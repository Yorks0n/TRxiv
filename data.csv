However recent findings indicate that approaches to identify enhancers may not capture the full repertoire of active enhancers in mammalian genomes. Here, we combine massively parallel enhancer assays with chromatin structure and transcriptome profiling to functionally annotate enhancers genome-wide in human induced pluripotent stem cells. We find that a substantial fraction (~40%) of accessible chromatin regions with enhancer function lack key features associated with active enhancers, including the active enhancer mark histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation and enhancer-associated RNAs. Perturbation of this class of non-canonical enhancers by CRISPR-mediated epigenome editing results in decreased levels of target gene expression and, in one instance, loss of pluripotent stem cell characteristics. Collectively, our data demonstrate enhancer activity for a class of gene regulatory elements that had until now only been associated with a neutral or inactive status, challenging current models of enhancer function.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

There was a broad increase in secreted proteins, while intracellular proteins, e.g. from skeletal muscle, particularly showed reduction. Immune cell-specific signatures indicated immune reprogramming, including a distinct reduction in neutrophil-associated proteins. Focused secretome analysis supported intensified regulatory interactions related to immune activity, inflammation, vasculature, and metabolism.

Along with laboratory characterisation and electron microscopy, we generated a complete Noodlococcus genome sequence using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore data. The genome consisted of a single, circular, 2,732,108 bp chromosome that shared 97.5% Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) with the Kocuria rhizophila type strain TA68. We identified genomic features involved in replication (oriC), carotenoid synthesis (crt), and genome defence (CRISPR-Cas), and discovered four novel mobile elements (ISKrh4-7). Despite its environmental ubiquity and relevance to food production, bioremediation, and human medicine, there have been few genomic studies of the Kocuria genus. We conducted a comparative, phylogenetic, and pangenomic examination of all 257 publicly available Kocuria genomes, with a particular focus on the 56 that were identified as K. rhizophila. We found that there are two phylogenetically distinct clades of K. rhizophila, with within-clade ANI values of 96.7-100.0% and between-clade values of 89.5-90.4%. The second clade, which we refer to as K. pseudorhizophila, exhibited ANI values of <95% relative to TA68 and constitutes a separate species. Delineation of the two clades would be consistent with the rest of the genus, where all other species satisfy the 95% ANI threshold criteria. Differences in the K. rhizophila and K. pseudorhizophila pangenomes likely reflect phenotypic as well as evolutionary divergence. This distinction is relevant to clinical and industrial settings, as strains and genomes from both clades are currently used interchangeably, which may lead to reproducibility issues and phenotype-genotype discordance. Investigating an innocuous laboratory contaminant has therefore provided useful insights into the understudied species K. rhizophila, prompting an unexpected reassessment of its taxonomy.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

Receptor switches are key to the integration of environmental signals, yet it is not well understood how their signal processing is genetically encoded. Here, to address these questions, we present a complete map of how mutations quantitatively alter the input-output function of a receptor. Using a massively parallel approach, GluePCA, we quantify more than 40,000 binding measurements and 3,500 dose-response curves for variants of the allosteric phytohormone receptor PYL1. Strikingly, >91% of missense variants tune the dose-response of the receptor. Many variants drive changes in sensitivity, basal activity, maximum response and induction steepness in a correlated manner, suggesting a shared underlying biophysical mechanism, which we identify as stability changes. Beyond this, signalling parameters can be independently tuned by mutations, with surprisingly large effects in interface-distal positions and a modular genetic architecture across the receptors structure. A small subset of missense variants confers qualitative phenotypic innovation, producing hypersensitive and inverted response patterns. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of dose-response profile quantification at massive scale and reveal the remarkable evolutionary malleability of an allosteric switch.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

Average reported losses since the preceding spring exceeded 60%, with substantial variation among operations. Many colonies were still actively collapsing in January, 2025, when pooled and individual samples were collected then screened for levels of known honey bee pathogens and parasites. Deformed wing virus strains A and B, along with Acute bee paralysis virus, were found at unusually high levels, either in pooled colony samples or in individual bees exhibiting shaking behaviors and morbidity. Differences between these two analyses suggest that direct collections of morbid bees provide a superior diagnostic for causal viruses, a suggestion borne out by confirmation of symptoms and morbidity following isolation and new inoculations. Since these viruses are known to be vectored by parasitic Varroa mites, mites from collapsed colonies were in turn screened for resistance to amitraz, a critical miticide used widely by beekeepers. Miticide resistance was found in all collected Varroa, underscoring the urgent need for new control strategies for this parasite. While viruses are a likely end-stage cause of colony death, other stressors such as nutritional stress and agrochemicals may have also played significant roles.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

While the majority of paralogous TFs are dispersed across different chromosomes, some remain clustered raising the question of whether genomic proximity confers any evolutionary advantage for TF clusters. To address this, we investigated a ~1 Mbp locus containing two ETS family paralogs, Ets1 and Fli1. Using a sub-diffraction sequential imaging technique called Optical Reconstruction of Chromatin Architecture (ORCA), we traced the 3D organization of this region in single alleles of T cells from genetically engineered mice with targeted deletions of key regulatory elements. In wild-type T cells, the predominant chromatin conformation spatially links Ets1 to its proximal super-enhancer, segregating Ets1 from Fli1. This topology correlates with high Ets1 and low Fli1 expression. Deletion of the Ets1 super-enhancer abolishes this configuration, triggering locus-wide architectural rewiring that increases Ets1-Fli1 promoter-promoter interactions and subsequently the co-expression of two genes within individual cells. Remarkably, this compensatory interaction bypasses insulated chromatin domains, sustaining Ets1 levels necessary for T cell development despite enhancer loss. Our results reveal that genomic clustering of TF paralogs enables dynamic architectural plasticity: while a super-enhancer fine-tunes paralog expression balance in wild-type contexts, its deletion unmasks latent promoter-driven coordination, suggesting that proximity safeguards functional redundancy and transcriptional resilience critical for cellular fitness.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

However, current mutational signatures do not distinguish the two independent steps that generate SBSs: the initial DNA damage followed by erroneous repair. To address this modelling gap we developed DAMUTA, a hierarchical Bayesian probabilistic model that infers separate signatures for each process, and captures their sample-specific interaction. We applied DAMUTA to 18,974 pan-cancer whole genome sequencing mutation catalogues from 23 cancer types and show that tissue-specificity in mutation patterns is driven largely by variability in damage processes. We also show that misrepair processes are predictive of DNA damage response deficiencies, and unlike existing approaches, DAMUTA distinguishes damage from misrepair contributions, and we demonstrate significant improvements over a mutational-burden baseline or signatures from the COSMIC database. Our analysis reveals a shared pan-cancer pattern of early clonal transition-mutations which shifts to a more uniform substitution pattern consistent with increased reliance on translesion synthesis for damage tolerance. DAMUTA thus generates a compact set of signatures which resolves redundancies of current signature models, disentangles the effects of DNA damage and misrepair processes, and facilitates improved stratification of tumours, while providing a framework towards a unified pan-cancer model of the cellular response to DNA damage.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

Much effort has been devoted to understanding TF activity in different tissues and how tissue-specificity is achieved. However, ultimately gene regulation occurs at the single cell level and the recent explosion in the availability of single cell gene expression data now makes it possible to understand TF activity at this granular level of resolution.

Here, we leverage a large collection of Human Cell Atlas (HCA) single cell data to explore TF activity by examining cell-type and tissue-specific sets of target genes, or regulons. We compile a regulon atlas, CellRegulon, and map the activity of TFs in an extensive set of healthy adult and foetal tissues spanning hundreds of cell types. Using CellRegulon, we describe dynamic patterns of co-regulation, associate TF-modules with different cellular functions and characterise the distribution of active TFs and TF families across cell types. We show that CellRegulon can link disease gene expression signatures to cell types and TFs relevant to the disease. Finally, using a newly generated multiome dataset of the adult lung, we show how CellRegulon can be extended into an enhancer-gene regulatory network (eGRN) to improve cell-type associations with genetic risk loci for diseases, such as childhood onset asthma, COPD and IPF, and to identify high risk gene modules. Our database for easy download and interactive exploration allows researchers to understand key gene modules activated at cell type transitions and will therefore be valuable for tasks such as cell type engineering (https://www.cellregulondb.org).","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

One of the major challenges to understanding the role of condensates is the lack of technologies to map condensate-scale protein architecture at subcompartmental or nanoscale resolution. To address this, we introduce HCR-Proxy, a proximity labelling technique that couples Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR)-based signal amplification with in situ proximity biotinylation (Proxy), enabling proteomic profiling of RNA-proximal proteomes at subcompartmental resolution. We benchmarked HCR-Proxy using nascent pre-rRNA targets to investigate the distinct proteomic signatures of the nucleolar subcompartments and to uncover a spatial logic of protein partitioning shaped by RNA sequence. Our results demonstrate HCR-Proxys ability to provide spatially-resolved maps of RNA interactomes within the nucleolus, offering new insights into the molecular organisation and compartmentalisation of condensates. This subcompartment-specific nucleolar proteome profiling enabled integration with deep learning frameworks, which effectively confirmed a sequence-encoded basis for protein partitioning across nested condensate subcompartments, characterised by antagonistic gradients in charge, length, and RNA-binding domains. HCR-Proxy thus provides a scalable platform for spatially resolved RNA interactome discovery, bridging transcript localisation with proteomic context in native cellular environments.

Schizophrenia has been associated with impaired nervous system development and an excitation/inhibition imbalance in the prefrontal cortex. On a molecular level, schizophrenia is moderately heritable and genetically complex. Hundreds of risk genes have been identified, spanning a heterogeneous landscape dominated by loci that confer relatively small risk. Bioinformatic analyses of genetic associations point to a limited set of neurons, mainly excitatory cortical neurons, but other analyses suggest the importance of astrocytes and microglia. To understand different cell type roles in schizophrenia and reveal novel cell-type specific aetiologically relevant perturbations in schizophrenia, our study integrated genetic analysis with single nucleus RNA-seq of 536,618 nuclei from postmortem samples of dorsal prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 8/9) of 43 cases with schizophrenia and 42 neurotypical controls. We found no significant difference in cell type abundance. Gene expression in excitatory layer 2-3 intra-telencephalic neurons had the greatest number of differentially expressed transcripts and, together with excitatory deep layer intra-telencephalic neurons, conferred most of the genetic risk for schizophrenia. Most differential expression of genes was found in specific cell types and was dominated by down-regulated transcripts. Down-regulated transcripts were enriched in gene sets including transmembrane transport, mitochondrial function, protein folding, and cell-cell signaling whereas up-regulated transcripts were enriched in gene sets related to RNA processing, including RNA splicing in neurons. Co-regulation network analysis identified 40 schizophrenia-relevant programs across 13 cell types. A gene program largely shared between neuronal subtypes, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes was significantly enriched for schizophrenia risk, supporting an aetiological role for perturbed protein modification, ion transport, and mitochondrial function. These results were largely consistent with cell-type expression quantitative trait locus and transcriptome-wide association analyses. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing results, most prominently mitochondrial dysfunction, had multiple points of convergence with proteomic and long-read RNA sequencing results from samples from the same donors. Our study integrates genetic analysis with transcriptomics to reveal novel cell-type specific aetiologically relevant perturbations in schizophrenia.","NA","medrxiv",1748988582949

Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) already supplies nitrogen to legume crops and several avenues of research are underway to extend it to non-legume crops. In maize (Zea mays), aerial roots have been shown to contribute to BNF in some varieties, and both having many aerial roots and large aerial roots contributes to the fixation trait. However, much of the genetics controlling aerial root number and size is still unknown. Here we validate and quantify BNF in maize varieties from Southern Mexico under controlled conditions and evaluate a population of double haploids derived from the elite inbred PHZ51 crossed with these varieties. We find that most aerial root traits (root number, nodes with roots, root size) are reasonably heritable (h2 0.5-0.75) and generally uncorrelated with each other. QTL mapping identifies 5 QTL each affecting nodes with aerial roots and aerial root number per node; in both cases all but 1 QTL show an increase from the landrace allele. We also identify 11 QTL for aerial root diameter, with most positive QTL coming from PHZ51. Between the two populations, only a few QTL overlap, indicating a presumably high diversity of genes affecting aerial root morphology in landrace populations. Combining the best QTL into elite material may provide a path toward meaningful levels of BNF for maize, and additional work is needed to determine how viable this approach will be in field settings.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

We hypothesize that semantic memories are altered in a similar way when retrieval draws on a core dimension of conceptual knowledge: semantic granularity. Each level, from accessing a concept via unique perceptual features to its thematic context, shapes the retrieval route used to access semantic memories. This study tests whether semantic granularities used to retrieve a concept influences its reactivation during later recognition. Human participants learned and retrieved novel word-image pairs while undergoing fMRI. Following encoding, items were retrieved via one of three semantic levels: item, category, or theme. Later, participants accessed the memories in recognition and cued recall tests. Although behavioral memory performance was matched across conditions, neural activity during recognition varied based on prior retrieval history. Recognition patterns could be classified according to prior retrieval granularity in ventral temporal cortex for both remembered and non-remembered concepts, and in the hippocampus for remembered concepts only. A whole-brain searchlight analysis revealed bilateral clusters along the ventral visual stream, from early visual cortex to fusiform gyrus, where retrieval history was decodable. Representational similarity analyses showed that category-level retrieval increased pattern consistency in early visual cortex and pattern reactivation in ventral temporal cortex, while item-level retrieval enhanced memory trace distinctiveness in visual word form area. Theme-level retrieval increased activity in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings show that how we access a concept leaves a detectable trace on subsequent neural reactivation, subtly shaping how conceptual knowledge is organized in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

Hypothesizing that such differences in signaling efficacy may be captured structurally in intermediate states under non-equilibrium conditions, we implemented a time-resolved (TR) cryo-EM approach to visualize the GTP-induced activation of the Gi{beta}{gamma} heterotrimer by the -opioid receptor (MOR) bound to three ligands displaying partial, full, or super-agonism on the receptor. We resolved ensembles of conformational states along the G-protein activation pathway, including a previously unobserved intermediate state that enabled us to visualize receptor dynamics as a function of bound ligand. The results demonstrate ligand-dependent differences in state occupancy and conformational stability, with higher ligand efficacy correlating with increased dynamics of the receptors transmembrane (TM) helices 5 and 6. Furthermore, we identify key mechanistic differences in the GTP-induced activation of Gi compared to Gs that likely underlie their distinct activation kinetics. Corroborated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, these findings provide a dynamic structural landscape of GPCR-G-protein interactions for ligands of different efficacy and suggest partial agonists may produce a  kinetic trap during G-protein activation.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

We used mouse mating behavior to model how the brain orchestrates slow-timescale changes in motivation. Male mice become sexually satiated after successful matings, and their motivation to mate gradually recovers over a week. Using deep-brain fluorescence-lifetime imaging in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), we found that tonic dopamine transmission - which regulates mating drive - also declined after mating and re-emerged over a week. Two mechanisms regulated dopamine transmission. First, successful mating transiently reduced tonic firing of hypothalamic dopamine-releasing neurons, thereby inhibiting dopamine release and mating behavior. Second, mating reduced the ability of these neurons to produce and release dopamine, and this ability gradually returned over the week-long recovery time course. Therefore, fast and slow mechanisms of neuronal plasticity cooperate to control the early and late phases of motivational dynamics, respectively.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

While its prognostic significance remains debated, we demonstrate that HDAC6 loss significantly impairs myeloid leukemia progression in vivo, despite having no functional impact on leukemia cell proliferation in vitro. Global proteome and secretome profiling of HDAC6-knockout (KO) cells revealed upregulation of several immune-related modulators, including RNase T2, a tumor suppressor known to modulate the tumor microenvironment. Notably, RNase T2 upregulation upon HDAC6 loss was restricted to myeloid but not B-ALL cells. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 recapitulated this phenotype, leading to RNase T2 upregulation in myeloid leukemia cells. ATAC-seq revealed increased chromatin accessibility of RNase T2 following HDAC6 loss, highlighting a functionally epigenetic regulatory contribution. Further functional assays conducted in an immunocompetent setting both ex vivo and in vivo demonstrated that HDAC6 inhibition sensitized murine AML cells to broad CD8+ T cell activation as evidenced by increased TNF and CD107a expression. Consistently, in a syngeneic AML model, HDAC6 inhibition restricted AML cell growth. Moreover, an extended drug screening analysis identified Cytarabine and Clofarabine as significantly synergizing with HDAC6 inhibitor (Ricolinostat) in AML cell lines or pediatric patient derived xenograft (PDX)-AML cells, while showing limited synergy in ALL cell lines, PDX-ALL cells or healthy controls. These findings suggest that HDAC6 represents a promising therapeutic target in pediatric AML by simultaneously enhancing immune activation and increasing chemosensitivity.

However, investigating these slower aspects requires methodological innovation beyond standard EEG approaches. Using a minimalist virtual environment paradigm, we found that infra-slow EEG oscillations (ISOs) in the 0.016-0.2 Hz frequency range tracked meaningful contextual transitions during social interaction. Furthermore, participants who successfully engaged in a perceptual crossing task exhibited increased alignment in the spectral power of ISOs when measured in the temporal vicinity of the task response (before-after button press), compared to those who failed. This task-locked alignment was accompanied by similar dynamics in respiratory pressure and electrodermal activity, suggesting that ISOs reflect the integration of physiological, cognitive, and social processes, with their alignment facilitating shared understanding and joint action. These findings highlight the role of ISOs in mediating the temporal dynamics of social cognition and show that inter-participant alignment in ISOs can serve as a proxy for the complex interplay between body physiology, cognition, and social behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs), the development of place selectivity, manifested as place fields, is believed to result from dendritic integration of spatially distributed inputs combined with behavioral time scale plasticity (BTSP). BTSP involves dendritic spikes that temporally regulate synaptic potentiation and depotentiation. However, the role of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) synaptic distributions in the emergence of place specificity in CA1 PNs remains unclear, due to the lack of detailed synaptic reconstructions in vivo. Here, we present full synaptic reconstructions from individual CA1 PNs in the mouse hippocampus, revealing that these neurons receive approximately 10,000-15,000 E synapses and 900-1,400 I synapses. Computational modeling of biologically relevant E and I synaptic distributions shows that spatial tuning is preserved with co-tuned, spatially clustered E synapses, but disrupted when E distributions are randomized. Moreover, synapse clustering has a different contribution to spatial tuning in apical vs. basal domains. Our results reveal a complex and finely-tuned interplay between presynaptic input patterns and the spatial organization of their postsynaptic targets in dictating neuronal output in CA1 PNs.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

Here, we bridge this gap by reconstructing wing sensory axons from the Female Adult Nerve Cord (FANC) EM dataset and mapping them to peripheral sensory structures using genetic tools and light microscopy. We confirm the location and identity of known wing mechanosensory neurons and identify previously uncharacterized axons, including a novel population of putative proprioceptors that make monosynaptic connections onto wing steering motor neurons. We also find that proprioceptors of adjacent campaniform sensilla on the wing have distinct axon morphologies and postsynaptic partners, suggesting a high degree of specialization in axon pathfinding and synaptic partner matching. The peripheral location and central projections of wing sensory neurons are stereotyped across flies, allowing this wing proprioceptor atlas and genetic toolkit to guide analysis of other fly connectome datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

Here, we show that the histone variant H2A.Z is a novel sex-specific regulator of AD in human patients and AD model mice. Specifically, H2A.Z binding in chromatin declines in female and increases in male AD patients, indicating opposite patterns of AD-related H2A.Z dysregulation each sex. These sex differences were recapitulated in the 5xFAD model of AD, in which females accumulated H2A.Z at early disease stages and lost H2A.Z as the disease progressed, suggesting that H2A.Z occupancy shifts with advancing disease. Males showed no change in H2A.Z binding in early disease, but exhibited increased binding as disease progressed, albeit to a lesser extent than females. Consistent with sex-specific H2A.Z dysregulation, H2A.Z depletion produced sex-specific changes in gene expression, whereby H2A.Z was more repressive in female than in male mice and in 5xFAD than in WT males, suggesting that H2A.Zs role in transcription varies with sex and disease. Moreover, H2A.Z depletion improved memory and AD pathology in females, while impairing memory and worsening pathology in male mice. Together, these data suggest that H2A.Z is protective in males and detrimental in females with AD, with key implications for sex-specific therapeutic targeting of chromatin factors.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

A serious concern in HLA peptide analysis is that the routinely used, collision-based fragmentation methods (CID/HCD) do not always render sufficiently informative MS2 spectra, whereby gaps in the fragmentation sequence coverage prevent unambiguous assignments. EThcD can be utilized to generate complementary ion series, i.e. b/y ions and c/z ions, resulting in richer, more informative MS2 spectra, thereby filling in the gaps. Here, we present data generated on a novel hybrid Orbitrap mass spectrometer, facilitating fast and efficient hybrid fragmentation due to the implementation of EThcD in the ion routing multipole. We hypothesized that this would enable more comprehensive and less error-prone analysis of immunopeptidomes at minimal costs in duty-cycle. First, we optimized ETD/EThcD methods using an elastase-digested cell lysate, as this contains peptides of similar length and charge distributions to immunopeptides. Next, we compared HCD and EThcD on immunopeptidomes originating from three cell lines with distinct HLA-I complexes that present peptides with varying physicochemical properties. We demonstrate that the new instrument not only enables efficient and fast ETD reactions, but when combined with collision-based supplemental activation, i.e. EThcD, also consistently increases the sequence coverage and identification of peptide sequences, otherwise missed by using solely HCD. We reveal several of the biochemical properties that make HLA peptides preferably identifiable by EThcD, with internal Arg residues being one of the most dominant determinants. Finally, we demonstrate the power of EThcD for the identification and localization of HLA peptides harboring post-translational modifications, focusing here on HLA Arg mono-/di-methylation. We foresee that this new instrument with efficient EThcD capabilities enhances not only immunopeptidomics analysis, but also analysis of peptides harboring post-translational modifications and de novo sequencing.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

The host-bacteria induced proinflammatory cytokines in epithelial cells, while Saccharibacteria were immune silent. Remarkably, Saccharibacteria dampened cytokine responses to host-bacteria during coinfection. This effect was driven by Saccharibacteria-induced clustering of TLR2 receptors, a process likely facilitated by type IV pili, ultimately leading to reduced TLR2-mediated cytokine signalling. High resolution imaging showed that Saccharibacteria were endocytosed by oral epithelial cells, and colocalized with endosome markers, eventually trafficking to lysosomes.

Here, we introduce the third version of the KODAMA algorithm, specifically tailored for spatial transcriptomics analysis. This upgraded version incorporates a novel approach that effectively reduces data dimensionality while preserving spatial information. At its core, the KODAMA algorithm employs parallel iterations that enforce spatial constraints throughout an embedded clustering process. Our method provides the flexibility to simultaneously analyze multiple samples, streamlining analysis workflows. Additionally, it extends beyond traditional 2D analysis to accommodate multidimensional datasets, including 3D spatial information. KODAMA seamlessly integrates into various pipelines, such as Seurat and Giotto. Extensive evaluations of KODAMA on 10x Visium, Visium HD, and image-based 3D datasets demonstrate its high accuracy in spatial domain prediction. Comparative analyses against alternative dimensionality reduction techniques and spatial analysis tools consistently validate and highlight KODAMA's superior performance in unraveling the spatial organization of cellular components across both single and integrated tissue samples.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

However, the associated molecular changes across endocrine and non-endocrine compartments remain largely unexplored. Here, using longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) on islets from C57BL/6 mice subjected to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding for 8, 16, and 24 weeks, along with age-matched controls on regular chow, we mapped dynamic changes in islet cell composition and transcriptional states. Beta cells demonstrated pronounced stress-induced reprogramming, with the emergence of proliferative and dysfunctional subsets. Alpha and delta cell fractions declined under HFD, despite increased polyhormonal biosynthesis, suggesting functional rather than numerical adaptation. Immune profiling showed robust expansion of proinflammatory M1 macrophages and upregulation of NF-{kappa}B and chemotaxis pathways, particularly at 16 weeks. Notably, cell-cell communication analyses revealed diet-specific disruption in signaling networks. Under HFD conditions, intercellular communication among beta cells, macrophages, and delta cells was markedly altered, leading to the disruption of key signaling pathways such as the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR) and major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I). Notably, C-C motif chemokine ligand 27A (Ccl27a) expression and chromatin accessibility were significantly altered in a distinct subpopulation of beta cells under HFD condition, indicative of a niche-specific regulatory mechanism. Integration with human islet datasets from obese and type 2 diabetes (T2D) donors confirmed conserved shifts in beta cell identity and immune activation. This study presents a comprehensive high-resolution atlas of islet remodeling under metabolic stress, identifying key communication nodes and transcriptional programs pertinent to T2D pathogenesis.

It is unclear how hallucinatory proneness changes across the lifespan, with prior questionnaire-based studies showing mixed results. As factors such as multi-sensory acuity loss and relatively increased reliance on prior knowledge may increase as we age, and these are considered risk factors for hallucination proneness, we hypothesised that reported decreases in hallucinations might reflect stigma-related underreporting. We therefore sought to measure hallucination proneness in 44 healthy adults spanning the adult lifespan (younger age group; n=22; age 19-39 years, mean: 27.2, SD: 5.5; older age group n=22; age 59-79 years, mean: 68.0, SD: 5.8), quantifying the tendency to experience complex and simple hallucinations in an experimental environment designed to elicit hallucinations. We find that reports of complex hallucinations (those representing objects, scenes, etc) are lower in older adults than in younger adults, both in real time and retrospectively. None of our measured cognitive or sensory measures (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, perceptual reorganisation, imagery vividness, memory inhibition, and suggestibility) mediate this relationship. We conclude that reduced complex hallucination proneness appears normative in ageing, and that experiencing hallucinations in older individuals may signal underlying pathology.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

EnrichMap generates enrichment scores for signatures or pathways, with an optional framework for incorporating gene weights. To assess performance, we benchmark EnrichMap against established scoring techniques using spatial autocorrelation metrics such as Morans I. Our results show that EnrichMap improves spatial coherence, producing scores that capture both local and global spatial patterns, while conventional approaches tend to exhibit higher heterogeneity or diminished spatial structure. EnrichMap is demonstrated to be generalisable across a variety of ST platforms, including Visium, Xenium, MERFISH and imaging mass cytometry, maintaining consistent performance despite differences in spatial resolution and detection chemistry.

In angiosperms, a double fertilization process results in the formation of a diploid embryo and a triploid endosperm, both of which develop within maternal sporophytic integuments. Thus, the seed of angiosperms is a combined structure of three genetically distinct components: embryo, endosperm, and maternal integuments. It has long been assumed that the maternal plant influences embryo development, but there is limited molecular evidence for a direct pathway through which the maternal sporophyte affects embryogenesis. Here we show that secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated upon exosome impairment lead to embryo abortion through a maternal sporophytic effect. Depletion of the core subunit of the RNA-processing exosome RRP45B (CER7) causes globular embryo arrest connected to ectopic post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Seed coat expression of CER7 suppresses seed abortion, demonstrating a maternal sporophytic control of embryo development through an RNA decay safeguard pathway. Our data support a model in which a primary siRNA trigger originates in the maternal integuments of the cer7 seed coat and drives PTGS amplification in reproductive tissues after fertilization, ultimately leading to seed abortion. In addition, our genetic and molecular data suggest that overloading of AGO1 with siRNAs impairs miRNA function, likely leading to embryo arrest. Our data highlight the complex interplay between maternal and embryonic gene regulation, reinforcing the importance of controlled RNA decay in plant development.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

With the growing prevalence of machine learning, calculating similarities for sequences of continuous representations, e.g. frequency-based position-weight matrices (PWMs), attribution-based contribution-weight matrices, and even learned embeddings, is taking on newfound importance. Tomtom has previously been proposed as an algorithm for identifying pairs of PWMs whose similarity is statistically significant, but the implementation remains inefficient for both real-time and large-scale analysis. Accordingly, we have re-implemented Tomtom as a numba-accelerated Python function that is natively multi-threaded, avoids cache misses, more efficiently caches intermediate values, and uses approximations at compute bottlenecks. Here, we provide a detailed description of the original Tomtom method (see Supplementary Note 1) and present results demonstrating that our re-implementation can achieve over a thousand-fold speedup compared with the original tool on reasonable tasks (see Supplementary Note 2).

A standard common pathway model, in which a genetic association is estimated between an external GWAS phenotype and a common factor, assumes that all genetic associations between the external GWAS phenotype and the individual indicator phenotypes are mediated through the factor. This assumption can be tested using the QTrait statistic, which compares the common pathway model to an independent pathways model that allows for direct genetic associations between the external GWAS phenotype and the individual indicators of the factor. We expand upon the QTrait approach by describing an effect size index that quantifies the degree to which the common pathways model is violated, and we provide a systematic approach for empirically identifying specific direct pathways between an external trait and indicator traits. Our method comprises a series of omnibus tests and outlier detection algorithms indexing the heterogeneity of associations between the genetic component of external traits and the individual indicators of common factors.

In the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, the rhythm generated by a molecular pacemaker is converted into a global transcriptional oscillation by the central regulator RpaA. Mutants in RpaA and other components have been instrumental in elucidating the clocks molecular architecture and physiological role. Extensive evidence suggests that one of the central functions of circadian regulation is to prevent the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during nighttime. However, circadian mutants are unable to grow under natural day/night cycles and require constant illumination, hindering our ability to study the clock function during the night, a phase where circadian regulation is critical for redox homeostasis. Here, we show that the darkness lethality phenotype of circadian mutants can be overcome by high CO2 levels. When grown under a 3% CO2 atmosphere, RpaA-null mutants exhibited growth rates similar to the wt. An analysis of the ROS levels under different CO2 and light intensity conditions revealed carbon scarcity to be the most significant contributor to redox stress. Nighttime ROS accumulation can be modulated by CO2 abundance, an observation that will allow the characterization of heretofore lethal mutants in circadian regulation. The dispensability of the circadian clock in a high CO2 environment suggests that the clock may have evolved as an adaptation to the decrease in atmospheric CO2 levels that occurred after the Great Oxygenation Events, in the Paleoproterozoic era.

IMPORTANCECyanobacterial circadian clocks are considered essential for survival under natural day/night conditions, and many circadian mutants are lethal under diel cycles. Results presented here challenge this assumption, showing that these mutants grow normally when CO2 is abundant. This suggests that the major adaptive role of the clock is to manage the redox stress caused by carbon limitation. By separating the effects of carbon availability from circadian control, we identify a key environmental factor that shaped the evolution of biological timekeeping. Using high CO2 to bypass clock dependency will allow the study of circadian function in otherwise lethal mutants. These findings reframe the clock as a specific adaptation to atmospheric carbon, stressing its key role in the regulation of the redox balance.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

Using a multilayer source reconstruction approach, we systematically assess the limits of hpMEGs depth resolution, and show that laminar precision is achievable under optimal signal-to-noise ratios and co-registration accuracy. Our simulations reveal that accurate source reconstruction depends critically on aligning dipole orientations with the underlying cortical columnar structure, and that regional variations in cortical anatomy influence reconstruction fidelity.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

As a further step, motivated by the complexity generated by these dissociation techniques, we developed a single Prosit deep learning model for fragment ion intensity prediction covering all of these techniques. The generated model has been made publicly available and has been utilised in FragPipe within its MSBooster module. Rescoring allowed both data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) to achieve on average more than 10% increase in protein identifications across all dissociation techniques and enzymatic digestions. We demonstrate that these alternative fragmentation approaches can now be used within standard data analysis pipelines and can produce data competitive to CID in terms of efficiency, but in the cases of EID and UVPD with far richer and more comprehensive spectra.","NA","biorxiv",1748988582949

We aimed to compare Germany-wide characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized adults with diabetes in diabetes certified vs. non-diabetes certified hospitals.

MethodsWe analyzed in the German Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) statistics for 2021-2023 all inpatient cases aged [&ge;] 20 years with and without diabetes (all types) as a main or secondary diagnosis based on ICD-10 codes. Using Wilcoxon and Chi2-tests, characteristics of inpatient cases with diabetes were compared between diabetes certified hospitals (n=300) and non-diabetes certified hospitals (n=1,103).

ResultsOf 43.4 million total inpatient cases in the period from 2021 to 2023, 8.1 million (18.5%) had a documented diabetes diagnosis (94% of the cases as secondary diagnosis). In certified hospitals, 19.0% of inpatient cases had diabetes compared to 18.3% in non-certified hospitals. Although inpatient cases with diabetes had more hospital-acquired and procedure-related complications (17.2% vs. 16.7%, p<0.001), as well as higher rates of hypoglycemia (3.2% vs. 2.1%, p<0.001) and metabolic disorder (diabetic ketoacidosis: 0,5% vs. 0,4%; acute metabolic disorder with multiple complications: 2.3% vs. 1.0%, p<0.001) in certified hospitals vs. non-certified hospitals, in-hospital mortality for all diabetes cases was similar (4.5% in both). However, among those with diabetes as the main diagnosis, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in diabetes certified hospitals (type 1 diabetes: 0.6% vs. 1.1% and type 2 diabetes: 2.3% vs. 2.9%, both p<0.001), despite a higher complication burden.

ConclusionsHospitalized people with diabetes as the main diagnosis had lower in-hospital mortality in diabetes-certified hospitals, even though they had a higher disease burden. These findings suggest that expanded use of DDG-certified departments, including consultation services for patients whose diabetes is a secondary diagnosis, may further improve clinical outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1748988582949

DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]). Negative control outcomes did not show any indication of meaningful unobserved residual confounding.

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

However, these proposed rearrangements have not yet been confirmed. Here, we have identified at least five distinct conformational states of Na+-NQR using: mutants that lack specific cofactors, specific inhibitors or low-sodium conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations based on these structural insights indicate that 2Fe-2S reduction in NqrD/E plays a crucial role in triggering Na+ translocation by driving structural rearrangements in the NqrD/E subunits, which subsequently influence NqrC and NqrF positioning.

We demonstrate the real world implications of the use of testing and evaluate adverse events and outcomes in individuals who did not receive pharmacogenomic testing for clopidogrel.

MethodsWe analyzed ~100K individuals with paired EHR and exome sequencing data from population health studies administered at multiple medical centers using the Helix Exome+(R) assay. We inferred clopidogrel dosage by processing the prescription with an LLM. We identified all instances of individuals with at least one prescription that is not in concordance with their CYP2C19 genotype. Lastly, we identify instances of thrombosis using a comprehensive codeset based on ICD9, ICD10, and SNOMED terms.

ResultsWe identified 16,140 prescriptions of clopidogrel given to 3,853 participants. We found that 29% of these individuals have a mismatch between the recommended clopidogrel dosage guideline based on their CYP2C19 genotype and their actual prescribed daily dosage. 25% of poor metabolizers experienced thrombosis, with 40% occurring within 2 months of treatment. Poor and intermediate metabolizers receiving clopidogrel are much more likely to experience thrombosis and myocardial infarction (binomial p-value = 0.001).

ConclusionsWe estimate a 38% excess of adverse events occur in poor and intermediate metabolizers relative to normal and rapid metabolizers. The lack of testing may be responsible for 1 thrombosis event per every ~30 people prescribed clopidogrel.","NA","medrxiv",1748988582949

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1748988582949

In this study, we performed comprehensive cellular and transcriptional immunometabolic profiling within a cohort that included SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (NC, N=30) and individuals with prior COVID-19 ([~]4-months) who fully recovered (RC, N=38) or went on to experience Long COVID symptoms (N=58). Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing.

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
