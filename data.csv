Understanding how the Healthy Eating Index-2020 (HEI-2020) can be used as a measure of diet quality to create benchmarks for national nutrition monitoring can assist in surveillance and improve the design of nutrition programs and policies.

ObjectiveTo examine the utility of the HEI-2020 to create benchmarks for national diet quality monitoring.

MethodsThis serial cross-sectional study used data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Nationally representative data for 22,168 US adults ([&ge;]20 years) who completed two 24-hour recalls were analyzed. We derived HEI-2020 scores (0-100) from participants two 24-hour dietary recalls. Diet quality categories were established: high diet quality (>70-100), marginal (>60-70), low (>50-60), and very low (0-50).

ResultsOnly 13% of US adults had high diet quality while nearly two-thirds had low or very low diet quality. Diet quality was higher for older adults, female, ""Other"" race or ethnicity, born outside of the US, have higher education attainment, higher income, and food security. Compared to adults with high diet quality, adults with very low diet quality had lower intakes of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and seafood and the highest intakes of ultra-processed foods, refined grains, and red and processed meats (all P-trends <0.01). Adults with very low diet quality were more likely to have elevated adiposity, lower HDL cholesterol, and higher triglycerides, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c (all P-trends [&le;]0.01).

ConclusionsThe HEI-2020 is a robust measure of diet quality that can be directly linked to biological measures associated with chronic disease risk. Using evidence-based HEI categories could allow policymakers, public health practitioners, and nutrition professionals to set benchmarks and nationwide targets for achieving improved diet quality.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

During the tumult of war they are, however, challenging to obtain due to the conflicts themselves. The Gaza Ministry of Health (GMoH) has provided regular updates to their post-October-7 violent death tally for the Gaza Strip. However, GMoH reports have attracted both criticism and support. Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures. Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods. We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

Recently, a novel approach for the fast and efficient differentiation of ovarian support cells (OSCs) to generate a versatile platform for basic research and clinical applications was demonstrated. This study details the clinical process development and application of an OSC product, known as Fertilo, to improve the in vitro maturation (IVM) of human oocytes, a method referred to as OSC-IVM. First, transcription factor (TF) mediated OSC differentiation using research-grade raw materials was shown to produce granulosa-like cells that improve the MII maturation rate of human oocytes. To support clinical application, several raw material upgrades were initiated, including substitution of the differentiation matrix with a higher-quality alternative, laminin-521, and the generation of a clinically suitable hiPSC seed bank and master cell bank. Single cell RNA sequencing of OSCs generated using the updated protocol for clinical translation demonstrated the consistency and reproducibility of cellular outcomes. Next, analytical release testing of the clinical product was performed and a murine oocyte maturation assay was developed to establish the potency of OSCs for use in OSC-IVM. Finally, the qualified Fertilo product was applied in a two-phase longitudinal cohort analysis, with the results showing improvement in key outcomes compared to traditional IVM treatment. Our findings demonstrate the first-time clinical development and application of an hiPSC-derived product to improve reproductive outcomes after IVM and advance womens health.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

Rationally predicting individual-specific success or failure of probiotic and prebiotic interventions remains an outstanding challenge. In this study, we leverage microbial community-scale metabolic models (MCMMs) to predict probiotic engraftment and shifts in microbiota-mediated short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in response to a synbiotic intervention. Using data from a placebo-controlled synbiotic intervention trial, involving a cocktail of five probiotic strains and the prebiotic inulin, we validate model engraftment predictions with quantitative PCR (qPCR), demonstrating that MCMMs accurately predict probiotic engraftment outcomes in the treatment group with over 85% accuracy. Engraftment varied by species, with Akkermansia muciniphila and Bifidobacterium infantis displaying higher engraftment rates than Clostridium beijerinckii, Anaerobutyricum hallii, and Clostridium butyricum. Furthermore, MCMMs predicted significant increases in butyrate and propionate production following synbiotic treatment. MCMM-predicted changes in propionate production in the treatment group were negatively associated with changes in C-reactive protein (CRP), a blood marker of systemic inflammation, from baseline to 12 weeks after the synbiotic intervention. Finally, we explore MCMM-predicted responses to a wider range of synbiotic combinations in a larger observational cohort, suggesting that personalized prebiotic selection can augment probiotic efficacy. These findings highlight the potential of metabolic modeling to inform precision microbiome therapeutics.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

However, the insertion of these systems into enzymes is often performed with little consideration of the structural impact they might have. This is particularly relevant when modifying complex molecular machines that transition between numerous conformational states. Here, we address this issue by developing SIMPLIFE, a computational workflow that supports the design of optimal insertion sites for conjugation tags based on the structure of the proteins involved and performs localised residue redesign where needed. We demonstrate how SIMPLIFE can be used to effectively augment the function of T7 RNA polymerase using the DogCatcher-DogTag system, enabling diverse and dynamically varying mutations within a targeted region of DNA. This work demonstrates the power of combining biophysical and machine learning based approaches for protein structure prediction to efficiently augment the function of molecular machines, accelerating our ability to combine complex biochemical functionalities in new ways.","NA","biorxiv",1750889357127

However, this sex/gender gap has been narrowing in recent decades, likely due to an increase in cannabis use among women and girls, who have been historically under-represented in cannabis research. The lack of sex- and gender-based approaches within cannabis research has been highlighted in previous reviews, some of which have synthesized existing literature of associations between sex, gender, and cannabis use. What is missing is a clinically-relevant synthesis of evidence for sex and gender influences on problematic cannabis use, including treatment-related outcomes that could be used to influence care. The objective of this scoping review is to identify and synthesize published evidence about the influence of sex and gender on correlates and outcomes of treatment among people with problematic cannabis use (including CUD). Furthermore, we will examine to what extent this published literature has considered how sex and gender intersect with other social categories such as race and sexuality.

Methods and AnalysisThis scoping review will follow the most commonly used methodology, the 2005 Arksey and OMalley scoping study framework (including the optional consultation exercise to solicit feedback from relevant stakeholders) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews reporting guidelines. We will search MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for articles published between 2010 and the present. Included studies must be conducted in human participants with problematic cannabis use (e.g., diagnosis or screening for CUD) and include an analysis of sex- and/or gender-related factors. Using Covidence software, two independent reviewers will screen each record at the title/abstract and full text phases. Two independent reviewers will then use a data charting form developed by the study team to extract data. Data charting and both phases of article screening will begin with a pilot process completed by the entire team to ensure consistency. Article data will be exported into a spreadsheet to facilitate summary and basic descriptive statistics. Studies will be grouped together first by content area (e.g., treatment correlates, treatment effectiveness), then by study design, and which sex- or gender-related factors are considered in the analysis.

DisseminationWe will disseminate findings using two main strategies. First, we will engage in traditional knowledge translation, including publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentation at both medical and scientific conferences. Second, we will engage in knowledge translation strategies that will reach a wider audience (e.g., presentations to non-researcher audiences, dissemination of findings through social media networks, and development of brochures, infographics, and short videos to summarize our findings for a lay audience). We aim to ultimately engage relevant stakeholders (including clinicians) to determine how the identified evidence can best support care of problematic cannabis use.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

This fraction was enriched in lipid metabolic enzymes and proteins homologous to known membrane organization factors. Several candidates, including TVP38 FAMILY PROTEIN (TVPFP), PLASMA MEMBRANE FUSION PROTEIN (PMFP), and LETM1-LIKE, localized to discrete subdomains within chloroplasts. Loss- of-function tvpfp or pmfp mutants exhibited altered chloroplast ultrastructure, including changes in thylakoid-envelope proximity, supporting their roles in maintaining membrane architecture.

Yet, the molecular mechanisms through which juvenile environments shape adult physiology and behavior via transstadial effects remain largely unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that larval competition, a key ecological stressor, profoundly alters adult body size, survival, reproductive output, host-seeking behavior, olfactory neurophysiology, and vector competence in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Crucially, using transcriptomic profiling and integrative network analyses, we identify seven regulatory hub genes whose expression is strongly associated with size-dependent variation in olfactory behavior, reproductive investment, and Zika virus transmission potential. These hub genes belong to gene modules enriched for functions in chemosensory processing, metabolic regulation, and signal transduction, revealing a molecular framework mediating environmentally induced plasticity across metamorphosis. Integrating these empirical findings into a transmission model, we show that incomplete larval control can inadvertently increase outbreak risk by producing larger, longer-lived, and more competent vectors. Our results uncover molecular mechanisms underpinning phenotypic plasticity in disease vectors and highlight the critical need to account for transstadial effects in models of vector-borne disease transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1750889357127

We leveraged age- and sex-stratified tuberculosis incidence data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and applied risk ratios derived from a systematic literature review of tuberculosis risk during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

FindingsCompared to non-pregnant women without HIV, tuberculosis incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were 1.34 (95% CI:1.1-1.54) during pregnancy and 1.91 (1.53-2.39) during postpartum among HIV-negative women. For women living with HIV, IRRs were 5.73 (2.64-10.94) during pregnancy and 3.58 (0.85-9.63) postpartum. We estimated 239,300 pregnant women (95% UI:216,100-262,100) and 97,600 postpartum women (90,000-105,200) developed tuberculosis disease globally in 2023, with HIV contributing to 21% and 11% of cases respectively. The WHO Southeast Asian Region had the highest incidence (115,900 pregnant [97,300-134,500]; 51,800 postpartum [45,700-57,800] cases), followed closely by the African Region (115,500 pregnant [101,600-129,400]; 42,700 postpartum [38,100-47,200] cases).

InterpretationPregnant and postpartum women face substantial tuberculosis risk yet remain underrepresented in global estimates. Our findings underscore the need for improved surveillance and targeted interventions to reduce tuberculosis incidence in this group.

This hinders the development of novel precision medicine solutions and, more importantly, limits the translation of research findings to patient treatment. Here, we present DeepSpot, a deep-set neural network that leverages recent foundation models in pathology and spatial multi-level tissue context to effectively predict spatial transcriptomics from H&E images. DeepSpot substantially improved gene correlations across multiple datasets from patients with metastatic melanoma, kidney, lung, or colon cancers as compared to previous state-of-theart. Further, we validated our approach at the Autoimmune Disease Machine Learning Challenge 2025 organized by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and greatly outperformed other methods, securing first place. Using DeepSpot, we generated 3 780 TCGA spatial transcriptomics samples (56 million spots) of the melanoma, renal cell cancer, lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma cohorts. We anticipate this to be a valuable resource for biological discovery and a benchmark for evaluating spatial transcriptomics models. We hope that DeepSpot and this dataset will stimulate further advancements in computational spatial transcriptomics analysis.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

This study investigated IgG to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in Malawian pregnant women participating in the REVAMP trial, where no COVID-19 clinical cases or positive SARS-CoV-2 tests were reported during the pandemic (April 2020 to September 2021).

MethodsWe analysed serum samples collected from November 2018 to September 2021 from 852 pregnant women at enrolment (second trimester) and delivery, measuring IgG against five SARS-CoV-2 antigens using a multiplex bead assay. IgG to Tetanus toxoid served as a positive control, and IgG to four seasonal coronavirus antigens and Influenza A were used for context.

FindingsWomen recruited after the start of the pandemic were younger than those recruited before the emergence of COVID-19 (median age 19 vs 21 years) and more likely primigravid (60.1% vs 51.1%). IgG levels to SARS-CoV-2 antigens showed sharp increases of 18.5% - 29.7% every 30 days during COVID waves 2 and 3. Overall seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens reached 39.3% during the pandemic; however, the 14.7% seropositivity detected pre-pandemic demonstrates the presence of cross-reactive antibody responses against other antigens in Malawi. Surprisingly, pregnancies within the pandemic showed improved outcomes, with longer gestations (mean difference: 0.6 weeks [95% CI: 0.2 - 0.9]) and higher birth weights (mean difference: 169.3g, [65.9 - 272.6]) when compared to pregnancies occurring pre-pandemic. We found no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were associated with pregnancy outcomes.

InterpretationsThis study demonstrates that serological surveillance reveals undetected SARS-CoV-2 exposure where traditional testing was limited. The improvement in pregnancy outcomes during the pandemic suggests community-level exposure did not offset the social impacts of the pandemic in this population. These findings highlight pregnancy cohorts as valuable sentinel populations for infectious disease surveillance, emphasising the importance of serosurveillance in resource-limited settings.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

ObjectiveTo identify causes and consequences of VaD by developing a polygenic risk score (PRS) for VaD and conducting a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), followed by Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using data from the UK Biobank.

MethodsUsing data from 334,758 UK Biobank participants, we first constructed a VaD PRS based on the most recent genome-wide association study (GWAS). We then performed an age-stratified PheWAS (39-53, 53-62, 62-72 years), examining 9,319 phenotypes associated with the VaD PRS. We followed up PheWAS hits with two-sample MR to evaluate causal relationships with VaD risk.

ResultsOur PheWAS revealed age-dependent associations, with many relationships strengthening as age increased. Associations were found with vascular and Alzheimers dementias; cerebrovascular traits such as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), stroke, and intracerebral haemorrhage; adverse lipid profiles; elevated systolic blood pressure and glucose levels; reduced brain volumes (subcortical and hippocampal); and poorer cognitive function. The VaD PRS was also associated with higher risk of depression, Parkinsons disease, neuroinflammatory disorders, and decreased basal metabolic rate and fat-free mass. MR analyses supported causal effects for WMH (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.39-2.40), depression (1.25, 1.02-1.54), lipid traits (e.g., apolipoprotein B/A1 ratio: 1.31, 1.06-1.62), HbA1c (1.14, 1.02-1.28), and diastolic (1.03, 1.01-1.04) and systolic (1.01, 1.01-1.02) blood pressure. Protective factors included years of schooling (0.76, 0.64-0.90), apolipoprotein A (0.74, 0.59-0.92), fat-free mass (0.84, 0.71-0.99), and basal metabolic rate (0.82, 0.69-0.97).

ConclusionsOur findings highlight the central role of cardiometabolic and educational factors in the development of vascular dementia. Several modifiable risk factors--particularly blood pressure, glucose regulation, lipid levels, and years of schooling--showed evidence of causal effects on VaD risk. Age-stratified results suggest that early intervention, ideally from midlife, may offer the greatest preventive benefit by mitigating the progressive accumulation of vascular damage contributing to dementia risk.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

The aim of this research was to identify small molecule inhibitors of NET production using a highly-curated panel of narrow-spectrum small molecule kinase inhibitors termed the Kinase Chemogenomic Set (KCGS).

MethodsNeutrophils were isolated from healthy controls (HC) and people with RA or SLE. Over 220 small molecules were screened for their ability to inhibit NET production and decrease ROS production without impairing neutrophil apoptosis or killing of S. aureus bacteria.

ResultsFifty compounds, nominally targeting 29 individual protein kinase targets, were found to inhibit NOX2-dependent (PMA-stimulated) and NOX2-independent (A23187-stimulated) NET production (p<0.05, n=5 HC, RA and SLE). Of these, seven compounds did not significantly impair ROS production or apoptosis. The deconvoluted targets of these small molecules inhibit kinases that operate in three cellular pathways: autophagy, cell cycle checkpoint and epidermal growth factor (EGF) tyrosine kinase signalling. Of these, only inhibitors of ULK1, JNK and ROCK1/2, broadly implicated in the regulation of autophagy, did not significantly impair bacterial killing (n=5 HC, p>0.05). Autophagy inhibitors were also able to inhibit immune-complex driven NET production (p<0.05, n=5 HC, RA and SLE).

ConclusionWe propose that autophagy signalling pathways represent novel and exciting targets for the development of small molecule therapeutics to block unwanted neutrophil activation and NET release in immune-mediated inflammatory disease.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

SEM-EDS enabled the classification of PM by size (Dust, PM10, and PM2.5) and by composition (Terrigenous PM and Carbonaceous PM). Higher PM concentrations were detected during harvest periods, with a notable increase in carbon-rich PM2.5 (PMC2.5) in 2019 compared to 2020. Unexpectedly, this variation was primarily attributed to reduced population mobility during the 2020 lockdowns, rather than changes in industrial activity. Satellite data on nitrogen oxides (NOx) supported these findings, revealing emission patterns consistent with vehicular activity. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of SEM-EDS in characterizing air pollutants and highlights the critical influence of population mobility on urban air quality. The findings support the implementation of targeted air pollution control strategies - particularly during harvest seasons- to mitigate both health and environmental impacts.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

They also require subjective choices to set the level of temporal and spatial heterogeneity assumed. We propose a novel framework to estimate Rt based on Generalized Linear and Additive Models (GLM/GAM). By integrating the renewal equation model within GLM/GAM, the proposed framework, 'Rt.glm', allows smooth estimation of Rt variations over time and space without relying on arbitrary scaling parameters. The performance of Rt.glm was evaluated using historical datasets and simulated outbreaks. It demonstrated improved overall performance and accuracy compared to EpiEstim, as measured by the CRPS scores and Mean Square Errors respectively. However, when case incidence was low and Rt estimation relied on a smoothing term, Rt.glm was marginally overconfident in its estimates. The method offers substantial improvement for the real-time estimation of spatio-temporal trends in Rt, with improved performance and lower reliance on arbitrarily set parameters. The open-source and user-friendly R package developed will also simplify user experience. Finally, the framework bridges gaps between epidemic monitoring methodologies and sets the stage for future extensions to enhance statistical inference and integrate additional epidemiological complexities, including the evaluation of intervention strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

Utilizing a complementary set of statistical analyses, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the genetic architecture between severe mental disorders (major depression (MD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SCZ)) and seven autoimmune diseases (autoimmune thyroiditis, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes), involving a total of 667,518 cases from 10 genome-wide association studies. While MD was positively genetically correlated with five autoimmune diseases, BD and SCZ were only positively correlated with IBD, suggesting differences in the genetic signal shared with autoimmunity across these mental disorders. A considerable fraction of genetic variants influencing autoimmune diseases (range 17.1-88.4 %) were estimated to overlap with mental disorders; however, this constitutes only a minor part of genetic variants influencing the more polygenic mental disorders. Finally, we identified 172 genetic loci jointly affecting mental disorders and autoimmune diseases, implicating both lipid metabolism and TNF signaling.

Because different types of epilepsy involve different brain networks, numerous DBS targets have been explored.

MethodsTo provide a comprehensive overview of this expanding literature, we conducted a systematic review of studies for DBS in epilepsy, collecting data on surgical targets, individual disease characteristics, outcomes, and precise electrode placements. DBS electrode coordinates were gathered into a common template space and related to clinical outcomes.

FindingsWe included 124 studies, corresponding to 1,210 patients and 20 distinct surgical targets. While the anterior (ANT) and centromedian (CM) nuclei of the thalamus remain the most studied, we also review less commonly used targets that show promise for specific forms of epilepsy and may warrant further investigation. Substantial variability in targeting strategies and electrode placement was observed within each of the target regions. Importantly, significant relationships between stimulation location and outcomes were identified for ANT- and CM-DBS. For ANT-DBS, shorter distance to the mammillothalamic tract junction was associated with greater seizure reduction on both study- and patient-level analyses (r=-0.55, p<0.001 and r=-0.51, p<0.001, respectively). For CM-DBS, localization effects may be dependent on the form of epilepsy, with stimulation of the parvocellular CM being associated with better outcomes in generalized epilepsy.

InterpretationOur results emphasize the importance of accurate targeting in DBS for epilepsy. Our database and atlas of DBS targets are made publicly available, potentially serving further meta-analytical work.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSDeep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment option for drug-resistant epilepsy. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease, various brain networks may be candidates for targeted neuromodulation. We systematically searched the PubMed database on 07/05/2024 using the search terms ""Epilep* AND (neuromodulation OR deep brain stimulation)"". Although several systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating DBS for epilepsy have been published in recent years, these have focused on individual surgical targets. A comprehensive synthesis of the broader and increasingly diverse landscape of DBS targeting strategies in epilepsy has been lacking. Moreover, no large-scale, systematic assessment of the relationship between electrode placement and outcomes has been conducted.

Added value of the studyOur systematic review provides the most comprehensive overview to date of deep brain stimulation targets for epilepsy, synthesizing data from 1,210 participants across 124 studies. We report on surgical targeting strategies, clinical rationales and outcomes for 20 distinct anatomical targets, identifying promising emerging options for specific epilepsy types. Crucially, we collected DBS electrode coordinates and pooled them across studies, revealing substantial variability in targeting strategies and electrode placement within each region. By systematically relating electrode locations to outcomes, we derive meta-analytical evidence for optimal stimulation sites within anterior and centro-median nuclei of the thalamus.

Implications of all the available evidenceWhile only the anterior nucleus is approved as a DBS target for epilepsy in the United States and Europe, our review highlights other emerging targets that warrant further investigation. Furthermore, our findings emphasize the key influence of electrode placement on outcomes and have immediate clinical relevance for DBS targeting and programming for the anterior and centro-median nuclei. Further research is needed to better define the networks modulated by stimulation (even more so for surgical targets other than the anterior and centro-median nuclei) and optimize outcomes for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

ResultsBefore treatment intensification or de-escalation, the impact of antibiotic treatment on health-related quality of life and microbiological factors, such as acquired resistance and changes in the pathogenic NTM, should be assessed. The presence of severe radiological findings at the beginning of treatment and a history of multiple antibiotic regimen modifications were associated with a lower chance of treatment success. Evidence regarding supportive interventions for treatment-refractory NTM-PD, such as nutritional counselling, respiratory rehabilitation, and psychosocial support, remains limited. Intermittent administration of intravenous antibiotics may be an additional strategy for symptom management. Depending on the causative NTM species, some antibiotic options have been explored for treatment intensification, although most of these are based on observational studies. Surgical resection remains an option for localised disease, although the risk of recurrence remains substantial in the case of preoperative positive culture. Novel therapeutic approaches remain under investigation as potential alternatives.

DiscussionThis systematic review underscores the complexity of managing refractory NTM-PD, highlighting the role of treatment intensification, symptom control, supportive measures and knowledge gaps. While no standardised approach exists, individualised strategies incorporating clinical, microbiological, and radiological factors remain essential for optimising patient outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

Fixation stability, the ability to maintain steady visual fixation, may serve as a transdiagnostic marker in major psychiatric disorders. This study evaluates fixation stability as a potential transdiagnostic endophenotype in families with multiple affected individuals.

MethodsMonocular eye tracking data was recorded using infrared cameras while participants fixed their gaze on a stimulus in trials with and without distractors. The fixation stability (FS) performance was compared across 449 individuals affected with major psychiatric disorders (26 Alzheimers Dementia (AD), 89 schizophrenia (SCZ), 116 bipolar disorder (BD), 98 obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and 120 substance-use disorder (SUD)), 442 unaffected first degree relatives (FDRs) along with 145 healthy controls (HC). FS performance was compared across groups using a linear mixed effects model controlling for familiality, age and sex.

ResultAffected individuals performed significantly poorly (fixation frequency(F=6.37, pcor=0.003), median fixation duration(F=4.79, pcor=0.009), saccade frequency(F=7.74, pcor<0.001), mean saccade amplitude(F=4.92, pcor=0.009), mean scanpath length(F=6.83, pcor=0.003)) in the trials with distractors when compared to FDRs and HC. The performance of FDRs and HC did not differ significantly from that of the other. Furthermore, in a cross-diagnostic comparison, impaired performance was observed only in SCZ and BD, with both performing significantly worse than SUD, OCD, and HC.

ConclusionsFS performance was impaired in major psychiatric disorders compared to FDRs and HC. Instead of an endophenotype, FS measures serve as illness markers. SCZ and BD showed the greatest deficits, highlighting the strong impact of psychotic conditions on visuoperceptual processing.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

Human Siglecs count 14 unique proteins allocated to two subsets; group 1 includes four evolutionarily conserved proteins with clear orthologues in all mammals with low sequence similarity and group 2 includes ten rapidly evolving proteins with high sequence similarity and species specificity. In all Siglecs, the recognition and binding of the sialic acid on the glycan target involves a conserved, or canonical, Arg residue. Yet, for a subset of human Siglecs, namely MAG, Siglec-6, and Siglec-11, this Arg appears not to be essential, suggesting that a different binding mechanism may be at play. In this work, we used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding assays, and mutagenesis to investigate the structural, mechanistic and energetic details of the binding of Siglec-6 to monosialylated gangliosides. Our results show that Siglec-6 relies only partially on its conserved Arg (Arg122) for recognition of membrane-bound gangliosides and that it supplements its binding free energy through interactions with the phospholipids in the membrane surrounding the target epitope. We identified residues Lys126 and Trp127 as key players in this unique membrane interaction, and we confirmed by mutagenesis assays that the loss of these residues abrogates binding. These results provide a step-change in our understanding of the diversification of human Siglecs across group 2, where different members likely evolved as molecular precision tools, to bind specific sialosides by adapting their structure to recognize not only the epitope, but also the biological environment in which it is found.","NA","biorxiv",1750889357127

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1750889357127
