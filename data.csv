The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

This study compared leading commercial blood tests for amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.

MethodsPlasma samples from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were assayed with AD blood tests from C2N Diagnostics, Fujirebio Diagnostics, ALZPath, Janssen, Roche Diagnostics, and Quanterix. Outcomes measures were amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, cortical thickness, and dementia severity. Logistic regression models assessed the classification accuracies of individual or combined plasma biomarkers for binarized outcomes, and Spearman correlations evaluated continuous relationships between individual plasma biomarkers and continuous outcomes.

ResultsMeasures of plasma p-tau217, either individually or in combination with other plasma biomarkers, had the strongest relationships with all AD outcomes.

The relevant pharmacologic target of SGLT2i remains unclear. We show here that SGLT2i directly activate pantothenate kinase 1 (PANK1), the rate-limiting enzyme that initiates the conversion of pantothenate (vitamin B5) to coenzyme-A (CoA), an obligate co-factor for all major pathways of fuel use in the heart. Using stable-isotope infusion studies, we show that SGLT2i promote pantothenate consumption, activate CoA synthesis, rescue decreased levels of CoA in human failing hearts, and broadly stimulate fuel use in ex vivo perfused human cardiac blocks from patients with heart failure. Furthermore, we show that SGLT2i bind to PANK1 directly at physiological concentrations and promote PANK1 enzymatic activity in assays with purified components. Novel in silico dynamic modeling identified the site of SGLT2i binding on PANK1 and indicated a mechanism of activation involving prevention of allosteric inhibition of PANK1 by acyl-CoA species. Finally, we show that inhibition of PANK1 prevents SGLT2i- mediated increased contractility of isolated adult human cardiomyocytes. In summary, we demonstrate robust and specific off-target activation of PANK1 by SGLT2i, promoting CoA synthesis and efficient fuel use in human hearts, providing a likely explanation for the remarkable clinical benefits of SGLT2i.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

However, the optimal date for booster administration remains uncertain. Geographic variation in infection rates throughout the year make it challenging to intuit the best yearly booster administration date to effectively prevent infection, and also challenging to provide best guidance in how to alter booster administration in response to a breakthrough infection. Therefore, we leverage longitudinal antibody and reinfection probabilities with spatiotemporal projections of COVID-19 incidence to develop a geographically-informed approach to optimizing the timing of booster vaccination. Additionally, we assess the delay in booster vaccination that is warranted following breakthrough infections whenever they occur during the year, enabling an approach that acknowledges and respects diverse immune statuses, thereby addressing a substantial barrier to uptake. Our results provide guidance for individual decision-making and healthcare provider recommendations, as well as optimal public health policies.","NA","medrxiv",1722204574071

We investigated the pandemics impact on brain ageing using longitudinal neuroimaging data from the UK Biobank. Brain age prediction models were trained from hundreds of multi-modal imaging features using a cohort of 15,334 healthy participants. These models were applied to an independent cohort of 1,336 participants with two MRI scans: either both before the pandemic (Controls) or one before and one after the pandemic onset (""Pandemic"" group). Our findings reveal that, even with matched brain age gaps initially, the pandemic significantly accelerated brain ageing. The ""Pandemic"" group showed on average 11-month higher deviation of predicted brain age vs. chronological age (brain age gap) at the second time point compared with controls. Accelerated brain ageing was more pronounced in males and those from deprived socio-demographic backgrounds, with average increases of 3.3 and 7 months, respectively. These deviations existed regardless of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, accelerated brain ageing correlated with reduced cognitive performance only in COVID-infected participants. Our study highlights the pandemics significant impact on brain health, beyond direct infection effects, emphasising the need to consider broader social and health inequalities.","NA","medrxiv",1722204574071

The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g. upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% and 14% of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56.

But most viruses have limited cargo capacities, restricting their ability to carry large CRISPR-Cas systems. Here, we engineered tobacco rattle virus to carry the compact RNA-guided TnpB enzyme ISYmu1 and its guide RNA. This innovation allowed transgene-free editing of Arabidopsis thaliana in a single step, with edits inherited in the subsequent generation. By overcoming traditional reagent delivery barriers, this approach offers a novel platform for genome editing, which can greatly accelerate plant biotechnology and basic research.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

This approach uses the increased abundance of p53 protein in TP53 mutant cancer cells to concentrate toxic molecules in these cells. We demonstrate the first generalizable strategy using a small molecule to selectively kill TP53 mutant cells. This molecule binds the Y220C mutant of p53 and concentrates a PLK1 inhibitor in cells harboring TP53 Y220C mutations.

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1722204574071

The mechanisms driving the formation of TF clusters and their impact on transcription, however, remain largely unclear. This is mostly due to the lack of a tractable system. Here, we exploit the transcriptional activation of mir430 in zebrafish embryos to simultaneously follow the dynamic formation of a large Nanog cluster, the underlying DNA, and transcription output by live imaging at high temporal and spatial resolution. We find that the formation of a Nanog cluster that can support transcription requires local DNA compaction. This brings more Nanog-binding sites into the cluster, and therefore more Nanog. Importantly, we find that Nanog stabilizes this TF-DNA cluster, which emphasizes the interdependent relationship between TFs and DNA dynamics in cluster formation. Once the Nanog-DNA cluster at the mir430 locus reaches a maximum amount of Nanog, transcription begins. This maximum is a locus-intrinsic feature, which shows that the locus self-regulates the recruitment of an optimal amount of Nanog. Our study supports a model in which endogenous TF clusters positively impact transcription and form through a combination of DNA binding and local DNA compaction.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

DesignObservational population-based study.

SettingScotland, 2000-2019. Linked psychiatric hospital admission and death records.

ParticipantsAdults with a psychiatric hospital admission record for schizophrenia (28,797), bipolar disorder (16,657) or major depression (72,504) compared with the Scottish population (4.3 million adults in 2011).

Main outcome measuresTrends over time in life years lost for people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depression compared with the Scottish population, for all deaths, and natural and unnatural deaths, stratified by sex.

ResultsAmong people with SMI, one third died during the study period. Between 2000 and 2019, LE increased in the general Scottish population and the LE gap widened for people with schizophrenia. For 2000-2002, men and women with schizophrenia lost an excess 9.4 (95% CI 8.5 to 10.3) and 8.2 (7.4 to 9.0) life years, respectively, compared to the general population. In 2017-2019, this excess life years lost increased to 11.8 (10.9 to 12.7) and 11.1 (10.0 to 12.1) for men and women, respectively. There was no evidence of a change over time in the LE gap of 5 to 8 years for people with bipolar disorder or major depression. Changes in LE for natural and unnatural causes of death varied by individual SMI and sex.

ConclusionsThe LE gap in people with an SMI persisted or widened in Scotland from 2000-2019. These entrenched disparities reflect intersecting inequalities requiring coordinated solutions at multiple levels to improve LE in this and other marginalised and socially excluded groups.

Understanding how behavioral and artifactual variation in these populations relates to climate change and ecology is vital to correctly interpreting the archaeological record, especially given the major climatic and cultural fluctuations during the Pleistocene. Bifacially flaked core tools - which technologically define the tradition - are sometimes regionally and periodically absent within the Acheuleans boundaries. Biface presence is broadly associated with, but rarely formally tested against, environmental conditions. Here, we investigate biface presence/absence and climate/ecological variation at a continental scale between 726 and 130ka. Using a comprehensive sample of European sites matched to paleoenvironmental reconstructions, we demonstrate clear associations between Acheulean presence and specific environments. Acheulean habitat suitability was most strongly associated with mean winter temperatures above -5/-10{degrees}C, and precipitation of the driest month above 15 mm. Two major habitats, warm forest/woodland and shrubland, comprised the European Acheulean niche. Acheulean spatial presence was reconstructed through time: during interglacial and glacial periods it covered most of southwestern Europe, but extended along northern coastal routes during interglacials. Central and Eastern Europe always remained unsuitable. The Acheulean was excluded from areas experiencing both low winter temperatures and low summer precipitation, but reached areas including only one of those two climatic extremes, suggesting seasonal migrations to avoid the harshest seasons. These analyses explain current Acheulean site distributions in Europe and suggest strong links between handaxes, specific ecological conditions, and prehistoric demographic patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

However, existing gradient flow learning methods cannot analyze spatially resolved transcriptomic data.

These immune receptors detect pathogen infection by sensing virulence effector proteins. However, the mechanisms by which receptors evolve new recognition specificities remain poorly understood. Here we report that a plant NLR has evolved the capacity to bind to a pathogen effector by acting as a molecular mimic of a virulence target of the effector, thereby triggering an immune response. The barley NLR Mildew Locus A 3 (MLA3) confers resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae by recognizing the effector Pwl2. Using structural analysis, we show that MLA3 has acquired the capacity to bind and respond to Pwl2 through molecular mimicry of the effector host target HIPP43. We demonstrate that the amino acids at the binding interface of MLA3 and Pwl2 are highly conserved in interface of HIPP43 with Pwl2, and are required to trigger an immune response. We used this discovery to bioengineer SR50-an MLA ortholog in rye that confers resistance to wheat stem rust-by introducing the Pwl2 binding interface of MLA3. This chimeric receptor has dual recognition activities, binding and responding to effectors from two major cereal pathogens. Collectively, these results provide evidence that plant immune receptors have evolved sophisticated mimicry strategies to counteract pathogen attack.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1722204574071

While many nucleoside analogues have exhibited broad-spectrum activity against a wide range of viruses, their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 is limited. The lack of activity is hypothesized to be attributed to the proofreading function of viral nsp14 exonuclease. In this study, the role of the nsp14 proofreading in modulating nucleoside antiviral activity was investigated using genetic and pharmacological approaches. Introduction of exonuclease attenuation or disabling mutations to nsp14 led to either severe replication defect or increased sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replicons to specific nucleoside analogues. In contrast, repurposing of HCV NS5A inhibitors to suppress nsp14 exonuclease activity is insufficient to enhance the potency of nucleoside analogues. These findings provided further support for nsp14 as a target for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral development and highlighted the complex interplay between nsp14 proofreading and RNA replication.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

Mutational profiling and spatial transcriptomics on squamous cell carcinomas adjacent to actinic keratoses revealed TERT promoter and CDKN2A mutations emerging in actinic keratoses, whereas additional mutations inactivating ARID2 and activating the MAPK-pathway delineated the transition to squamous cell carcinomas. Spatial variation in gene expression patterns was common in both tumor and immune cells, with high expression of checkpoint molecules at the invasive front of tumors.

While both cortical and subcortical structures are involved, their precise roles and interactions are not fully understood. To investigate this, we simultaneously recorded neural activity from the frontal and parietal cortex, higher-order thalamic nuclei, and core basal ganglia structures during color and spatial working memory tasks in non-human primates. We found widespread yet differential encoding of color and spatial information, marked by area-specific temporal dynamics and modulation according to task demands. Both cortical and subcortical information increased towards working memory-dependent actions, suggesting a task-specific reloading of information. Directed interactions between cortical and subcortical regions were extensive and reciprocal, with dominant directions of information flow, especially from frontoparietal areas. These interactions were dynamically modulated and partially task specific. Our findings provide comprehensive insights into the large-scale circuit dynamics underlying primate working memory and suggest that flexible goal-directed behavior relies on the selective processing of task-relevant memory information within information-specific cortico-subcortical networks.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

Development of biomarkers for amyloid-beta (A{beta}) and tau protein aggregates, the hallmark pathologies of AD, have improved patient monitoring/stratification and drug development, but they still only explain 20-40% of the variance in cognitive impairment (CI) in AD. To discover additional molecular drivers and biomarkers of AD dementia, we perform cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics on 3,416 individuals from six deeply phenotyped prospective AD case-control cohorts. We identify synapse proteins as the strongest correlates of CI, independent of A{beta} and tau. Using machine learning we derive the CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 synapse protein ratio, a robust correlate of CI, which explains 27% of the variance in CI beyond CSF PTau181:A{beta}42, 10% beyond tau PET, and 50% beyond CSF NfL in A{beta} positive individuals. We find YWHAG:NPTX2 also increases with normal aging as early as age 20 and increases at a faster rate in APOE4 carriers and autosomal dominant-AD mutation carriers. Most notably, YWHAG:NPTX2+ individuals (top 25th percentile) are 15-times (HR=15.4 [10.6-22.2]) more likely to experience cognitive decline over 15 years compared to YWHAG:NPTX2- individuals (bottom 25th percentile), and this rises to 19-times (HR=18.9 [10.83-32.9]) with additional stratification by A{beta} and phosphorylated tau status. Lastly, we perform plasma proteomics on 4,245 individuals to develop a plasma-based signature of CI which partly recapitulates CSF YWHAG:NPTX2. Overall, our findings underscore CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 and the corresponding plasma signature as robust prognostic biomarkers for AD onset and progression beyond gold-standard biomarkers of A{beta}, tau, and neurodegeneration and implicate synapse dysfunction as a core driver of AD dementia.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

However, whether Gram-negative bacteria, which are known to manipulate the host membranous system, regulate ER-phagy remains elusive. We find that bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) released upon infection with Salmonella Typhimurium colocalizes with FAM134B, a reticulon-like protein that operates as an ER-phagy receptor. Pulldown assays reveal that LPS binds directly to FAM134B. The interaction occurs via lipid A of LPS and positively charged amino acid residues on the amphipathic helices and C-terminal region of FAM134B. Upon binding, O-Antigen of LPS promotes FAM134B oligomerization and ER fragmentation in in vitro liposome membrane remodeling assays. Delivery of LPS into the cytoplasm via transfection significantly increases the number of FAM134B-LC3B-decorated ER fragments, which are recruited to Salmonella-containing vacuoles. Both intracellular and extracellular bacteria use outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) to deliver LPS into the cytosol for FAM134B activation and ER fragmentation. Taken together, our results show that Gram-negative bacteria subvert the host ER remodeling system to create bacteria-containing vacuoles that provide a niche for bacterial survival.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

Cells polarizing at the early and late 8-cell stage have distinct molecular and morphological properties that direct their following lineage specification, with early polarizing cells being biased towards producing the TE lineage. More recent studies have also implicated heterogeneities between cells prior to the 8-cell stage in the first cell fate decision: cells exhibiting reduced methyltransferase CARM1 activity at the 4-cell stage are predisposed towards the TE fate. Here, we demonstrate that reduced CARM1 activity and upregulation of its substrate BAF155 promote early polarization and TE specification.

Exclusively polycistronic transcripts are prevalent in green algae, although the mechanism by which multiple polypeptides are translated from a single transcript is unknown. Here, we used bioinformatic and in vivo mutational analyses to evaluate competing mechanistic models for polycistronic expression in green algae. High-confidence manually curated datasets of bicistronic loci from two divergent green algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Auxenochlorella protothecoides, revealed 1) a preference for weak Kozak-like sequences for ORF 1 and 2) an underrepresentation of potential initiation codons before ORF 2, which are suitable conditions for leaky scanning to allow ORF 2 translation. We used mutational analysis in Auxenochlorella protothecoides to test the mechanism. In vivo manipulation of the ORF 1 Kozak-like sequence and start codon altered reporter expression at ORF 2, with a weaker Kozak-like sequence enhancing expression and a stronger one diminishing it. A synthetic bicistronic dual reporter demonstrated inversely adjustable activity of green fluorescent protein expressed from ORF 1 and luciferase from ORF 2, depending on the strength of the ORF 1 Kozak-like sequence. Our findings demonstrate that translation of multiple ORFs in green algal bicistronic transcripts is consistent with episodic leaky ribosome scanning of ORF 1 to allow translation at ORF 2. This work has implications for the potential functionality of upstream open reading frames found across eukaryotic genomes and for transgene expression in synthetic biology applications.

Significance StatementTextbook dogma states that nucleus-encoded genes are monocistronic, producing transcripts with a single translated open reading frame. However, highly conserved bicistronic loci are pervasive in green algae that are separated by several hundred million years of evolution, speaking to their ancestral origins and functions within the Chlorophyte lineage. A combination of bioinformatic analysis and in vivo gene manipulation supports leaky ribosomal scanning as the primary mechanism for translation of multiple ORFs from bicistronic transcripts. We have successfully tuned synthesis levels of two proteins encoded on one mRNA by modifying the ORF 1 Kozak-like sequence. These findings may have broad applications in synthetic biology.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

This paper aims to be a practical guide to spatial simulation, helping researchers to implement realistic and efficient spatial, individual-based simulations and avoid common pitfalls. To do this, we delve into mechanisms of mating, reproduction, density-dependent feedback, and dispersal, all of which may vary across the landscape, discuss how these affect population dynamics, and describe how to parameterize simulations in convenient ways (for instance, to achieve a desired population density). We also demonstrate how to implement these models using the current version of the individual-based simulator, SLiM. Since SLiM has the capacity to simulate genomes, we also discuss natural selection---in particular, how genetic variation can affect demographic processes. Finally, we provide four short vignettes: simulations of pikas that shift their range up a mountain as temperatures rise; mosquitoes that live in rivers as juveniles and experience seasonally changing habitat; cane toads that expand across Australia, reaching 120 million individuals; and monarch butterflies whose populations are regulated by an explicitly modeled resource (milkweed).","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

How sound causes excruciating pain that can last for weeks or months in otherwise healthy individuals is not well understood, resulting in a lack of effective treatments. To address this gap, we identified the most salient physical and psychosocial consequences of debilitating sound-induced pain and reviewed the interventions that sufferers have sought for pain relief to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of the condition. Adults (n = 32) with pain hyperacusis attended a virtual focus group to describe their sound-induced pain. They completed three surveys to identify common symptoms and themes that defined their condition and to describe their use of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical therapies for pain relief. All participants endorsed negative effects of pain hyperacusis on psychosocial and physical function. Most reported sound-induced burning (80.77%), stabbing (76.92%), throbbing (73.08%), and pinching (53.85%) that occurs either in the ear or elsewhere in the body (i.e., referred pain). Participants reported using numerous pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions to alleviate their pain with varying degrees of pain relief. Benzodiazepines and nerve blockers emerged as the most effective analgesic options while non-pharmaceutical therapies were largely ineffective. Symptoms of pain hyperacusis and therapeutic approaches are largely consistent with peripheral mechanistic theories of pain hyperacusis (e.g., trigeminal nerve involvement). An interdisciplinary approach to clinical studies and the development of animal models is needed to identify, validate, and treat the pathological mechanisms of pain hyperacusis.","NA","medrxiv",1722204574071

One rapid response to mitochondrial damage is peri-mitochondrial actin polymerization within 2 mins, which we term ADA (Acute Damaged-induced Actin). ADA is vital for a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis upon mitochondrial dysfunction. In the current study we investigated the effect of ADA on Pink1/Parkin mediated mitochondrial quality control. We show that inhibition of proteins involved in the ADA pathway significantly accelerates Parkin recruitment onto depolarized mitochondria. Addressing the mechanism by which ADA resists Parkin recruitment onto depolarized mitochondria, we found that ADA disrupts ERmitochondrial contacts in an Arp2/3 complex-dependent manner. Interestingly, over-expression of ER-mitochondrial tethers overrides the effect of ADA, allowing rapid recruitment of not only Parkin but also LC3 after mitochondrial depolarization. During chronic mitochondrial dysfunction, Parkin and LC3 recruitment are completely blocked, which is reversed rapidly by inhibiting ADA. Taken together we show that ADA acts as a protective mechanism, delaying mitophagy following acute damage, and blocking mitophagy during chronic mitochondrial damage.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

We discover over 100 unique RNA-regulatory effectors in 86 distinct RBPs, presenting evidence that RBPs contain functionally separable domains that dictate their post-transcriptional control of gene expression, and identify some with unique activity at 5 or 3UTRs. We identify some domains that downregulate gene expression both when recruited to DNA and RNA, and dissect their mechanisms of regulation. Finally, we build a synthetic RNA regulator that can stably maintain gene expression at desired levels that are predictable by a mathematical model.

We solve the structure of the seipin/Adig complex by Cryo-EM at 2.98A overall resolution. Surprisingly, seipin can form two unique oligomers, undecamers and dodecamers. Adig selectively binds to the dodecameric seipin complex. We further find that Adig promotes seipin assembly by stabilizing and bridging adjacent seipin subunits. Functionally, Adig plays a key role in generating lipid droplets in adipocytes. In mice, inducible overexpression of Adig in adipocytes substantially increases fat mass, with enlarged lipid droplets. It also elevates thermogenesis during cold exposure. In contrast, inducible adipocyte-specific Adig knockout mice manifest aberrant lipid droplet formation in brown adipose tissues and impaired cold tolerance.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

Advances in genome sequencing have led to the identification of a myriad NLRs in numerous agriculturally important plant species. However, deciphering which NLR proteins recognize specific pathogen effectors remains a challenge. Predicting NLR-effector interactions in silico would provide a more targeted approach for experimental validation, critical for elucidating function, and advancing our understanding of NLR-triggered immunity. In this study, NLR-effector protein complex structures were predicted using Alphafold2-Multimer for all experimentally validated NLR-effector interactions. Binding affinities- and energies were predicted using 97 machine learning models from Area-affinity. We show that predicted structures with an AlphaFold confidence score > 0.42 have acceptable accuracy, and can be used to investigate NLR-effector interactions in silico. Binding affinities for 58 NLR-effector complexes ranged between -8.5 and -10.6 log(K), and binding energies between -11.8 and -14.4 kcal/mol, depending on the Area-Affinity model used. For 2427 forced NLR-effector complexes, these estimates showed larger variability, enabling the identification of novel NLR-effector complexes with 99% accuracy using an Ensemble machine learning model. The narrow range of binding energies- and affinities for true interactions suggest a specific change in Gibbs free energy, and thus conformational change, is required for NLR activation. This is the first study to provide a method for predicting NLR-effector interactions, applicable to all plant-pathogen interactions. Finally, the NLR-Effector Interaction Classification (NEIC) resource can streamline research efforts by identifying NLRs important for providing resistance against plant pathogens, advancing our understanding of plant immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

Unfortunately, our understanding of necrosis and how it impacts surrounding healthy tissue - an essential consideration when developing methods to treat such injuries - has been limited by a lack of robust genetically tractable models. Our lab previously established a method to study necrosis-induced regeneration in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, which revealed a unique phenomenon whereby cells at a distance from the injury upregulate caspase activity in a process called Necrosis-induced Apoptosis (NiA) that is vital for regeneration. Here we have further investigated this phenomenon, showing that NiA is predominantly associated with the highly regenerative pouch region of the disc, shaped by genetic factors present in the presumptive hinge. Furthermore, we find that a proportion of NiA fail to undergo apoptosis, instead surviving effector caspase activation to persist within the tissue and stimulate reparative proliferation late in regeneration. This proliferation relies on the initiator caspase Dronc, and occurs independent of JNK, ROS or mitogens associated with the previously characterized Apoptosis-induced Proliferation (AiP) mechanism. These data reveal a new means by which non-apoptotic Dronc signaling promotes regenerative proliferation in response to necrotic damage.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

Here, we perform a meta-analysis of existing datasets and examine the associated bioinformatic pipelines. Our analysis reveals that technological noise, biological variation and incomplete genome assemblies give rise to features in the data that can distort the interpretation.

In this work, we propose HCS-3DX, a next-generation system revolutionising HCS research in 3D imaging and evaluation. HCS-3DX is based on three main components: an automated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven micromanipulator for oid selection, an engineered HCS foil multiwell plate for optimised imaging, and an image-based software for single-cell data analysis. The developed system was validated through different experiments with 3D tumour models, including tumour-stroma co-cultures. The results prove that the resolution achievable with HCS-3DX enables us to overcome the limitations of current systems and reliably perform 3D high-content screening (HCS) at the single-cell level.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

During aging, levels of NAD+ can decrease by up to 50% in some tissues, the repletion of which provides a range of health benefits in both mice and humans. Whether or not the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) extends lifespan in mammals is not known. Here we investigate the effect of long-term administration of NMN on the health, cancer burden, frailty and lifespan of male and female mice. Without increasing tumor counts or severity in any tissue, NMN treatment of males and females increased activity, maintained more youthful gene expression patterns, and reduced overall frailty. Reduced frailty with NMN treatment was associated with increases in levels of Anerotruncus colihominis, a gut bacterium associated with lower inflammation in mice and increased longevity in humans. NMN slowed the accumulation of adipose tissue later in life and improved metabolic health in male but not female mice, while in females but not males, NMN increased median lifespan by 8.5%, possible due to sex-specific effects of NMN on NAD+ metabolism. Together, these data show that chronic NMN treatment delays frailty, alters the microbiome, improves male metabolic health, and increases female mouse lifespan, without increasing cancer burden. These results highlight the potential of NAD+ boosters for treating age-related conditions and the importance of using both sexes for interventional lifespan studies.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

Immunophenotypic profiling has shown that leukemias develop hierarchically, with mutations in leukemia stem cells associated with disease propagation and relapse1,2. Although leukemia initiating cells can be enriched using cell surface markers, their frequency tends to be variable and low, obscuring mechanisms and hindering effective therapies3,4. To define AML stem cells in human patients, we performed functional genomic profiling of diverse leukemias using label tracing techniques designed to preserve hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function in vivo. We found that propagation of human AML is mediated by a rare but distinct quiescent label-retaining cell (LRC) population that evades detection by currently known immunophenotypic markers. We show that human AML LRC quiescence is reversible, sparing genetic clonal competition that maintains its epigenetic inheritance. LRC quiescence is defined by distinct promoter-centered chromatin and gene expression dynamics and controlled by a distinct AP-1/ETS transcription factor network, including JUN in particular, which is associated with disease persistence and chemotherapy resistance in diverse patients. These results enable prospective isolation and functional genetic manipulation of immunophenotypically-varied leukemia stem cells in human patient specimens, as well as establish key functions of epigenetic plasticity in leukemia development and therapy resistance. We anticipate that these findings will lead to the elucidation of essential properties of leukemia stem cell quiescence and the design of therapeutic strategies for their clinical identification and control.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

Altering DNA methylation could generate additional phenotypic variation for crop breeding, however the lethality of epigenetic mutants in crop species has hindered its investigation. Here, we exploit partial redundancy between homoeologs in polyploid wheat to generate viable mutants in the DNA methyltransferase 1-1 (MET1-1) gene with altered methylation profiles. In both Triticum turgidum (tetraploid wheat) and Triticum aestivum (hexaploid wheat) we identified clear segregation distortions of higher-order mutants (5/6 and 6/6 mutant met1-1 copies in hexaploid and 3/4 and 4/4 copies in tetraploid) when genotyping segregating seeds and seedlings, which we attribute to reduced transmission of null mutant gametes. We found that the reduced transmission occurred from both the maternal and paternal gametes, however, we did not detect any deleterious effects on pollen development. The loss of four or more functional copies of MET1-1 results in decreased CG methylation in hexaploid wheat. Changes to gene expression increase stepwise with the number of mutant alleles suggesting a dosage dependent effect. Finally, we identify heritable changes to flowering and awn phenotypes which segregate independently of MET1-1. Together our results demonstrate that polyploidy can be leveraged to generate quantitative changes to CG methylation without the lethal consequences observed in other crops, opening the potential to exploit novel epialleles in plant breeding.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

However, the evolutionary origins of HPQs remain unresolved. Here, we reconstruct the biosynthetic pathway of a novel HPQ, methyl-plastoquinone, that is unique to bacteria of the phylum Nitrospirota. We demonstrate that the three extant HPQ biosynthetic pathways, in Nitrospirota, Cyanobacteriota, and Pseudomonadota, share a common origin that predates the emergence of these phyla.

Here, we sequenced and analyzed 382 full-length OROV genomes from human samples collected between 2022 and 2024 from all four states, aiming to trace the origin and genetic evolution of OROV leading to the current outbreak. Genomic analyses revealed that the recent upsurge of OROV cases in the Brazilian Amazon region coincides with the emergence of a novel reassortant viral lineage containing the M segment of viruses detected in the eastern Amazon region from 2009 to 2018 and the L and S segments of viruses detected in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador from 2008 to 2021. The novel reassortant OROV lineage likely emerged in the Central region of the AM state between 2010 and 2014 and displayed a long-range silent dispersion during the second half of the 2010s. The 2022-2024 OROV epidemic was spatially segregated into three major subpopulations located in RR, AMACRO (a bordering region between AC, RO, and AM-Southern region), and AM-Central (which includes the Amazonas capital, Manaus) regions. The peak of OROV transmissions in all regions occurred during the rainy season in the Amazon basin. Furthermore, our phylodynamics reconstructions showed that OROV spread was driven mainly by short-range (< 2 km) movements, with an average dispersal rate [&le;] 1.2 km/day, consistent with the pattern of an active flight of infected vectors. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion (22%) of long-range (> 10 km) OROV migrations were also detected, consistent with viral dispersion via human activities. Our data provides an unprecedented view of the real-time spread and evolution of a neglected emergent human pathogen. Moreover, our results emphasize the need for widespread, long-term genomic surveillance to better understand the real burden of OROV within and beyond the Amazon region.","NA","medrxiv",1722204574071

Here, we report measurements of the impact of all single amino acid mutations on ACE2-binding affinity and protein folding and expression in the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2.86 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). As with other SARS-CoV-2 variants, we find a plastic and evolvable basis for receptor binding, with many mutations at the ACE2 interface maintaining or even improving ACE2-binding affinity. Despite its large genetic divergence, mutational effects in BA.2.86 have not diverged greatly from those measured in its Omicron BA.2 ancestor. However, we do identify strong positive epistasis among subsequent mutations that have accrued in BA.2.86 descendants. Specifically, the Q493E mutation that decreased ACE2-binding affinity in all previous SARS-CoV-2 backgrounds is reversed in sign to enhance human ACE2-binding affinity when coupled with L455S and F456L in the currently emerging KP.3 variant. Our results point to a modest degree of epistatic drift in mutational effects during recent SARS-CoV-2 evolution but highlight how these small epistatic shifts can have important consequences for the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

It is challenging to quantify the dynamic responses of community members in situ as they experience steep gradients and rapid fluctuations of light. To address this, we developed a binary consortium using two representative isolates from hot spring mats, the unicellular oxygenic phototrophic cyanobacterium Synechococcus OS-B' (Syn OS-B') and the filamentous anoxygenic phototroph Chloroflexus MS-CIW-1 (Chfl MS-1). We quantified the motility of individual cells and entire colonies and demonstrated that Chfl MS-1 formed bundles of filaments that moved in all directions with no directional bias to light. Syn OS-B' was slightly less motile but exhibited positive phototaxis. This binary consortium displayed cooperative behavior by moving further than either species alone and formed ordered arrays where both species aligned with the light source. No cooperative motility was observed when a non-motile pilB mutant of Syn OS-B' was used instead of Syn OS-B'. The binary consortium also produced more adherent biofilm than individual species, consistent with the close interspecies association revealed by electron microscopy. We propose that cyanobacteria and Chloroflexota cooperate in forming natural microbial mats, by colonizing new niches and building robust biofilms.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

Pla2g2f deletion in DGCs exacerbates aging-associated pathophysiological changes including synapse loss, inflammatory microglia, reactive astrogliosis, impaired neurogenesis, lipid dysregulation and hippocampal-dependent memory loss. Conversely, boosting Pla2g2f in DGCs during aging is sufficient to preserve synapses, reduce inflammatory microglia and reactive gliosis, prevent hippocampal-dependent memory impairment and modify trajectory of cognitive decline.

Biopsies were sent for immunohistochemical staining. Clinical data was collected. Duodenal, ileal, cecal, and sigmoid colon samples were stained for SARS-CoV-2 using a SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody. Slides were reviewed by a blinded pathologist. 8 patients with known duodenal SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (SC-NA) positivity and 8 demographically matched IBS matched patients from prior to 2020 were identified for RNA sequencing comparison. Results were compared with public data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository for intestinal tissue with IBS and epithelial tissues with active SARS-CoV2 infection.

Emerging evidence suggests that ether lipids play a significant role in physiology and human health. However, their cellular functions remain largely unknown due to a lack of tools for identifying their subcellular localization and interacting proteins. Here, we address this methodological gap by synthesizing minimally modified bifunctional ether lipid probes by introducing diazirine and alkyne groups. To interrogate the subcellular kinetics of intracellular ether lipid transport in mammalian cells we used a combination of fluorescence imaging, machine learning-assisted image analysis and mathematical modelling. We find that alkyl-linked ether lipids are transported up to twofold faster than vinyl-linked species (plasmalogens), pointing to yet undiscovered cellular lipid transport machinery able to distinguish between linkage types differing by as little as two hydrogen atoms. We find that ether lipid transport predominantly occurs via non-vesicular pathways, with varying contributions from vesicular mechanisms between cell types, hinting at cell type-specific adaptations of the relatively conserved major transport mechanism. Altogether, our results suggest that differential recognition of alkyl- and vinyl ether lipids by lipid transfer proteins contributes to their distinct biological functions. In the future, the probes reported here will enable studying ether lipid biology in much greater detail through identification of interacting proteins and in-depth characterization of intracellular ether lipid dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

While the effects of individual RNA-associated proteins on RNA metabolism have been extensively characterized, the full complement of regulators for most RNA metabolic events remain unknown. Here we present a massively parallel RNA-linked CRISPR (ReLiC) screening approach to measure the responses of diverse RNA metabolic events to knockout of 2,092 human genes encoding all known RNA-associated proteins. ReLiC screens highlight modular interactions between gene networks regulating splicing, translation, and decay of mRNAs. When combined with biochemical fractionation of polysomes, ReLiC reveals striking pathway-specific coupling between growth fitness and mRNA translation. Perturbing different components of the translation and proteostasis machineries have distinct effects on ribosome occupancy, while perturbing mRNA transcription leaves ribosome occupancy largely intact. Isoform-selective ReLiC screens capture differential regulation of intron retention and exon skipping by SF3b complex subunits.

We show that cells exposed to a low dose of therapy adapt to become resistant to a high dose, demonstrating that resistance was not purely selective. The application of therapy itself results in the encoding of transient gene expression into cellular memory and that this encoding occurs for both transiently induced and probabilistically arising expression. Chromatin accessibility showed concomitant persistence. A two-color AP-1 reporter system showed that these memories are encoded in cis, constituting an example of activating cis epigenetics. Our findings establish the formation and maintenance of cellular memories as a critical aspect of gene regulation during the development of therapy resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

Therefore, therapeutic interventions proficient in reducing A{beta}-42-induced toxicity in AD are of great interest. One promising approach is to use extracellular vesicles from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells (hiPSC-NSC-EVs) because they carry multiple therapeutic miRNAs and proteins capable of protecting neurons against A{beta}-42-induced pathological changes. Therefore, this in vitro study investigated the proficiency of hiPSC-NSC-EVs to protect human neurons derived from two distinct hiPSC lines from A{beta}-42o-induced neurodegeneration.

MethodsWe isolated hiPSC-NSC-EVs using chromatographic methods and characterized their size, ultrastructure, expression of EV-specific markers and proficiency in getting incorporated into mature human neurons. Next, mature human neurons differentiated from two different hiPSC lines were exposed to 1 {micro}M A{beta}-42 oligomers (A{beta}-42o) alone or with varying concentrations of hiPSC-NSC-EVs. The protective effects of hiPSC-NSC-EVs against A{beta}-42o-induced neurodegeneration, increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy, and tau phosphorylation were ascertained using multiple measures and one-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons post hoc tests.

ResultsSignificant neurodegeneration was observed when human neurons were exposed to A{beta}-42o alone. Notably, neurodegeneration was associated with elevated levels of oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyls (PCs), increased expression of proapoptotic Bax and Bad genes and proteins, reduced expression of the antiapoptotic gene and protein Bcl-2, increased expression of genes encoding mitochondrial complex proteins, decreased expression of autophagy-related proteins Beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B, and increased phosphorylation of tau. However, the addition of an optimal dose of hiPSC-NSC-EVs (6 x 109 EVs) to human neuronal cultures exposed to A{beta}-42o significantly reduced the extent of neurodegeneration, along with diminished levels of MDA and PCs, normalized expressions of Bax, Bad, and Bcl-2, and genes linked to mitochondrial complex proteins, and reduced tau phosphorylation.

ConclusionsThe findings demonstrate that an optimal dose of hiPSC-NSC-EVs could significantly decrease the degeneration of human neurons induced by A{beta}-42o. The results also support further research into the effectiveness of hiPSC-NSC-EVs in AD, particularly their proficiency in preserving neurons and slowing disease progression.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

Despite its importance, the process of aging remains poorly understood. Epigenetic dysregulation has been proposed as a key driver of the aging process. Modifications in transcriptional networks and chromatin structure might be central to age-related functional decline. A prevalent feature described during aging is the overall reduction in heterochromatin, specifically marked by the loss of repressive histone modification, Histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3). However, the role of H3K9me3 in aging, especially in mammals, remains unclear. Here we show using a novel mouse strain, (TKOc), carrying a triple knockout of three methyltransferases responsible for H3K9me3 deposition, that the inducible loss of H3K9me3 in adulthood results in premature aging. TKOc mice exhibit reduced lifespan, lower body weight, increased frailty index, multi-organ degeneration, transcriptional changes with significant upregulation of transposable elements, and accelerated epigenetic age. Our data strongly supports the concept that the loss of epigenetic information directly drives the aging process. These findings reveal the importance of epigenetic regulation in aging and suggest that interventions targeting epigenetic modifications could potentially slow down or reverse age-related decline. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the process of aging will be crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies that can delay the onset of age-associated diseases and preserve human health at old age specially in rapidly aging societies.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

While strains responsible for cholera have been extensively studied over the past century, less is known about their environmental counterparts, despite their contributions to the species' pangenome. This study analyzed the genome compositions of 46 V. cholerae strains, encompassing both pandemic and non-pandemic, toxigenic, and environmental variants, to explore the diversity of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and bacterial defense systems. Our findings include both conserved and novel MGEs across the strains, pointing to shared evolutionary pathways and ecological niches. The defensome analysis revealed a wide array of antiviral mechanisms, extending well beyond the traditional CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification systems. This underscores the dynamic arms race between V. cholerae and MGEs and/or bacteriophages and suggests that non-pandemic strains may act as reservoirs for emerging defense strategies. Moreover, the study showed that MGEs are integrated into genomic hotspots, which may serve as critical platforms for the exchange of defense systems, thereby enhancing V. cholerae's adaptive capabilities against phage attacks and invading MGEs. Overall, this research offers foundational insights into V. cholerae's genetic complexity and adaptive strategies, with implications for understanding the differences between environmental strains and their pandemic relatives, and the potential evolutionary paths that led to the emergence of pandemic strains.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

DNA language models (LMs) implicitly capture functional elements and their organization from genomic sequences alone by modeling probabilities of each nucleotide given its sequence context. However, using DNA LMs for discovering functional genomic elements has been challenging due to the lack of interpretable methods. Here, we introduce nucleotide dependencies which quantify how nucleotide substitutions at one genomic position affect the probabilities of nucleotides at other positions. We generated genome-wide maps of pairwise nucleotide dependencies within kilobase ranges for animal, fungal, and bacterial species. We show that nucleotide dependencies indicate deleteriousness of human genetic variants more effectively than sequence alignment and DNA LM reconstruction. Regulatory elements appear as dense blocks in dependency maps, enabling the systematic identification of transcription factor binding sites as accurately as models trained on experimental binding data. Nucleotide dependencies also highlight bases in contact within RNA structures, including pseudoknots and tertiary structure contacts, with remarkable accuracy. This led to the discovery of four novel, experimentally validated RNA structures in Escherichia coli. Finally, using dependency maps, we reveal critical limitations of several DNA LM architectures and training sequence selection strategies by benchmarking and visual diagnosis. Altogether, nucleotide dependency analysis opens a new avenue for discovering and studying functional elements and their interactions in genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574071

Through advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), homotypic aggregates of the C-Terminal domain of TMEM106B (TMEM CT) were discovered as a previously unidentified cytosolic proteinopathy in the brains of FTLD, Alzheimers disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients. While it remains unknown what role TMEM CT aggregation plays in neuronal loss, its presence across a range of aging related dementia disorders indicates involvement in multi-proteinopathy driven neurodegeneration. To determine the TMEM CT aggregation propensity and neurodegenerative potential, we characterized a novel transgenic C. elegans model expressing the human TMEM CT fragment constituting the fibrillar core seen in FTLD cases. We found that pan-neuronal expression of human TMEM CT in C. elegans causes neuronal dysfunction as evidenced by behavioral analysis. Cytosolic aggregation of TMEM CT proteins accompanied the behavioral dysfunction driving neurodegeneration, as illustrated by loss of GABAergic neurons. To investigate the molecular mechanisms driving TMEM106B proteinopathy, we explored the impact of PGRN loss on the neurodegenerative effect of TMEM CT expression. To this end, we generated TMEM CT expressing C. elegans with loss of pgrn-1, the C. elegans ortholog of human PGRN. Neither full nor partial loss of pgrn-1 altered the motor phenotype of our TMEM CT model suggesting TMEM CT aggregation occurs downstream of PGRN loss of function. We also tested the ability of genetic suppressors of tauopathy to rescue TMEM CT pathology. We found that genetic knockout of spop-1, sut-2, and sut-6 resulted in weak to no rescue of proteinopathy phenotypes, indicating that the mechanistic drivers of TMEM106B proteinopathy may be distinct from tauopathy. Taken together, our data demonstrate that TMEM CT aggregation can kill neurons. Further, expression of TMEM CT in C. elegans neurons provides a useful model for the functional characterization of TMEM106B proteinopathy in neurodegenerative disease.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

Here, we describe SAVANA, a computationally efficient algorithm designed for the joint analysis of somatic SVs, SCNAs, tumour purity and ploidy using long-read sequencing data. SAVANA relies on machine learning to distinguish true somatic SVs from artefacts and provide prediction errors for individual SVs. Using high-depth Illumina and nanopore whole-genome sequencing data for 99 human tumours and matched normal samples, we establish best practices for benchmarking SV detection algorithms across the entire genome in an unbiased and data-driven manner using simulated and sequencing replicates of tumour and matched normal samples. SAVANA shows significantly higher sensitivity, and 9- and 59-times higher specificity than the second and third-best performing algorithms, yielding orders of magnitude fewer false positives in comparison to existing long-read sequencing tools across various clonality levels, genomic regions, SV types and SV sizes. In addition, SAVANA harnesses long-range phasing information to detect somatic SVs and SCNAs at single-haplotype resolution. SVs reported by SAVANA are highly consistent with those detected using short-read sequencing, including complex events causing oncogene amplification and tumour suppressor gene inactivation. In summary, SAVANA enables the application of long-read sequencing to detect SVs and SCNAs reliably in clinical samples.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

Modeling the brain as a network of interconnected brain regions, allowed us to capitalize on network science tools and identify these segregated systems (modules, or communities) by optimizing the weights of pairwise connections within them. However, just knowing how strongly two brain areas are connected does not paint the whole picture. Brain dynamics is also engendered by interactions involving more areas at the same time, namely, higher-order interactions. In this paper, we propose a community detection algorithm that accounts for higher-order interactions and finds modules of brain regions whose brain activity is maximally redundant. Compared to modules identified with methods based on bivariate interactions, our redundancy-dominated modules are more symmetrical between the hemispheres, they overlap with canonical systems at the level of the sensory cortex, but describe a new organization of the transmodal cortex. By detecting redundant modules across spatial scales, we identified a sweet spot of maximum balance between segregation and integration of information as that scale where redundancy within modules and synergy between modules peaked. Moreover, we defined a local index that distinguishes brain regions in segregators and integrators based on how much they participate in the redundancy of their modules versus the redundancy of the whole system. Finally, we applied the algorithm to a lifespan dataset and tracked how redundant subsystems change across time. The results of this paper serve as educated guesses on how the brain organizes itself into modules accounting for higher-order interactions of its fundamental units, and pave the way for further investigation that could link them to cognition, behavior, and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

Electron microscopy provides the necessary resolution, yet - as electrons penetrate samples for only a few 100s of nm - requires physical sectioning or ablation. This provides a significant challenge when aiming to scale up anatomical investigations to entire organs such as mammalian brains. X-ray nanotomography has been suggested as a promising alternative for ultrastructural 3d imaging without physical sectioning(1-15). Leveraging the high brilliance of 4th generation synchrotron X-ray sources, it has the theoretical potential to non-destructively acquire mm^3-sized samples at ultrastructural resolution within a few days(16). A fundamental barrier to the practical implementation has been that, when irradiated with high-intensity X-rays, biological samples deform and ultimately disintegrate, prohibiting reaching sufficient resolution. Here, we demonstrate that X-ray ptychography(17), a coherent diffractive X-ray imaging technique, can faithfully acquire 3-dimensional images of metal-stained mouse neuronal tissue. Achieving high imaging quality requires minimization of the radiation damage to the sample, which we achieve by imaging at cryogenic temperatures and using tailored non-rigid tomographic reconstruction algorithms(18). Adapting an epoxy resin developed for the nuclear and aerospace industry, we demonstrate radiation resistance to X-ray doses exceeding 10^10 Gy. Sub-40 nm isotropic resolution makes it possible to densely resolve axon bundles, boutons, dendrites and reliably identify synapses without physical sectioning. Moreover, the tissue volumes exposed to X-rays can subsequently be imaged in 3D using high-resolution focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM)(19, 20) showing intact ultrastructure and demonstrating that metal-stained neuronal tissue can be highly radiation-stable. Thus, our work removes the fundamental limitations to employing X-ray tomography for high-resolution tissue imaging. Ongoing improvements in synchrotron, X-ray and detector physics(21), as well as further optimization of sample preparation and staining procedures(22-27), could lead to substantial improvements in acquisition speed(16), whilst complementary X-ray techniques such as laminography(28-31) and nano-holotomography(2, 32) could allow for non-destructive X-ray imaging of synapses and neural circuits in volumes of increasing size.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

This is the case of nosocomial bacteria under antibiotic therapy because antibiotics are of ancient natural origin and resistances to them have previously emerged in environmental bacteria. In such cases, the rate of adaptation crucially depends on the acquisition of genes by horizontal transfer of plasmids from distantly related bacteria in different biomes. We hypothesized that such processes should be driven by plasmids amongst the most mobile and evolvable. We confirmed these predictions by showing that plasmid families encoding antibiotic resistance are very mobile, have broad host ranges, while showing higher rates of homologous recombination and faster turnover of gene repertoires than the other plasmids. These characteristics remain outstanding when we remove resistance plasmids from our dataset, suggesting that antibiotic resistance genes are preferentially acquired and carried by plasmid families that are intrinsically very mobile and plastic. Evolvability and mobility facilitate the transfer of antibiotic resistance, and presumably of other phenotypes, across distant taxonomic groups and biomes. Hence, plasmid families, and possibly those of other mobile genetic elements, have differentiated and predictable roles in the spread of novel traits.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

As the zebrafish embryo grows into a larva, to improve its heart function, the embryonic myocardial wall transforms into an intricate 3D architecture, composed of an outer compact layer enveloping an inner layer of multicellular trabecular ridges. How these tissue layers acquire their characteristic form suited for their function remains an open question. Here, we find that multiscale mechanochemical coupling and an emergent tissue-scale morphological transition steer functional maturation of the developing zebrafish heart. Single-celled trabecular seeds recruit outer compact layer cells to mature into clonally heterogenous multicellular ridges, thereby amplifying cardiac contractile forces. In response, remaining compact layer cells are stretched, which impedes their further recruitment, thereby constraining trabecular ridge density. Concomitantly, Notch-dependent actomyosin dampening triggers a sharp transition in myocardial tissue area, activating rapid organ growth that expands blood filling capacity. Thus, multiscale self-organizing interactions optimize heart size and contractile efficiency to support embryonic life.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

This small, translucent organ has an outer cortex teeming with immune cells, an inner medulla with a mesh-like network of fibroblastic reticular cells along which immune cells migrate, and a network of lymphatic vessels draining to a large adjacent lymph sac. Noninvasive high-resolution imaging of transgenically marked immune cells can be carried out in the lobes of living animals, and the ALO is readily accessible to external treatment.

Here, we collected radiotherapy phenotype and expression data from 32 TCGA cancer datasets and performed overall survival analysis for 32 cancer types. Additionally, we conducted a signalling pathway enrichment analysis to identify key pathways involved in radiotherapy resistance and sensitivity. Our findings show that radiotherapy improves survival outcomes in certain cancer types, such as GBM, while worsening outcomes in others, such as LGG. Next, we focused on exploring the differences in radiotherapy outcomes between GBM and LGG, focusing on the molecular mechanisms contributing to these variations. The differential regulation of pathways related to programmed cell death, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, chromosome condensation, antiviral responses, and interferon signaling between GBM and LGG patients may elucidate the underlying reasons for these observed differences. These insights underscore the importance of personalized treatment approaches and the need for further research to improve radiotherapy outcomes in cancer patients.","NA","medrxiv",1722204574072

Employing molecular rulers that stabilize ER-mitochondrial distances at 5 nm resolution, and using genetically-encoded Ca2+ indicators targeting the ER lumen and the sub-mitochondrial compartments, we now show that a distance of ~20 nm is optimal for Ca2+ transfer and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism due to enrichment of IP3R at MERCS. In human iPSC-derived astrocytes from PD patients, 20 nm MERCS were specifically reduced which correlated with a reduction of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Our work determines with precision the optimal distance for Ca2+ flux between ER and mitochondria and suggests a new paradigm for fine control over mitochondrial function.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

However, many parameters are challenging to estimate from real-world data, and rely on human challenge studies or mass community testing. During Winter 2023/2024, a community cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted across households in England and Scotland. From this survey, questionnaire data and follow-up testing protocols provided valuable data into multiple epidemiological parameters: namely, the duration of positivity, test sensitivity, and the incubation period. Here, Bayesian statistical modelling methods are developed and applied to estimate the underlying parameters. The duration of LFD positivity is found to increase with increasing age, with a mean of 8.55 days (95% CrI: 7.65 days, 9.44 days) in the youngest age group compared to 10.27 days (95% CrI: 9.85 days, 10.71 days) in the oldest age group. Similarly, test sensitivity, as a function of time since symptom onset, decays fastest in the youngest age group, reaching a minimum sensitivity of 0.26 (95% CrI: 0.16, 0.37) compared to 0.54 (95% CrI: 0.46, 0.6). Such patterns are expected since younger individuals experience less severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are likely to clear the virus faster. Combining the duration of positivity and test sensitivity, we estimate the probability of returning a positive test. Close to symptom onset date, this probability is approximately 95%. However, this rapidly drops off, dropping below 5% after 11.3 days (95% CrI: 9.7 days, 13 days) for the youngest age group and 16.2 days (95% CrI: 15.4 days, 17.1 days) for the oldest age group. For the incubation period, there is no clear pattern by age. Across all age groups, the mean incubation period is 2.52 days (95% CrI: 2.42 days, 2.62 days). This is shorter than the most recent estimates for Omicron BA.5, which is in line with earlier research that found replacing variants had shorter incubation periods.","NA","medrxiv",1722204574072

Because the sexes mix their autosomal genomes each generation, quantifying SDS is not possible using conventional population genetic approaches. Here, we introduce a novel method that exploits subtle sex differences in haplotype frequencies resulting from SDS acting in the current generation. Using data from 300K individuals in the UK Biobank, we estimate the strength of SDS throughout the genome. While only a handful of loci under SDS are individually significant, we uncover polygenic signals of genome-wide SDS for both viability and fecundity. An interesting life-history tradeoff emerges: alleles that increase viability more in one sex increase fecundity more in the other sex. Lastly, we find evidence of SDS on fecundity acting on alleles affecting arm fat-free mass. Taken together, our findings connect the long-standing evidence of SDS acting on human phenotypes with its impact on the genome.

Significance statementSelection often acts differently on females and males, as evidenced by the striking sexual dimorphism found in many taxa. As a result, alleles can have different fitness effects in each sex. Consequences can include higher levels of genetic variation and higher disease burdens in populations. This study introduces a novel method to quantify this sex-differential selection (SDS) and reveals that it acts throughout the human genome. We discovered a life history tradeoff between survival and fecundity in females and males and that SDS on fecundity acts on alleles affecting arm fat-free mass.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

While many neural circuits underlying feeding and parenting behaviors are well characterized6-9, it is unclear how these different circuits interact and adapt during lactation. Here, we characterized the transcriptomic changes in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the mouse hypothalamus in response to lactation and hunger. Furthermore, we showed that heightened appetite in lactating mice was accompanied by increased activity of hunger-promoting agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the ARC. To assess the strength of hunger versus maternal drives, we designed a conflict assay where female mice chose between a food source or a chamber containing pups and nesting material. Although food-deprived lactating mothers prioritized parenting over feeding, hunger reduced the duration and disrupted the sequences of parenting behaviors in both lactating and virgin females. We discovered that ARCAgRP neurons directly inhibit bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS3) neurons in the MPOA, a population that governs both parenting and satiety. Selective activation of this ARCAgRP to MPOABRS3 circuit shifted behaviors from parenting to food-seeking. Thus, hypothalamic networks are modulated by physiological states and work antagonistically during the prioritization of competing motivated behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

We sampled 190 individuals including juvenile and mature trees belonging to 18 temperate broadleaved tree species and 9 genera. We measured guard cell length (GCL), stomatal density (SD), specific leaf area (SLA), gas-exchange, iWUE and leaf {delta}13C as a proxy for long-term WUE. Leaf {delta}13C correlated positively with iWUE for both juvenile and mature trees. Across species, GCL showed a negative and SD a positive effect on iWUE and leaf {delta}13C of both juvenile and mature trees. Within species, however, only GCL was significantly associated with iWUE and leaf {delta}13C. Pioneer species (Populus, Prunus, Betula) showed a significantly lower leaf {delta}13C than climax forest species (Fagus, Quercus, Tilia), but the differentiation was not clear for iWUE.

Little is known about external factors regulating this process. Here, we identified environmental mechanics as an important regulator of neuronal maturation, and a molecular pathway linking tissue stiffness to this process. Using patch clamp electrophysiology, calcium imaging and immunofluorescence, we found that neurons cultured on stiffer substrates showed a delay in voltage-gated ion channel activity, spontaneous and evoked action potentials, and synapse formation. RNA sequencing and CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown strategies revealed that the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 supresses transthyretin (TTR) expression on stiffer substrates, slowing down synaptic receptor expression and consequently electrical maturation. Stiffening of brain tissue in Xenopus laevis embryos also resulted in a significant delay of synaptic activity in vivo. Our data indicate that environmental stiffness represents a fundamental regulator of neuronal maturation, which is important for the development of normal circuitry in the brain, and potentially for neurodevelopmental disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

We conducted a comprehensive investigation into the evolutionary genomics of C. graminicola using a collection of 212 isolates from 17 countries. Genomic analyses supported the existence of three geographically isolated genetic lineages, with a significant pattern of isolation by distance. We identified two distinct gene flow patterns, driven by short and long-distance dispersion, likely resulting from the natural spread of the pathogen and the exchange of contaminated seeds. We present evidence of genetic introgression between lineages, suggesting a long history of recombination. We identified significant recombination events coalescing at distinct points in time, with the North American lineage displaying evidence of most ancient recombination. Demographic modeling indicated that North America is an intermediate between Brazil, Europe and an ancestral, unsampled source population, hypothesized to be Mesoamerican. Our analyses revealed that the global genomic structure of C. graminicola is shaped by geographic differentiation driven by long-distance migration and a long history of recombination and introgression. We show historical relationships among these lineages, identifying a potential route for fungal spread, with the North American population emerging ancestrally, followed sequentially by the Brazilian and European populations. Our research indicates that the European lineage is more virulent, which has implications for the potential emergence of new outbreaks of maize anthracnose in Europe.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

The initial theme of safety and security permeated the childrens narratives and overwhelmingly, the children spoke of the need for them to be alert to who in their lives is a safe person and who is not. They were also highly attuned to whether specific places are safe for them, as past experiences appear to have taught them that their safety in everyday places cannot be assumed. Teachers, health and social care professionals, and neurotypical peers were frequently singled out as unsafe people and school as an unsafe place, whilst parents, home, and autistic peers were often referred to as safe. This distinction was also evident in the statistical analysis of the quantitative data, whereby autistic children were significantly more likely to report that it is okay for them to be autistic at home, relative to when they are at school or with their friends/peers. Judging a person as safe was closely linked to that persons understanding of the child and of their autistic experiences, and understanding was important in establishing trust. When trust was established, it appeared possible for trusted people to facilitate a sense of safety for the children even within otherwise unsafe places. A sense of belonging within autistic/neurodivergent communities was positively linked to the core theme of safety and security and to having a positive autistic identity, whilst masking and sensory distress were linked to feeling unsafe and insecure. These first-hand accounts provide valuable insights into autistic childrens lives and demand that we urgently explore how places outside of the family home (including places of education) can be transformed into safe spaces for autistic children.","NA","medrxiv",1722204574072

However, indirect protection from infection-acquired immunity and its comparative strength and durability to vaccine-derived indirect protection in the current epidemiologic context of high levels of vaccination, prior infection, and novel variants are not well characterized. Here, we show that both infection-acquired and vaccine-derived immunity independently yield indirect protection to close social contacts with key differences in their strength and waning. Analyzing anonymized data from a system-wide SARS-CoV-2 surveillance program of 177,319 residents across 35 California state prisons from December 2021 to December 2022, we find that vaccine-derived indirect protection against Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection is strongest within three months post-vaccination [30% (95% confidence interval: 20-38%)], whereas infection-acquired immunity provides 39% (25-51%) indirect protection to roommates for 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, with moderate indirect protection persisting for over one year. Variant-targeted vaccines (bivalent formulation including Omicron subvariants BA.4/BA.5) confer strong indirect protection for at least three months [51% (18-70%)]. These results have important implications for understanding the long-term transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and can guide vaccine policy and public health measures, especially in high-risk environments such as prisons.","NA","medrxiv",1722204574072

In primates, this adaptive response is achieved by cerebellar modulation of motor cortical signals, but the nature and timing of this process are unknown. Specifically, cortical correlates of adaptation are encoded already in the pre-movement motor plan, but these early cortical signals could be driven by a cerebellar-to-cortical information flow or evolve independently through intracortical mechanisms. To address this question, we trained monkeys to reach against a viscous force field while blocking cerebellar outflow. During the force field trials, the cerebellar block led to impaired adaptation and a compensatory, re-aiming-like shift in motor cortical preparatory activity. In the null-field conditions, the cerebellar block altered neural preparatory activity by increasing task-representation dimensionality and impeding generalization. A computational model indicated that low-dimensional (cerebellar-like) feedback is sufficient to replicate these findings. We conclude that cerebellar signals carry task structure information that constrains the dimensionality of the cortical preparatory manifold and promotes generalization. In the absence of these signals, cortical mechanisms are harnessed to partially restore adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

This revealed that an alternatively-spliced isoform of lncRNA Colorectal Neoplasia Differentially Expressed containing an ultraconserved element (UCE), referred to as CRNDEUCE, is required for RCC cell proliferation. CRNDEUCE localizes to the nucleolus and promotes 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis. The UCE of CRNDE functions as an unprocessed C/D box snoRNA that directly interacts with ribosomal RNA precursors. This facilitates delivery of eIF6, a key 60S biogenesis factor, which binds to CRNDEUCE through a sequence element adjacent to the UCE.

To improve disease resistance, its crucial to accurately annotate nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs), which are key components of plant immune systems. This study focuses on refining the NLR repertoire (NLRome) of the Westar cultivar using Resistance gene enrichment sequencing (RenSeq). Initially, only 345 NLR genes were identified in the Westar genome annotation, a figure significantly lower than other canola cultivars. By employing RenSeq, we expanded the annotated NLR genes to 715, including 287 full NLRs and 428 partial NLRs, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of the NLR diversity in this cultivar. Our findings reveal crucial genomic regions with previously misannotated NLR genes and identify key integrated domains that may contribute to enhanced disease resistance. This refined NLRome not only advances the fundamental understanding of B. napus genetics but also offers valuable insights for breeding programs and biotechnological applications aimed at improving crop resilience.

The PAXT connection is an adaptor that recruits the exosome to polyadenylated RNAs in the nucleus, especially transcripts polyadenylated at intronic poly(A) sites. Here we show that PAXT-mediated RNA degradation is induced by the combination of a 5' splice site and a poly(A) junction, but not by either sequence alone. These sequences are bound by U1 snRNP and cleavage/polyadenylation factors, which in turn cooperatively recruit PAXT. As the 5' splice site-poly(A) junction combination is typically not found on correctly processed full-length RNAs, we propose that it functions as a ""nuclear RNA degradation code"" (NRDC). Importantly, disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms that create novel 5' splice sites in 3' untranslated regions can induce aberrant mRNA degradation via the NRDC mechanism. Together our study identified the first NRDC, revealed its recognition mechanism, and characterized its role in human diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

Isolated microglia were sorted based on reporter expression and their transcriptomic profiles acquired in both wildtype and APP transgenic animals, allowing us to disentangle TREM2 versus pathology-specific effects. Bulk RNA-sequencing highlighted TREM2 level-dependent changes in major immunometabolic pathways, with enrichment of genes in oxidative phosphorylation and cholesterol metabolism in microglia with increased TREM2 expression. To confirm these findings, we next analysed uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and examined metabolomic and lipidomic profiles. Again, independent of A{beta} pathology, TREM2 expression correlated with uptake of FDG as well as increased cellular redox, energetics, and cholesterol homeostasis.

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

How mammalian cells, which evolved to optimally function within a narrow range of temperatures, adapt to this profound decrease in temperature remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted the first genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen in cells derived from Syrian hamster, a facultative hibernator, as well as human cells to investigate the genetic basis of cold tolerance in a hibernator and a non-hibernator in an unbiased manner. Both screens independently revealed glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a selenium-containing enzyme, and associated proteins as critical for cold tolerance. We utilized genetic and pharmacological approaches to demonstrate that GPX4 is active in the cold and its catalytic activity is required for cold tolerance. Furthermore, we show that the role of GPX4 as a suppressor of cold-induced cell death extends across hibernating species, including 13-lined ground squirrels and greater horseshoe bats, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of this mechanism of cold tolerance.

This unprecedented dataset provides the first comprehensive view of the energy landscape and the first large-scale measurement of energetic couplings for a protein transition state.

Here, we recorded thousands of neurons in superficial MEC and dorsal CA1 as mice learned to associate two pairs of rewarded locations. We found that during immobility, the MEC neural population frequently represented positions far from the animals location, which we defined as  non-local coding. Cells with spatial firing fields at remote locations drove non-local coding, even as cells representing the current position remained active. While MEC non-local coding has been reported during sharp-wave ripples in downstream CA16, we observed non-local coding more often outside of ripples. In fact, CA1 activity was less coordinated with MEC during non-local coding. We further observed that non-local coding was pertinent to the task, as MEC preferentially represented remote task-relevant locations at appropriate times, while rarely representing task-irrelevant locations. Together, this work raises the possibility that MEC non-local coding could strengthen associations between locations independently from CA1.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

Memory processing is critically dependent on adult neurogenesis, a unique form of plasticity in the hippocampus. However, it remains unknown if cognitive aging influences the integration and role of adult-born hippocampal neurons (ABNs) generated early in adult life. Here, we investigated the role of long-lived ABNs in rats characterized as either resilient or vulnerable to cognitive aging using a peudo-longitudinal approach. Our findings reveal that long-lived ABNs support successful cognitive aging by preserving their synaptic inputs onto the proximal segments of their dendrites, and that these proximal synaptic sites also demonstrate a maintenance of their mitochondrial homeostasis. Furthermore, by-passing the reduced inputs of ABNs in vulnerable rats through direct optogenetic stimulation successfully improved their memory abilities. Overall, our data indicate that the maintenance of long-lived ABNs integration within the neuronal network is essential for successful cognitive aging, highlighting their potential as a therapeutic target for restoring cognitive functions in old age.

We identified the lingual regions in lobule VI of the vermis and recorded from hundreds of Purkinje cells (P-cells), each in sessions where the subject produced thousands of licks. Most movements aimed for one of the small tubes, while other movements groomed the mouth area. To quantify contributions of a P-cell to control of the tongue, we relied on the fact that in a small fraction of the licks, the input from the inferior olive produced a complex spike (CS), which then briefly but completely silenced the P-cell. When the movements were targeting a tube, the CS rates increased during protraction for both ipsilateral and contralateral targets, thus identifying the preferred axis of motion in the olivary input, termed CS-on. However, for grooming movements this modulation was absent. We compared the tongue's trajectory in the targeted movement that had experienced the CS with temporally adjacent targeted licks that had not. When the SS suppression occurred during protraction, the tongue exhibited hypermetria, and when the suppression took place during retraction, the tongue exhibited slowing. These effects amplified when two P-cells were simultaneously suppressed. Therefore, CS-induced suppression of P-cells in the lingual vermis disrupted the forces that would normally decelerate the tongue as it approached the target, demonstrating a specialization in stopping the movement. Because the CS-on direction tended to align with the direction of downstream forces produced during P-cell suppression, this suggests that for targeted licks, the olivary input defined an axis of control for the P-cells.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

Both wastewater (WW) and individual whole genome sequencing (WGS) are used to assess viral variant diversity and spread. However, their relative performance and the information provided by each approach have not been sufficiently quantified. Therefore, we conducted a comparative evaluation using extensive individual and wastewater longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 WGS datasets in Northern Ireland (NI).

MethodsWGS of SARS-CoV-2 was performed on >4k WW samples and >23k individuals across NI from 14th November 2021 to 11th March 2023. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was amplified using the ARTIC nCov-2019 protocol and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Wastewater data were analysed using Freyja to determine variant compositions, which were compared to individual data through time series and correlation analyses. Inter-programme agreements were evaluated by mean absolute error (MAE) calculations. WW treatment plant (WWTP) performances were ranked by mean MAE. Volatile periods were identified using numerical derivative analyses. Geospatial spreading patterns were determined by horizontal curve shifting.

FindingsStrong concordance was observed between wastewater and individual variant compositions and distributions, influenced by sequencing rate and variant diversity. Overall variant compositions derived from individual sequences and each WWTP were regionally clustered rather than dominated by local population size. Both individual and WW sequencing detected common nucleotide substitutions across many variants and complementary additional substitutions. Conserved spreading patterns were identified using both approaches.

InterpretationBoth individual and wastewater WGS effectively monitor SARS-CoV-2 variant dynamics. Combining these approaches enhances confidence in predicting the composition and spread of major variants, particularly with higher sequencing rates. Each method detects unique mutations, and their integration improves overall genome surveillance.

FundingIndividual sequencing was funded via the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust (Department of Health for Northern Ireland) and the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium, which was supported by the Medical Research Council (MRC), UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), and the Wellcome Sanger Institute.

Whether existing scores provide similar individual-level assessments of disease liability is a critical consideration for clinical implementation that remains uncharacterized. Objective: Characterize the reliability of CAD PRSs that perform equivalently at the population level at predicting individual-level risk. Design: Cross-sectional Study. Setting: All of Us Research Program (AOU), Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB), and UCLA ATLAS Precision Health Biobank. Participants: Volunteers of diverse genetic backgrounds enrolled in AOU, PMBB, and UCLA with available electronic health record and genotyping data. Exposures: Polygenic risk for CAD from previously published PRSs and new PRSs developed separately from the testing cohorts. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sets of CAD PRSs that perform population prediction equivalently were identified by comparing calibration and discrimination (Brier score and AUROC) of generalized linear models of prevalent CAD using Bayesian analysis of variance. Among equivalently performing scores, individual-level agreement between risk estimates was tested with intraclass correlation (ICC) and Light's Kappa, measures of inter-rater reliability. Results: 50 PRSs were calculated for 171,095 AOU participants. When included in a model of prevalent CAD, 48 scores had practically equivalent Brier scores and AUROCs (region of practical equivalence = 0.02). Across these scores, 84% of participants had at least one score in both the top and bottom risk quintile. Continuous agreement of individual risk predictions from the 48 scores was poor, with an ICC of 0.351 (95% CI; 0.349, 0.352). Agreement between two statistically equivalent scores was moderate, with an ICC of 0.649 (95% CI; 0.646, 0.652). Light's Kappa, used to evaluate consistency of assignment to high-risk thresholds, did not exceed 0.56 (interpreted as 'fair') across statistically and practically equivalent scores. Repeating the analysis among 41,193 PMBB and 50,748 UCLA participants yielded different sets of statistically and practically equivalent scores which also lacked strong individual agreement. Conclusions and Relevance: Across three diverse biobanks, CAD PRSs that performed equivalently at the population level produced unreliable individual risk estimates. Approaches to clinical implementation of CAD PRSs must consider the potential for discordant individual risk estimates from otherwise indistinguishable scores.","NA","medrxiv",1722204574072

Critical to this function is the ability to transition between states of proliferation and quiescence. This balancing act is disrupted with age, leading to eroded regenerative capacity. Notwistanding, mechanisms by which the regenerating niche directs MuSCs return to the dormant state are largely unknown. Since single-cell RNAseq methods exclude the analysis of multinucleated cells, we generated single-nuclei RNAseq datasets of regenerating muscle to capture the full breadth of myogenic progression. With this, we uncovered new transition states between differentiating myocytes and syncytial multinucleated cells. Using cell communication inference tools, we highlighted receptor-ligand interactions between MuSCs and fusing nuclei. We leveraged a bespoke biomimetic 3D niche that induces MuSC quiescence, to filter the predicted interactions using a Cas9-based functional genomics approach. We found the proteoglycan Perlecan (Hspg2) promotes MuSC re-quiescence. Hspg2 silencing in vivo, during muscle regeneration, induced an aging-like phenotype and perturbed MuSC re-quiescence. Notably, the temporal profile and overall levels of Perlecan were altered with age. Exogenous supplementation with Endorepellin (truncated Perlecan) rescued MuSC decline following aged muscle regeneration, offering a new therapeutic target. Thus, coupling in silico predictions with a 3D in vitro assay followed by in vivo investigations revealed a previously inaccessible window of biology; that spatiotemporal coordination of MuSC re-quiescence is directed by fusing myonuclei.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

Moreover, detection of the complete set of tRNA modifications by nanopore sequencing remains challenging. Here we show that recent updates to nanopore direct RNA sequencing chemistry (RNA004) combined with our own optimizations to tRNA sequencing protocols and analysis workflows enable high throughput coverage of tRNA molecules and characterization of nanopore signals produced by 43 distinct RNA modifications. We share best practices and protocols for nanopore sequencing of tRNA and further report successful detection of low abundance mitochondrial and viral tRNAs, providing proof of concept for use of nanopore sequencing to study tRNA populations in the context of infection and organelle biology.

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Thereafter, JN.1 subvariants, such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1), KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), and KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which convergently acquired a deletion of Serine at the 31st position in S (S:S31del) in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We recently reported the virological features of JN.1 subvariants including KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3.2,3 Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.3.1.1. First, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3.1.1 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model4 based on genome surveillance data from Spain, the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, where this variant has spread as of June 2024. In Spain, the Re of KP.3.1.1 is over 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and even higher than those of KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein show higher Re for KP.3.1.1. However, it must be noted there is the possibility of overestimation in these countries due to more limited KP.3.1.1 sequence numbers. These results suggest that KP.3.1.1 will spread worldwide along with other JN.1 sublineages. We then assessed the virological properties of KP.3.1.1 using pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus of KP.3.1.1 had significantly higher infectivity than that of KP.3. Neutralization of KP.3.1.1 was tested using i) convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or EG.5, ii) convalescent sera after the infection with HK.3 or JN.1, and iii) sera after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.3.1.1 was significantly lower than KP.3 (1.4-1.6-fold) in all four groups of convalescent sera tested. KP.3.1.1 also showed a 1.3-fold lower NT50 against XBB.1.5 vaccine sera than KP.3. Moreover, KP.3.1.1 showed stronger resistance with a 1.3-fold lower NT50 with statistical significances to the convalescent sera infected with EG.5 and HK.3 than KP.2.3. Altogether, KP.3.1.1 exhibited a higher Re, higher pseudovirus infectivity, and higher neutralization evasion than KP.3. These results align with our recent report that the JN.1 subvariants with S:S31del (e.g., KP.2.3 and LB.1) exhibited enhanced Re and immune evasion compared to the other JN.1 subvariants without S:S31del (e.g., JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3), highlighting the evolutionary significance of S:S31del in the JN.1 lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

This is a powerful approach since it is a multi-region measurement, but because the imaging is done post-mortem, each animal only provides one set of counts. Experiments are expensive and since cells are counted by imaging and aligning a large number of brain sections, they are time-intensive. The resulting datasets tend to be under-sampled with fewer animals than brain regions. As a consequence, these data are a challenge for traditional statistical approaches. We demonstrate that hierarchical Bayesian methods are well suited to these data by presenting a  standard partially-pooled Bayesian model for multi-region cell-count data and applying it to two example datasets. For both datasets the Bayesian model outperformed standard parallel t-tests. Overall, the Bayesian approachs ability to capture nested data and its rigorous handling of uncertainty in under-sampled data can substantially improve inference for cell-count data.

Significance StatementCell-count data is important for studying neuronal activation and gene expression relating to the complex processes in the brain. However, the difficulty and expense of data collection means that such datasets often have small sample sizes. Many routine analyses are not well-suited, especially if there is high variability among animals and surprising outliers in the data. Here we describe a multilevel, mixed effects Bayesian model for these data and show that the Bayesian approach improves inferences compared to the usual approach for two different cell-count datasets with different data characteristics.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

Recently, Holst et al. demonstrated with their program Helixer that the accuracy of ab initio eukaryotic gene prediction can be improved by combining deep learning layers with a separate HMM postprocessor.

ResultsWe present Tiberius, a novel deep learning-based ab initio gene predictor that end-to-end integrates convolutional and long short-term memory layers with a differentiable HMM layer. Tiberius uses a custom gene prediction loss and was trained for prediction in mammalian genomes and evaluated on human and two other genomes. It significantly outperforms existing ab initio methods, achieving F1-scores of 62% at gene level for the human genome, compared to 21% for the next best ab initio method. In de novo mode, Tiberius predicts the exon-intron structure of two out of three human genes without error. Remarkably, even Tiberiuss ab initio accuracy matches that of BRAKER3, which uses RNA-seq data and a protein database. Tiberiuss highly parallelized model is the fastest state-of-the-art gene prediction method, processing the human genome in under 2 hours.

In addition to impacting poultry, these HPAI viruses caused mortality events in wild bird species and wild mammals. Transmission in multiple host species raises the concern for mammalian adaptation. On March 25, 2024, HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed in a dairy cow in Texas in response to a multi-state investigation into milk production losses. Over one hundred positive herds were rapidly identified in Texas and eleven other U.S. states. The case description included reduced feed intake and rumen motility in lactating cows, decreased milk production, and thick yellow milk. The diagnostic investigation revealed detections of viral RNA in milk and mammary tissue with alveolar epithelial degeneration and necrosis, and positive immunoreactivity of glandular epithelium by immunohistochemistry. A single transmission event, likely from avian species to dairy cattle, followed by limited local transmission preceded the onward lateral transmission of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13. We sought to experimentally reproduce infection with genotype B3.13 in Holstein yearling heifers and lactating cows. The heifers were inoculated by an aerosol respiratory route and the cows by an intramammary route. Clinical disease was mild in the heifers, but infection was confirmed by virus detection, lesions, and seroconversion. Clinical disease in lactating cows included decreased rumen motility, changes to milk appearance, and production losses consistent with field reports of viral mastitis.

Previous studies, including our own research, have shown that specific interneuron subtypes are closely associated with particular pyramidal neuron types, forming stereotyped local inhibitory microcircuits. However, the developmental processes that establish these precise networks are not well understood. Here we show that pyramidal neuron types are instrumental in driving the terminal differentiation and maintaining the survival of specific associated interneuron subtypes. In a wild-type cortex, the relative abundance of different interneuron subtypes aligns precisely with the pyramidal neuron types to which they synaptically target. In Fezf2 mutant cortex, characterized by the absence of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons and an expansion of layer 6 intratelencephalic neurons, we observed a corresponding decrease in associated layer 5b interneurons and an increase in layer 6 subtypes. Interestingly, these shifts in composition are achieved through mechanisms specific to different interneuron types. While SST interneurons adjust their abundance to the change in pyramidal neuron prevalence through the regulation of programmed cell death, parvalbumin interneurons alter their identity. These findings illustrate two key strategies by which the dynamic interplay between pyramidal neurons and interneurons allows local microcircuits to be sculpted precisely. These insights underscore the precise roles of extrinsic signals from pyramidal cells in the establishment of interneuron diversity and their subsequent integration into local cortical microcircuits.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

Of these, the Portuguese man-o-war (Physalia) is uniquely suited to dispersal, sailing the ocean surface with a muscular crest.

We then scored thousands of citizen-science photos and identified four recognizable morphologies linked to these lineages.

SummaryThe open ocean is a vast and highly connected environment. The organisms that live there have a significant capacity for dispersal and few geographic boundaries to separate populations. Of these, the Portuguese man-o-war or bluebottle (genus Physalia) is uniquely suited to long-distance travel, using its gas-filled float and muscular crest to catch the wind and sail the sea surface. Physalia are distributed across the globe, and like many pelagic organisms, have been hypothesized to represent a massive, well-mixed population that extends across ocean basins. We tested this hypothesis by sequencing whole genomes of 133 samples collected from waters of over a dozen countries around the globe. Our results revealed five distinct lineages, with multiple lines of evidence indicating strong reproductive isolation, despite regions of range overlap. We combined these data with an independent dataset of thousands of images of Physalia uploaded to the citizen-science website inaturalist.org, which we scored for morphological characters including sail size, tentacle arrangement, and color. From these images, we identified four recognizable morphologies, described their geographical distribution, and linked them to four of the lineages identified with genomic data. We conclude there are at least four species, three of which correspond to species proposed by scientists in the 18th and 19th centuries: P. physalis, P utriculus, and P. megalista, along with one as yet unnamed species Physalia sp. from the Tasman Sea. Within each species, we observe significant population structure, with evidence of persistent subpopulations at a regional scale, as well as evidence for individual long-distance dispersal events. Our findings indicate that, instead of one well-mixed, cosmopolitan species, there are in fact multiple Physalia species with distinct but overlapping ranges, each made up of regionally endemic subpopulations that are connected by major ocean currents and wind patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

However, the mechanisms causing adipocyte inflammation and insulin resistance remain unclear. Here, we show that excess cholesterol induces adipocyte dysfunction, which is suppressed by the transcription factor Nfe2l1 (nuclear factor erythroid derived-2, like-1). Nfe2l1 is required to sustain proteasome function in adipocytes and proteotoxic stress induces adipocyte inflammation via the activation of Atf3. In humans, the Nfe2l1-proteasome pathway is inversely correlated to body mass index (BMI) in an adipose-depot specific manner. In mice, loss of adipocyte Nfe2l1 caused AT inflammation with a pronounced infiltration of macrophages and T cells. Mice lacking adipocyte Nfe2l1 displayed severe adipocyte dysfunction during diet-induced obesity (DIO), characterized by lower adipokine levels, steatosis, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Nfe2l1{Delta}AT mice on an Apoe-deficient (Apoe-/-) background fed a cholesterol-rich Western Diet (WD), developed a lipoatrophy-like syndrome, dyslipidemia, and enhanced atherosclerosis. Our results reveal an important role for proteasome-mediated proteostasis in adipocytes and indicate that Nfe2l1 is linked to metabolic health in humans and preclinical mouse models. Promoting proteostasis in adipocytes may thus alleviate inflammation in obesity, potentially averting adverse cardiometabolic outcomes.

How the physicochemical properties of the cytoplasm affect spindle architecture and size remains largely unknown. Using quantitative biochemistry in combination with adaptive feedback microscopy, we investigated mitotic cell and spindle morphology during neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells. While tubulin biochemistry and microtubule dynamics remained unchanged, spindles changed their scaling behaviour: in differentiating cells, spindles were significantly smaller than those in equally-sized undifferentiated stem cells. Integrating quantitative phase imaging, biophysical perturbations and theory, we found that as cells differentiated, their cytoplasm became more dilute. The concomitant decrease in free tubulin activated CPAP (centrosomal P4.1-associated protein) to enhance the centrosomal nucleation capacity. As a consequence, in differentiating cells, microtubule mass shifted towards spindle poles at the expense of the spindle bulk, explaining the differentiation-associated switch in spindle architecture. This study shows that cell state-specific cytoplasmic density tunes mitotic spindle architecture. Thus, we reveal physical properties of the cytoplasm as a major determinant in organelle size control.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

However, understanding the underlying infection burden (i.e., including undetected asymptomatic/mild infections) and dynamics, particularly since late 2021 when the Omicron variant emerged, is challenging due to the potential for asymptomatic and repeat SARS-CoV-2 infection, changes in testing practices, and changes in disease reporting. Here, we leverage extensive surveillance data available in New York City (NYC) and a comprehensive model-inference system to reconstruct SARS-CoV-2 dynamics therein from the pandemic onset in March 2020 to August 2023, and further validate the estimates using independent wastewater surveillance data. The validated model-inference estimates indicate a very high infection burden totaling twice the population size (>5 times documented case count) but decreasing infection-fatality risk (a >10-fold reduction) during the first 3.5 years. The detailed estimates also reveal highly complex variant dynamics and immune landscape, changing virus transmissibility, and higher infection risk during winter in NYC over this time period. These transmission dynamics and drivers, albeit based on data in NYC, may be relevant to other populations and inform future planning to help mitigate the public health burden of SARS-CoV-2.","NA","medrxiv",1722204574072

Influenza A virus (IAV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded, RNA virus that has not previously been associated with widespread infection in cattle. As such, cattle are an extremely under-studied domestic IAV host species. IAV receptors on host cells are sialic acids (SAs) that are bound to galactose in either an 2,3 or 2,6 linkage. Human IAVs preferentially bind SA-2,6 (human receptor), whereas avian IAVs have a preference for 2,3 (avian receptor). The avian receptor can further be divided into two receptors: IAVs isolated from chickens generally bind more tightly to SA-2,3-Gal-{beta}1,4 (chicken receptor), whereas IAVs isolated from duck to SA-2,3-Gal-{beta}1,3 (duck receptor). We found all receptors were expressed, to a different degree, in the mammary gland, respiratory tract, and cerebrum of beef and/or dairy cattle. The duck and human IAV receptors were widely expressed in the bovine mammary gland, whereas the chicken receptor dominated the respiratory tract. In general, only a low expression of IAV receptors was observed in the neurons of the cerebrum. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for the high levels of H5N1 virus reported in infected bovine milk and show cattle have the potential to act as a mixing vessel for novel IAV generation.

The lack of a comprehensive understanding on the biology of the disease is paralleled by its dismal survival rates (5-20%). To overcome this challenge, we first identified and prioritized urgently needed resources for clinicians and researchers. Thus, we established genome-wide single-cell RNA-sequencing and bulk proteomic data of in vitro and in vivo-generated knockdown models of the pathognomonic DSRCT fusion oncoprotein (EWSR1::WT1) and combined them with an original systems-biology-based pipeline including patient data and the largest histology collection of DSRCTs and morphological mimics available to date. These novel tools were enriched with curated public datasets including patient- and cell line-derived ChIP-seq, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq studies resulting in a multi-model and multi-omic toolbox for discovery analyses. As a proof of concept, our approach revealed the alpha-2/delta subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex, CACNA2D2, as a highly overexpressed, super-enhancer driven, direct target of EWSR1::WT1. Single-cell and bulk-level analyses of patient samples and xenografted cell lines highlighted CACNA2D2 as a critical component of our newly established EWSR1::WT1 oncogenic signature, that can be employed to robustly identify DSRCT in reference sets. Finally, we show that CACNA2D2 is a highly sensitive and specific single biomarker for fast, simple, and cost-efficient diagnosis of DSRCT. Collectively, we establish a large-scale multi-omics dataset for this devastating disease and provide a blueprint of how such toolbox can be used to identify new and clinically relevant diagnostic markers, which may significantly reduce misdiagnoses, and thus improve patient care.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

During immobility, hippocampal replay sequences depict spatial paths related to the animals past experience or predicted future13. By recording from large ensembles of hippocampal place cells14 in combination with optogenetic manipulation of cortical input in freely behaving rats, we show here that the selection of hippocampal replay is governed by a novel self-avoidance principle. Following movement cessation, replay of the animals past path is strongly avoided, while replay of the future path predominates. Moreover, when the past and future paths overlap, early replays avoid both and depict entirely different trajectories. Further, replays avoid self-repetition, on a shorter timescale compared to the avoidance of previous behavioral trajectories. Eventually, several seconds into the stopping period, replay of the past trajectory dominates. This temporal organization contrasts with established and recent predictions9,10,15,16 but is well-recapitulated by a symmetry-breaking attractor model of sequence generation in which individual neurons adapt their firing rates over time26-35. However, while the model is sufficient to produce avoidance of recently traversed or reactivated paths, it requires an additional excitatory input into recently activated cells to produce the later window of past-dominance. We performed optogenetic perturbations to demonstrate that this input is provided by medial entorhinal cortex, revealing its role in maintaining a memory of past experience that biases hippocampal replay.

This outbreak is associated with the 2.3.4.4b clade of influenza A, and it is as yet unclear what factors have contributed to its spread at the continental scale. In this study we use Bayesian additive regression trees, a machine learning method designed for probabilistic modelling of complex nonlinear phenomena, to construct species distribution models for HPAI presence across Europe. Using these models we identify factors driving the geospatial distribution of cases and project the distribution of risk across Europe. Our models are stratified by time to capture both seasonal changes in risk patterns and shifts in HPAI epidemiology associated with the introduction of the 2.3.4.4b clade. While previous studies have aimed to predict HPAI presence from physical geography, here we explicitly consider the impact of wild bird ecology by including in our model estimates of bird species richness, abundance of specific high-risk bird taxa, and ""species-trait abundance indices"" describing the total abundance of species with high-risk behavioural and/or dietary traits. Our projections point to a shift in concentration of risk towards cold, low-lying regions of coastal northwest Europe associated with 2.3.4.4b, with the margins of uncertainty extending that risk further into central and eastern Europe. In coastal northwest Europe specifically, we predict a persistence of high risk throughout the year. Methodologically, we demonstrate that while the majority of variation in risk can be explained by climate and other aspects of physical geography, the addition of ecological covariates represents a valuable refinement to species distribution models of HPAI.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

Their genomes encode extensive repertoires of secreted effector proteins that suppress host immunity. Here, we revised and analyzed the candidate secreted effector protein (CSEP) effectome of the barley powdery mildew fungus, Blumeria hordei (Bh) and identified seven CSEPs that are broadly conserved in powdery mildew fungal species, rendering them core effectors of these phytopathogens. We show that one of these, CSEP0214, interacts with the barley VPS18 protein, a core component of the CORVET and HOPS endosomal tethering complexes, mediating fusions of early endosomes and multivesicular bodies with the central vacuole, respectively. Overexpression of CSEP0214 and knockdown of either VPS18, HOPS-specific VPS41 or CORVET-specific VPS8 caused a block of the vacuolar pathway and the accumulation of the fluorescent vacuolar marker protein (SP)-RFP-AFVY in the endoplasmic reticulum. Co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid experiments suggest that CSEP0214 blocks the interaction of VPS18 and VPS16, which are both core components of CORVET as well as HOPS. Additionally, expression of CSEP0214 blocked the hypersensitive cell death response associated with resistance gene-mediated immunity in barley, indicating that endomembrane traffic is required for this process. It also prevented callose deposition in cell wall appositions at attack sites and encasements of fungal infection structures. Our results indicate that this powdery mildew core effector is an essential immunity suppressor.

In this view, the precise timing in the transcriptional activation of these genes may impact upon body length. Unlike other Hox clusters, HoxB lacks all posterior genes between Hoxb9 and Hoxb13, two genes separated by a ca. 70 kb large DNA segment containing an unusually high number of CTCF sites, suggesting it isolates Hoxb13 from the rest of the cluster, thereby delaying its negative impact on trunk extension. We deleted the spacer DNA to induce a potential heterochronic gain of function of Hoxb13 at physiological concentration and observed a shortening of the tail as well as other abnormal phenotypes, which were all rescued by inactivating Hoxb13 in-cis with the deletion. A comparable gain of function was observed in mutant ES cells grown as pseudo-embryos in vitro, which allowed us to examine in details the importance of both the number and the orientation of CTCF sites in the insulating activity of the DNA spacer. A short cassette containing all the CTCF sites was sufficient to insulate Hoxb13 from the rest of HoxB and additional modifications of this CTCF cassette showed that two CTCF sites in convergent orientations are already capable of importantly delaying Hoxb13 activation in these conditions. We discuss the relative importance of genomic distance versus number and orientation of CTCF sites in preventing Hoxb13 to be activated too early during trunk extension and hence to modulate tail length.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

While much of the current understanding of P. syringae is centered on interactions with flowering plants, much less is known about infection in evolutionarily divergent non-flowering lineages. Here, we took a comparative evolutionary approach to understand how P. syringae infects distantly related plants. We identify broad host P. syringae isolates causing significant disease in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, the fern Ceratopteris richardii, and the flowering plant Nicotiana benthamiana, which last shared a common ancestor over 500 million years ago. We demonstrate that phytotoxin enriched isolates belonging to the phylogroup 2 clade of the P. syringae species complex are particularly virulent in non-flowering plants, relying on a combination of type-3 secreted effector proteins and the lipopeptide phytotoxin syringomycin. The application of purified syringomycin promotes necrosis in diverse host tissues and activates conserved genes associated with redox regulation and cell death. Toxin-deficient phylogroups normally unable to infect Marchantia thalli exhibit enhanced bacterial growth when supplemented with exogenous syringomycin, further highlighting its role as a host-range defining factor in Pseudomonas. Collectively our research reveals a key role for the lipopeptide syringomycin in promoting Pseudomonas colonization, which works in concert with type-3 effector proteins to antagonize an exceptionally wide spectrum of land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

Here, we describe a new family of bacterial DUBs that is structurally related to eukaryotic Josephins, but contains members that catalyze a unique destructive substrate deubiquitination. These ubiquitin C-terminal clippases (UCCs) cleave ubiquitin before the C-terminal diGly motif, thereby truncating the modifier and leaving a remnant on the substrate. By comparing the crystal structures of substrate-bound clippases and a closely related conventional DUB, we identified the factors causing the shift and found them conserved in other clippases, including one highly specific for M1-linked ubiquitin chains. This new enzyme class has great potential as tools to study the ubiquitin system, in particular aspects involving branched chains.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

The latest example is the BA.2.86 Variant Of Interest (VOI), which rapidly outcompeted all other lineages following its detection in late July 2023. Descending sublineages dominated globally by July 2024, at the time of writing this study. The mechanisms by which highly-divergent viral lineages tend to emerge remain unclear, with the most strongly supported hypothesis being the acquisition of multiple mutations through accelerated evolution in chronically infected individuals, with spread back into the community facilitated by prolonged shedding. We used BA.2.86 as a case study to investigate the evolutionary process behind the emergence of a highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variant. Through fine-scale evolutionary analyses applied to four independently subsampled datasets, we identify over 100 genomes representing evolutionary intermediates occupying the branch in the phylogenetic tree leading to the BA.2.86*/JN.1* clade. Additionally, we detected more than 2,600  hybrid genomes across the evolutionary history of the Omicron-descending BA.2* sub-lineages, displaying a sequential acquisition of BA.2.86 lineage-defining mutation constellations through time. We observe that hybrid strains circulated up to 19 months prior to BA.2.86, denoting cryptic circulation in various countries, with further evidence of early transmission chains. We also found signals of recombination between pre-existing parental lineages, suggesting that this process contributed to the emergence of BA.2.86. Our results suggest that the BA.2.86 lineage emerged sequentially through a complex evolutionary process, rather than via accelerated evolution associated with a single emergence event.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

So far, a well-known mammalian mutation PB2-E627K has not been maintained in AIV in poultry, which limits the spread of AIVs from avian to humans. Here, we discovered a variant, PB2-627V, which combines the properties of avian-like PB2-627E and human-like PB2-627K, overcoming host restrictions and posing a risk for human pandemics. Specifically, by screening the global PB2 sequences, we discovered a new independent cluster with PB2-627V emerged in the 2010s, which is prevalent in various avian, mammalian, and human isolates of AIVs, including H9N2, H7N9, H3N8, 2.3.4.4b H5N1, and other subtypes. And, the increasing prevalence of PB2-627V in poultry is accompanied by a rise in human infection cases with this variant. Then we systematically assessed its host adaptation, fitness, and transmissibility across three subtypes of AIVs (H9N2, H7N9, and H3N8) in different host models, including avian and human cells, chickens, mice, and ferrets where infections naturally occur. We found that PB2-627V facilitates AIVs to efficiently replicate and infect chickens and mice by utilizing both avian- and human-origin ANP32A proteins. Importantly, and like PB2-627K, PB2-627V promotes efficient transmission between ferrets through respiratory droplets. Deep sequencing in passaged chicken samples and transmitted ferret samples indicates PB2-627V maintains stable functionality across the two distinct hosts. Therefore, the mutation has the ability to continue spreading among poultry and can also overcome the barrier between birds and humans, greatly enhancing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, it is crucial to closely monitor influenza viruses carrying PB2-627V to prevent a pandemic.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

Our study aims to assess the association between COVID-19 infections and subsequent kidney diseases, using influenza as a positive control and incorporating a negative control to establish clearer associations.

MethodsA large retrospective cohort study with strata matching was conducted using the MarketScan database with records from Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. We used the international classification of 10th revision (ICD-10) codes to identify individuals and build three cohorts, (1) COVID-19 group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of COVID-19; (2) Influenza but no COVID-19 (positive control) group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of Influenza; and (3) no COVID-19 / Influenza (negative control) group, with randomly assigned index dates between Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. The main outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To evaluate the association between COVID-19 and the new onset of kidney diseases relative to both control groups, we employed multivariable stratified Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.

ResultsThe study included 939,241 individuals with COVID-19, 1,878,482 individuals in the negative control group, and 199,071 individuals with influenza. After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and medication histories, COVID-19 was significantly associated with increased risks of AKI (adjusted hazards ratio, aHR: 2.74, 2.61-2.87), CKD (aHR: 1.38, 1.32-1.45), and ESRD (aHR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.67-3.88), while influenza was associated with a modestly increased risk of AKI (aHR: 1.24, 1.11-1.38) and had no impact on CKD (aHR: 1.03, 0.92-1.14), and ESRD (aHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55-1.29). Time-specific analyses indicated that while the HR for AKI declined from 0-180 days to 0-540 days, the HR for CKD and ESRD remained stable, with COVID-19s risk surpassing influenzas risk throughout follow-up. Exploratory analysis also found significant impacts of COVID-19 on glomerular diseases (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50).

ConclusionIn this large real-world study, COVID-19 infections were associated with a 2.3-fold risk of developing AKI, a 1.4-fold risk of CKD, and a 4.7-fold risk of ESRD compared to influenza. Greater attention needs to be paid to kidney diseases in individuals after contracting COVID-19 to prevent future adverse health outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1722204574072

This shortcoming increases the rate of false positives and false negatives, giving rise to a potentially misleading scientific record. To address this shortcoming, many researchers now use point-and-click software to run sample size calculations.

ObjectiveWe aimed to (1) estimate how many published articles report using the G*Power sample size calculation software; (2) assess whether these calculations are reproducible and (3) error-free; and (4) assess how often these calculations use G*Powers default option for mixed-design ANOVAs--which can be misleading and output sample sizes that are too small for a researchers intended purpose.

MethodWe randomly sampled open access articles from PubMed Central published between 2017 and 2022 and used a coding form to manually assess 95 sample size calculations for reproducibility and errors.

ResultsWe estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65% [95% CI: 0.62% - 0.67%] of articles). We could reproduce 2% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8%; 3/36).

ConclusionPublished sample size calculations that use G*Power are not transparently reported and may not be well-informed. Given the popularity of software packages like G*Power, they present an intervention point to increase the prevalence of informative sample size calculations.","NA","medrxiv",1722204574072

Mobile Integrons (MI) are borne on plasmids, acting as a vehicle for hundreds of antimicrobial resistance genes among key pathogens. These elements also carry gene cassettes of unknown function (gcus) whose role and adaptive value remains unexplored. Recent years have witnessed the discovery of a myriad defence systems against bacteriophages, highlighting that viral infection is a major selective pressure for bacteria. We hence sought to explore if gcus could encode phage defence systems. Using the INTEGRALL database, we established a collection of 129 gcus in pMBA, a vector where cassettes are established as part of a class 1 integron. PADLOC and DefenseFinder predicted four phage defence systems in this collection, comprising Lamassu, CBASS and two ABI (abortive infection) systems. We experimentally challenged all cassettes with phages and found nine additional candidates that were not detected in silico. We have characterized in depth the 13 gcus against a panel of phages in Escherichia coli confirming their role as phage defence integron cassettes (PICs). We used recombination assays to verify that all systems are bona fide integron cassettes and are therefore mobile. We show that PICs confer resistance in other clinically relevant species, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Several PICs also limit prophage activation, providing protection at the population-level. Given the stockpiling capacity of integrons, we explored the additivity of phenotypes and found that integrons with two PICs confer multiphage-resistance. Additionally, when combined with antimicrobial resistance genes, integrons confer simultaneously drug and phage resistance. Crucially, we also show that the position of a pic in the array can strongly decrease its cost. Our results prove a role of integrons in phage defence, acting as highly mobile, low-cost defence islands. This has important implications in the spread of defence systems, and on the future of phage therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072

The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins.

We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria.

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1722204574072
