Although phenotypically similar to living wolves (Canis lupus), dire wolves have yet to be placed confidently in the canid family tree. We generated 3.4x and 12.8x paleogenomes from two well-preserved dire wolves dating to > 13,000 and > 72,000 years ago, and estimated consensus species trees for these and 10 canid species. Our results revealed that ~2/3 of dire wolf ancestry is derived from a lineage sister to the clade comprising the gray wolf, coyote, and dhole, and the remaining ~1/3 from a lineage near the base of Canini diversity. We identified 80 genes evolving under diversifying selection in dire wolves. Our results underscore the power of paleogenomes to resolve long-standing taxonomic questions and contribute to growing evidence of the role of post-speciation gene flow as an evolutionary force.","NA","biorxiv",1744668506138

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1744668506138

Reference point-dependence, a valuation bias shared by eminent adaptation level and prospect theories, is often cited as the underlying computational mechanism. However, whether these behavioural and computational mechanisms are preserved across species is unknown. To fill this gap, we designed a reinforcement learning task that was adapted for both humans (homo sapiens sapiens) and rats (rattus norvegicus). Behavioural analyses indicated robust relative value encoding in both species. At the computational level, reference point-dependence provided a reliable account of reinforcement learning behaviour in humans and rats. Despite these major similarities between species, some distinct differences in behavioural and computational modelling parameters were also observed. Overall, our study demonstrates that relative value encoding is a robust feature of reinforcement learning that is conserved across human and rat species.","NA","biorxiv",1744668506138

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1744668506138

However, although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for common complex diseases routinely profile 1M+ individuals, studies of molecular phenotypes have lagged behind. We performed a GWAS meta-analysis for 249 circulating metabolic traits in the Estonian Biobank and the UK Biobank in up to 619,372 individuals, identifying 88,604 significant locus-metabolite associations and 8,774 independent lead variants, including 987 lead variants with a minor allele frequency less than 1%. We demonstrate how common and low-frequency associations converge on shared genes and pathways, bridging the gap between rare-variant burden testing and common-variant GWAS. We used Mendelian randomisation (MR) to explore putative causal links between metabolic traits, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Surprisingly, up to 85% of the tested metabolite-disease pairs had statistically significant genome-wide MR estimates, likely reflecting complex indirect effects driven by horisontal pleiotropy. To avoid these pleiotropic effects, we used cis-MR to test the phenotypic impact of inhibiting specific drug targets. We found that although plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have been associated with T2D in both observational and genome-wide MR studies, inhibiting the BCAA catabolism pathway to lower BCAA levels is unlikely to reduce T2D risk. Our publicly available results provide a valuable novel resource for GWAS interpretation and drug target prioritisation.","NA","medrxiv",1744668506138

Real-word data on relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) between mRNA- and protein-based vaccines are limited, and more data are needed on disease outcomes in this age group. Methods: The K-COV-N database, COVID-19 vaccine registry, and health insurance claims were retrospectively reviewed to identify adolescents (12-18-year-olds) in South Korea who received a homologous primary series of NVX-CoV2373 or BNT162b2 and a heterologous or homologous third vaccine dose. Vaccine recipients were propensity score matched to reduce confounding baseline factors. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for any medically attended COVID-19 post vaccination (starting 14 days post primary series and 7 days post third dose) were calculated to assess rVE every 30 days through a 180-day risk window. Results: From February to December 2022, 3174 and 6253 doses of NVX-CoV2373 and BNT162b2, respectively, were administered to South Korean adolescents. Individuals who received NVX-CoV2373 tended to be older, have a disability, and/or have a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Propensity score matching resulted in 107 individuals in each primary series group and 701 and 1417 individuals in the NVX-CoV2373 and BNT162b2 third-dose groups, respectively. The aHR (95% CI) for NVX-CoV2373 compared with BNT162b2 for medically attended COVID-19 in the 180-day risk window was 0.57 (0.31-1.05) for the primary series and 0.68 (0.54-0.84) for the third dose. Discussion: These results suggest that NVX-CoV2373 may provide more robust protection against medically attended COVID-19, compared to BNT162b2, both as a homologous primary series and as a homologous or heterologous third dose.","NA","medrxiv",1744668506138

However, the regeneration rate is adjusted with the plane of amputation along the proximo-distal (PD) axis, leading to equivalent regeneration times regardless of the extent of tissue removal. We hypothesized that this phenomenon could be partly explained by differences in tissue mechanical properties. In this work, we describe tissue growth mathematically and evaluate cell cycle parameters of regenerating limbs amputated at different levels along the PD axis, demonstrating a linear correlation between the cell cycle length and the amputation site during early regeneration phases. We show as well, that blastema cells require their endogenous context to retain such proliferation differences. We measured mechanical properties in regenerating limbs with in vivo optical and standard indentation-based techniques and demonstrated that distal blastema cells are stiffer than proximal ones. Accordingly, we demonstrated that axolotl cells decrease their proliferation with increased extracellular matrix stiffness in vitro. Next, we evaluated the activity of the mechanotransducers YAP/TAZ in vivo by using a GTIIC-based reporter line combined with target gene expression data, which indicated that their activity peaks during the blastema stage, with higher activity after proximal amputations. Hence, our findings strongly suggest a mechanical dependence for the position-dependent regulation of cell proliferation during axolotl limb regeneration, where YAP/TAZ likely plays a role in the mechanotransduction mechanism.","NA","biorxiv",1744668506138

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1744668506138

A hallmark of the co-translational folding (coTF) of many proteins are highly stable folding intermediates that are absent or only transiently populated off the ribosome, yet persist during translation well-beyond complete emergence of the domain from the ribosome exit tunnel. Intermediates are important for folding fidelity; however, their structures have remained elusive. Here, we have structurally characterised two coTF intermediates of an immunoglobulin-like domain by developing comprehensive 19F NMR analyses using chemical shifts, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), and protein engineering. We integrated these experimental data with extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to obtain atomistic structures of the folding intermediates on the ribosome. The resulting structures are distinguished by native-like folds initiated from either their N- or C-termini, and reveal multiple parallel folding pathways, which are structurally conserved within the protein domain family, in contrast to their in vitro refolding mechanisms. By redirecting proteins to fold along hierarchical, parallel routes, the ribosome may promote efficient folding by avoiding kinetic traps, and regulate nascent chain assembly and targeting by auxiliary factors to maintain cellular proteostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1744668506138

Given the increased RA burden in women, and well-known correlations between the vaginal microbiota and local inflammation, we seek to understand the vaginal microenvironment in the context of RA pathology. Methods: Self-collected vaginal swabs and questionnaires on dietary and health practices were obtained from 36 RA and 50 demographically-matched control women, 18-63 years of age. Additionally, medication regimen and disease activity and severity were captured for the RA cohort. Vaginal swabs were subjected to full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex cytokine analyses, and quantification of rheumatoid factor, c-reactive protein, and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs). Results: Vaginal microbial richness and genera Peptoniphilus and Prevotella, among other rare taxa, were elevated in RA versus control samples. Vaginal IL-18 and EGF levels were increased in the RA group; IL-18 correlated with multiple microbial features whereas EGF levels were not associated with bacterial composition or other host factors. Within the RA cohort, decreased relative abundance of Streptococcus was associated with joint pathologies, and Lactobacillus gasseri was lower in individuals with serum detection of ACPAs and rheumatoid factor. Vaginal ACPAs were higher in the RA group and positively correlated with Streptococcus and multiple vaginal inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: We describe vaginal microbial and immunological differences in women with RA, particularly when accounting for diet and menopausal status, disease activity and severity, and medication use.

While some lateralized functions are evident in other species, the human brain displays a strong, species-wide bias. Despite the evolutionary and functional significance of these asymmetries, their molecular and cellular foundations remain poorly understood. Here, we identify key neurochemical and cellular asymmetries that underpin cortical lateralization. Specifically, we demonstrate lateralized gradients in neurotransmitter receptor densities, particularly along the acetylcholine-norepinephrine axis, as well as asymmetries in mitochondrial distribution and the spatial prevalence of microglia and glutamatergic excitatory neurons. Using a multimodal approach that integrates in vivo functional MRI, PET imaging, and post-mortem transcriptomic and cellular data, we delineate two distinct cortical clusters: a left-lateralized network centered on language processing and a right-lateralized network supporting visuospatial attention. These results highlight a biologically embedded substrate for lateralized cognition that may inform both evolutionary theory and our mechanistic understanding of neuropsychiatric illnesses characterized by disrupted lateralization.","NA","biorxiv",1744668506138

We previously showed that the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus evolves resistance to the dual-targeting fluoroquinolone delafloxacin (DLX) that inhibits both the DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV via gene amplifications of an efflux pump encoding gene sdrM. However, the pathways that control the formation or selection of gene amplifications, and consequently adaptive trajectories, remain understudied, especially in gram-positive bacteria like S. aureus. Here, we show that specific DNA repair and chromosomal separation pathways alter the frequency of formation and selection of gene amplifications in S. aureus. Through a screen of 36 mutants deficient in various DNA processes, we found that while sdrM amplification was still the almost universal path to DLX resistance, other mutations that increased sdrM expression reduced the selection frequency of sdrM amplifications, demonstrating the critical role of sdrM in DLX resistance. We found that similar to other bacteria, the formation and loss of sdrM amplifications required a functional RecA recombinase, but multiple other mutants in pathways required for amplifications in other species still exhibited frequent sdrM amplifications, suggesting that S. aureus may have alternate routes of amplification formation. Finally, mutants in the tyrosine recombinase XerC that is involved in chromosomal separation were deficient for sdrM amplifications, indicating that XerC is a novel modulator of amplification formation, maintenance, or selection. Thus, our work sheds light on genetic factors that alter gene amplification-mediated evolutionary trajectories to antibiotic resistance in S. aureus and can potentially unlock mechanisms by which such evolution of resistance can be inhibited.","NA","biorxiv",1744668506138

Cognitively normal trial recruits with baseline neuroimaging aged 65 to 85 years in A4 (n=4,415). Deceased AD cases and controls in ADGC (mean age ~ 82 years; n=5,007) Main outcomes Clinically diagnosed AD and all-cause dementia, principally or exclusively ascertained through health record linkages (UK Biobank, FinnGen); Cerebral amyloidosis ascertained through Positron Emission Tomography neuroimaging (A4); AD neuropathologically confirmed at autopsy (ADGC). Results In UKB, 73.9% (95% confidence interval: 37.3% to 89.0%) of AD and 37.8% (9.1% to 57.4%) of all-cause dementia were attributable to a combination of {varepsilon}3 and {varepsilon}4 carriage.

In the A4 study, 85.1% (19.2% to 93.9%) of cerebral amyloidosis was attributable to {varepsilon}3 and {varepsilon}4. In the ADGC data, 92.7% (81.4% to 96.5%) of neuropathologically confirmed AD was attributable to {varepsilon}3 and {varepsilon}4, with {varepsilon}4 accounting for 56.9% (36.0% to 63.0%) and {varepsilon}3 for 35.8% (22.1% to 58.3%). Conclusions Without the strong risk-increasing effects of both APOE {varepsilon}3 and {varepsilon}4, most AD would not occur. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) predominates late-onset AD's causes. Research into apoE should be prioritised given its major potential as a target for AD prevention and treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1744668506138

Much of the qualitative research on Long Covid has been based on people attending specialist clinical services or who have accessed support groups. We describe the varied ways in which a diverse group of people in a community sample experience, recognise and manage persistent symptoms following COVID-19. Methods: Qualitative interview study nested within the large, community-based REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study in England. Participants reporting persistent symptoms following COVID-19 were asked for consent to be contacted about a follow-up interview. We then purposively sampled by age, gender, ethnicity and symptom severity and conducted 60 interviews. Analysis was carried out using a reflexive thematic analysis approach. Results: Participants were an ethnically diverse group aged between 18 and 80 years who reported symptoms following COVID-19 for between a few months and more than two years. Many had not accessed clinical care or specific Long Covid support, and some did not identify with the category of long covid, rendering their experiences largely invisible. Participants highlighted the ways in which they self-manage symptoms within this context, and the varied burden of coping with ongoing health problems. Conclusion: This diverse sample of people with Long Covid report a range of challenges managing this emerging and contested condition, with uncertainty affecting their own understanding and the validation they receive from professionals, family and friends. These challenges intersect with others such as racism, and are compounded by a lack of specific resources for Long Covid as well as over-stretched health services in the UK. Nevertheless, people show resilience in their self-management, seeking information and support from a range of sources.

DNA convolutional neural networks (CNNs) attain state-of-the-art performance at predicting variant effects on gene regulation. However, most applications of such models focus on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as technical challenges limit their application to insertions and deletions (indels). Sequence shifts from indels introduce technical variance in deep CNNs through misalignment of pooling blocks and output boundaries, creating artificially inflated variant effect scores compared to SNPs and confounding their interpretation. In this work, we demonstrate this technical variance in model predictions and present two strategies based on data augmentation with sequence shifts that reduce it. Applied to the state-of-the-art Borzoi model, our stitching approach improves indel eQTL classification accuracy across GTEx tissues. Furthermore, we demonstrate these techniques and observe compelling eQTL concordance for larger structural variants and tandem repeats. We additionally introduce in silico deletion (ISD) as an interpretation technique and validate it using MPRA data, demonstrating concordance between predicted and experimental measurements for deletion effects. Our strategies expand the utility of regulatory sequence machine learning for studying the full spectrum of noncoding genetic variation in human development and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1744668506138

RNU4-2 is a non-protein-coding gene that is transcribed into the U4 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of the major spliceosome. ReNU syndrome variants disrupt spliceosome function and alter 5' splice site selection. Here, we performed saturation genome editing (SGE) of RNU4-2 to identify the functional and clinical impact of variants across the entire gene. The resulting SGE function scores, derived from variants' effects on cell fitness, discriminate ReNU syndrome variants from those observed in the population and dramatically outperform in silico variant effect prediction. Using these data, we redefine the ReNU syndrome critical region at single nucleotide resolution, resolve variant pathogenicity for variants of uncertain significance, and show that SGE function scores delineate variants by phenotypic severity. Further, we identify variants impacting function in regions of RNU4-2 that are critical for interactions with other spliceosome components. We show that these variants cause a novel recessive NDD that is clinically distinct from ReNU syndrome. Together, this work defines the landscape of variant function across RNU4-2, providing critical insights for both diagnosis and therapeutic development.","NA","medrxiv",1744668506138

An essential transmembrane beta-barrel protein, LptD, and a cognate lipoprotein, LptE, translocate LPS selectively into the OM external leaflet via a poorly understood mechanism. Here, we characterize two additional translocon subunits, the lipoproteins LptM and LptY (formerly YedD). We use single-particle cryo-EM analysis, functional assays and molecular dynamics simulations to visualize the roles of LptM and LptY at the translocon holo-complex LptDEMY, uncovering their impact on LptD conformational dynamics. Whereas LptY binds and stabilizes the periplasmic LptD beta-taco domain that functions as LPS receptor, LptM intercalates the lateral gate of the beta-barrel domain, promoting its opening and access by LPS. Remarkably, we demonstrate a conformational switch of the LptD beta-taco/beta-barrel interface alternating between contracted and extended states. The LptD beta-strand 1, which defines the mobile side of the lateral gate, binds LPS and performs a stroke movement toward the external leaflet during the contracted-to-extended state transition. Our findings establish a detailed mechanistic framework explaining the selective transport of LPS to the membrane external leaflet.","NA","biorxiv",1744668506138

The Movile Cave, isolated from external influences 5.5 million years, offers a unique opportunity to explore microbial evolution under prolonged environmental stability. Here, we analyzed metagenome-assembled genomes from this cave, revealing that prokaryotes exhibit lower gene diversity and higher levels of pseudogenization compared to those from non-isolated environments, mainly affecting housekeeping functions involved in translation. Functional redundancy across genomes remained comparable to related habitats. Our results suggest that pseudogenization may serve as a fine-tuning mechanism to reduce excess redundancy. Although horizontal gene transfer is limited overall, the cave virome seems to contribute to microbial adaptation through the transfer of auxiliary metabolic genes. Movile microorganisms harbor fewer phage-defense systems than counterparts in related environments, suggesting a long-term adaptation to a relatively stable virosphere. Our findings indicate that prolonged isolation under stable selective pressures does not necessarily lead to major genomic divergence, but rather promotes adaptive gene loss. This study provides key insights into how long-term stability shapes microbial genome evolution and ecosystem function.","NA","biorxiv",1744668506138

In less studied organisms without annotated genomes, it can seem impossible to perform proteomic analysis. In this study we sought to answer the question - does enough information exist to do proteomics on any organism we want? As a case study we started with material available due to an infestation of a home with black widow spiders. Thanks to the recent publication of an annotated genome for one species of black widow spider, we were able to identify 5502 protein groups and assign putative annotations using ortholog mapping. We also demonstrate that had we not had this resource, over 2000 proteins could be identified using other available spider genome annotations, despite their unrelatedness. Moreover, regardless of spider proteome used, proteins annotated as toxins were almost exclusively observed in the main body of the mature female black widow spider. Overall, these results provide a draft proteome map for the black widow spider and valuable data for validating machine learning models, while also suggesting that the door to insightful quantitative proteomics may already be open for millions of less studied organisms.

Despite their importance, our understanding of the cell biology of sporozoite formation and salivary gland invasion is limited. Here, we apply a technique called Mosquito Tissue Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (MoTissU-ExM), which physically expands infected mosquito tissues while preserving both host and parasite ultrastructure. Using MoTissU-ExM we are able to observe a range of parasite structures and organelles including features previously seen only by electron microscopy as well as structures not observed before. We leverage MoTissU-ExM to investigate a number of cell biology events during sporozoite formation and salivary gland invasion. In particular we focus on the rhoptries, a secretory organelle important for host cell invasion. We establish a timeline for sporozoite rhoptry biogenesis, show that two rhoptries are used up during salivary gland invasion, and provide the first evidence that rhoptry pairs are specialized for different invasion events. Building on this new knowledge, we characterize the rhoptry protein RON11 and identify it as the first protein involved in sporozoite rhoptry biogenesis. Disruption of RON11 led to the production of sporozoites that specifically fail to invade the salivary gland epithelial cell, thereby blocking transmission of these parasites.","NA","biorxiv",1744668506138

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone.

These two aspects of meaning are traditionally studied separately, resulting in two large, multi-method literatures, which we sought to bring together in this study. Not only would this address basic cognitive questions of how semantic cognition operates but also because, despite their distinct focuses, both literatures ascribe a critical role to the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in each aspect of semantics. Given these considerations, we explored the notion that these systems rely on common underlying computational principles when activating conceptual semantic representations via single words, vs. building a coherent semantic representation across sequences of words. The present study used magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography to track brain activity in participants reading nouns and adjective-noun phrases, whilst integrating conceptual variables from both literatures: the concreteness of nouns (e.g., ""lettuce"" vs. ""fiction"") and the denotational semantics of adjectives (subsective vs. privative; e.g., ""bad"" vs. ""fake""). Region-of-interest analyses show that the left, and to a lesser extent the right, ATLs responded more strongly to phrases at different timepoints, irrespective of concreteness, suggesting a unified ATL function for semantic memory and composition. Decoding analyses further revealed a time-varying representational format for adjective semantics, whereas representations of noun concreteness were more stable and maintained for around 300 ms. Further, the neural representation of noun concreteness was modulated by the preceding adjectives: decoders learning concreteness signals in single words generalized better to subsective relative to privative phrases.","NA","biorxiv",1744668506138

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities.
