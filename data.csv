While previous studies have focused on characterizing PASC and identifying its subphenotypes in children and adolescents following an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, the risks of PASC with Omicron-variant reinfections remain unclear. Using a real-world data approach, this study investigates the risks of PASC following reinfections during the Omicron phase in the pediatric population. OBJECTIVE To investigate the risks of PASC diagnosis and 24 PASC symptoms and conditions after reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 during Omicron period in the pediatric population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 40 children's hospitals and health institutions in U.S. between January 2022 and October 2023. EXPOSURES A second SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) or antigen tests, or a diagnose of COVID-19, occurring at least 60 days after the initial infection, compared to the initial infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES PASC was identified using two approaches: (1) the ICD-10-CM diagnosis code U09.9 and (2) a symptom-based definition including 24 physician-identified symptoms and conditions. Absolute risks of incident PASC were reported, and relative risks (RRs) were calculated by comparing the second infection episode with the first infection episode groups using a modified Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through exact matching and propensity scoring matching. RESULTS A total of 465,717 individuals under 21 years old (mean [SD] age 8.17 [6.58] years; 52% male) were included. Compared to the first infection, a second infection was associated with significantly increased risk of an overall PASC diagnosis (RR, 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-2.59), and with many specific conditions including: myocarditis (RR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.46-8.86); changes in taste and smell (RR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.41-5.67); thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism (RR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.71-3.04); heart disease (RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.69 to 2.28); acute kidney injury (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.38 to 2.61); fluid and electrolyte (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.62 to 2.20); generalized pain (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.48 to 1.95); arrhythmias (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.45-1.74); abnormal liver enzyme (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.96); fatigue and malaise (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.64); musculoskeletal pain (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.37 to 1.54); abdominal pain (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.34 to 1.50); postural orthostatic tachycardia syndromes (POTS)/dysautonomia (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.51); cognitive functions (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.50); and respiratory signs and symptoms (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.33). The risks were consistent across various organ systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children and adolescents face significantly higher risk of various PASC outcomes after reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest a cumulative risk of PASC and highlight the urgent need for targeted prevention strategies to reduce reinfections, which includes an increased emphasis on initial or re-vaccination of children.","NA","medrxiv",1743545345558

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

Yet, designing, manufacturing, and delivering LBPs remains challenging, in part due to a lack of technologies capable of analyzing LBPs as complete, spatially organized consortia. Conventional sequencing-based methods lack sensitivity and specificity and do not provide critical spatial information. To address this, we present high-phylogenetic-resolution spatial mapping platform (HiPR-Map), a state-of-the-art spectral imaging technology that enables precise enumeration and spatial localization of microbial cells at species-level within complex communities. Through these advantages, HiPR-Map provides unique insights for LBP discovery and development. Applying HiPR-Map to an LBP designed to complement immune checkpoint therapy, we profiled over 1.8 million microbial cells engrafted in the murine gut. Our analysis revealed distinctive microbial spatial organization, underscoring the power of imaging-based microbiome profiling to optimize LBP design and characterization. This work highlights the transformative potential of spatial microbiome analysis for next-generation LBP development.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

MethodsData were extracted from linked administrative healthcare claims and electronic health records (EHR) for vaccinations from 23 August 2024 through 24 December 2024 and followed through 31 December 2024. We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study with propensity score weighting to adjust for differences between groups to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 outcomes. VE was calculated as 1 minus the hazard ratio (HR) from Cox proportional hazards models.

ResultsOverall, 465,073 mRNA-1273 KP.2 vaccine recipients were matched 1:1 to unexposed adults. The mean (standard deviation) age was 63 (17) years, with more than half of the population being 65 years or older. Approximately 70% of individuals had an underlying medical condition making them high risk for severe outcomes for COVID-19. VE was 52.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.8%, 65.8%) against COVID-19-related hospitalization and 39.4% (35.0%, 43.5%) against medically attended COVID-19 over a median follow-up of 57 (interquartile range: 33-78) days.

ConclusionThe mRNA-1273 KP.2 vaccine demonstrated significant incremental effectiveness in preventing hospitalization with COVID-19 and medically attended COVID-19 in adults during the 2024-2025 season to date. These findings support ongoing vaccination efforts to mitigate the public health impact of COVID-19.

The plant microbiota is generally taxonomically structured. Some of the members can promote plant fitness including growth and stress tolerance. However, microbial imbalance can also result in deleterious effects, a phenomenon known as dysbiosis that was first coined in the gut microbiome field. To unveil the regulatory mechanism to maintain plant homeostatic interaction with microbiota, we performed screening using defined synthetic bacterial communities. We identified an Arabidopsis mutant with altered microbial profiles, an overall increase of microbial load and microbiota-dependent growth defects. Transcriptomic and chemical complementation analyses confirmed that the aforementioned microbiota-dependent phenotypes are contributed by an upregulation of the jasmonate signaling pathway. Upregulation of the jasmonate pathway further promotes microbial growth, possibly forming a positive feedback loop. Even though activation of the jasmonate signaling pathway is known to enhance plant stress tolerance, hyperactivation of the pathway alters plant tolerance or resistance against multiple stressors. Plant association with the microbiota together with proper regulation of the jasmonate signaling pathway are thus essential to maintain plant response to environmental stressors.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

To ensure electron transparency, sample thickness must not exceed 500 nm. Focused-ion-beam (FIB) milling has become the standard method to prepare thin samples (lamellae), however, the material removed by the milling process is lost, the imageable area is usually limited to a few square microns, and the surface layers sustain damage from the ion beam. We have examined cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS), a preparation technique based on cutting thin sections with a knife, as an alternative to FIB-milling. CEMOVIS sections also sustain damage, including compression, shearing and cracks. However, samples can be sectioned in series, producing many orders of magnitude more imageable area compared to lamellae making CEMOVIS an alternative to FIB-milling with distinct advantages. Using 2-dimensional template matching on images of CEMOVIS sections of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, we reconstructed the 60S ribosomal subunit at near-atomic resolution, demonstrating that, in many regions of the sections, the molecular structure of these subunits is largely intact, comparable to FIB-milled lamellae.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

This study presents the first comprehensive investigation of microbial communities inhabiting heritage artifacts from Argentina's Museum of Independence. By integrating advanced microscopy with phenotypic and genomic characterization, we analyzed samples collected from wooden objects, textiles, architectural elements, and exterior walls. Scanning electron microscopy revealed diverse and well-structured biofilms, with intricate three-dimensional arrangements embedded in extracellular polymeric substances. A total of 49 bacterial strains were isolated and identified via VITEK MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, with a predominance of Gram-positive genera such as Bacillus, Micrococcus, and Kocuria. Remarkably, the 19th-century albumen print photograph emerged as the most biodiverse artifact, yielding 21 distinct strains, including Streptomyces, Oceanobacillus, and thermophilic Caldibacillus thermoamylovorans. The protein-rich and halophilic environment of the albumen layer likely facilitated microbial colonization and persistence. Pseudomonas species were exclusively associated with this photographic substrate, further underscoring its niche specificity. Human-associated taxa like Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus equorum were prevalent in high-contact areas, while exterior surfaces displayed distinct microbial signatures, including potential pathogens linked to environmental exposure. These findings reveal a complex and artifact-specific microbial landscape, emphasizing the need for tailored, bio-informed conservation strategies. This work advances the field of heritage microbiology and supports efforts to safeguard culturally significant objects through a deeper understanding of their microbial ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

Two factors that likely contribute to this situation include (a) conceptual disagreement about language and its component processes, and (b) intrinsic inter-individual variability in the topography of language areas. Recent functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) studies of small numbers of intensively scanned individuals have argued that a language-selective brain network emerges from correlations (individualized functional connectomics, iFC) in task-free (e.g., rest) or task-regressed activation timecourses. Here we test this hypothesis at scale and evaluate its practical utility for task-agnostic language localization: we apply iFC separately to each of 1,971 (fMRI) scanning sessions (1,199 unique brains), each consisting of diverse tasks. We find that iFC indeed reveals a left-lateralized frontotemporal network that is more stable within individuals than between them, robust to the granularity of the parcellation, and selective for language. These results support the hypothesis that this network is a key structure in the functional organization of the adult brain and show that it can be recovered retrospectively from arbitrary imaging data, with implications for neuroscience, neurosurgery, and neural engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

However, its precise chromosomal composition has remained elusive due to challenges in resolving repetitive regions. Using PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing, we assembled the complete nuclear genome of the Dm28c strain into 32 telomere-to-telomere chromosomes. The assembly revealed conserved chromosomal structures and synteny patterns when compared to the independently sequenced Dm25 strain, both of which belong to clade A (TcI). This indicates that the 32-chromosome karyotype is a stable and conserved feature of T. cruzi. Through a comprehensive annotation pipeline, we refined gene content and resolved haplotypes, resulting in an approximately 25% reduction in core gene redundancy. All chromosomes demonstrate a conserved compartmentalized architecture consisting of core, disruptive, and newly characterized subtelomeric regions. Subtelomeres, enriched in RHS, TS, and DGF-1 genes but lacking MASP and mucins, create a distinct third genomic compartment. Telomere analysis showed significant length heterogeneity, which may influence subtelomeric gene regulation. Overall, this work defines the complete chromosomal complement of T. cruzi, establishing a solid framework for comparative genomics and enabling detailed studies into genome organization, antigenic variability, and evolutionary dynamics across strains and clades. This assembly redefines the genomic reference landscape, paving the way for future research on T. cruzi fundamental biology, pathogenic diversity, and adaptive mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

Understanding the functions of vocal mimicry can help to uncover the evolutionary drivers of vocal learning. Different adaptive functions like interspecific and intraspecific communication have been suggested, as well as the possibility of vocal mimicry to be a mistake during vocal learning. In the present study, we review the occurrence of mimicry in the family of corvids and investigate the socio-ecological factors driving the evolution of vocal mimicry in this group of birds. We recorded evidence of vocal mimicry from primary (xeno-canto recordings) as well as secondary sources (published literature) and found evidence for vocal mimicry in 31 out of 128 corvid species (24%). Smaller species were described as mimics more compared to larger species. Other socio-ecological factors like breeding status, habitat and trophic niche did not have a significant effect. More mimicry was recorded during the non-breeding season compared to the breeding season. We used Bayesian modelling based on existing data from primary and secondary sources to estimate the occurrence of mimicry, suggesting that vocal mimicry may be more widespread among corvids than currently documented, with many species potentially being  hidden mimics. Our study for the first time systematically reviews the occurrence of vocal mimicry across the family of corvids and investigates a range of socio-ecological factors driving the behaviour. Our analysis suggests many corvid species likely to be  hidden mimics and we provide specific suggestions for species which according to our statistical model are most likely mimicking corvid species, hopefully inspiring future field work on those species.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

It detects neurons using 3D correlation, which improves the signal-to-background ratio and detectability of cells. Finally, it performs 3D segmentation, detecting cells across imaging planes. We validated Suite3D with data from conventional multi-plane microscopes and advanced volumetric microscopes, at various resolutions and in various brain regions.

A common theme is generating a nucleotide-derived second messenger in response to phage that activates an effector protein to halt virion production. Phages respond with counter-defenses that deplete these second messengers, leading to an escalating arms race with the host. Here we discover a novel antiphage system we call Panoptes that detects phage infection by surveying the cytosol for phage proteins that antagonize the nucleotide-derived second messenger pool. Panoptes is a two-gene operon, optSE. OptS is predicted to synthesize a second messenger using a minimal CRISPR polymerase (mCpol) domain, a version of the polymerase domain found in Type III CRISPR systems (Cas10) that is distantly related to GGDEF and Thg1 tRNA repair polymerase domains. OptE is predicted to be a transmembrane effector protein that binds cyclic nucleotides. optSE potently restricted phage replication but mutant phages that had loss-of-function mutations in anti-CBASS protein 2 (Acb2) escaped defense. These findings were unexpected because Acb2 is a nucleotide sponge that antagonizes second messenger signaling. Using genetic and biochemical assays, we found that Acb2 bound the OptS-synthesized nucleotide, 2',3'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( 2',3'-c-di-AMP ); however, 2',3'-c-di-AMP was synthesized constitutively by OptS and inhibited OptE. Nucleotide depletion by Acb2 released OptE toxicity thereby initiating abortive infection to halt phage replication. These data demonstrate a sophisticated immune strategy that hosts use to guard their second messenger pool and turn immune evasion against the virus.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

In insects and other arthropods, which have only innate immune mechanisms, four main immune-specific modules contribute to defense against microbial invaders: the Toll pathway, the Imd pathway, the melanization response, and phagocytosis by plasmatocytes. Our present understanding of their relative importance remains fragmented, as their contribution to host defense has never been simultaneously assessed across a large panel of pathogens. Here, we have taken advantage of newly-described immune mutants in a controlled genetic background to systematically delete these four immune modules individually, in pairs, or all four simultaneously. Surprisingly, flies simultaneously deficient in all four immune modules are viable, homozygous fertile, and display no overt morphological defects, suggesting these immune mechanisms are not strictly required for organismal development. With this new set of lines, we assessed the individual and collective contribution of each module to host defense against five viruses, three fungi, eight Gram-positive bacteria, and eight Gram-negative bacteria. Our findings show that these four modules largely function independently or additively in host defense, although synergistic effects can occur for select pairs of modules. Our study confirmed the importance of the Imd pathway against Gram-negative bacteria and the Toll pathway against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, largely via the induction of effectors such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and Bomanins (Bom), but also reveals an important role of melanization against viruses, and a contribution of phagocytosis against various germs. Additionally, by examining microbial load kinetics in different mutants, we provide insight into how these modules contribute to tolerance or resistance against specific microbes. Our study provides insights into the architecture of the Drosophila immune system, revealing differential requirements of immune modules according to each pathogen. The set of immune deficient lines provided here offers tools to better assess the role of these immune modules in host defense.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

Many of these damaging modifications (i.e., lesions) persist into S-phase of the cell cycle where they may stall the canonical DNA replication machinery. In humans, these stalling events are circumvented by one of at least three interconnected DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathways; translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), Template Switching (TS), and Homology-dependent Recombination (HDR). Currently, the functional interplay between these pathways is unclear, leaving wide gaps in our fundamental understanding of human DDT. To gain insights, we focus on the activation mechanisms of the DDT pathways. PCNA sliding clamps encircling primer/template (P/T) junctions of stalled replication sites are central to the activation of both TLS and TS whereas exchange of RPA for Rad51 filaments on the single strand DNA (ssDNA) sequences of stalled replication sites is central to HDR activation. Utilizing direct, ensemble FRET approaches developed by our lab, we independently monitor and directly compare PCNA occupancy and RPA/Rad51 exchange at P/T junctions under a variety of conditions that mimic in vivo scenarios. Collectively, the results reveal that assembly of stable Rad51 filaments at P/T junctions via RPA/Rad51 exchange causes complete and irreversible unloading of the resident PCNA, both in the presence and absence of an abundant PCNA-binding protein complex. Further investigations decipher the mechanism of RPA/Rad51 exchange-dependent unloading of PCNA. Collectively, these studies provide critical insights into the interplay between human DDT pathways and direction for future studies.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

In these pathways, including CBASS and type III CRISPR systems in bacteria and cGAS-STING in humans, oligonucleotide synthesis occurs upon detection of virus or foreign genetic material in the cell, triggering the antiviral response. In a surprising inversion of this process, we show here that the CRISPR-related enzyme mCpol synthesizes cyclic oligonucleotides constitutively as part of an active mechanism that maintains cell health. Cell-based experiments demonstrated that the absence or loss of mCpol-produced cyclic oligonucleotides triggers cell death, preventing spread of viruses that attempt immune evasion by depleting host cyclic nucleotides. Structural and mechanistic investigation revealed mCpol to be a di-adenylate cyclase whose product, c-di-AMP, prevents toxic oligomerization of the effector protein 2TM{beta}. Analysis of cells by fluorescence microscopy showed that lack of mCpol allows 2TM{beta} oligomerization and consequent cell death due to inner membrane collapse. These findings unveil a powerful new defense strategy against virus-mediated immune suppression, expanding our understanding of oligonucleotides in cell health and disease. These results raise the possibility of similar protective roles for cyclic oligonucleotides in other organisms including humans.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

However, the gut microbiome can interact with these parasites to influence infection outcomes, raising the possibility that its response to increasing temperatures may help buffer against increased infection burden. To evaluate this hypothesis, we sought to determine if the microbiome is resistant or resilient to the stressors of increased water temperature, helminth exposure, and their combination, and whether this variation linked to infection outcomes. We leveraged the zebrafish (Danio rerio) model organism to measure how these variables relate to the temporal dynamics of the gut microbiome. In particular, we exposed adult zebrafish to the parasitic whipworm Pseudocapillaria tomentosa across three different water temperatures (28oC, 32oC, 35oC), and analyzed fecal microbiome samples at five time points across 42 days. Our findings show that parasite exposure and water temperature independently alter gut microbiome diversity. Moreover, we find that water temperature moderates the association between parasite infection and the gut microbiome. Consistent with this observation, but at odds with current expectations, we find that increasing water temperature reduces parasitic infection in fish. Overall, our results indicate that water temperature alters the contextual landscape of the gut microbiome to impact its response to an exogenous stressor of an intestinal parasite in zebrafish. Furthermore, our findings represent the first report of the effects of elevated temperature on parasitic nematode development in a fish host. Importantly, our study demonstrates that climate change may have unanticipated and environmentally contingent impacts to vertebrate gut microbiomes and health outcomes in response to an exogenous stressor.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

Here, we investigate using agent-based models how a propensity for early exploration in childhood contributes to cultural adaptation and the evolution of long human childhood. Using a complex cultural task, we implemented a two-stage strategy for exploring this space - children explore broadly, more likely to learn new behaviours, while adults exploit behaviours already known, incrementally improving them. We found that populations that followed this two-stage strategy achieved higher payoffs in the long term than populations using the two exploration strategies in a random order. Our models point at a 'just right' length of childhood - neither too long, nor too short - allowing individuals enough time to explore before exploiting what they learned. Social learning increased payoffs when agents could copy individuals of a variety of ages. Payoffs decreased under environmental change, especially for long childhoods, because adults did not have enough time to recover between bouts of change.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

The etiology of PMDD, or more generally premenstrual syndrome (PMS) including subclinical forms, is not well understood and both biological and psychological models have been postulated. In the current manuscript we explore the role of emotion regulation ability for the emergence of premenstrual symptoms. Specifically, we were interested whether difficulties in emotion regulation in women with PMS/PMDD persisted as a trait across all cycle phases or were specific to the symptomatic premenstrual phase. We also explored for the first time, whether difficulties in emotion regulation already emerged during the high progesterone mid-luteal phase. 105 women aged 18 to 35 years completed a trait questionnaire on difficulties in emotion regulation, as well as two state measures of emotion regulation during three cycle phases (mid-follicular, mid-luteal, premenstrual). PMS/PMDD was prospectively confirmed across two menstrual cycles in 54 women, while the remaining 51 were assigned to the control group. Our results confirm previous findings that women with PMS/PMDD subjectively report more difficulties in emotion regulation on a trait scale. However, these difficulties were not confirmed in any of the state measures employed in the current study. Furthermore, difficulties in emotion regulation did not account for premenstrual symptom severity in a mediation analysis. This raises the question, whether difficulties in emotion regulation underly premenstrual symptoms or the perception of impaired emotion regulation arises as a consequence of untreated PMS/PMDD. Noteworthy, we were also able to demonstrate via Bayesian analyses, that mood worsening in the premenstrual phase is not a universal occurrence and absent in healthy controls. Taken together these findings highlight the importance of adequate diagnosis and treatment of PMDD.","NA","medrxiv",1743545345558

MethodsRetrospective spatial analysis. Distances between each inpatient facility and the nearest wildfire perimeter were computed on an annual basis using data from the California Department of Health Care Access and Information and CAL-FIREs Fire and Resource Assessment Program. Temporal changes were analyzed via Kruskal-Wallis and linear models.

ResultsThe distance from inpatient healthcare facilities in California to nearby wildfires is decreasing by an average of 628 feet per year, while close approaches are increasing; during 2017-2023, there was 53% increase in the number of inpatient beds within five miles of a wildfire as compared with 2001-2008.

ConclusionWildfires are occurring closer to inpatient healthcare facilities in California. An increasing proportion of Californias inpatient bed capacity is exposed to nearby wildfires. Policies to reduce risk posed by wildfires, prepare for evacuations, preserve access to healthcare, and ensure safe location of new facilities are urgently needed to ensure the safety of patients and the wellbeing of populations that depend on inpatient healthcare services.","NA","medrxiv",1743545345558

With wireless powering and neural data transmission, this system enables real-time BCI control of hand movements and hand function rehabilitation in home use. A complete spinal cord injury (SCI) patient with paralyzed hand functions was recruited in this study.

ResultsOver a 9-month period of home use, the patient achieved an average grasping detection F1-score of 0.91, and a 100% success rate in object transfer tests, with this minimally invasive BCI and a wearable exoskeleton hand. This system allowed the patient to perform eating, drinking and other daily tasks involving hand functions. Additionally, the patient showed substantial neurological recovery through consecutive BCI training, regaining the ability to hold objects without BCI.

We identified HGT events across these genomes, and identified enrichments for functions previously shown to be prone to HGT. By mapping metagenomic reads from 1,862 ocean samples to these genomes, we also identified co-occurrence patterns and environmental associations. Although we observed an expected negative association between phylogenetic distance and HGT rates, we only detected the association between co-occurrence and phylogenetic distance when restricted to closely related taxa. This observation refines the previously reported trend to closely related taxa, rather than a consistent pattern across all taxonomic levels, at least within marine environments.

Accordingly, previous slice physiology experiments in hippocampal area CA1 showed that mGluRIII receptors inhibit glutamate and GABA release only at excitatory and inhibitory synapses formed onto GABAergic interneurons, not onto pyramidal cells. Here, we show that the supposed target cell-specific modulation of GABA release only occurs when the extracellular calcium concentration in the recording solution is higher than its physiological concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid. Under more physiological conditions, mGluRIII receptors inhibit GABA release at synapses formed onto both interneurons and pyramidal cells but limit glutamate release only onto interneurons. This previously unrecognized form of mGluRIII-dependent, pre-synaptic modulation of inhibition onto pyramidal cells is accounted for by a reduction in the size of the readily releasable pool, mediated by protein kinase A and its vesicle-associated target proteins, synapsins. Using in vivo whole-cell recordings in behaving mice, we demonstrate that blocking mGluRIII activation in the intact CA1 network results in net effects consistent with decreased inhibition and significantly alters CA1 place cell activity.

We used human-chimpanzee tetraploid cells to distinguish gene expression changes due to cis-acting sequence variants that change local gene regulation, from trans expression changes due to species differences in the cellular environment. In neural progenitor cells, examination of both cis and trans changes - combined with CRISPR inhibition and transcription factor motif analyses - identified cis-acting, species-specific gene regulatory changes, including to TNIK, FOSL2, and MAZ, with widespread trans effects on neurogenesis-related gene programs. In excitatory neurons, we identified POU3F2 as a key cis-regulated gene with trans effects on synaptic gene expression and neuronal firing. This study identifies cis-acting genomic changes that cause cascading trans gene regulatory effects to contribute to human neural specializations, and provides a general framework for discovering genetic differences underlying human traits.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

Although mouse models of AD have provided insight into neurobiological mechanisms contributing to impaired formation and retrieval of new memories, the process underlying the progressive loss of remote memories in AD has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate age-dependent remote memory decline in APP/PS1 mice, which coincides with progressive hyperexcitability of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Analysis of Fos expression showed that the remote memory deficit is not mirrored by changes in reactivation of memory-encoding neurons, so-called engram cells, nor PV interneuron (re)activation, in the mPFC. However, inhibitory input is enhanced onto engram cells compared to non-engram cells specifically in APP/PS1 mice. Our data indicate that age-dependent remote memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice is due to increased innervation of cortical engram cells by hyperexcitable PV interneurons, suggesting that dysfunctional inhibitory microcircuits in the neocortex mediate progressive retrograde amnesia in AD.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

Despite advances in collagen extraction protocols, the process remains destructive, requiring sampling by sawing, drilling or crushing of dry bone, that can damage or destroy physical features and archaeological evidence, and often consumes the entire specimen. While non-destructive approaches have recently been applied in ancient genomics and palaeoproteomics, no equivalent approach has been established for radiocarbon dating of bone. Here, we outline a non-destructive collagen extraction workflow that avoids invasive sampling (cutting or drilling) and produces no visible damage to the bone. By heating the bone in hot water for several hours, collagen is solubilized, and the resulting collagenous solution can be purified and AMS dated. Here we show that the amino acid composition, C/N atomic ratios, {delta}13C and {delta}15N values of the hot-water-extracted collagen are comparable to collagen isolated from the same bones using classic decalcification methodologies. The hot water extraction method was tested on various bones, ranging from the Bronze Age to the Middle and Upper Paleolithic periods, which had been dated previously using routine destructive methods that involved acid demineralization.

While early visual areas are known to encode retinotopic positions, how these representations transform into invariant neural codes remains unclear. Building on a computational model of reading, we used 7T fMRI and MEG to reveal a cortical hierarchy in which early visual areas (V1-V4) predominantly encode retinotopic information, whereas higher-level regions, including the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), transition to an ordinal letter-position code. MEG analyses confirm that retinotopic encoding emerges early (60-200 ms), followed by a shift toward ordinal representations in later time windows (220-450 ms). Despite this transition, word position remained a dominant factor across all time points, suggesting a concurrent coding of both retinotopic and abstract positional information.

To answer these questions, we administered a new difficult change discrimination task with variable anticipatory periods (N=142). We show that both perceptual sensitivity and motor responses are influenced by temporal structure. Using computational modelling, we show that the cognitive operation underlying this behavior is based on a logarithmic transformation of the event hazard rate (HR) and reveal a crucial role of temporal-estimation noise in shaping this computation, both when temporal information is encoded, and when it is decoded. Together, our results highlight the fundamental contribution of anticipation in directing behavior and advance our understanding of temporal processing in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

This study leveraged 13 longitudinal datasets, including 3,737 cognitively healthy adults (10,343 MRI scans; 13,460 memory assessments), to determine whether brain change-memory change associations are more pronounced with age and genetic risk for Alzheimers Disease. Both factors are associated with accelerated brain decline, yet it remains unclear whether memory loss is exacerbated beyond what atrophy alone would predict. Additionally, we assessed whether memory decline aligns with a global pattern of atrophy or stems from distinct regional contributions. Our mega-analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship between memory decline and brain atrophy, primarily affecting individuals with above-average brain structural decline. The associations were stronger in the hippocampus but also spread across diverse cortical and subcortical regions. The associations strengthened with age, reaching moderate associations in participants in their eighties. While APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers exhibited steeper brain and memory loss, genetic risk had no effect on the change-change associations. These findings support the presence of common biological macrostructural substrates underlying memory function in older age which are vulnerable to multiple age-related factors, even in the absence of overt pathological changes.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

Given this importance, the rational design of microbiomes with targeted functional properties is an important objective. Designing microbial consortia with targeted functions is challenging due to complex community interactions and environmental heterogeneity. Community-function landscapes address this challenge by statistically inferring impacts of species presence or absence on function. Similar to fitness landscapes, community-function landscapes are shaped by both additive effects and interactions (epistasis) among species that influence function. Here, we apply the community-function landscape approach to design synthetic microbial consortia to degrade the toxic environmental contaminant bisphenol-A (BPA). Using synthetic communities of BPA-degrading isolates, we map community-function landscapes across increasing BPA concentrations, where higher BPA means greater toxicity. As toxicity increases, so does epistasis, indicating that collective effects become more important in degradation. Further, we leverage landscapes to rationally design communities with predictable BPA degradation dynamics in vitro. Remarkably, designed synthetic communities are able to remediate BPA in contaminated soils. Our results demonstrate that toxicity can drive epistatic interactions in community-function landscapes and that these landscapes can guide microbial consortia design for bioremediation.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

However, little effort has been dedicated to determining which specific system(s) within defense islands limit lytic phage reproduction in clinical bacterial strains. Here, we employed the CRISPR-based Cascade-Cas3 system to delete defense islands in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate to identify mechanisms of lytic phage antagonism. Deletion of one island in a cystic fibrosis-derived clinical isolate sensitized the strain to phages from the Pbunavirus family, which are commonly used as therapeutics. The causal defense system is a Type IIS restriction endonuclease-like protein (ENDPaCF1), common in Pseudomonads. ENDPaCF1 lacks an associated methyltransferase required for typical Type IIS restriction-modification system to function. ENDPaCF1 protects bacteria against phages with hypermodified DNA and is surprisingly agnostic to the specific structure of the modification, which is unlike typical type IV restriction endonucleases. In ENDPaCF1, the endonuclease domain is fused to a catalytically inactive Endonuclease III (iEndoIII), a domain that recognizes non-canonical bases to repair DNA in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. We therefore propose that nucleases containing an iEndoIII domain (END nucleases) can sense diverse DNA hypermodifications. Our findings reveal modularity of the sensing and cleavage domains, as expected of a modification-dependent endonucleases. We further show that some hypermodified phages, including Pbunavirus family members and Wrowclawvirus family (Pa5oct-like) of jumbo phages, encode END nuclease inhibitors that directly bind to the nuclease, likely via the iEndoIII domain. These inhibitors are necessary for Pbunavirus to plaque on clinical isolates and sufficient to enable other hypermodified phages to plaque in the presence of this defense system.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

While spontaneous thoughts have been associated with various neural correlates, the relationship between subjective qualities of ongoing experiences and the brain's sensitivity to bodily signals (i.e., interoception) remains largely unexplored. Given the well-established role of interoception in emotion, clarifying this relationship may elucidate how processes relevant to mental health, such as arousal and anxiety, are regulated. We used EEG and ECG to measure the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP), an index of interoceptive processing, while 51 adult participants (34 male, 20 female) visually fixated on a cross image and let their minds wander freely. At pseudo-random intervals, participants reported their momentary level of arousal. This measure of subjective arousal was highly variable within and between individuals but was statistically unrelated to several markers of physiological arousal, including heart rate, heart rate variability, time on task, and EEG alpha power at posterior electrodes. A cluster-based permutation analysis revealed that the HEP amplitude was increased during low relative to high subjective arousal in a set of frontal electrodes during the 0.328 s to 0.364 s window after heartbeat onset. This HEP effect was more pronounced in individuals who reported high, relative to low, levels of state anxiety. Together, our results offer novel evidence that at varying levels of state anxiety, the brain differentially modulates sensitivity to bodily signals in coordination with the momentary, spontaneous experience of subjective arousal, a mechanism that may operate independently of physiological arousal.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

This study assessed the evolution of European modelling practices, data usage, gaps, and interactions between modellers and decision-makers to inform future investments in epidemic-intelligence globally.

MethodsWe conducted a two-stage semi-quantitative survey among modellers in a large European epidemic-intelligence consortium. Responses were analysed descriptively across early, mid-, and late-pandemic phases. Policy citations in Overton were used to assess the policy impact of modelling.

FindingsOur sample included 66 modelling contributions from 11 institutions in four European countries. COVID-19 modeling initially prioritised understanding epidemic dynamics, while evaluating non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination impacts became equally important in later phases.  Traditional surveillance data (e.g. case linelists) were widely used in near-real time, while real-time non-traditional data (notably social contact and behavioural surveys), and serological data were frequently reported as lacking. Data limitations included insufficient stratification and geographical coverage. Interactions with decision-makers were commonplace and informed modelling scope and, vice versa, supported recommendations. Conversely, fewer than half of the studies shared open-access code.

InterpretationWe highlight the evolving use and needs of modelling during public health crises. The reported missing of non-traditional surveillance data, even two years into the pandemic, underscores the need to rethink sustainable data collection and sharing practices, including from for-profit providers. Future preparedness should focus on strengthening collaborative platforms, research consortia and modelling networks to foster data and code sharing and effective collaboration between academia, decision-makers, and data providers.","NA","medrxiv",1743545345558

Here, we investigated the timing of these physiological changes to test two hypotheses. Under the thermal challenge hypothesis, we expected an initial rise in heat dissipation effort (i.e., increased peripheral vasomotion) followed by a rise in core temperature, indicating a failed attempt to prevent hyperthermia. Under the warm-up hypothesis, we expected an initial rise of core temperature concomitant or followed by an increase of peripheral vasomotion, indicating regulated hyperthermia, possibly to accelerate feather development. We tested these hypotheses using simultaneous measurements of core and surface temperatures in captive king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus). Core and surface temperatures increased drastically but concomitantly during moult, providing tentative support for the warm-up hypothesis. Moulting penguins were never seen panting, suggesting that increasing peripheral heat loss was sufficient to regulate moulting-induced hyperthermia. Core and subcutaneous temperatures in wild individuals resembled patterns measured in captivity, despite lower heat load and additional options for behavioural thermoregulation.

Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls.

Heterochromatin erosion is a hallmark of human ageing and H3K9me3 is lost globally in aged mammalian cells. However, the functional consequences of the loss of heterochromatin maintenance have been challenging to model. In this study, we used CRISPRi-mediated deletion of the H3K9me3 methyltransferase SETDB1 in human neural progenitor cells to model disruption of heterochromatin maintenance. Deletion of SETDB1 had a limited effect on cell viability, despite a global loss of H3K9me3 peaks resulting in genome-wide reorganization of heterochromatin domains, cells remained proliferative and expressed appropriate marker genes. We found that a key event following the loss of H3K9me3 maintenance was the expression of evolutionarily young L1 retrotransposons. Derepression of L1s was associated with a loss of CpG DNA methylation at their promoters, suggesting that deposition of H3K9me3 at the L1 promoter is required to maintain DNA methylation. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that loss of H3K9me3 in human neural somatic cells transcriptionally activates evolutionary young L1 retrotransposons, further implicating these elements in human ageing processes.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

Yet how enhancers determine transcription of their target genes, and how this depends on their relative position inside a cis-regulatory landscape remains unclear. Here we use live-cell imaging to track the activity of a promoter under the control of the same enhancer, but inserted at different positions across a simplified regulatory landscape with minimal complexity. Combined with mathematical modeling, this reveals that RNA production from the promoter occurs in clusters of transcriptional bursts, with enhancer position controlling the frequency at which such clusters appear. This results in bursts being more frequent and occurring more uniformly across cells when the enhancer is genomically close to the promoter than when it is located at large genomic distance. Mathematical modeling further indicates that the enhancer modulates the promoter's ability to transition from its basal transcriptional state to a regime where clusters of bursts become more frequent. Our results challenge existing models of mammalian promoter operation, and reveal that enhancer position within a cis-regulatory landscape critically controls the timing and variability of transcriptional output in single cells.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

Cell migration is driven by the extension of actin-based lamellipodia protrusions, powered by actin polymerization, which is tightly regulated by signaling pathways, including Rho GTPases and Ca2+ signaling. While the importance of Ca2+ signaling in lamellipodia protrusions has been established, the molecular mechanisms linking Ca2+ to lamellipodia assembly are unknown. Here, we identify a novel Ca2+ signaling axis involving the mechano-gated channel TRPV4, which regulates lamellipodia protrusions in various cell types. Using Ca2+ and FRET imaging, we demonstrate that TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ influx upregulates RhoA activity within lamellipodia, which then facilitates formin-mediated actin assembly. Mechanistically, we identify CaMKII and TEM4 as key mediators relaying the TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ signal to RhoA. These data define a molecular pathway by which Ca2+ influx regulates small GTPase activity within a specific cellular domain - lamellipodia - and demonstrate the critical role in organizing the actin machinery and promoting cell migration in diverse biological contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

This makes cryo-EM a powerful tool, not only for investigating the structure of biomolecules at high resolution but also for inferring the entire conformational ensemble distribution. Some recent works have reported conformational state populations by counting particle-images from cryo-EM. We wish to caution the community that these measurements are highly susceptible to noise and should not be relied upon as a precise estimate of the thermodynamic landscape of a biomolecule for understanding its biological function. Here, we demonstrate that the extremely noisy nature of cryo-EM images and uncertainty in the viewing orientations of biomolecules lead to ambiguities when assigning images to structures. If ignored, this ambiguity can introduce inherent bias when determining the populations of conformational states through individual particle assignment. We further show that modeling the conformational probability distribution using the entire image dataset mitigates these biases.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

We previously observed that during experimental evolution in the presence of abundant susceptible hosts, the AMR plasmid R1 rapidly evolves variants with increased horizontal transmission due to mutations causing increased plasmid copy number. Yet AMR was progressively lost from the evolving populations. Here, we show that AMR loss was associated with evolution of ""stealth"" plasmids in which the AMR region is spontaneously deleted, making plasmid carriage undetectable by plating on selective antibiotic-containing media. These plasmids transmit both vertically and horizontally more efficiently than the ancestral AMR plasmid, driving AMR extinction in bacterial populations and effectively acting as an intrinsic defence against AMR plasmids. Our results suggest that within-host plasmid evolution could be exploited to limit the spread of AMR in natural populations of bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

Here, we show that a specific isoform of RAB5 GTPases, the molecular switches controlling early endosome traffic, is necessary for LAP. We demonstrate that RAB5c regulates phagosome recruitment and function of complexes required for phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate [PI(3)P] and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by macrophages. RAB5c facilitates phagosome translocation of the V-ATPase transmembrane core, which is needed for ATG16L1 binding and consequent LC3 conjugation. RAB5c depletion impaired macrophage elimination of the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus and disruption of the V-ATPase-ATG16L1 axis increased susceptibility in vivo. Therefore, early endosome-to-phagosome traffic is differentially regulated to promote LAP and ROS contributes to resistance against A. fumigatus by effecting LAP.

Domestication of its wild progenitor, the African wildcat (F. lybica), is widely attributed to the emergence of farming. Wildcats are said to have been attracted to settled communities by the rodent populations that were thriving within this new agricultural niche. Some claim the African wildcat even reached Europe during the Neolithic, though many credit the Romans with their dispersal. Through a program of zooarchaeological analysis, genetic identification and radiocarbon dating, we redefine the established chronology for the cats domestication and dispersal across Europe. We argue that early human-cat relationships were more complex than the commensal and mutualistic pathways that have been proposed, and that both the domestication and translocation of cats were linked to its association with deities. Our results suggest domestic cats first arrived in Europe prior to Roman expansion during the early first millennium BCE, and that successive populations of domestic cats with unique mitochondrial signatures were introduced during the Roman, Late Antique and Viking periods. Lastly, by characterising the spatiotemporal representation of both domestic cats and the native European wildcat (F. silvestris), we argue that the introduction of domestic cats precipitated a decline in native European wildcat populations.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has proven effective at biomonitoring aquatic systems but remains underexplored for terrestrial habitats, partly due to point-source sampling bias and difficulty in upscaling. Air has recently emerged as a promising substrate for terrestrial biomonitoring yet most studies use active samplers which tend to be expensive, bulky, and require power. We used a newly developed, inexpensive, reusable, and easy-to-use passive airborne eDNA sampler (DNAir Sampler) to capture eDNA suspended in air over 96 hours within Rotterdam Zoo, the Netherlands. Its performance was compared to two commonly used active airborne eDNA samplers for vertebrate diversity detection. In total, 88 species were detected, including 24 zoo residents. The DNAir Sampler was the most effective at detecting zoo residents, surpassing active samplers in species richness within 48 hours and continuing to accumulate new species beyond 96 hours. It also detected the furthest species signal (515m). Zoo airborne eDNA further demonstrated a positive correlation to species total biomass. Our findings indicate that for long, unsupervised biomonitoring, passive airborne eDNA sampling outperforms active sampling for assessing vertebrate communities and potentially reduces detection noise in stochastic air eDNA signals.

SynopsisPassive airborne eDNA sampling outperforms active methods, accumulates species over time, correlates with biomass, and enables scalable biodiversity monitoring across landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

Here, we present a large, single-cell atlas of expression signatures from 441,088 live microglia broadly sampled across a diverse set of brain regions and neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases obtained from 161 donors sampled at autopsy or during a neurosurgical procedure. Using single-cell hierarchical Poisson factorization (scHPF), we derived a 23-factor model for continuous gene expression signatures across microglia which capture specific biological processes (e.g., metabolism, phagocytosis, antigen presentation, inflammatory signaling, disease-associated states). Using external datasets, we evaluated the aspects of microglial phenotypes that are encapsulated in various in vitro and in vivo microglia models and identified and replicated the role of two factors in human postmortem tissue of Alzheimers disease (AD). Further, we derived a complex network of transcriptional regulators for all factors, including regulators of an AD-related factor enriched for the mouse disease-associated microglia 2 (DAM2) signature: ARID5B, CEBPA, MITF, and PPARG. We replicated the role of these four regulators in the AD-related factor and then designed a multiplexed MERFISH panel to assess our microglial factors using spatial transcriptomics. We find that, unlike cells with high expression of the interferon-response factor, cells with high expression of the AD DAM2-like factor are widely distributed in neocortical tissue. We thus propose a novel analytic framework that provides a taxonomic approach for microglia that is more biologically interpretable and use it to uncover new therapeutic targets for AD.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

Preliminary evidence has shown the gut microbiome influences the aging process of bone and muscle in animal studies. However, such evidence in humans is still scarce. This study aimed to assess the microbiome-bone and microbiome-muscle associations in two cohorts of community-dwelling older adults.

MethodsWe leveraged information from two large population-based cohorts, i.e., the Rotterdam Study (mean age 62.7 {+/-} 5.6 years; n=1,249) and the Framingham Heart Study (mean age 55.2 {+/-} 9.1 years; n=1,227). For individuals included in this study, gut microbiome 16S rRNA sequencing, musculoskeletal phenotyping derived from DXA images, lifestyle and socioeconomic data, and medication records were available. Per cohort, the 16S rRNA sequencing data, derived from stool, were processed with the DADA2 pipeline and taxonomies were assigned using the SILVA reference database. In addition, the microbiome functional potential was obtained with PICRUSt2. Further, we investigated the association between the human gut microbiome (alpha diversity, genera and predicted functional pathways) and appendicular lean mass (ALM), femoral neck bone mineral density (FN-BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) using multilinear regression models controlling for multiple confounders, and performed a joint analysis from both cohorts. Sex-stratified analyses were also conducted.

ResultsThe gut microbiome alpha diversity was not associated with either tested phenotype after accounting for multiple-testing (P>1.67e-02). In the joint analysis, lower abundance of Oscillibacter (beta= -0.51, 95%CI [-0.74, -0.29]), Anaerotruncus (beta=-0.41, 95%CI [-0.61, - 0.21]), Eisenbergiella (beta=-0.39, 95%CI [-0.59, -0.19]) and higher abundance of Agathobacter (beta=0.40, 95%CI [0.20, 0.60]) were associated with higher ALM (P<2.0e-04). Lower abundance of Anaerotruncus (beta=-0.32, 95%CI [-0.45, -0.19]), Hungatella (beta=-0.26, 95%CI [-0.38, -0.15]) and Clostridiales bacterium DTU089 (beta=-0.37, 95%CI [-0.55, -0.19]) was associated with higher ALM only in females (P< 2.0e-04). Moreover, the biotin biosynthesis II pathway was positively associated with ALM (beta=0.44, 95% CI [0.24, 0.64]) (P<1.90e-04) in females while no associations were observed in males. We did not observe any robust association of bone traits with gut microbiome features.

ConclusionOur results indicate that specific genera are associated with ALM in middle-aged and older adults and these associations can present in a sex-specific manner. Overall, our study suggests that the gut microbiome is linked to muscle aging in middle-aged and older adults. However, larger sample sizes are still needed to underpin the specific microbiome features involved.","NA","medrxiv",1743545345558

As ZIKV spread into new geographic regions, it now has the potential to interact with many novel potential host species whose susceptibility to the virus has yet to be determined. Mathematical models predict a sylvatic reservoir host of ZIKV, with non-human primates (NHPs) as the likely candidates, though outbreaks in areas without NHPs suggest the presence of other unidentified sylvatic reservoir hosts. Bats, with their ability to fly and live in or near human structures, are plausible ZIKV reservoirs. However, their competence as hosts for ZIKV remains unresolved. In this study, we investigate the immune response of Old World and New World bats to ZIKV infection in vitro. Through comparative growth curves and transcriptomic analyses, we assess ZIKV susceptibility of cells derived from the Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) and the Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus). R. aegyptiacus cells were susceptible to both African and Asian ZIKV isolates, while we observed little to no ZIKV replication in A. jamaicensis cells. Notably, ZIKV elicited a strong anti-inflammatory response in the R. aegyptiacus cell line, in contrast to the dampened inflammatory response in these bats to other viruses including Marburg virus.

AUTHOR SUMMARYThis study investigates how different lineages of Zika virus (ZIKV) interact with bat cells, specifically examining the cellular inflammatory responses. We demonstrate that cells from Old World bats (R06E cells derived from an Egyptian rousette bat) are permissive to infection by both lineages, supporting viral replication. This permissiveness suggests these cells can support the virus lifecycle, potentially facilitating broader transmission. In contrast, cells from New World bats (Aji cells from Jamaican fruit bats) exhibit low susceptibility to ZIKV, with negligible viral replication observed, suggesting an inherent resistance or lack of necessary factors for ZIKV to effectively initiate its lifecycle in this cell culture model. Our findings highlight the critical role of specific host cell characteristics in ZIKV transmission and underscore the importance of cellular context in understanding the viruss capability to induce an inflammatory immune response. By exploring the interactions of ZIKV with different bat cells, our research provides insights into the ecological and epidemiological complexities of ZIKV and provides insights into the evolutionary history of this virus.","NA","biorxiv",1743545345558

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1743545345558
