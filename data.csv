MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1744841307939

Silencing occurs with both randomly integrated transgenes, introduced via transposase or lentiviral methods, and with transgenes targeted to specific genomic sites, including at commonly used safe harbor loci. The challenge to robustly express experimental transgenes in differentiated pluripotent stem cells is a major bottleneck in the field for applications such as CRISPR screening. Here, we conducted a comparative analysis to systematically evaluate the impact of various promoters, transcriptional regulatory elements, insulators, and genomic integration sites on transgene silencing during neuronal differentiation. Our findings reveal that specific combinations of promoters and transcriptional stability elements are able to prevent transgene silencing during differentiation, whereas chromatin insulators had less impact on silencing and three novel safe harbor integration sites performed similarly to the CLYBL locus. Guided by these insights we developed the PiggyBac vector TK4, which showed complete resistance to transgene silencing across various neuronal and microglial differentiation protocols from six different pluripotent stem cell lines, as independently confirmed by seven different laboratories. This construct will be highly useful for assays requiring stable transgene expression during differentiation, and holds the potential for broad applications in various research fields.","NA","biorxiv",1744841307939

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1744841307939

DNA convolutional neural networks (CNNs) attain state-of-the-art performance at predicting variant effects on gene regulation. However, most applications of such models focus on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as technical challenges limit their application to insertions and deletions (indels). Sequence shifts from indels introduce technical variance in deep CNNs through misalignment of pooling blocks and output boundaries, creating artificially inflated variant effect scores compared to SNPs and confounding their interpretation. In this work, we demonstrate this technical variance in model predictions and present two strategies based on data augmentation with sequence shifts that reduce it. Applied to the state-of-the-art Borzoi model, our stitching approach improves indel eQTL classification accuracy across GTEx tissues. Furthermore, we demonstrate these techniques and observe compelling eQTL concordance for larger structural variants and tandem repeats. We additionally introduce in silico deletion (ISD) as an interpretation technique and validate it using MPRA data, demonstrating concordance between predicted and experimental measurements for deletion effects. Our strategies expand the utility of regulatory sequence machine learning for studying the full spectrum of noncoding genetic variation in human development and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1744841307939

Despite growing research on pandemic response factors, the effectiveness of different strategic approaches to Covid-19 control remains insufficiently investigated.

AimsTo examine associations between Covid-19 pandemic control strategies (including stringent border restrictions) with age-standardized excess mortality and GDP per capita growth outcomes during 2020-2021.

MethodsAnalysis of 193 sovereign jurisdictions with existing Global Burden of Disease Study data. Jurisdictions were classified by implementation of exclusion/elimination strategies reported in published literature, and the level of border restriction measures based on the Oxford Stringency Index. Multivariable analyses adjusted for island status, GDP per capita, and an index of government corruption. Excess mortality was cube root transformed and GDP per capita log transformed for regression analysis.

ResultsJurisdictions implementing explicit exclusion/elimination strategies showed the lowest age-standardized excess mortality (-2.1/100,000) compared to others (166.5/100,000). Island jurisdictions experienced lower mortality (64.8/100,000) than non-islands (194.3/100,000). Duration of border restrictions correlated with reduced excess mortality in islands (Pearsons r = -0.624, p <0.001; {beta} -0.004, island interaction -0.005, p <0.001), but not in non-islands. However, this effect weakened when controlling for government corruption in a subsample (lower corruption was associated with lowered mortality). No consistent significant relationships emerged between border measures and GDP growth, suggesting that stringent border restrictions in a pandemic may not significantly harm economies.

ConclusionExclusion/elimination strategies and related stringent border restrictions were associated with better health outcomes, particularly for islands. Effectiveness was likely partially mediated by governance quality. Future pandemic planning should consider both control strategy selection and implementation context, both of which are modifiable.","NA","medrxiv",1744841307939

Reference point-dependence, a valuation bias shared by eminent adaptation level and prospect theories, is often cited as the underlying computational mechanism. However, whether these behavioural and computational mechanisms are preserved across species is unknown. To fill this gap, we designed a reinforcement learning task that was adapted for both humans (homo sapiens sapiens) and rats (rattus norvegicus). Behavioural analyses indicated robust relative value encoding in both species. At the computational level, reference point-dependence provided a reliable account of reinforcement learning behaviour in humans and rats. Despite these major similarities between species, some distinct differences in behavioural and computational modelling parameters were also observed. Overall, our study demonstrates that relative value encoding is a robust feature of reinforcement learning that is conserved across human and rat species.","NA","biorxiv",1744841307939

However, the impact of experiencing discrimination on long-term patterns of healthcare utilization is unknown. Objective: To assess how perceived discrimination in healthcare settings is associated with longitudinal patterns of doctor visits among middle-aged and older adults in the United States. Design: Prospective cohort study of US adults in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) who were followed every 2 years for up to 14 years (2008-2020). Setting: US population-based cohort study. Participants: Adults aged 50-80 years at baseline who completed the HRS psychosocial questionnaire, answered the question on discrimination in healthcare settings, had complete covariate information, and had at least two waves of follow-up data. Exposure: Discrimination in healthcare settings was measured at baseline as the self-reported frequency of 'receiving poorer treatment than others from doctors or hospitals.' Responses were dichotomized to indicate any experience of discrimination. Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of doctor visits in the prior two years were reported by participants at each wave. Group-based trajectory models (GBTM) were used to identify distinct longitudinal trajectories (patterns) of doctor visits over time. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine associations between discrimination in healthcare and trajectories of doctor visits while adjusting for sociodemographic, behavioral, and health-related factors. Results: Among 13,422 participants (mean age {approx}63.0 years [{+/-}8.0]), approximately 19.4%, reported experiencing discrimination in healthcare at baseline. Results identified five major patterns of doctor visits over time: 'Low' ({approx}2 visits/year, 35.5%), 'Frequent' ({approx}4.5 visits/year, 33.3%), 'Frequent-to-High' ({approx}4.5 to 9 visits/year, 13.7%), 'High-to-Frequent' ({approx}13.5 to 6 visits/year, 10.3%), and 'High' ({approx}11+ visits/year, 6.3%). Discrimination in healthcare was more prevalent among participants with higher-utilization patterns and among those with greater disease burden and social vulnerability. Compared to participants with Low doctor visits, perceived discrimination was significantly greater in those with High-to-Frequent (relative risk ratio [RRR]=1.38; 95% CI, 1.17 - 1.63; P<.001) and High (RRR=1.62; 95% CI, 1.30 - 2.03; P<.001) patterns of doctor visits. Conclusions and Relevance: Discrimination in healthcare settings is associated with greater numbers of doctor visits, possibly indicating it as a marker of poor quality of care.","NA","medrxiv",1744841307939

Real-word data on relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) between mRNA- and protein-based vaccines are limited, and more data are needed on disease outcomes in this age group.

MethodsThe K-COV-N database, COVID-19 vaccine registry, and health insurance claims were retrospectively reviewed to identify adolescents (12-18-year-olds) in South Korea who received a homologous primary series of NVX-CoV2373 or BNT162b2 and a heterologous or homologous third vaccine dose. Vaccine recipients were propensity score matched to reduce confounding baseline factors. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for any medically attended COVID- 19 post vaccination (starting 14 days post primary series and 7 days post third dose) were calculated to assess rVE every 30 days through a 180-day risk window.

ResultsFrom February to December 2022, 3174 and 6253 doses of NVX-CoV2373 and BNT162b2, respectively, were administered to South Korean adolescents. Individuals who received NVX-CoV2373 tended to be older, have a disability, and/or have a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Propensity score matching resulted in 107 individuals in each primary series group and 701 and 1417 individuals in the NVX-CoV2373 and BNT162b2 third-dose groups, respectively. The aHR (95% CI) for NVX-CoV2373 compared with BNT162b2 for medically attended COVID-19 in the 180-day risk window was 0.57 (0.31-1.05) for the primary series and 0.68 (0.54-0.84) for the third dose.

DiscussionThese results suggest that NVX-CoV2373 may provide more robust protection against medically attended COVID-19, compared to BNT162b2, both as a homologous primary series and as a homologous or heterologous third dose.

Implications and ContributionsThis study provides essential data on the real-world effectiveness of a protein-based (NVX- CoV2373) and an mRNA-based (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents. A homologous primary series and homologous/heterologous third dose of NVX-CoV2373 provided more robust protection than BNT162b2 at preventing medically attended COVID-19, with protection demonstrated through 6 months post vaccination.","NA","medrxiv",1744841307939

Accurate modeling of protein-peptide complexes is crucial for understanding fundamental biological processes and for advancing peptide-based drug design. However, due to the high conformational flexibility of peptides, predicting their interactions with proteins remains a significant challenge. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), exemplified by all-atom protein folding neural networks (PFNNs) such as AlphaFold3 (AF3), have expanded predictive capabilities beyond proteins to encompass protein-peptide complexes. Nevertheless, existing evaluations of these methods are often limited in scope and lack systematic, multi-dimensional, and fair comparisons of PFNN performance in protein-peptide complex prediction.

This dataset includes 261 protein-peptide complexes with peptide lengths ranging from 5 to 30 residues. Our benchmark results indicate that AF3 outperforms other PFNNs in prediction accuracy and structural validation. However, its performance remains insufficient for practical peptide drug discovery, indicating room for improvement. It is expected that PepPCBench can provide some valuable insights into the enhancement of protein-peptide complex structure prediction and the development of peptide-based therapeutics.

"A stochastic ratchet during genome streamlining can commit insect endosymbionts to a parasitic or mutualistic fate","10.1101/2025.04.10.648247","biorxiv",3,3,3,3,3,"Grigaitis, P.; Teusink, B.; LeBoeuf, A.

As bacteria transitioned to live inside host cells, free-living bacterial ancestors of endosymbionts reduced their genomes in a process known as streamlining. Contemporary endosymbioses represent at least two distinct life strategies: endosymbionts either become unilaterally dependent on host-derived resources (uni-obligate) or enter bidirectionally obligate mutualistic relationships (bi-obligate endosymbiosis). It is an open question whether these paths taken by free-living bacteria can be sequential, or alternatively, if commitment takes place early, making these strategies mutually exclusive. In this study, we quantified metabolic capacity of different endosymbionts to contextualize genome streamlining in terms of organismal function. We show that uni-obligate endosymbionts of insects have lost substantial parts of their metabolic capacity that are present both in free-living bacteria and bi-obligate endosymbionts. On the contrary, genomes of uni-obligate endosymbionts contain more genes which can be attributed to scavenging host resources. In sum, we challenge the existing notion that bi-obligate endosymbionts have emerged from uni-obligate ones, and rather, propose a stochastic ratchet model: in early stages of endosymbiosis, bacteria get locked into either a more mutualistic or more parasitic relationship with the host depending on the first losses during streamlining.","NA","biorxiv",1744841307939

Much of the qualitative research on Long Covid has been based on people attending specialist clinical services or who have accessed support groups. We describe the varied ways in which a diverse group of people in a community sample experience, recognise and manage persistent symptoms following COVID-19.

MethodsQualitative interview study nested within the large, community-based REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study in England. Participants reporting persistent symptoms following COVID-19 were asked for consent to be contacted about a follow-up interview. We then purposively sampled by age, gender, ethnicity and symptom severity and conducted 60 interviews. Analysis was carried out using a reflexive thematic analysis approach.

ResultsParticipants were an ethnically diverse group aged between 18 and 80 years who reported symptoms following COVID-19 for between a few months and more than two years. Many had not accessed clinical care or specific Long Covid support, and some did not identify with the category of long covid, rendering their experiences largely invisible. Participants highlighted the ways in which they self-manage symptoms within this context, and the varied burden of coping with ongoing health problems.

ConclusionThis diverse sample of people with Long Covid report a range of challenges managing this emerging and contested condition, with uncertainty affecting their own understanding and the validation they receive from professionals, family and friends. These challenges intersect with others such as racism, and are compounded by a lack of specific resources for Long Covid as well as over-stretched health services in the UK. Nevertheless, people show resilience in their self-management, seeking information and support from a range of sources.

The brains automatic reactivity to cannabis cues can trigger craving and subsequent use. This study aimed to test neural activity during cannabis cue-induced craving in non-treatment seeking individuals with moderate-to-severe CUD, with past attempts to cut down/quit.

MethodsThe study examined 65 individuals with moderate-to-severe CUD and 43 controls, with a fMRI cannabis cue-induced craving task and assessment of mental health, substance use, and cognitive testing. Group differences in neural cue-induced craving were examined, adjusting for age and sex; correlations with cannabis use characteristics were assessed, accounting for recent substance use.

ResultsIndividuals with a CUD relative to controls showed greater brain activity during cannabis cue-induced craving in the superior/middle occipital, medial/lateral OFC, anterior/posterior cingulate, cerebellar, hippocampus, middle temporal and lateral parietal cortices (p < .05; cluster k > 10, FWE-corrected). Greater occipital/cerebellar activity correlated with greater subjective arousal towards cannabis images and cannabis withdrawal scores, while anterior cingulate/inferior parietal activity negatively correlated with urinary level of 11-Nor-9-carboxy-{Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol:creatinine (ps<.05).

ConclusionsExposure to cannabis cues can elicit greater activity within salience evaluation/attention, motivation and disinhibition pathways of addiction neurocircuitry in people with moderate-to-severe CUD, consistent with prominent neuroscientific theories of addiction and findings with other substances. Interventions which can suppress brain activity in salience and attention circuits during cannabis-induced craving may help reduce craving and subsequent use.","NA","medrxiv",1744841307939

The recent evolutionary rescue of the cereal crop sorghum via RMES1 aphid resistance is among a few known in situ cases, but its pangenomic origins and molecular basis is not yet known. Here, we describe the behavioral effects, molecular endophenotypes, and pangenomic evolution underlying this evolutionary rescue. Analysis of near-isogenic lines show that RMES1 disrupts phloem feeding via global immunity activation of conserved defense networks. A growth-to-defense transition is evidenced by extensive transcriptome remodeling (>15% of expressed genes) and mediated by salicylic acid signaling. Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptor genes at the RMES1 locus harbored on a large tandem duplication have extensive copy number variation across the sorghum pangenome. The likely causative NLRs (RMES1A and RMES1B) were inferred from expression and structural variation. The NLRs encoded at RMES1 lack an N-terminal signaling domain and have nucleotide-binding domain sequence variation expected to result in a loss of ATP binding, suggesting RMES1 NLRs function via a noncanonical mechanism. The RMES1 NLR family is shared across the grass super-pangenome and includes the brown planthopper resistance gene BPH40 in Oryza sativa, which is syntenic to RMES1. Finally, k-mer analysis of RMES1 haplotypes in the sorghum pangenome established the East African origin of rare standing variation for resistance. Thus, the birth-and-death process at an ancient gene cluster generated pangenomic variation that was recruited to activate coordinated defense pathways and provide evolutionary rescue.","NA","biorxiv",1744841307939

However, the specific biological mechanisms through which PA protects against disease are not entirely understood. To address this knowledge gap, we first assessed the conventional observational associations of three self-reported and three device-based PA measures with circulating levels of 2,911 plasma proteins measured in the UK Biobank (nmax=39,160) and assessed functional enrichment of identified proteins. We then used bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) to further evaluate the evidence for causal relationships of PA with protein levels. Finally, we performed mediation analyses to identify proteins that may mediate the relationship of PA with incident all-cause dementia. Our findings revealed 41 proteins consistently associated with all PA measures and 1,027 proteins associated with at least one PA measure. Both conventional observational and MR study designs converged on proteins that appear to increase as a result of PA, including integrin proteins such as ITGAV and ITGAM, as well as MXRA8, CLEC4A, CLEC4M, GFRA1, and ADGRG2; and on proteins that appear to decrease as a result of PA such as LEP, LPL, INHBC, CLMP, PTGDS, ADM, OGN, and PI3. Functional enrichment analyses revealed several relevant processes, including cell-matrix adhesion, integrin-mediated signaling, and collagen binding. Finally, several proteins, including GDF15, ITGAV, HPGDS, BCAN, and MENT, were found to mediate the relationship of PA with all-cause dementia, implicating processes such as synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis and inflammation, through which PA protects against dementia. Our results provide insights into how PA may affect biological processes and protect from all-cause dementia, and provide avenues for future research into the health-promoting effects of PA.","NA","medrxiv",1744841307939

These two aspects of meaning are traditionally studied separately, resulting in two large, multi-method literatures, which we sought to bring together in this study. Not only would this address basic cognitive questions of how semantic cognition operates but also because, despite their distinct focuses, both literatures ascribe a critical role to the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in each aspect of semantics. Given these considerations, we explored the notion that these systems rely on common underlying computational principles when activating conceptual semantic representations via single words, vs. building a coherent semantic representation across sequences of words. The present study used magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography to track brain activity in participants reading nouns and adjective-noun phrases, whilst integrating conceptual variables from both literatures: the concreteness of nouns (e.g., ""lettuce"" vs. ""fiction"") and the denotational semantics of adjectives (subsective vs. privative; e.g., ""bad"" vs. ""fake""). Region-of-interest analyses show that the left, and to a lesser extent the right, ATLs responded more strongly to phrases at different timepoints, irrespective of concreteness, suggesting a unified ATL function for semantic memory and composition. Decoding analyses further revealed a time-varying representational format for adjective semantics, whereas representations of noun concreteness were more stable and maintained for around 300 ms. Further, the neural representation of noun concreteness was modulated by the preceding adjectives: decoders learning concreteness signals in single words generalized better to subsective relative to privative phrases.","NA","biorxiv",1744841307939

These set points are established early and are stable through adulthood, suggesting they are immutable. Here we challenge this idea using an ethological vision-dependent prey capture learning paradigm in juvenile rats. This learning required visual cortex (V1), and enhanced tuning of V1 neurons to specific behavioral epochs. Chronic recordings revealed a slow, state-dependent increase in V1 firing that began after learning was complete and persisted for days. This upward firing rate plasticity was gradual, gated by wake states, and in L2/3 was driven by a TNF-dependent increase in excitatory synapses onto pyramidal neurons - all features of homeostatic plasticity within V1. Finally, TNF inhibition after learning reduced retention of hunting skills. Thus, naturalistic learning in juvenile animals co-opts homeostatic forms of plasticity to reset firing rate setpoints within V1, in a process that facilitates skill consolidation.","NA","biorxiv",1744841307939

Sex and gender mandates were introduced in grant competitions to increase womens health research. This study aimed to understand what type of womens health research is being funded and prioritized in open grant competitions in Canada. Methods: Publicly available funded Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) project grant abstracts from 2020 and 2023 were coded for the mention of sex, gender, two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer plus (2S/LGBTQ+), and female-specific research and assessed for changes in research representation and funding. A deeper analysis of funded female-specific grant abstracts from 2023 and 2009-2020 was conducted to assess if grant abstracts focused on the 11 areas of global disease burden and death that disproportionately affect females, and if this has evolved over time. Results: The percentage of abstracts mentioning sex, gender and 2S/LGBTQ+ doubled or quadrupled from 2020 to 2023, but remained at under 10% of overall funded abstracts. In contrast, female-specific research representation did not change over time, and remained at ~7% of all research. Importantly, female-specific research largely focused on cancers (breast, gynecologic) or pregnancy. We also examined research funding representation for the top 11 global burden of disease or death for females across the 13 years and observed that cancer accounted for 2.07% of funding, whereas the other top 10 collectively accounted for 2.21% across 13 years. Conclusions: Despite mandates for integrated sex and gender based analyses in Canada, research acknowledging which population is explored remains under 10%. Mandates are not affecting the percentage of funding for womens health grants. More efforts and support beyond sex and gender mandates are needed to increase funding for and to diversify female-specific research beyond pregnancy and cancer.

We evaluated yield of symptom and chest radiograph (CXR) screening of TB-exposed household contacts (HHC) in South Africa.

MethodsAdult volunteers ([&ge;]18 years) with household exposure to pulmonary TB patients were enrolled at three sites. Systematic screening of TB symptoms (any duration), CXR (any abnormality), and sputum microscopy, Xpert Ultra, and liquid culture were performed. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured by multiplex bead array. Prevalent TB was microbiologically-confirmed (Xpert Ultra or culture). Symptomatic and asymptomatic TB were defined as prevalent TB with and without reported symptoms, respectively.

ResultsBetween March 2021 - December 2022, 979 HHC were enrolled; 185 (18.9%) living with HIV and 187 (19.1%) with previous TB. Prevalent TB occurred in 51 (5.2%) and was asymptomatic in 42/51 (82.4%). Only 13/42 (31.0%) asymptomatic TB cases were smear-positive [8/13 (61.5%) graded scanty or 1+]. CRP did not discriminate healthy HHC from those with asymptomatic TB (AUC 0.60; 95%CI 0.47-0.73). An abnormal CXR was observed in 23/41 asymptomatic (sensitivity 56.1%, 95%CI 41.0-70.1%) versus 8/9 symptomatic (sensitivity 88.9%, 95%CI 56.5-98.0%) TB cases. Sensitivity of CXR in combination with symptom screening was 64.0% (32/50, 95%CI 50.1-75.9%) for all prevalent TB.

ConclusionsMore than 80% of confirmed TB cases among HHC were asymptomatic. CXR screening missed more than 40% of these asymptomatic cases. Community prevalence surveys reliant on symptom- and CXR-based approaches may significantly underestimate the prevalence of asymptomatic TB in endemic countries.

FundingSupported by RePORT South Africa through funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, CRDF Global, and the South African Medical Research Council.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWorld Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for systematic tuberculosis (TB) screening recommend symptom screening and chest radiography (CXR), based on a Cochrane meta-analysis reporting 70.6% sensitivity (any TB symptom) and 94.7% sensitivity (any CXR abnormality) for bacteriologically-confirmed pulmonary TB. National TB prevalence surveys rely on a positive symptom screen or abnormal CXR to trigger diagnostic sputum testing. This approach to community screening would, by definition, miss asymptomatic TB cases without CXR evidence of disease.

We reviewed the reference list of the aforementioned meta-analysis for active case-finding studies of adolescents and adults aged 15 years and older in community and contact-tracing settings. We performed forward citation-tracking and searched reference lists, including studies published in English between Jan 1, 1980, and November 1, 2024. We excluded studies that included children <15 years; or that exclusively enrolled people with additional risk factors (HIV; diabetes; latent TB infection; prior TB). We found 28 studies that performed universal sputum testing for bacteriologically-confirmed pulmonary TB and reported 51.8% (95%CI 49.9-53.7%; I2 = 89.2%) pooled sensitivity for symptom screening (any symptom; 24 studies, 2,969 TB cases) and 62.4% (95%CI 59.3-65.3%; I2 = 88.3%) pooled sensitivity for CXR (any abnormality; 10 studies, 1,123 TB cases). Only four studies (145 TB cases) reported accuracy of symptom screening in parallel with chest radiography (pooled sensitivity 67.3%, 95%CI 57.3-75.9%; I2 = 87.1%), but these studies did not disaggregate symptomatic and asymptomatic disease.

Added value of this studyWe performed systematic screening using universal sputum microbiological testing of 978 household contacts of pulmonary TB patients in three South African communities and compared symptom (any duration) and CXR (any abnormality) screening approaches against a microbiological reference standard. We detected confirmed pulmonary TB in 5.2% of household contacts, and 82.4% of these TB cases reported no TB symptoms. Asymptomatic TB in household contacts was pauci-bacillary and associated with low serum CRP levels that were indistinguishable from healthy controls, but distinct from symptomatic TB in a comparator group of clinic attendees. Sensitivity of CXR screening for asymptomatic TB was only 56.1%; sensitivity of combined symptom and CXR screening for all TB was marginally higher at 64.0%.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings from household contacts suggest that symptom- and CXR-based approaches are inadequate for community TB screening in South Africa and do not meet the WHO Target Product Profile for a TB screening test (minimum 90% sensitivity; 70% specificity). National TB Prevalence Surveys that omit universal sputum microbiological testing may significantly underestimate the prevalence of asymptomatic TB in high-burden countries.","NA","medrxiv",1744841307939

A lipopolysaccharide (LPS) layer linked to the outer membrane is essential for survival in most species of bacteria, primarily by providing structural stability and regulating selective chemical permeability. These functions make the LPS layer a key pathogenicity determinant, protecting bacteria from host defences. At the same time, it serves as a common receptor for multiple bacteriophage orders, making it a crucial point of bacterial vulnerability. LPS outer core typing is traditionally performed using immunoblotting and PCR. With the increasing availability of sequenced genomes, PCR has emerged as the primary method for typing. This study presents a set of nine oligonucleotides designed for typing the five LPS outer core structures of Escherichia coli: R1, R2, R3, R4, and K-12, both in vitro and in silico. Our method was able to successfully type 99% of strains within a comprehensive dataset of 4549 complete genomes. Using these new methods, we identify previously unreported hybrid LPS structures involving R2 and K-12 outer core types and establish associations between LPS outer core types and E. coli phylogenetic groups, pathogenicity, O-antigen polysaccharides, and capsule types. We also introduce LPSTyper, a Python-based command-line tool that enables rapid and precise LPS outer core typing in E. coli genome sequences. Together, the expanded dataset of LPS outer core types and enhanced laboratory and computational tools for their detection provide new insights into LPS structural evolution and its role in E. coli ecology and pathogenicity. We anticipate these tools will improve the efficiency of future research and diagnostics of this important bacterial envelope structure.

Impact StatementBacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) layer types are important for determining both pathogenicity potential and phage susceptibility. This study presents a robust and scalable framework for precise typing of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) outer core types, enabled by the development of nine novel oligos targeting the waa locus. Using the LPSTyper tool for in silico analysis and a simple PCR-based method for in vitro validation, this approach allows rapid and accurate typing across thousands of genomes, supporting large-scale monitoring of LPS diversity in both commensal and pathogenic E. coli populations. Our findings reveal strong associations between LPS outer core types, O-antigens, capsules, phylogenetic groups, and pathotypes, highlighting the critical role of LPS structure in virulence, immune evasion, and environmental adaptation. The discovery of hybrid and novel waa locus arrangements further underscores the evolutionary plasticity of LPS biosynthesis. Overall, this work provides essential tools and insights for genomic surveillance and deepens our understanding of E. coli surface structure variability central to host-pathogen interactions and antimicrobial resistance.

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1744841307939

We previously showed that the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus evolves resistance to the dual-targeting fluoroquinolone delafloxacin (DLX) that inhibits both the DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV via gene amplifications of an efflux pump encoding gene sdrM. However, the pathways that control the formation or selection of gene amplifications, and consequently adaptive trajectories, remain understudied, especially in gram-positive bacteria like S. aureus. Here, we show that specific DNA repair and chromosomal separation pathways alter the frequency of formation and selection of gene amplifications in S. aureus. Through a screen of 36 mutants deficient in various DNA processes, we found that while sdrM amplification was still the almost universal path to DLX resistance, other mutations that increased sdrM expression reduced the selection frequency of sdrM amplifications, demonstrating the critical role of sdrM in DLX resistance. We found that similar to other bacteria, the formation and loss of sdrM amplifications required a functional RecA recombinase, but multiple other mutants in pathways required for amplifications in other species still exhibited frequent sdrM amplifications, suggesting that S. aureus may have alternate routes of amplification formation. Finally, mutants in the tyrosine recombinase XerC that is involved in chromosomal separation were deficient for sdrM amplifications, indicating that XerC is a novel modulator of amplification formation, maintenance, or selection. Thus, our work sheds light on genetic factors that alter gene amplification-mediated evolutionary trajectories to antibiotic resistance in S. aureus and can potentially unlock mechanisms by which such evolution of resistance can be inhibited.","NA","biorxiv",1744841307939

Given the increased RA burden in women, and well-known correlations between the vaginal microbiota and local inflammation, we seek to understand the vaginal microenvironment in the context of RA pathology.

MethodsSelf-collected vaginal swabs and questionnaires on dietary and health practices were obtained from 36 RA and 50 demographically-matched control women, 18-63 years of age. Additionally, medication regimen and disease activity and severity were captured for the RA cohort. Vaginal swabs were subjected to full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex cytokine analyses, and quantification of rheumatoid factor, c-reactive protein, and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs).

ResultsVaginal microbial richness and genera Peptoniphilus and Prevotella, among other rare taxa, were elevated in RA versus control samples. Vaginal IL-18 and EGF levels were increased in the RA group; IL-18 correlated with multiple microbial features whereas EGF levels were not associated with bacterial composition or other host factors. Within the RA cohort, decreased relative abundance of Streptococcus was associated with joint pathologies, and Lactobacillus gasseri was lower in individuals with serum detection of ACPAs and rheumatoid factor. Vaginal ACPAs were higher in the RA group and positively correlated with Streptococcus and multiple vaginal inflammatory cytokines.

ConclusionsWe describe vaginal microbial and immunological differences in women with RA, particularly when accounting for diet and menopausal status, disease activity and severity, and medication use. This work opens a new avenue in the multidisciplinary approach to RA patient care.","NA","medrxiv",1744841307939

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1744841307939

While some lateralized functions are evident in other species, the human brain displays a strong, species-wide bias. Despite the evolutionary and functional significance of these asymmetries, their molecular and cellular foundations remain poorly understood. Here, we identify key neurochemical and cellular asymmetries that underpin cortical lateralization. Specifically, we demonstrate lateralized gradients in neurotransmitter receptor densities, particularly along the acetylcholine-norepinephrine axis, as well as asymmetries in mitochondrial distribution and the spatial prevalence of microglia and glutamatergic excitatory neurons. Using a multimodal approach that integrates in vivo functional MRI, PET imaging, and post-mortem transcriptomic and cellular data, we delineate two distinct cortical clusters: a left-lateralized network centered on language processing and a right-lateralized network supporting visuospatial attention. These results highlight a biologically embedded substrate for lateralized cognition that may inform both evolutionary theory and our mechanistic understanding of neuropsychiatric illnesses characterized by disrupted lateralization.","NA","biorxiv",1744841307939

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

Many recent studies have quantified their adverse events with a focus on gastrointestinal adverse events. However, no large epidemiologic study has investigated the risk of hair loss with these medications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone. The adjusted hazard ratio for hair loss for all patients using semaglutide, for men, and for women compared to bupropion-naltrexone were 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.86-2.69), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.05-14.49), and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.17-3.72) respectively. Our results demonstrate an increased risk of hair loss with semaglutide in women.

In less studied organisms without annotated genomes, it can seem impossible to perform proteomic analysis. In this study we sought to answer the question - does enough information exist to do proteomics on any organism we want? As a case study we started with material available due to an infestation of a home with black widow spiders. Thanks to the recent publication of an annotated genome for one species of black widow spider, we were able to identify 5502 protein groups and assign putative annotations using ortholog mapping. We also demonstrate that had we not had this resource, over 2000 proteins could be identified using other available spider genome annotations, despite their unrelatedness. Moreover, regardless of spider proteome used, proteins annotated as toxins were almost exclusively observed in the main body of the mature female black widow spider. Overall, these results provide a draft proteome map for the black widow spider and valuable data for validating machine learning models, while also suggesting that the door to insightful quantitative proteomics may already be open for millions of less studied organisms. All raw and processed proteomic data are available through the ProteomeXchange repository as accession PXD051601.

Despite their importance, our understanding of the cell biology of sporozoite formation and salivary gland invasion is limited. Here, we apply a technique called Mosquito Tissue Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (MoTissU-ExM), which physically expands infected mosquito tissues while preserving both host and parasite ultrastructure. Using MoTissU-ExM we are able to observe a range of parasite structures and organelles including features previously seen only by electron microscopy as well as structure not observed before. We leverage MoTissU-ExM to investigate a number of cell biology events during sporozoite formation and salivary gland invasion. In particular we focus on the rhoptries, a secretory organelle important for host cell invasion. We establish a timeline for sporozoite rhoptry biogenesis, show that two rhoptries are used up during salivary gland invasion, and provide the first evidence that rhoptry pairs are specialized for different invasion events. Building on this new knowledge, we characterize the rhoptry protein RON11 and identify it as the first protein involved in sporozoite rhoptry biogenesis. Disruption of RON11 led to the production of sporozoites that specifically fail to invade the salivary gland epithelial cell, thereby blocking transmission of these parasites.","NA","biorxiv",1744841307939

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1744841307939
