Here, we systematically review over 3,600 abstracts, and identify a dozen end-to-end impact attribution studies on human health outcomes published between 2016 and 2023. Based on these studies, we find that estimates of attributable mortality range from 10 to over 271,000 deaths, depending on timescale, spatial extent, climate hazard, and cause of death. We calculate that this loss of life amounts to up to US$ trillions in monetary value when using standard valuation approaches. So far, end-to-end attribution studies capture only a small fraction of the presumed global burden of climate change, with few studies addressing infectious and non-communicable diseases, and no subnational or event-specific studies focused on a location outside of Europe and the United States. However, the field of health impact attribution is poised to explode in the next decade, putting unprecedented pressure on policymakers to take action for human health.","NA","medrxiv",1723241366495

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1723241366495

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1723241366495

MethodsThis study uses the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to investigate the potential relationship between vaccinations and the incidence of NMOSD, AE, and MOGAD. Potential risk factors, such as age, sex, type of vaccine, and previous history of autoimmune diseases, were examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

ResultsOur analysis included 161 cases: 72 NMOSD, 82 AE, and 7 MOGAD. The COVID-19 vaccine was implicated in 19/72 (26.3%) NMOSD, 43/82 (52.4%) of AE and 6/7 (85.7%) of MOGAD. The subacute temporal profile (OR 24.4, p = 0.004) and the presence of any comorbidity (OR 12.49, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with hospitalization for those with NMOSD. The subacute onset of symptoms and encephalopathy was statistically significant for hospitalization (OR 6.15, p = 0.048) and (OR 10.3, p = 0.005) respectively for patients with AE. Anti-NMDAR (N-methyl D-aspartate) antibodies were observed in 16/24 (66.7%) of AE. Treatment often involved high-dose corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

ConclusionsMost cases of vaccine induced NMOSD, AE, and MOGAD occurred secondary to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The subacute onset of symptoms and the presence of encephalopathy was most associated with hospitalization.","NA","medrxiv",1723241366495

From this family, we estimate an average of 192 DNMs per generation, including 75.5 de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 7.4 non-tandem repeat indels, 79.6 de novo indels or structural variants (SVs) originating from tandem repeats, 7.7 centromeric de novo SVs and SNVs, and 12.4 de novo Y chromosome events per generation. STRs and VNTRs are the most mutable with 32 loci exhibiting recurrent mutation through the generations. We accurately assemble 288 centromeres and six Y chromosomes across the generations, documenting de novo SVs, and demonstrate that the DNM rate varies by an order of magnitude depending on repeat content, length, and sequence identity. We show a strong paternal bias (75-81%) for all forms of germline DNM, yet we estimate that 17% of de novo SNVs are postzygotic in origin with no paternal bias. We place all this variation in the context of a high-resolution recombination map ([~]3.5 kbp breakpoint resolution). We observe a strong maternal recombination bias (1.36 maternal:paternal ratio) with a consistent reduction in the number of crossovers with increasing paternal (r=0.85) and maternal (r=0.65) age. However, we observe no correlation between meiotic crossover locations and de novo SVs, arguing against non-allelic homologous recombination as a predominant mechanism. The use of multiple orthogonal technologies, near-telomere-to-telomere phased genome assemblies, and a multi-generation family to assess transmission has created the most comprehensive, publicly available ""truth set"" of all classes of genomic variants. The resource can be used to test and benchmark new algorithms and technologies to understand the most fundamental processes underlying human genetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366495

Current methods, including PCR and rapid antigen tests (RAT), have limitations in speed, sensitivity, and the requirement for specialized equipment and trained personnel. Nanotechnology, particularly upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), offer a promising alternative due to their unique optical properties. UCNPs can convert low-energy near-infrared (NIR) light into higher-energy visible light, making them ideal for use as optical probes in single molecule detection and point of care applications. This study, initiated in early 2020, explores the opportunity of using highly doped UCNPs (40%Yb3+/4%Er3+) in lateral flow assay (LFA) for the early diagnosis of COVID-19. The UCNPs-based LFA testing demonstrated a minimum detection concentration of 100 pg/mL for SARS-CoV-2 antigen and 105 CCID50/mL for inactivated virus. Clinical trials, conducted in Malaysia and Western Australia independently, showed that the technique was at least 100 times more sensitive than commercial RAT kits, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 91.34%. The development process involved multidisciplinary collaborations, resulting in the Virulizer device, an automated strip reader for point-of-care testing. This work sets a reference for future development of highly sensitive and quantitative rapid antigen tests, aiming for the Limits of Detection (LoD) in the range of sub-ng/mL.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366495

Specifically, we enter n variations of k pattern classes (n*k patterns) onto a cortex-like balanced inhibitory-excitatory network with heterogeneous neurons, and let the pattern spread within the recurrent network. We show that we can identify high mutual-information (MI) neurons as major information-bearing elements within each pattern representation. We employ a simple one-shot adaptive (learning) process focusing on high MI neurons and inhibition. Such  localist plasticity has high efficiency, because it requires only few adaptations for each pattern. Specifically, we store k=10 patterns of size s=400 in a 1000/1200 neuron network. We stimulate high MI neurons and in this way recall patterns, such that the whole network represents this pattern. We assess the quality of the representation (a) before learning, when entering the pattern into a naive network and (b) after learning, on the adapted network, during recall. The recalled patterns could be easily recognized by a trained classifier. The pattern  unfolds over the recurrent network with high similarity, albeit compressed, with respect to the original input pattern. We discuss the distribution of neuron properties in the network, and find that an initial Gaussian or uniform distribution changes into a more heavy-tailed, lognormal distribution during the adaptation process. The remarkable result is that we are able to achieve reliable pattern recall by stimulating only high information neurons. This work has interesting technical applications, and provides a biologically-inspired model of cortical memory.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366495

ObjectiveThis cross-sectional study examined the relationships between macronutrients, dietary components, and sleep parameters, considering their interdependencies.

MethodsData from 4,825 users of sleep and nutrition apps for at least 7 days were analyzed. Multivariable regression analysis investigated associations between quartiles of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate, and total fat, including saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats), dietary components (sodium, potassium, dietary fiber, and sodium-to-potassium ratio), and sleep variables (total sleep time [TST], sleep latency [SL], and % wakefulness after sleep onset [%WASO]). Nutrients were divided into quartiles, with the lowest intake group as the reference. Compositional data analysis accounted for interdependencies among macronutrients. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI).

ResultsHigher protein intake was associated with longer TST in the 3rd (B = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.26) and 4th quartiles (B = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.27).

A higher sodium-to-potassium ratio was linked to shorter TST in the 3rd (B = -0.11, 95% CI = -0.20, -0.02) and 4th quartiles (B = -0.19, 95% CI = -0.28, -0.10), longer SL in the 2nd (B = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.08, 1.98) and 4th quartiles (B = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.53, 2.47), and longer %WASO in the 4th quartile (B = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.15, 1.28). Compositional data analysis, involving 6% changes in macronutrient proportions, showed higher protein intake correlated with longer TST (B = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.18, 0.35), while more monounsaturated fats were linked to longer SL (B = 4.64, 95% CI = 1.93, 7.34) and %WASO (B = 2.21, 95% CI = 0.63, 3.78). Higher polyunsaturated fat intake correlated with shorter TST (B = -0.22, 95% CI = -0.39, -0.05), shorter SL (B = -4.72, 95% CI = -6.58, -2.86), and shorter %WASO (B = -2.00, 95% CI = -3.08, -0.92).

Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation.

Immunotherapies specifically are ineffective in pancreatic cancer, in part due to its unique stromal and immune microenvironment. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, or PanIN, is the main precursor lesion to PDAC. Recently it was discovered that PanINs are remarkably abundant in the grossly normal pancreas, suggesting that the vast majority will never progress to cancer. Here, through construction of 48 samples of cm3-sized human pancreas tissue, we profiled the immune microenvironment of 1,476 PanINs in 3D and at single-cell resolution to better understand the early evolution of the pancreatic tumor microenvironment and to determine how inflammation may play a role in cancer progression.

We found that bulk pancreatic inflammation strongly correlates to PanIN cell fraction. We found that the immune response around PanINs is highly heterogeneous, with distinct immune hotspots and cold spots that appear and disappear in a span of tens of microns. Immune hotspots generally mark locations of higher grade of dysplasia or locations near acinar atrophy. The immune composition at these hotspots is dominated by naive, cytotoxic, and regulatory T cells, cancer associated fibroblasts, and tumor associated macrophages, with little similarity to the immune composition around less-inflamed PanINs. By mapping FOXP3+ cells in 3D, we found that regulatory T cells are present at higher density in larger PanIN lesions compared to smaller PanINs, suggesting that the early initiation of PanINs may not exhibit an immunosuppressive response.

This analysis demonstrates that while PanINs are common in the pancreases of most individuals, inflammation may play a pivotal role, both at the bulk and the microscopic scale, in demarcating regions of significance in cancer progression.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366495

Disease progression and failure to respond to anthracycline based chemotherapy, standard first-line treatment, is associated with poor patient outcomes. To address this, we investigated the contribution of STS cancer stem cells (STS-CSCs) to doxorubicin resistance. We identified a positive correlation between CSC abundance and doxorubicin IC50 in resistant cell lines. We investigated if a common genetic signature across STS-CSCs could be targeted. Utilizing patient derived samples from five sarcoma subtypes we identified Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a member of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) responsible for H3K27 methylation as being enriched in the CSC population. EZH2 activity and a shared epigenetic profile was observed across subtypes. Targeting of EZH2 using Tazemetostat, an FDA approved inhibitor specifically ablated the STS-CSC population. Treatment of doxorubicin resistant cell lines with tazemetostat resulted in a decrease in the STS-CSC population. Further, co-treatment was not only synergistic in the parent cell lines, but restored chemosensitivity in doxorubicin resistant lines. These data confirm the presence of shared genetic programs across distinct subtypes of CSC-STS that can be therapeutically targeted.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366495

Sequence divergence between repeats causes RMD suppression and indeed this divergence must be resolved in the RMD products. The mismatch repair factor, MLH1, was shown to be critical for both RMD suppression and a polarity of sequence divergence resolution in RMDs. Here, we sought to study the interrelationship between these two aspects of RMD regulation (i.e., RMD suppression and polar divergence resolution), by examining several mutants of MLH1 and its binding partner PMS2. To begin with, we show that PMS2 is also critical for both RMD suppression and polar resolution of sequence divergence in RMD products. Then, with six mutants of the MLH1-PMS2 heterodimer, we found several different patterns: three mutants showed defects in both functions, one mutant showed loss of RMD suppression but not polar divergence resolution, whereas another mutant showed the opposite, and finally one mutant showed loss of RMD suppression but had a complex effect on polar divergence resolution. These findings indicate that RMD suppression vs. polar resolution of sequence divergence are distinct functions of MLH1-PMS2.

Previous efforts to eliminate lactate production via knockout have failed in mammalian bioprocessing since lactate dehydrogenase has proven essential. However, here we eliminated the Warburg effect in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and HEK293 cells by simultaneously knocking out lactate dehydrogenase and regulators involved in a negative feedback loop that typically inhibits pyruvate conversion to acetyl-CoA. In contrast to long-standing assumptions about the role of aerobic glycolysis, Warburg-null cells maintain wildtype growth rate while producing negligible lactate. Further characterization of Warburg-null CHO cells showed a compensatory increase in oxygen consumption, a near total reliance on oxidative metabolism, and higher cell densities in fed-batch cell culture. These cells remained amenable for production of diverse biotherapeutic proteins, reaching industrially relevant titers and maintaining product glycosylation. Thus, the ability to eliminate the Warburg effect is an important development for biotherapeutic production and provides a tool for investigating a near-universal metabolic phenomenon.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366495

In neurons, mitochondrial lactate reported blood lactate levels with high fidelity. The exchange of lactate across the inner mitochondrial membrane was found to be mediated by a high affinity H+-coupled transport system involving the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier MPC. Assessment of electron transport chain activity and determination of lactate flux showed that mitochondria are tonic lactate producers, a phenomenon driven by energization and stimulated by hypoxia. We conclude that an overflow mechanism caps the redox level of mitochondria, while saving energy in the form of lactate.

Manual segmentation, though considered the gold standard, is time-consuming and error-prone, leading to the development of numerous automatic segmentation methods. However, no study has yet independently compared the performance of traditional, deep learning-based, and hippocampal subfield segmentation methods within a single investigation. We evaluated nine automatic hippocampal segmentation methods (FreeSurfer, FastSurfer, FIRST, e2dhipseg, HippMapper, Hippodeep, FreeSurfer-Subfields, HippUnfold and HSF) across three datasets with manually segmented hippocampus labels. Performance metrics included overlap with manual labels, correlations between manual and automatic volumes, diagnostic group differentiation, and systematically located false positives and negatives. Most methods, especially deep learning-based ones, performed well on public datasets but showed more error and variability on unseen data. Many methods tended to over-segment, particularly at the anterior hippocampus border, but were able to distinguish between healthy controls, MCI, and dementia patients based on hippocampal volume. Our findings highlight the challenges in hippocampal segmentation from MRI and the need for more publicly accessible datasets with manual labels across diverse ages and pathological conditions.

Key MessagesO_LIWe evaluated nine automatic hippocampal segmentation methods, including traditional and deep learning-based approaches, across three datasets with manually segmented hippocampus labels.
C_LIO_LIWhile deep learning-based methods perform well on public datasets, they show more error and variability on unseen data that is more reflective of a clinical population.
C_LIO_LIMore publicly accessible datasets with manual labels are required for automatic hippocampal segmentations to be accurate and reliable, particularly for clinical populations.

Practitioner PointsO_LIAlthough deep learning based automatic hippocampal segmentation methods offer faster processing times--a requirement for translation to clinical practice--the lack of variance within training sets (such as sample demographics and scanner sequences) currently prevents transfer of learning to novel data, such as those acquired clinically.

Following controlled induction in embryonic stem cells, we monitor binding across differentiation trajectories, employing an interpretable machine-learning approach integrating pre-existing DNA accessibility data. This reveals a chromatin-dependent motif syntax, delineating both common and factor-specific binding and predicting genome engagement with high precision. Shared binding sites reside in open chromatin, locally influenced by nucleosomes. In contrast, factor-specific binding in closed chromatin involves NGN2 and MyoD1 acting as pioneer-factors, influenced by multi-motifs, rotational spacing, flanking sequences, and specific interaction partners, accounting for subsequent lineage divergence. Extending our methodology to other models demonstrates how such combination of opportunistic-binding and context-specific chromatin opening underpin transcription factor specificity driving differentiation trajectories.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366495

Emerging evidence suggests that the tumor-draining lymph nodes can support the continuous generation of these stem-like cells that replenish the tumor sites and act as a critical source of expanded effector populations, underlining the importance of understanding what factors promote and maintain activated T cells in the stem-like state. Using advanced 3D multiplex immunofluorescence imaging, here we identified antigen-presentation niches in tumor-draining lymph nodes that support the expansion, maintenance, and affinity evolution of a unique population of TCF-1+PD-1+SLAMF6hi stem-like CD8+ T cells. Our results show that contrary to the prevailing view that persistent TCR signaling drives terminal effector differentiation, prolonged antigen engagement well beyond the initial priming phase sustained the proliferation and self-renewal of these stem-like T cells in vivo. The inhibitory PD-1 pathway plays a central role in this process by mediating the fine-tuning of TCR and co-stimulatory signal input that enables selective expansion of high affinity TCR stem-like clones, enabling them to act as a renewable source of high affinity effector cells. PD-1 checkpoint blockade disrupts this fine tuning of input signaling, leading to terminal differentiation to the effector state or death of the most avid anti-tumor stem-like cells. Our results thus reveal an unexpected relationship between TCR ligand affinity recognition, a key negative feedback regulatory loop, and T cell stemness programming. Furthermore, these findings raise questions about whether anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade during cancer immunotherapy provides a short-term anti-tumor effect that comes at the cost of diminishing efficacy due to progressive loss of these critical high affinity stem-like precursors.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366495

Here, we developed a multiplexed DMS by phage display protocol to define the binding determinants of short linear motifs (SLiMs) binding to peptide binding domains. We first designed a benchmarking DMS library to evaluate the performance of the approach on well-known ligands for eleven different peptide binding domains, including the talin-1 PTB domain. Systematic benchmarking against a gold-standard set of motifs from the eukaryotic linear motif (ELM) database confirmed that the DMS by phage analysis correctly identifies known motif binding determinants. The DMS analysis further defined a non-canonical PTB binding motif, with a putative extended conformation. A second DMS library was designed aiming to provide information on the binding determinants for 19 SLiM-based interactions between human and SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The analysis confirmed the affinity determining residues of viral peptides binding to host proteins, and refined the consensus motifs in human peptides binding to five domains from SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the non-structural protein (NSP) 9. The DMS analysis further pinpointed mutations that increased the affinity of ligands for NSP3 and NSP9. An affinity improved cell-permeable NSP9-binding peptide was found to exert stronger antiviral effects as compared to the initial wild-type peptide.

However, the sequence codes and mechanisms underpinning post-transcriptional regulation remain incompletely understood. Here, we revisit the finding from a prior massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) that AU-rich (U-rich) elements in 3 untranslated regions (3 UTRs) can drive upregulation or downregulation of mRNA expression depending on 3 UTR context. We unexpectedly discover that this variable regulation arises from widespread cryptic splicing, predominately from an unannotated splice donor in the coding sequence of GFP to diverse acceptor sites in reporter 3 UTRs. Splicing is activated by U-rich sequences, which function as potent position-dependent regulators of 5 and 3 splice site choice and overall splicing efficiency. Splicing has diverse impacts on reporter expression, causing both increases and decreases in reporter expression via multiple mechanisms. We further provide evidence that cryptic splicing impacts between 10 to 50% of measurements made by other published 3 UTR MPRAs. Overall, our work emphasizes U-rich sequences as principal drivers of splicing and provides strategies to minimize cryptic splicing artifacts in reporter assays.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366495

In this work we have developed a new framework for predicting regulatory variants, that includes deriving key conservation metrics in cattle for the first time, variant annotation and model training. When trained on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) data for human and cattle we show that this framework has a high performance at predicting regulatory variants, with a maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) score of 0.92 in human and 0.81 in cattle. We explore various approaches to further close this performance gap, including integrating advanced DNA sequence models and generating extra chromatin data, but illustrate that the best approach would be generating improved gold-standard sets of known cattle regulatory variants. Importantly we demonstrate both the human and cattle models substantially enrich for variants linked to important traits, with up to 25-fold enrichments for functional variants observed. Consequently, with our framework developed to be applicable across species these results not only demonstrate its potential utility for fine-mapping functional variants and improving breeding values in cattle, but also its potential for wider use across animal species.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366495

How mitochondrial RNA processing and translation are spatially organized across dynamic mitochondrial networks is not well understood. Here, we report that processed mitochondrial RNAs are consolidated with mitoribosome components into translation hubs distal to either nucleoids or processing granules in human cells. During stress, these hubs are remodeled into translationally repressed mesoscale bodies containing messenger, ribosomal, and double-stranded RNA. We show that the highly conserved helicase SUV3 contributes to the distribution of processed RNA within mitochondrial networks, and that stress bodies form downstream of proteostatic stress in cells lacking SUV3 unwinding activity. We propose that the spatial organization of nascent chain synthesis into discrete domains serves to throttle the flow of genetic information in stress to ensure mitochondrial quality control.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366495

Robust perception is thought to be facilitated by nonlinear response properties, including temporal adaptation (reduced responses to re-peated stimuli) and contrast gain (shift in the contrast response function with pre-exposure to a stimulus). Temporal adaptation and contrast gain have both been shown to aid object recognition, however, their joint effect on perceptual and neural responses remains unclear. Here, we collected behavioural measurements and electrocorticography (EEG) data while human participants (both sexes) classified objects embedded within temporally repeated noise patterns, whereby object contrast was varied. Our findings reveal an in-teraction effect, with increased categorization performance as a result of temporal adaptation for higher but not lower contrast stimuli. This increase in behavioral performance after adaptation is associated with more pronounced contrast-dependent modulation of evoked neural responses, as well as better decoding of object information from EEG activity. To elucidate the neural computations underlying these effects, we endowed deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) with various temporal adaptation mechanisms, including intrinsic suppression and temporal divisive normalisation. We demonstrate that incorporating a biologically-inspired contrast response function to modify temporal adaptation helps DCNNs to accurately capture human behaviour and neural activation profiles. Moreover, we find that networks with multiplicative temporal adaptation mechanisms, such as divisive normalization, show higher robustness against spatial shifts in the inputs compared to DCNNs employing additive mechanisms. Overall, we reveal how interaction effects between nonlinear response properties influence human perception in challenging viewing contexts and investigate potential computations that mediate these effects.

Significance statementHumans are able to perceive the environment even when viewing conditions are suboptimal. This robust perception has been linked to nonlinear neural processing of incoming visual information. Here, we examine the joint impact of two neural response properties, temporal adaptation and contrast gain, during object recognition, demonstrating interaction effects on categorization performance and in evoked neural responses. Using convolutional neural networks, we investigate various temporal adaptation mechanisms mediating the neural responses and perception, demonstrating that introducing contrast-dependent modulation of the unit activations captures human behaviour and neural object representations. Our findings shed light on how neural response properties give rise to robust perception and offer a framework to study the underlying neural dynamics and their impact on perception.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366495

In this study, we dissected the proinflammatory gene expression program induced by TNF in primary human endothelial cells using NGS- and imaging-based techniques. Our findings, enabled by our novel RWireX approach for single-cell ATAC-seq analysis, revealed two distinct regulatory chromatin modules: autonomous links of co-accessibility (ACs) between separated sites, and domains of contiguous co-accessibility (DCs) with increased local transcription factor binding.

We hypothesized that these difficulties may be related to atypical activation of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), known to produce a feedback-related negativity (FRN), measurable with EEG, following erred motor responses. We reasoned that ACC might also monitor perceptual performance and produce FRN following ""incorrect"" perceptual feedback. Participants performed a two-tone pitch discrimination task. Overall behavioral performance and EEG responses to stimuli did not differ between individuals with and without autism. However, almost all (33/35) non-autistics produced a clear perceptual FRN, while less than half (13/30) of autistic participants did. Behaviorally, non-autistics showed response slowing following incorrect trials, improved accuracy after difficult correct trials, and greater influence of perceptual priors following easy successful trials. In contrast, ASD participants did not exhibit these patterns. By examining FRN in a perceptual decision-making task involving feedback dependent choice updates, we demonstrated that FRN differs between ASD and non-autistic individuals and is associated with distinct behavioral differences. This study is the first to measure FRN in such a task, revealing significant disparities. Our findings suggest atypical ACC activation and insensitivity to feedback contribute to reduced behavioral flexibility in ASD, particularly when feedback is essential for performance update.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366495

After extrusion of modified lipoproteins from the IM via the LolCDE complex, the periplasmic chaperone LolA carries lipoproteins through the periplasm and transfers them to the OM lipoprotein insertase LolB, itself a lipoprotein with a LolA-like fold. Yet, LolB homologs appear restricted to {psi}-proteobacteria and are missing from spirochetes like the tick-borne Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi, suggesting a different hand-off mechanism at the OM. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the B. burgdorferi LolA homolog BB0346 (LolABb) at 1.9 [A] resolution. We identified multiple structural deviations in comparative analyses to other solved LolA structures, particularly a unique LolB-like protruding loop domain. LolABb failed to complement an Escherichia coli lolA knockout, even after codon optimization, signal I peptide adaptation, and a C-terminal chimerization which had allowed for complementation with an -proteobacterial LolA. Analysis of a conditional B. burgdorferi lolA knockout strain indicated that LolABb was essential for growth. Intriguingly, protein localization assays indicated that initial depletion of LolABb led to an emerging mislocalization of both IM and periplasmic OM lipoproteins, but not surface lipoproteins. Together, these findings further support the presence of two separate primary secretion pathways for periplasmic and surface OM lipoproteins in B. burgdorferi and suggest that the distinct structural features of LolABb allow it to function in a unique LolB-deficient lipoprotein sorting system.

SIGNIFICANCEBorrelia spirochetes causing Lyme disease and relapsing fever have unusual double-membrane envelopes that instead of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) display abundant surface lipoproteins. We recently showed that secretion of these surface lipoproteins in Borrelia burgdorferi depends on a distant homolog of the canonical LPS outer membrane translocase LptD. Here, we probed the role of the B. burgdorferi Lol pathway in lipoprotein sorting and secretion. We show that the periplasmic chaperone LolA is essential, functionally different from E. coli LolA, with structural features of a bifunctional lipoprotein carrier protein operating without a downstream LolB outer membrane lipoprotein insertase. Depletion of LolA did not impact surface lipoprotein localization but led to a marked mislocalization of inner membrane lipoproteins to the outer membrane. This further supports two parallel, yet potentially interacting Borrelia lipoprotein transport pathways that are responsible for either secreting surface lipoprotein virulence factors or maintaining proper distribution of lipoproteins within the periplasmic space.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366495

The objective of this study was to examine how prehabilitation can alter lung cancer immunity.

METHODSNewly diagnosed lung cancer patients were referred to the prehabilitation clinic for preoperative personalized multimodal intervention (exercise training, nutritional optimization, and anxiety reduction) and blood samples were collected at baseline and surgery. Tumor samples were collected at surgery and compared to matched control samples from patients who did not receive prehabilitation. An animal model was used to study prehabilitation and tumor growth kinetics.

RESULTSTwenty-eight lung cancer patients who underwent multimodal prehabilitation were included (McGill University Health Centre Research Ethics Board #2023-9005). After prehabilitation, patient-isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) showed significantly increased cytotoxicity against cancer cells (p < 0.0001) and significantly increased circulating natural killer (NK) cells in cohort (p = 0.0290) and paired analyses (p = 0.0312). Compared to matched controls, patients who received prehabilitation had significantly more intra-tumor NK cells (p = 0.0172). In vivo, we observed a significant increase in circulating NK cells (p = 0.0364) and slower tumor growth (p = 0.0396) with prehabilitation. When NK cells were depleted in prehabilitated mice, we observed a decrease in the protective effects of prehabilitation (p = 0.0314) and overall, we observed a significant correlation between circulating NK cells and reduced tumor volume (p = 0.0203, r = -0.5143).

CONCLUSIONSMultimodal prehabilitation may play a role in antitumor immunity by increasing peripheral and tumour-infiltrating NK cells leading to a reduced cancer burden. Future studies on the protective effect of prehabilitation on postoperative immunity should be conducted.","NA","medrxiv",1723241366495

An effective approach to identifying GxT signals and gaining insight into molecular mechanisms is mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) of molecular count phenotypes, such as gene expression and chromatin accessibility, under multiple treatment conditions, which is termed response molecular QTL mapping. Although standard approaches evaluate the interaction between genetics and treatment conditions, they do not distinguish between meaningful interpretations such as whether a genetic effect is only observed in the treated condition or whether a genetic effect is observed but accentuated in the treated condition. To address this gap, we have developed a downstream method for classifying response molecular QTLs into subclasses with meaningful genetic interpretations. Our method uses Bayesian model selection and assigns posterior probabilities to different types of GxT interactions for a given feature-SNP pair. We compare linear and nonlinear regression of log-scale counts, noting that the latter accounts for an expected biological relationship between the genotype and the molecular count phenotype. Through simulation and application to existing datasets of molecular response QTLs, we show that our method provides an intuitive and well-powered framework to report and interpret GxT interactions. We provide a software package, ClassifyGxT, which is available at https://github.com/yharigaya/classifygxt.

Author summaryResponses to treatment, such as drug, therapeutic intervention, and infection, can vary across individuals at least in part due to their genetic backgrounds. This phenomenon can be conceptualized as a manifestation of gene-by-treatment (GxT) or gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions, which refer to non-additive effects of genotype and treatment on traits and phenotypes. An understading of GxT or GxE interactions can potentially improve strategies for prevention and treatment of diseases, for example by selecting treatments for which a patient is most likely to respond given their genetic information, or enhanced screening for individuals most susceptible to environmental exposures. An effective approach to GxT discovery is response quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, where the effect of the treatment on the association between the genotype and phenotype is examined using a linear regression model including the genotype, treatment, and GxT interaction terms. Despite its effectiveness in identifying a large number of associations, the response QTL mapping relies on hypothesis testing, which does not provide classification of different types of GxT interactions. Herein, we propose a use of Bayesian model selection to classify the GxT types of response QTLs and provide a software package for this method. In addition to standard linear regression, our package provides an option to use nonlinear regression that is suited for molecular count phenotypes, such as gene expression and chromatin accessibility, measured by sequencing-based techniques. It also provides an option to use mixed effect models to accommodate replicate measurements per donor, which are common in data generated in in-vitro cell systems.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366496

Previously, we have categorised healthcare pathways for patients after discharge from hospital with COVID-19 across 45 UK sites. The aim of this work was to estimate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of these pathways.

MethodsWe examined prospectively collected data from 1,013 patients at 12-months post-discharge on whether they felt fully recovered (self-report), number of newly diagnosed conditions (NDC), quality of life (EQ-5D-5L utility score compared to pre-covid estimate) and healthcare resource costs (healthcare records). An analysis of the cost-effectiveness was performed by combining the healthcare resource cost and one-year EQ5D (giving a quality adjusted life-year: QALY) using statistical models that accounted for observed confounding.

ResultsAt 1 year, 29% of participants felt fully recovered and 41% of patients had an NDC. The most comprehensive services, where all patients could potentially access assessment, rehabilitation, and mental health services, were more clinically effective when compared with either no service or light touch services (mean (SE) QALY 0.789 (0.012) vs 0.725 (0.026)), with an estimated cost per QALY of {pound}1,700 (95% uncertainty interval: dominated to {pound}24,800).

We ultimately find that the proposed mRNA NiV G nanoparticle (mRNA NiV G-NP) provides a flexible platform for the development of vaccines that will likely be of great value in combatting future Nipah virus outbreaks.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366496

Identifying and controlling dose-dependent transgenes require tools for precisely titrating expression. To this end, we developed a highly modular, extensible framework called DIAL for building editable promoters that allow for fine-scale, heritable changes in transgene expression. Using DIAL, we increase expression by recombinase-mediated excision of spacers between the binding sites of a synthetic zinc finger transcription factor and the core promoter. By nesting varying numbers and lengths of spacers, DIAL generates a tunable range of unimodal setpoints from a single promoter. Through small-molecule control of transcription factors and recombinases, DIAL supports temporally defined, user-guided control of transgene expression that is extensible to additional transcription factors. Lentiviral delivery of DIAL generates multiple setpoints in primary cells and iPSCs. As promoter editing generates stable states, DIAL setpoints are heritable, facilitating mapping of transgene levels to phenotypes. The DIAL framework opens new opportunities for tailoring transgene expression and improving the predictability and performance of gene circuits across diverse applications.

HighlightsPromoter editing generates unimodal setpoints from a single synthetic promoter

DIAL setpoints are tuned by the length of an excisable spacer within the promoter

Here, we sequenced and analyzed 382 full-length OROV genomes from human samples collected between 2022 and 2024 from all four states, aiming to trace the origin and genetic evolution of OROV leading to the current outbreak. Genomic analyses revealed that the recent upsurge of OROV cases in the Brazilian Amazon region coincides with the emergence of a novel reassortant viral lineage containing the M segment of viruses detected in the eastern Amazon region from 2009 to 2018 and the L and S segments of viruses detected in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador from 2008 to 2021. The novel reassortant OROV lineage likely emerged in the Central region of the AM state between 2010 and 2014 and displayed a long-range silent dispersion during the second half of the 2010s. The 2022-2024 OROV epidemic was spatially segregated into three major subpopulations located in RR, AMACRO (a bordering region between AC, RO, and AM-Southern region), and AM-Central (which includes the Amazonas capital, Manaus) regions. The peak of OROV transmissions in all regions occurred during the rainy season in the Amazon basin. Furthermore, our phylodynamics reconstructions showed that OROV spread was driven mainly by short-range (< 2 km) movements, with an average dispersal rate [&le;] 1.2 km/day, consistent with the pattern of an active flight of infected vectors. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion (22%) of long-range (> 10 km) OROV migrations were also detected, consistent with viral dispersion via human activities. Our data provides an unprecedented view of the real-time spread and evolution of a neglected emergent human pathogen. Moreover, our results emphasize the need for widespread, long-term genomic surveillance to better understand the real burden of OROV within and beyond the Amazon region.","NA","medrxiv",1723241366496

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1723241366496

Non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1), the first viral protein produced during coronaviral infections, inhibits host protein synthesis and induces mRNA degradation to enhance viral proliferation. However, the interconnection between the two processes and whether host mRNA degradation depends on the active translation of targeted mRNAs remains enigmatic. Here, intrigued by the observation that Nsp1 does not stimulate ribosome collisions, we use a human cell-free translation system to decouple the main Nsp1 activities, showing that Nsp1 can induce mRNA degradation independently of translation inhibition. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binding to the ribosome is sufficient to trigger host mRNA degradation without requiring ribosome scanning or translation elongation, stimulating degradation at the 5'end of the transcript. Interestingly, for MERS-CoV, Nsp1 causes translation inhibition without triggering mRNA degradation. Using Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2, MERS and Bat-Hp coronaviruses, we observe 5UTR-specific protection of viral mRNAs, indicating a co-evolutionary adaptation mechanism of the two viral features. Our findings mirror key observations from living cells about Nsp1-mediated mRNA degradation, highlighting the utility of cell-free systems in monitoring and decoupling translation-related processes and providing new insights into this interplay.

Through most of its range, this frog is red with blue limbs. However, frogs from the Bocas del Toro Province, Panama, show striking variance in color and pattern, both sympatrically and allopatrically. This observation contradicts standard models of the evolution of aposematism and has led to substantial speculation about its evolutionary and molecular causes. Since the enigma of O. pumilio phenotypic variation is partly unresolved because of its large, [~] 6.7 Gb genome, we here sequence exomes from 347 individuals from ten populations and map a number of genetic factors responsible for the color and pattern variation. The kit gene is the primary candidate underlying the blue-red polymorphism in Dolphin Bay, where an increase in melanosomes is correlated with blue coloration. Additionally, the ttc39b gene, a known enhancer of yellow-to-red carotenoid conversion in birds, is the primary factor behind the yellow-red polymorphism in the Bastimentos West area. The causal genetic regions show evidence of selective sweeps acting locally to spread the rare phenotype. Our analyses suggest an evolutionary model in which selection is driving the formation of new morphs in a dynamic system resulting from a trade-off between predation avoidance, intraspecific competition, and mate choice.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366496

Occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus (58.3%) and Escherichia coli (45.8%) in skin and stool samples were respectively determined based on cultural and morphological characteristics. Conventional biochemical tests were carried out on the 14 and 10 presumptive Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli isolates and then 10 and 8 presumptive isolates were detected respectively. The antibacterial activity of the test agent was determined using the agar well diffusion technique; five different concentrations (20% v/v, 40% v/v, 60% v/v, 80% v/v, and 100% v/v) of the test agents were evaluated against the bacterial isolates. The earwax showed antibacterial activity against both isolates (except the 20% v/v for Staphylococcus aureus) at all concentrations used with antibacterial activity directly proportional to earwax concentration and a better antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (zone of inhibition 20mm) aureus than Escherichia coli. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out on the 10(41.7%) and 8(33.3%) presumptive isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli respectively based on Kirby Bauer method.

A DFE is typically estimated by fitting an observed site frequency spectrum (SFS) to an expected SFS given a hypothesized distribution of selection coefficients and demographic history. The development of tools to infer gene trees from haplotype alignments, along with ancient DNA resources, provides us with additional information about the frequency trajectories of segregating mutations. Here, we ask how useful this additional information is for learning about the DFE, using the joint distribution on allele frequency and age to summarize information about the trajectory. To this end, we introduce an accurate and efficient numerical method for computing the density on the age of a segregating variant found at a given sample frequency, given the strength of selection and an arbitrarily complex population size history. We then use this framework to show that the unconditional age distribution of negatively selected alleles is very closely approximated by re-weighting the neutral age distribution in terms of the negatively selected SFS, suggesting that allele ages provide very little information about the DFE beyond that already contained in the present day frequency. To confirm this prediction, we extended the standard Poisson Random Field (PRF) method to incorporate the joint distribution of frequency and age in estimating selection coefficients, and test its performance using simulations. We find that when the full SFS is observed and the true allele ages are known, including ages in the estimation provides only small increases in the accuracy of estimated selection coefficients. However, if only sites with frequencies above a certain threshold are observed, then the true ages can provide substantial information about the selection coefficients, especially when the selection coefficient is large. When ages are estimated from haplotype data using state-of-the-art tools, uncertainty about the age abrogates most of the additional information in the fully observed SFS case, while the neutral prior assumed in these tools when estimating ages induces a downward bias in the case of the thresholded SFS.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366496

To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Warm White Light-Emitting Diode (LED), Cool White LED, Blue LED, and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic Puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation, and husbandry programs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic Puffin strandings remains to be the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine if aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366496

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366496

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366496

Here we show that language models trained on tokens generated by evolution can act as evolutionary simulators to generate functional proteins that are far away from known proteins. We present ESM3, a frontier multimodal generative language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to biological alignment. We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins with a chain of thought. Among the generations that we synthesized, we found a bright fluorescent protein at far distance (58% identity) from known fluorescent proteins. Similarly distant natural fluorescent proteins are separated by over five hundred million years of evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366496
"The Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect: Pupils size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest during exhalation","10.1101/2024.06.27.599713","biorxiv",102.08,0,0,0,89.03,"Schaefer, M.; Mathot, S.; Lundqvist, M.; Lundstrom, J.

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366496

However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366496

Here, we estimate biological age of 11 organs from 44,526 individuals in the UK Biobank using an antibody-based proteomics platform to model disease and mortality risk. Organ age estimates are associated with future onset of heart failure (heart age HR=1.83), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (lung age HR=1.39), type II diabetes (kidney age HR=1.58), and Alzheimers disease (brain age HR=1.81) and sensitive to lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise, hormone replacement therapy, or supplements. Remarkably, the accrual of aged organs progressively increases mortality risk while a youthful brain and immune system are uniquely associated with disease-free longevity. These findings support the use of plasma proteins for monitoring organ health and the efficacy of drugs targeting organ aging disease.","NA","biorxiv",1723241366496
