To facilitate this goal, we engineered and screened 3365 variants of the fluorescent protein glutamate indicator iGluSnFR3 in neuron culture, and selected variants in the mouse visual cortex. Two variants have high sensitivity, fast activation (< 2 ms) and deactivation times tailored for recording large populations of synapses (iGluSnFR4s, 153 ms) or rapid dynamics (iGluSnFR4f, 26 ms). By imaging action-potential evoked signals on axons and visually-evoked signals on dendritic spines, we show that iGluSnFR4s/4f primarily detect local synaptic glutamate with single-vesicle sensitivity. The indicators detect a wide range of naturalistic synaptic transmission, including in the vibrissal cortex layer 4 and in hippocampal CA1 dendrites. iGluSnFR4 increases the sensitivity and scale (4s) or speed (4f) of tracking information flow in neural networks in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935428

Technological advances in microcomputed tomography enabled non-destructive volumetric imaging of tissue blocks with sub-micron resolution at a centimetre scale. Here, we present X-Pression, a deep convolutional neural network-based frame-work designed to reconstruct 3D expression signatures of cellular niches from volumetric microcomputed tomography data. By training on a singular 2D section of a paired spatial transcriptomics experiment, X-Pression achieves high accuracy and is capable of generalising to out-of-sample examples. We utilised X-Pression to demonstrate the benefit of 3D examination of tissues on a paired SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy spatial transcriptomics and microcomputed tomography cohort of a recently developed live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. By applying X-Pression to the entire mouse lung, we visualised the sites of viral replication at the organ level and the simultaneous collapse of small alveoli in their vicinity. In addition, we assessed the immunological response following vaccination and virus challenge infection. X-Pression offers a valuable and cost-effective addition to infer expression signatures without the need for consecutive 2D sectioning and reconstruction, providing new insights into transcriptomic profiles in three dimensions.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935428

Because dopamine influences blood vessel dilation, we hypothesized that hemodynamic latency, which reflects BOLD signal timing, could serve as an indirect marker of dopamine physiology. Across four datasets, we found a topography of hemodynamic latencies that precisely distinguished the nucleus accumbens, a dopaminergic region implicated in motivation and substance abuse, from other striatal regions. Using PET, genetics, and pharmacology, we found that hemodynamic latencies are robustly related to dopamine function and dopamine-linked behavior. In individuals with cocaine use disorder, we observed a spatial gradient of altered hemodynamic latencies in the striatum. This pattern independently predicted nicotine use, revealing a conserved physiological profile associated with addictive substance use. Hemodynamic latencies map regional, individual, and pathological differences linked to dopamine, opening new avenues for indirectly assessing the role of dopamine in healthy cognition and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935428

Therefore, URT is a critical site to investigate the changes in the microbiome caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we have used the whole genome shotgun metagenomic approach to investigate URT swab samples (n=96) collected from SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals (n=48) (non-hospitalised but symptomatic) and healthy controls (n=48) belonging to five districts of central India. This study aims to compare the phageome diversity and investigate the correlation of the phageome profiles with the sample type (SARS-CoV-2 or Control) to determine the nature of phage-host interactions and to assess the effect of SARS-CoV-2 viral load over host and phage abundance. The results showed that Detrevirus was a prominent bacteriophage in controls and Maxrubnervirus in SARS-CoV-2 samples. Higher Chao1 indices were observed in the SARS-CoV-2 group for bacteria (886.00 vs. 351.00, p < 0.0001) and phages (39.00 vs. 16.00, p = 0.0002). The Simpson index was lower for bacteria (0.88 vs. 0.93, p = 0.0024) and higher for phages (0.86 vs. 0.79, p = 0.0384). Ct-dependent variations in bacterial (H = 6.69, p = 0.035) and phage (H = 8.97, p = 0.011) abundances were also observed. Disrupted host-phage interactions were observed in SARS-CoV-2 samples, with a weaker model fit (logistic R2 = 0.7425) than controls (logistic R2 = 0.9265). These findings highlight the need to integrate virome and bacteriome analyses with potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic applications for infectious disease research.

Application of in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) made it possible to visualize the consequences of mitochondrial depolarization at higher resolution than heretofore attainable. Parkin-expressing U2OS cells were treated with the depolarizing agents oligomycin and antimycin A (OA), subjected to cryo-FIB milling, and mitochondrial structure was characterized by in situ cryo-ET. Phagophores were visualized in association with mitochondrial fragments. Bridge-like lipid transporter (BLTP) densities potentially corresponding to ATG2A were seen connected to mitophagic phagophores. Mitochondria in OA-treated cells were fragmented and devoid of matrix calcium phosphate crystals. The intermembrane gap of cristae was narrowed and the intermembrane volume reduced, and some fragments were devoid of cristae. A subpopulation of ATP synthases re-localized from cristae to the inner boundary membrane (IBM) apposed to the outer membrane (OMM). The structure of the dome-shaped prohibitin complex, a dodecamer of PHB1-PHB2 dimers, was determined in situ by sub-tomogram averaging in untreated and treated cells and found to exist in open and closed conformations, with the closed conformation is enriched by OA treatment. These findings provide a set of native snapshots of the manifold nano-structural consequences of mitochondrial depolarization and provide a baseline for future in situ dissection of Parkin-dependent mitophagy.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935428

The LacI/GalR family (LGF) of transcription factors provides a system for examining how these trade-offs evolve over billions of years but has seldom been studied from a full thermodynamic perspective. While the evolution of ligand specificity has been well-studied, the thermodynamic determinants underlying the changes in specificity is not well understood - especially how proteins alter thermodynamic strategies to optimize affinity. By reconstructing LGF ancestors, we reveal a shift from entropy-driven binding in the most distant ancestor, to enthalpy-driven binding in the most recent ancestor and extant LacI. The most distant ancestor is characterized by the ability to bind its ligand in an open and dynamic conformation, and we propose that entropically-driven binding is driven by the presence of entropic reservoirs. This thermodynamic binding trade-off between the most distant and most recent ancestor is in accordance with the concept of ancient life that existed in a hot Earth environment, where higher temperatures enhanced entropically-driven binding. This suggests that molecular binding mechanisms evolved not just for ligand specificity, but to adapt to environmental pressures such as cooling Earth temperatures where enthalpic binding modes are favored.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935428

We document an exception to this pattern in the wider Rhine-Meuse area in communities in the wetlands, riverine areas, and coastal areas of the western and central Netherlands, Belgium and western Germany, where we assembled genome-wide data for 109 people 8500-1700 BCE. Here, a distinctive population with high hunter-gatherer ancestry (~50%) persisted up to three thousand years later than in continental European regions, reflecting limited incorporation of females of Early European Farmer ancestry into local communities. In the western Netherlands, the arrival of the Corded Ware complex was also exceptional: lowland individuals from settlements adopting Corded Ware pottery had hardly any steppe ancestry, despite a characteristic early Corded Ware Y-chromosome. The limited influx may reflect the unique ecology of the region's river-dominated landscapes, which were not amenable to wholesale adoption of the early Neolithic type of farming introduced by Linearbandkeramik, making it possible for previously established groups to thrive, and creating a persistent but permeable boundary that allowed transfer of ideas and low-level gene flow. This changed with the formation-through-mixture of Bell Beaker using populations ~2500 BCE by fusion of local Rhine-Meuse people (9-17%) and Corded Ware associated migrants of both sexes. Their expansion from the Rhine-Meuse region then had a disruptive impact across a much wider part of northwest Europe, including Britain where its arrival was the main source of a 90-100% replacement of local Neolithic peoples.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935428

Most research focusses on Dictyostelium discoideum, which - due to its ease of culturing and genetic tractability - has been adopted as a model species in the fields of developmental biology, cell biology and microbiology. Over decades, genome editing methods in D. discoideum have steadily improved but remain relatively time-consuming and limited in scope, effective in a few species only. Here, we introduce a CRISPR-Cas9 editing protocol that is cloning-free, selection-free, highly-efficient, and effective across Dictyostelid species. After optimizing our protocol in D. discoideum, we obtained knock-out efficiencies of ~80% and knock-in efficiencies of ~30% without antibiotic selection. Efficiencies depend on template concentrations, insertion sizes, homology arms and target sites. Since our protocol is selection-free, we can isolate mutants as soon as one day post-transfection, vastly expediting the generation of knock-outs, fusion proteins and expression reporters. Our protocol also makes it possible to generate several knock-in mutations simultaneously in the same cells. Boosted by cell-sorting and fluorescent microscopy, we could readily apply our CRISPR-Cas9 editing protocol to phylogenetically distant Dictyostelid species, which diverged hundreds of millions of years ago and have never been genome edited before. Our protocol therefore opens the door to performing broad-scale genetic interrogations across Dicyostelids.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

These rare states influence protein function, interactions, aggregation, and immunogenicity, yet they remain far less understood than protein native states. Although native protein structures are now often predictable with impressive accuracy, conformational fluctuations and their energies remain largely invisible and unpredictable, and experimental challenges have prevented large-scale measurements that could improve machine learning and physics-based modeling. Here, we introduce a multiplexed experimental approach to analyze the energies of conformational fluctuations for hundreds of protein domains in parallel using intact protein hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. We analyzed 5,778 domains 28-64 amino acids in length, revealing hidden variation in conformational fluctuations even between sequences sharing the same fold and global folding stability. Site-resolved hydrogen exchange NMR analysis of 13 domains showed that these fluctuations often involve entire secondary structural elements with lower stability than the overall fold. Computational modeling of our domains identified structural features that correlated with the experimentally observed fluctuations, enabling us to design mutations that stabilized low-stability structural segments. Our dataset enables new machine learning-based analysis of protein energy landscapes, and our experimental approach promises to reveal these landscapes at unprecedented scale.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

Defense-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems provide an intriguing counterpoint to this strategy by leveraging DNA synthesis instead. We and others recently showed that DRT2 systems use an RNA template to assemble a de novo gene, leading to expression of an antiviral effector protein, Neo. It remains unknown whether similar mechanisms of defense are employed by other DRT families. Focusing on DRT9, here we uncover an unprecedented mechanism of DNA homopolymer synthesis, in which viral infection triggers polydeoxyadenylate (poly-dA) accumulation in the cell to drive abortive infection and population-level immunity. Cryo-EM structures reveal how a conserved noncoding RNA serves as both a structural scaffold and reverse transcription template to direct hexameric complex assembly and RNA-templated poly-dA synthesis. Remarkably, biochemical and functional experiments identify conserved tyrosine residues within the reverse transcriptase itself that prime DNA synthesis, leading to the formation of high-molecular weight protein-DNA covalent adducts. Synthesis of poly-dA in vivo is regulated by the competing activities of phage-encoded triggers and host-encoded silencers of DRT9. Collectively, our work unveils a novel nucleic acid-driven defense system that expands the paradigm of bacterial immunity and broadens the known functions of reverse transcriptases.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

Preliminary evidence has shown the gut microbiome influences the aging process of bone and muscle in animal studies. However, such evidence in humans is still scarce. This study aimed to assess the microbiome-bone and microbiome-muscle associations in two cohorts of community-dwelling older adults.

MethodsWe leveraged information from two large population-based cohorts, i.e., the Rotterdam Study (mean age 62.7 {+/-} 5.6 years; n=1,249) and the Framingham Heart Study (mean age 55.2 {+/-} 9.1 years; n=1,227). For individuals included in this study, gut microbiome 16S rRNA sequencing, musculoskeletal phenotyping derived from DXA images, lifestyle and socioeconomic data, and medication records were available. Per cohort, the 16S rRNA sequencing data, derived from stool, were processed with the DADA2 pipeline and taxonomies were assigned using the SILVA reference database. In addition, the microbiome functional potential was obtained with PICRUSt2. Further, we investigated the association between the human gut microbiome (alpha diversity, genera and predicted functional pathways) and appendicular lean mass (ALM), femoral neck bone mineral density (FN-BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) using multilinear regression models controlling for multiple confounders, and performed a joint analysis from both cohorts. Sex-stratified analyses were also conducted.

ResultsThe gut microbiome alpha diversity was not associated with either tested phenotype after accounting for multiple-testing (P>1.67e-02). In the joint analysis, lower abundance of Oscillibacter (beta= -0.51, 95%CI [-0.74, -0.29]), Anaerotruncus (beta=-0.41, 95%CI [-0.61, - 0.21]), Eisenbergiella (beta=-0.39, 95%CI [-0.59, -0.19]) and higher abundance of Agathobacter (beta=0.40, 95%CI [0.20, 0.60]) were associated with higher ALM (P<2.0e-04). Lower abundance of Anaerotruncus (beta=-0.32, 95%CI [-0.45, -0.19]), Hungatella (beta=-0.26, 95%CI [-0.38, -0.15]) and Clostridiales bacterium DTU089 (beta=-0.37, 95%CI [-0.55, -0.19]) was associated with higher ALM only in females (P< 2.0e-04). Moreover, the biotin biosynthesis II pathway was positively associated with ALM (beta=0.44, 95% CI [0.24, 0.64]) (P<1.90e-04) in females while no associations were observed in males. We did not observe any robust association of bone traits with gut microbiome features.

ConclusionOur results indicate that specific genera are associated with ALM in middle-aged and older adults and these associations can present in a sex-specific manner.

However, little is known about their biology, even in the model diplonemid Paradiplonema papillatum whose genome sequence is available. Examining the subcellular localization of proteins using fluorescence microscopy is a powerful approach to infer their putative function. Here we report a plasmid-based method that enables YFP-tagging of a gene at the endogenous locus. By examining the localization of proteins whose homologs are involved in chromosome segregation in other eukaryotes, we discovered several interesting features in mitotically dividing P. papillatum cells. Cohesin is enriched on condensed interphase chromatin. During mitosis, chromosomes organize into two rings (termed metaphase rings herein) that surround the elongating nucleolus. Homologs of chromosomal passenger complex components (INCENP, two Aurora kinases, and KIN-A), a CLK1 kinase, spindle checkpoint protein Mad1, and microtubule regulator XMAP215 localize in between the two metaphase rings, suggesting that kinetochores may assemble in between them. We also found that a homolog of the meiotic chromosome axis protein SYCP2L1 is enriched in between metaphase rings during mitosis. These features have some resemblance to the bivalent bridge (also known as the modified synaptonemal complex), which is thought to mediate the linkage between homologous chromosomes using axis components in Bombyx mori female meiotic metaphase I. By representing the first molecular characterization of mitotic mechanisms in P. papillatum and raising a number of questions, this study forms the foundation for dissecting mitotic mechanisms in diplonemids.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

Using a Drosophila larva assay with reduced stimulation, we found that larval groups show enhanced dispersal and distance from each other in the absence of food. This social context-dependent modulation overrides responses to other external sensory cues and is shaped by developmental social experience. Leveraging the genetic toolbox available in Drosophila, we find that different sensory modalities are required for normal social context modulation. Our results show that even less social animals like fly larvae are affected by conspecifics and that they recognize each other through multimodal sensory cues. This study provides a tractable system for future dissection of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying social interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

In this context, Python programming language is extensively used for manipulation and analysis of data stored in a tabular-form of rows and columns called dataframe. Pandas is the most-widely used Python dataframe package and is criticized for its inefficiencies and scalability problems that its novel alternative - Polars - tries to address with a vectorized backend written in Rust programming language. Results: polars-bio is a Python library that enables fast, parallel and out-of-core operations on large genomic intervals datasets. Its main components are implemented in Rust, using the Apache DataFusion query engine and Apache Arrow for efficient data representation. It is compatible with Polars and Pandas DataFrame formats. Single-thread benchmarking results confirm that for operations such as count_overlaps is 38x and coverage is 15x faster than the state-of-the-art bioframe library. Our implementation of overlap operation consumes 90x less memory in streaming mode. Multi-thread benchmarks show good scalability and up to 282x speedup for count_overlaps operation when executed with 8 CPU cores. To the best of our knowledge, polars-bio is the fastest single-node library for genomic interval dataframes in Python.

Understanding the cellular processes that occur in the later stages of life is essential to address age-related diseases. Although aging is a global process that affects the entire body, the brain is one of the most sensitive organs and is affected by numerous degenerative diseases. In this study, we investigate cell types and genes that are particularly sensitive to the aging process. To this end, we performed a time-course single-cell RNAseq experiment series in the brain of the killifish, the vertebrate model with the shortest lifespan, which makes it an excellent model for aging studies. Our analysis reveals that non-glial progenitor cells are among those populations that change the most between young and old animals. Furthermore, we identify specialized stromal clusters that seem to support a primitive hematopoietic program in the brain, which is active only during the embryonic stages in other vertebrate species. Our results show that the expression of embryonic genes in the adult brain appears to be a general feature in killifish, and that several cell populations in the adult killifish brain show a higher level of similarity to the zebrafish embryonic populations than to adult ones. Our study suggests that adult killifish maintain a neotenic gene expression status in the brain that may help in sustaining their characteristic high proliferation and metabolic rates, as well as combat the detrimental effects of this high metabolism on cells, especially at advanced ages.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1743026935429

However, it remains uncertain how strongly genome size is linked to microbial prevalence, relative abundance and co-occurrence in the environment. To address this gap, we present a systematic and global-scale evaluation of the relationship between genome size, relative abundance and prevalence in freshwater ecosystems, including 80,561 medium-to-high quality genomes. We identified 9,028 species (defined by ANI >95%) across a manually curated dataset of 636 freshwater metagenomes and calculated their relative abundance. Our results show that prokaryotes with reduced genomes exhibited higher prevalence and relative abundance, and a greater prevalence than expected based on their mean abundance, suggesting that genome streamlining may promote cosmopolitanism. Furthermore, our network analysis revealed that prokaryotes with reduced genomes are found in co-occurrent groups comprising up to 295 species. The species in these groups potentially possess a diminished capacity for synthesizing essential metabolites such as vitamins, amino acids and nucleotides, which may foster complex metabolic interdependencies within the community. Moreover, the fitness advantage of losing biosynthetic functions appears to be frequency dependent: while nucleotide biosynthesis is the most retained biosynthetic function, amino acid and then vitamin biosynthesis are more frequently lost. Our study finds that genome size is linked to microbial community structure and ecological adaptation to freshwaters. Our results underscore genome streamlining as a central ecological and evolutionary strategy that both shapes and is shaped by community dynamics, ultimately fostering interdependences among prokaryotes.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

In this work, we developed a simple, fast and cheap method for the Editing and Assembly of SYnthetic operons using CRISPR/Cas9-assisted recombineering (EASY-CRISPR) in Escherichia coli. Highly efficient editing of the different constitutive elements of the operons can be achieved by using a set of optimized guide RNAs and single- or double-stranded DNA repair templates carrying relatively short homology arms. This facilitates the construction of multiple genetic tools, including mutant libraries or reporter genes. EASY-CRISPR is also highly modular, as we provide alternative and complementary versions of the operon inserted in three loci which can be edited iteratively and easily combined. As a proof of concept, we report the construction of several fusions with reporter genes confirming known post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms and the construction of saturated and unbiased mutant libraries.

In summary, the EASY-CRISPR system provides a flexible genomic expression platform that can be used both for the understanding of biological processes and as a tool for bioengineering applications.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

In this study, we defined the epigenetic signatures of rRNA transcription and found that rDNA silencing relies on aerobic glycolysis, the sole energy-generating pathway in the human host. We show that disruption of NAD+ regeneration during lactate fermentation promotes rDNA de-repression and identify the sirtuin histone deacetylase Sir2a as the mediator between fluctuating NAD+ levels and a functional transcriptional outcome.

In this study we analyzed genomes derived from cultures and environmental metagenome-assembled genomes focusing on characters indicative of genome evolution. Our results show an enrichment of short length transposable elements (TEs) and pseudogenes in the periplasmic endosymbiont genomes, suggesting an active and transitionary period in genome evolution. In contrast, genomes of endobionts exhibited fewer TEs and pseudogenes, reflecting advanced stages of genome reduction and increased host dependency in the endobionts. Pangenome analyses identified that endobionts streamline their genomes and conserve a majority of their genes in the core, whereas periplasmic endobionts and epibionts maintain larger flexible genomes, suggesting increased genomic plasticity. Functional gene comparisons with other N2-fixing cyanobacteria revealed that Richelia endobionts have similar patterns of metabolic loss but are distinguished by absence of specific pathways (e.g. cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase, lipid-A) that increase dependency and direct interaction with their respective hosts.

In the intestinal tract, bidirectional communication occurs between the nervous and immune systems to affect local immune responses by modulating the activity of resident and recruited immune cells, and indirectly on the supporting stromal cells. These neuroimmune signaling pathways that alter host defense have focused on specialized sensory innervation and the unique neurotransmitters released from them. Although the sympathetic nervous system has been established to induce a tissue-protective phenotype in subpopulations of neuron-associated macrophages in the small intestine, the role of these neurons during enteric bacterial infection was unknown. Using genetic labeling of activated neurons with ArcTRAP, we demonstrate that colonic infection induces activation of the rostral ventrolateral medulla, a major sympathetic center in the brainstem. The importance of peripheral sympathetic neurons was further demonstrated using chemical sympathectomy that significantly increased bacterial burden during Citrobacter rodentium (C. rodentium) infection. Increased bacterial burden was matched by a deficit in host protection due to reduced IFN{gamma} production by colonic CD4+ T-cells. Sympathectomy, however, did not diminish the capacity to differentiate into IFN{gamma}- or IL-17A-producing T-cells in vitro, suggesting that the lack of sympathetic innervation during infection may alter this process in vivo without causing sustained T-cell intrinsic defects. In assessing which receptors could mediate these effects, pharmacological antagonists selective for -adrenergic receptors (AR), but not {beta}-adrenergic receptors, increased bacterial burden and reduced colonic IFN{gamma} production. Using isolated cell types from the colon of uninfected and infected mice, we identified the R subtypes expressed on immune and stromal cells, with significant upregulation of these receptors on T-cells during C. rodentium infection. Together these data demonstrate the unique role of the sympathetic nervous system and AR in mucosal immune responses against enteric bacterial pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

As they mature and gain independence from caregivers, juveniles stop producing infant calls and begin producing adult-like vocalizations in a variety of species-typical contexts. Neonatal mice (Mus musculus) produce isolation ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) when separated from the nest, and in contrast, adolescent and adult mice produce social USVs during interactions with conspecifics. Although this transition in vocal behavior is known to occur, its developmental timing remains poorly described. In the current study, we performed longitudinal measurements of mouse USVs to establish the age at which juvenile mice begin producing social USVs. Every 4 days (postnatal day (P)12-P28), USVs were first recorded from individual mice in solo sessions to establish rates of isolation/spontaneous USVs and then were recorded again during interactions between same-sex and opposite-sex pairs of age-matched, socially novel (non-littermate) C57BL/6J mice. We report that juvenile mice begin producing social USVs earlier than previously reported, at ages P20-P24. Moreover, although these early social USVs are produced at low rates compared to adult social USVs, they are nonetheless temporally coordinated with active social interaction. Our characterization of the timing of the transition from isolation USVs to social USVs forms a foundation to investigate brain mechanisms that enable the context-dependent regulation of vocal communication over development.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

Objectives: Multi-omic analyses defined the cellular and molecular mediators associated with RA dysfunction in pulmonary artery banded (PAB) swine. Methods: 4-week-old castrated male Yorkshire pigs were subjected to PAB and aged six weeks to induce right heart failure. Cardiac MRI evaluated RA size and function. snRNAseq defined the cell-specific alterations in RA tissue. Mitochondrial proteomics and metabolomics analyses examined the metabolic alterations in RA samples. Inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (iPSC-ACM) were treated with tunicamycin to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial structure and function were probed. Results: PAB induced RA dilation/dysfunction and atrial cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. snRNAseq demonstrated PAB altered the cellular composition of the RA defined by increased inflammatory macrophages and an alteration of cardiomyocytes subpopulations. RA cardiomyocytes exhibited ER stress and mitochondrial metabolic enzyme dysregulation. PAB RAs, but not PAB -right ventricles, had downregulation of branched chain amino acid degrading enzymes. Metabolomics profiling revealed BCAA and fatty acid metabolism were impaired in the dysfunctional RA. Tunicamycin-induced ER stress disrupted mitochondrial structure/function in iPSC-ACMs. Conclusions: Multi-omic evaluations demonstrate RA dysfunction is characterized by cardiomyocyte metabolic derangements due to ER dysregulation and an accumulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

ARFGAP1 itself is dispensable during macroautophagy, but among other proteins associating to these membranes, we find that Rab1 is essential. ATG2A co-immunoprecipitates strongly with Rab1a, and siRNA-mediated depletion of Rab1 blocks autophagy downstream of LC3B lipidation, similar to ATG2A depletion. Further, when either autophagosome formation or the early secretory pathway is perturbed, ARFGAP1 and Rab1a accumulate at ectopic locations with autophagic machinery. Our results suggest that ATG2A engages a Rab1a complex on select early secretory membranes at an early stage in autophagosome biogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

OMEGA computationally fragments target genes into short, high-fidelity Golden Gate-compatible oligonucleotides that can be ordered as a pooled library and assembled across multiplexed subpools. We systematically optimized the number of fragments per gene and orthogonal ligation sites per reaction and determine that OMEGA can assemble up to 2.6 kb constructs using as many as 70 Golden Gate sites. To validate the approach, we assembled and functionally screened a library of 810 natural and synthetic GFP variants, recovering 94-97% of target sequences with high uniformity.

In an effort to avert future pandemics, surveillance studies aimed at identifying zoonotic viruses at high risk of spilling over into humans act to monitor the `viral chatter' at the animal-human interface. These studies are hampered, however, by the diversity of zoonotic viruses and the limited tools available to assess pandemic risk. Methods currently in use include the characterization of candidate viruses using in vitro laboratory assays and experimental transmission studies in animal models. However, transmission experiments yield relatively low-resolution outputs that are not immediately translatable to projections of viral dynamics at the level of a host population. To address this gap, we present an analytical framework to extend the use of measurements from experimental transmission studies to generate more quantitative risk assessments. Specifically, we develop modeling approaches for estimating transmission parameters and gauging population-level emergence risk using within-host viral titer data from index and contact animals. To illustrate the use of these approaches, we apply them to two recently published influenza A virus (IAV) ferret transmission experiments: one using influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1pdm09) and one using influenza A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2). We find that, when controlling for viral titers, the H3N2 virus tends to be less transmissible than the H1N1 virus. Because of this difference in infectiousness and more robust replication of H1N1 in ferrets, we further find that the H1N1 virus has a higher projected reproduction number than the H3N2 virus and therefore more likely to cause an epidemic following introduction. Incorporating estimates of the generation interval for each virus, we find that the H1N1 virus has a higher projected epidemic growth rate than the H3N2 virus. The methods we present to assess relative pandemic risk across viral isolates can be used to improve quantitative risk assessment of other emerging viruses of pandemic concern.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

These N-MTSs interact with the translocation machinery and are cleaved in the matrix by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP), a heterodimeric zinc metalloprotease which is essential for the maturation of imported proteins. Import and cleavage of PINK1, a kinase implicated in Parkinson's disease, govern its ability to sense mitochondrial damage, but the MPP cleavage site and its role in PINK1's function remains cryptic. MPP typically cleaves a unique motif in N-MTSs with an arginine in the P2 position, but how MPP recognizes this motif is unclear. Here, we show that recombinant human MPP cleaves PINK1 between Ala28 and Tyr29 yet is turned over slowly compared to other canonical N-MTSs. While MPP cleavage is not required for downstream PARL processing or PINK1 accumulation in cells, the PINK1 N-MTS binds potently to MPP and inhibits the cleavage of other N-MTSs by glueing the regulatory () and catalytic ({beta}) subunits. Finally, we utilize hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to reveal the binding site of the PINK1 N-MTS on MPP. Taken together, our work provides key insight into both the PINK1 import pathway and the mechanisms of MPP processing.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive the onset and progression of synaptic pathology remain to be established. Here, we used synaptic density positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using the [11C]UCB-J radiotracer to reveal a prominent widespread pattern (pFWE < 0.05) of lower synaptic density in individuals with schizophrenia (n=29), compared to a large sample of healthy controls (n=93). We found that the spatial pattern of lower synaptic density in schizophrenia is spatially aligned (rcca = 0.67; p < 0.001) with higher normative distributions of GABAA/BZ, 5HT1B, 5HT2A, and 5HT6, and lower levels of CB1 and 5HT1A. Competing neighborhood deformation network models revealed that regional synaptic pathology strongly correlated with estimates predicted using a model constrained by both interregional structural connectivity and molecular similarity (.42 < r < .61; pFWE < 0.05). These data suggest that synaptic pathology in schizophrenia is jointly constrained by both global axonal connectivity and local molecular vulnerability. Simulation-based network diffusion models were used to identify regions that may represent the initial sources of pathology, nominating left prefrontal areas (pFWE < 0.05) as potential foci from which synaptic pathology initiates and propagates to molecularly similar areas. Overall, our findings provide in vivo evidence for widespread deficit in synaptic density in schizophrenia that is jointly constrained by axonal connectivity and molecular similarity between regions, and that synaptic deficits spread from initial source regions to axonally connected and molecularly similar territories.","NA","medrxiv",1743026935429

Aside from limited insights into nitrate uptake and storage, foundational nitrate biology has lagged. Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors can address this gap with real-time imaging. However, imaging technologies for mammalian cell applications remain rare. Here, we set out to design and engineer a two-domain chimera fusing the split green fluorescent protein EGFP and the nitrate recognition domain NreA from Staphylococcus carnosus. Over 7 rounds of directed evolution, 15 mutations were accumulated resulting in the functional biosensor NitrOFF. NitrOFF has a high degree of allosteric communication between the domains reflected in a turn-off intensiometric response (Kd {approx} 9 {micro}M). This was further reinforced by X-ray crystal structures of apo and nitrate bound NitrOFF, which revealed that the two domains undergo a large-scale conformational rearrangement that changes the relative positioning of the EGFP and NreA domains by 68.4{degrees}. Such a dramatic difference was triggered by the formation of a long helix at the engineered linker connecting the two domains, peeling the {beta}7 strand off the EGFP and thus extinguishing the fluorescence upon nitrate binding. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we highlighted the utility of this first-generation biosensor to monitor exogenous nitrate uptake and modulation in a human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line.

In this study, we generated a comprehensive and curated TE library for the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) by integrating two bioinformatic pipelines (EDTA and DeepTE). Our annotation revealed that TEs account for approximately 37% of the F. vesca genome. Analysis of TE-derived inverted repeats (IRs) and miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) demonstrated their association with 24-nt small interfering RNA (siRNA) production and differential DNA methylation patterns across tissues, suggesting a role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, particularly during fruit ripening. This MITE-mediated epigenetic regulatory mechanism was confirmed by evaluating gene expression and chromatin organization at FvH4_7g18570, which encodes the alcohol acyl transferase (FvAAT1). Three MITEs located upstream or downstream of the FvAAT1 coding sequence were shown to influence epigenetically this gene expression.

Furthermore, we analyzed 210 re-sequenced accessions from the F. vesca European germplasm collection to identify and annotate TE insertion and deletion polymorphisms. A principal component analysis (PCA) based on these polymorphisms revealed subpopulation structures that reflect geographic origins. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) uncovered significant associations between specific TE polymorphisms and economically important fruit traits, including aroma-related volatile compounds and fruit size. Among them, the insertion of a hAT MITE near FvH4_2g00610 correlated with increased levels of {gamma}-decalactone, a desirable aroma compound in strawberries.

These findings underscore the functional significance of TE-derived elements as key contributors to phenotypic diversity through novel regulatory functions. By integrating TE polymorphisms into population-genomic and functional studies, this work provides valuable insights into strawberry fruit development and quality traits. It also highlights the potential of harnessing TE-mediated variation in breeding initiatives and genome editing strategies to improve fruit quality.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

However, the neuronal and behavioral underpinnings of navigating in fluid environments outside vertebrates are poorly understood.

We present behavioral and computational modelling-based evidence that the pre-vertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis actively modulates its heading and angular velocities to counter oncoming flows and perform positive rheotaxis.

We demonstrate that a distributed network of ciliated peripheral sensory neurons is responsible for sensing hydrodynamic information such as flow velocity and direction. Pharmacological removal of sensory cilia impedes rheotactic behavior and reduces stimulus evoked neuronal activity.

Whole-brain calcium imaging experiments reveal that the central nervous system of Ciona can encode the onset and offset of flow, flow direction, and flow velocity, suggesting that miniature chordate brain is capable of surprisingly sophisticated computations.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

While several studies have demonstrated changes in brain function and connectivity associated with psychedelics, we still have a limited understanding of how LSD reshapes brain networks operating across different frequency bands. In this study, we applied the recently developed FREQ-NESS method to MEG data from 14 healthy participants who received LSD under four conditions: eyes-closed with or without music and eyes-open with or without a video stimulus. LSD significantly restructures canonical networks in the alpha and beta bands. Relative to broadband brain activity, it enhances the prominence of high alpha (12.1, 13.3 Hz) across all experimental conditions and high beta (25.3 Hz) in three conditions. Conversely, LSD decreases the prominence of low beta (18.1, 19.3 Hz) in both Open and Closed conditions and low alpha (8.5 Hz) in the latter. In addition, LSD substantially alters the spatial distributions or topographies of the networks. Under LSD, the low alpha (8.5 Hz) network shifts anteriorly toward the motor cortex, while high alpha (12.1, 13.3 Hz) becomes more localized to the visual cortex. Low beta (18.1, 19.3 Hz) expands over the temporal and occipital cortices, whereas high beta (25.3, 26.5 Hz) topographies remain unchanged. Our findings provide critical insights into the specific frequencies and spatial networks in which LSD modulates brain connectivity, adding nuance to prevailing theories about network disintegration under psychedelics.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

The major limitation has been the throughput of the assay, which typically relies upon labor intensive manual steps. The goal of this study was to develop a fully automated hybridization chain reaction (HCR) pipeline capable of large-scale gene expression pattern profiling, with dramatically reduced cost and effort, in the sea urchin Lytechinus pictus. Our resulting pipeline, which we term high throughput (HT)-HCR, can process 192 gene probe sets on whole-mount embryos within 32 hours. The unique qualities of the sea urchin embryo enabled us to automate the entire HCR assay in a 96-well plate format, and utilize highly miniaturized reaction volumes, a general purpose robotic liquid handler, and automated confocal microscopy. From this approach we produced high quality localization data for 101 target genes across three developmental stages of L. pictus. The results reveal the localization of previously undescribed physiological genes, as well as canonical developmental transcription factors. HT-HCR represents a log order increase in the rate at which spatial transcriptomic data can be resolved in the sea urchin. This study paves the way for localization of understudied genes and for sophisticated perturbation analysis.

In the absence of any structures of activated PI3K, the molecular details of its activation remain unknown. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the PI3K/KRas complex embedded in lipid nanodiscs, revealing a rich ensemble of PI3K states adopted at the membrane surface. The sequential addition of a lipid bilayer, PIP2 and an activating phosphopeptide leads to the progressive release of key inhibitory domains from the PI3K catalytic core, which directly correlates with the reorganization of its active site. While association with POPC/POPS nanodiscs partially relieves PI3K autoinhibition, incorporation of PIP2 triggers near-complete displacement of PI3K inhibitory domains and significant restructuring of active site regulatory motifs. The addition of the activating phosphopeptide induces dimerization of the PI3K/KRas complex through a p110 catalytic subunit-mediated interface that is sterically occluded in autoinhibited PI3K. In cells, this dimeric PI3K complex amplifies Akt signaling in response to growth factor stimulation. Collectively, our structures map the conformational landscape of PI3K activation and reveal previously unexplored interfaces for potential therapeutic targeting.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

However, across their diversity, fireflies employ a variety of mating strategies that include both chemical and visual signals. While phylogenetic evidence points to a common ancestor that relied on long-range pheromones, behavioral evidence suggests that light-dependent flashing fireflies do not use smell for mating. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the olfactory genetics of the nocturnal, light-using common eastern firefly, Photinus pyralis. In insects, odors are primarily detected by odorant receptor (OR) proteins embedded in the dendritic membranes of olfactory receptor neurons. If pheromones are part of mate signaling in light-using fireflies, then one or more OR genes should be upregulated in the antennae of the searching sex (males). We therefore annotated the complete suite of ORs from the genome of P. pyralis and measured expression of OR genes between the sexes.

ResultsWe identified 102 ORs in the Photinus pyralis genome, including the conserved single-copy Orco. Our phylogenetic analysis showed lineage-specific OR diversification in P. pyralis relative to other beetle species. Differential expression analysis of male and female antennae and hind legs revealed that a subset of ORs are upregulated in antennae as compared to legs, suggesting a role in adult olfaction. Notably, PpyrOR6 was one of two genes, and the only OR, that was significantly upregulated between male and female antennae, suggesting a role in mating.

ConclusionsThese findings increase known diversity of insect ORs in an understudied beetle family and suggest that bioluminescent fireflies use multimodal signals during mating.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

Combined with other labelling techniques (FUNCAT, DiD, rRNA FISH, DAPI), we show the Mimivirus transcription and translation sites during an infection cycle in the amoeba host cell. While viral mRNA localisation changes depending on the infection stage, transcription occurs at well-defined spots within the viral factory.

However, this effect was transient and less optimal when participants were highly confident in their self-motion-based spatial representation suggesting that internal priors hinder the assimilation of novel spatial cues. At the neural level, RSC theta-band activity supported these recalibration processes. When fine adjustments of the spatial representation were sufficient, landmark presentation elicited stronger theta-band activity and greater phase resetting compared to when substantial spatial updating was necessary.

Discovery of protein localization and protein complex composition are powerful approaches to determine protein function, but have not been widely applied in mycobacteria, in part due to technical barriers. Here we develop a multi-functional system that utilizes the ALFA tag and functional protein fusions to an anti-ALFA nanobody (NBALFA) to target proteins in fast and slow growing mycobacteria. Insertion of the ALFA epitope tag on the target protein, coupled with conditional expression of the NBALFA fused to a fluorescent protein faithfully recapitulates cytosolic and membrane protein localization by fluorescent microscopy in living cells. Targeted NBALFA can relocalize an ALFA tagged protein to inclusion bodies or the cytoplasmic membrane, demonstrating enforced protein localization. Finally, conditional expression of the NBALFA fused to TurboID for proximity proteomics allowed identification of known partner proteins of the RNA polymerase complex and the PKS13 mycolic acid biosynthesis protein. We conclude that the split ALFA tag-nanobody system is a flexible platform for discovery protein biology in mycobacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

Recent studies revealed more details of bone immune interaction and explored various safe and effective immunomodulatory therapies, such as probiotics for the prevention and management of osteoporosis. As a result, various immune factors have continuously been discovered to play specific roles in maintaining bone homeostasis. The role of the Tregs is already well established in the context of post-menopausal osteoporosis (PMO). While Foxp3+ Tregs are mostly matured in the thymus (tTregs), some are also produced from Foxp3-CD4+ T-cell precursors in the peripheral tissues (pTregs). Intriguingly, the specific role of pTregs or tTregs in PMO is still warranted. Foxp3 is required for the suppressive function of Treg cells, but its stability has been debated. Here, we reveal that ROR{gamma}T-FoxP3+pTregs (in the intestine and bone marrow) but not FoxP3+tTregs show plastic behavior and loss of FoxP3 expression transdifferentiate pTregs into ex-Foxp3 Tregs (i.e., osteoclastogenic Th17 cells), under estrogen-deficient PMO conditions. Interestingly, Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) supplementation in a butyrate-mediated manner stabilizes the expression of FoxP3 in pTregs. Furthermore, butyrate-primed pTregs are more potent in inhibiting osteoclastogenesis than the control pTregs. Altogether, our findings for the first time reveal that pTreg-Th17 cell axis do play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of PMO, and probiotic-LA mitigates PMO-induced bone loss via augmenting the immunoporotic potential of pTregs.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

Directly contrasting successful post-sleep vs. pre-sleep recall revealed a shift of alpha power decrease from parietal towards anterior temporal lobe (ATL) after sleep. Critically, time spent in slow wave sleep (SWS) during the intervening night not only predicted the extent of memory retention, but also correlated with the shift to ATL recall effects. Finally, brain-wide functional connectivity profiles during successful recall pointed to a marked overnight reorganisation of memory networks, with the extent of reorganisation again predicted by time spent in SWS.

Here we present a major extension to the stdpopsim framework that enables simulation of various modes of selection, including background selection, selective sweeps, and arbitrary distributions of fitness effects (DFE) acting on annotated subsets of the genome (for instance, exons). This extension maintains stdpopsims core principles of reproducibility and accessibility while adding support for species-specific genomic annotations and published DFE estimates. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by benchmarking methods for demographic inference, DFE estimation, and selective sweep detection across several species and scenarios. Our results demonstrate the robustness of demographic inference methods to selection on linked sites, reveal the sensitivity of DFE-inference methods to model assumptions, and show how genomic features, like recombination rate and functional sequence density, influence power to detect selective sweeps.

Clade diversity trajectories follow rise and decline dynamics, with fast accumulation following recurrent speciation while slowdowns and losses are modulated primarily by changes in extinction. Diversity dynamics do not appear to be governed by clade-level processes expected from adaptive radiations or diversity equilibria. Rather, these patterns emerge from dynamics at the species-level, where lineages tend to become increasingly vulnerable to extinction and less likely to speciate with time.

We performed multi-omic profiling of 3D genome structure and DNA methylation for 86,689 single nuclei across 16 human tissues, identifying 35 major and 206 cell subtypes. We revealed extensive changes in CG and non-CG methylation across almost all cell types and characterized 3D chromatin structure at an unprecedented cellular resolution. Intriguingly, extensive discrepancies exist between cell types delineated by DNA methylation and genome structure, indicating that the role of distinct epigenomic features in maintaining cell identity may vary by lineage.

A single-cell multiplexed patterning screen identifies morphogen concentration and combinations that expand existing organoid models, including conditions that generate medulla glycinergic neurons and cerebellum glutamatergic subtypes. Differential abundance of cell states across screen conditions enables differentiation trajectory reconstruction from region-specific progenitors towards diverse neuron types of mid- and hindbrain, which reveals morphogen-regulon regulatory relationships underlying neuronal fate specification.

While extensive research has explored navigation strategies in rodents, how these strategies emerge and evolve in freely moving non-human primates remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted a longitudinal study to investigate the dynamics of spatial learning and navigation strategies in freely moving common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) performing a foraging task in a semi-naturalistic environment. Marmosets were trained to collect rewards from eight spatially distributed dispensers. Using behavioral analyses combined with machine learning methods, including unsupervised clustering and probabilistic modeling, we examined how their navigation strategies evolved over time. Our results reveal a progressive improvement in performance, accompanied by an increasing structuring of movement patterns. Initially, marmosets exhibited exploratory behaviors, with high transition variability between food dispensers. As training progressed, their navigation became more structured, with the emergence of recurrent transition patterns and a shift towards route-based navigation. However, despite this increasing regularity, their navigation retained a degree of flexibility, allowing them to dynamically adapt their routes rather than following a fixed sequence. These findings suggest that marmosets develop structured yet flexible navigation strategies through experience. Their behavior reflects a balance between efficiency and adaptability and supports the emergence of a flexible representation of space. Our study provides novel insights into spatial memory development in primates and highlights the value of semi-naturalistic paradigms for studying navigation strategies and spatial learning in freely moving animals.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

Traditionally, Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) groups have contributed to the design of clinical research but less often to the analysis and reporting of findings. This study is wholly led by a patient group with no direct input from clinicians, thus presenting an entirely novel and unique patient-centric view.

MethodsThis report draws on data from a Wellbeing Survey led by the Edinburgh IBD Science team as part of the MUSIC IBD cohort study (www.musiscstudy.uk) with over 1,375 IBD respondents over two time periods in 2023 from United Kingdom. The PPI group utilised high-level topic analysis and their own lived experience of IBD to explore the 415 free-text survey responses. Regular discussions allowed the team to reflect on patient narratives and generate findings collaboratively. PPI members contributed to both the structure and content of the final write-up, utilising their diverse backgrounds and skillsets.

ResultsThe analysis provided in-depth exploration of several key themes affecting wellbeing in IBD patients. Of interest, the PPI group discussed and explored themes such as  what does remission mean?, access to care, expectations of self-management, mental and womens health. The patient narratives highlighted the variability of IBD experiences, the interconnectedness of these issues, and the importance of holistic, patient-centric approaches to care. The findings emphasise the necessity for improved support, both within and beyond healthcare settings.

ConclusionThis patient-led research approach demonstrates that allowing patients to lead in analysis ( taking the reins) and reporting provides deeper and impactful insights into IBD experiences. By integrating patient perspectives, this study advocates for a patient-dominant approach to research and care, which can improve outcomes and support ways to address the complexities of living with IBD. The model highlights challenges and benefits of this approach, serving as a foundational template for future patient-led collaborations, in addition to the immediate impact of patients wellbeing from shared experiences, to educating clinicians and people without IBD about the impact of IBD on patients lives.","NA","medrxiv",1743026935429

The newly named ScmA protein of Caulobacter crescentus is one of these solitary cytosine methyltransferases. Here, we show that it methylates YGCCGGCR motifs introducing thousands of m5C bases on the C. crescentus genome. We also find that wild-type C. crescentus cells easily outcompete{Delta} scmA cells during competition experiments. Transcriptome comparisons and using single-cell fluorescent reporters reveal that a DNA damage response is turned on in a significant proportion of{Delta} scmA cells. We then show that this particular response is strictly dependent on the presence of a Vsr-like protein named VsrA. Eventhough the vsrA gene is surprisingly neither genetically linked with the scmA gene nor with another cytosine methyltransferase gene, VsrA is predicted to encode an endonuclease preventing m5C-to-T mutations. Fluorescence microscopy experiments then show that GFP-VsrA forms foci relatively frequently in stationary phase cells, which may correspond to active repair sites. We propose that VsrA may accidentally create double strand breaks when detecting mismatched bases on the genome of{Delta} scmA cells, leading to their observed loss of fitness. Thus, the presence of vsr-like genes can potentially stabilize genes encoding cytosine methyltransferases in bacterial genomes, providing a potential explanation for the relatively high prevalence of solitary cytosine methyltransferases in bacteria even if some of these do not appear to play an easily detectable regulatory role.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

Traditional methods based on sequence homology and statistical models often struggle with complex genetic variations and novel sequences due to their limited ability to interpret the ""language of genes."" To overcome these challenges, we explore Genomic Language Models (gLMs) --inspired by Large Language Models in Natural Language Processing-- to enhance bacterial gene prediction. These models learn patterns and contextual dependencies within genetic sequences, similar to how LLMs process human language. We employ transformers, specifically DNABERT, for bacterial gene prediction using a two-stage framework: first, identifying Coding Sequence (CDS) regions, and then refining predictions by identifying the correct Translation Initiation Sites (TIS). DNABERT is fine-tuned on a curated set of NCBI complete bacterial genomes using a k-mer tokenizer for sequence processing. Our results show that GeneLM significantly improves gene prediction accuracy. Compared to Prodigal, a leading prokaryotic gene finder, GeneLM reduces missed CDS predictions while increasing matched annotations. More notably, our TIS predictions surpass traditional methods when tested against experimentally verified sites. GeneLM demonstrates the power of gLMs in decoding genetic information, achieving state-of-the-art performance in bacterial genome analysis. This advancement highlights the potential of language models to revolutionize genome annotation, outperforming conventional tools and enabling more precise genetic insights.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

CH is associated with risk for hematologic malignancies and cardiovascular disease, but most studies are predominately based on individuals of European ancestry. Using peripheral blood whole exome sequencing data from 125,748 individuals of diverse genetic ancestries, we cataloged 503,703 SM mutations based on low variant allele frequency distributions and 89,361 CH variants based on age-skewing. We examined CH prevalence across ancestry groups, including commonly recognized pathogenic variants in myeloid (M-CHIP) and lymphoid (L-CHIP) malignancies. CH and M-CHIP variants had the highest prevalence in the European non-Finnish ancestry group, and males trended toward more M-CHIP variants. Ancestry differences in CH included more mutations in NF1 in African/African American, TP53 in European, and CUX1 in Asian and Latino/Admixed American ancestry groups. Linking the identified CH variants to a cancer database, CH was detected in 14% (55,190/391,102) of patient tumors. Prevalence of CH variants in some solid tumors ranged from 25% - 40%. M-CHIP variants in solid tumors were associated with younger age (61 vs 63, p <0.001), while M-CHIP in hematologic malignancies were linked to older age (60 vs 50, p <0.001), suggesting differences in disease biology.

The ability to grow on methoxylated aromatic acids (e.g., vanillic acid) has recently been identified in certain clades of methylotrophs, bacteria characterized by their unique ability to tolerate and metabolize high concentrations of formaldehyde. Here, we use a phyllosphere methylotroph isolate, Methylobacterium extorquens SLI 505, as a model to identify the fate of formaldehyde during methylotrophic growth on vanillic acids. M. extorquens SLI 505 displays concentration-dependent growth phenotypes on vanillic acid without concomitant formaldehyde accumulation. We conclude that M. extorquens SLI 505 overcomes potential metabolic bottlenecks from simultaneous assimilation of multicarbon and C1 intermediates by allocating formaldehyde towards dissimilation and assimilating the ring carbons of vanillic acid heterotrophically. We correlate this strategy with maximization of bioenergetic yields and demonstrate that formaldehyde dissimilation for energy generation rather than formaldehyde detoxification is advantageous for growth on aromatic acids. M. extorquens SLI 505 also exhibits catabolite repression during growth on methanol and low concentrations of vanillic acid, but no diauxie during growth on methanol and high concentrations of vanillic acid.

We did not observe any gross differences in infection-driven pathology in the absence of iCCRs. Despite iCCR deletion resulting in decreased migration of monocytes, migratory macrophages and B cells to lungs during acute IAV infection, no differences in dendritic cell numbers were observed. Whilst the total number of T cells was similar in lungs of iCCR-deficient mice, the number of IAV-specific CD4 but not CD8 T cells in the lung was strongly reduced in the absence of iCCRs. Furthermore, fewer CD4, but not CD8, T cells produced IFN-{gamma}.

This CD4 T cell phenotype persisted into the memory stage of infection, with fewer IAV-specific and IFN-{gamma}+ CD4 but not CD8 T cells at 29 days post infection.

In conclusion, despite having no impact on dendritic cell migration between the lung and the draining lymph node, iCCR deletion is associated with an altered CD4 T cell response to IAV infection.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

Here, we identify fundamental patterns of white matter maturation by examining developmental variation along major, long-range cortico-cortical tracts in youth ages 5-23 years using diffusion MRI from three large-scale, cross-sectional datasets (total N = 2,710). Across datasets, we delineate two replicable axes of human white matter development. First, we find a deep-to-superficial axis, in which superficial tract regions near the cortical surface exhibit greater age-related change than deep tract regions. Second, we demonstrate that the development of superficial tract regions aligns with the cortical hierarchy defined by the sensorimotor-association axis, with tract ends adjacent to sensorimotor cortices maturing earlier than those adjacent to association cortices. These results reveal developmental variation along tracts that conventional tract-average analyses have previously obscured, challenging the implicit assumption that white matter tracts mature uniformly along their length. Such developmental variation along tracts may have functional implications, including mitigating ephaptic coupling in densely packed deep tract regions and tuning neural synchrony through hierarchical development in superficial tract regions - ultimately refining neural transmission in youth.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

Traditional community detection algorithms assign each node to one module, but this representation cannot capture integrative, multi-functional nodes that span multiple communities. Despite the increasing availability of overlapping community detection algorithms (OCDAs) to capture such integrative nodes, there is no objective procedure for selecting the most appropriate method and its parameters for a given problem. Here we overcome this limitation by introducing a datadriven method for selecting an OCDA and its parameters from performance on a tailored ensemble of generated benchmark networks, assessing 22 unique algorithms and parameter settings. Applied to the human structural connectome, we find that the  Order Statistics Local Optimization Method (OSLOM) best identifies ground-truth overlapping structure in the benchmark ensemble and yields a seven-network decomposition of the human cortex. These modules are bridged by fifteen overlapping regions that generally sit at the apex of the putative cortical hierarchy--suggesting integrative, higher-order function-- with network participation increasing along the cortical hierarchy, a finding not supported using a non-overlapping modular decomposition. This data-driven approach to selecting OCDAs is applicable across domains, opening new avenues to detecting and quantifying informative structures in complex real-world networks.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

Here, we demonstrate that SB431542, a selective TGF-{beta} receptor I (ALK5) inhibitor, exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 through unprecedented multitargeted mechanisms. Through comprehensive in vitro, and in silico analyses, we identified that SB431542 directly binds to SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and disrupt its canonical function in inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion. This interaction restored lysosomal acidification and normalized perinuclear LAMP-1 localization, significantly impairing virion assembly as evidenced by disrupted nucleocapsid-RNA association and reduced intracellular viral titers. Additionally, SB431542 downregulated the CLEAR network genes responsible for lysosomal biogenesis, further restricting viral egress pathways. Our temporal analyses revealed that at later infection stages (36-48 hpi), SARS-CoV-2 exploits TGF-{beta}-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and apoptosis for viral release--processes effectively inhibited by SB431542 through suppression of GADD45b and BAX expression. These multiple mechanisms resulted in an exceptional EC50 of 515 nM against SARS-CoV-2. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in embryonated chicken eggs, where SB431542 conferred dose-dependent protection against lethal infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) challenge, with a favourable therapeutic index of 34.54. Remarkably, sequential passaging of SARS-CoV-2 for 50 generations under SB431542 selection pressure failed to generate resistant variants, contrasting sharply with the rapid resistance emergence typical of direct-acting antivirals. These findings establish SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor with a unique triple-mechanism approach that simultaneously targets viral entry via TGF-{beta}/Smad modulation, disrupts ORF3a-mediated lysosomal dysfunction affecting assembly, and attenuates TGF-{beta}-induced apoptosis during late-stage infection-- collectively imposing multiple selective constraints that impede escape mutation development.

ImportanceThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need for antiviral drugs with high barriers to resistance. This study reveals that SB431542, a drug previously developed to inhibit TGF-{beta} signaling, exhibits remarkable effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 through an unprecedented triple-mechanism approach. Unlike conventional antivirals that target a single viral component, SB431542 simultaneously disrupts viral entry, assembly, and release by binding to the viral ORF3a protein and modulating host cellular processes. Most importantly, SARS-CoV-2 failed to develop resistance against SB431542 even after 50 generations of exposure--a significant advantage over current therapeutics that quickly lose effectiveness due to viral mutations. Our findings also uncover that coronaviruses exploit both lysosomal dysfunction and programmed cell death to spread efficiently, providing new targets for therapeutic intervention. This research establishes SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor and demonstrates the value of targeting host-virus interactions to overcome antiviral resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1743026935429

While highly processed food like packaged products, processed meat, and sweetened soft drinks have been increasingly associated with unhealthy diet, information on the degree of processing characterizing an item in a store is not straight forward to obtain, limiting the ability of individuals to make informed choices. Here we introduce GroceryDB, a database with over 50,000 food items sold by Walmart, Target, and Wholefoods, unveiling how big data can be harnessed to empower consumers and policymakers with systematic access to the degree of processing of the foods they select, and the potential alternatives in the surrounding food environment. The extensive data gathered on ingredient lists and nutrition facts enables a large-scale analysis of ingredient patterns and degrees of processing, categorized by store, food category, and price range. Our findings reveal that the degree of food processing varies significantly across different food categories and grocery stores. Furthermore, this data allows us to quantify the individual contribution of over 1,000 ingredients to ultra-processing. GroceryDB and the associated http://TrueFood.Tech/ website make this information accessible, guiding consumers toward less processed food choices while assisting policymakers in reforming the food supply.","NA","medrxiv",1743026935429
