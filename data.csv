However, standard gLMs adapted from natural language processing often require extremely large model sizes and computational resources, yet still fall short of classical evolutionary models in predictive tasks. Here, we introduce GPN-Star (Genomic Pretrained Network with Species Tree and Alignment Representation), a biologically grounded gLM featuring a phylogeny-aware architecture that leverages whole-genome alignments and species trees to model evolutionary relationships explicitly. Trained on alignments spanning vertebrate, mammalian, and primate evolutionary timescales, GPN-Star achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of variant effect prediction tasks in both coding and non-coding regions of the human genome. Analyses across timescales reveal task-dependent advantages of modeling more recent versus deeper evolution. To demonstrate its potential to advance human genetics, we show that GPN-Star substantially outperforms prior methods in prioritizing pathogenic and fine-mapped GWAS variants; yields unprecedented enrichments of complex trait heritability; and improves power in rare variant association testing. Extending beyond humans, we train GPN-Star for five model organisms - Mus musculus, Gallus gallus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabidopsis thaliana - demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the framework. Taken together, these results position GPN-Star as a scalable, powerful, and flexible new tool for genome interpretation, well suited to leverage the growing abundance of comparative genomics data.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35-GM134922;3P40-OD011102-24S1 7772;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350401

Using this platform, we identified a total of 99 STICs and their presumed precursors that harbor TP53 mutations in morphologically unremarkable tubal epithelium in all five specimens obtained from cancer-free organ donors with average-risk of developing ovarian cancer. Although these lesions comprised only 0.2% of the epithelial compartment, they displayed geographic diversity, immune exclusion, metabolic rewiring, and DNA copy number changes among lesions and normal fallopian tube epithelium discovered alterations in STIC-associated genes and the pathways they control. In sum, this platform provides a comprehensive 3D atlas of early neoplastic transformation, yielding mechanistic insights into tumor initiation and informing clinical screening strategies for detecting cancer precursors in whole organs at cellular resolution.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U54CA268083;RO1CA300052;UG3CA275681;P50CA228991;R01GM149976;U01AI167892;5R01NS111039;R21NS125395;U54 HL165443;U54 DK 134301;R01 HL170107;U2CCA271891;""},{""name"":""Sloan research fellow award, a CZI Scialog award, and UCSD Startup funds"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Johns Hopkins University and Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico student exchange program (HOPTEC and FLAD)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Richard W.

Currently, no holistic or even symptom specific treatment options are available, likely due to both a lack of insight into the disease processes that drive LC and an extreme heterogeneity in patient profiles. We characterised patients and post infection controls, with respect to their immunological profiles with a non-exhaustive panel of biomarkers rationalised based on their potential role in driving symptoms. We observed that the patients symptoms could be grouped into 4 clusters suggesting possible stratification. Systemic inflammation persisted and did not normalize over time in LC. This was not related to persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection, as the presence of circulating N-protein was detected similarly in both patients and controls. No obvious deviation in B-cells and monocytes profiles were observed with minor changes for NK-cells (CD62L+/CD16+/HLA-DR+). Major changes affected CD4+T-cells (and to a lesser extent CD8+T-cells) with respect to exhaustion (PD1+/LAG3+/CD44+), regulation (Treg) and differentiation (naive/memory-CD62L+). Several candidate biomarkers (cytokines, microRNAs, phosphate metabolism) were present more frequently in LC at high levels and provided information on underlying disease processes. While frequencies of candidate autoantibody+ participants were not different, levels of some antibodies were higher in LC. Yet none of these candidates stood out as a universal biomarker for LC, with the exception of CRP (73% cases), and loss of Treg (50%). However, we confirmed that several overlapping underlying aetiologies may be involved in this complex disease. Specific groups of biomarkers also associated with the 4 cluster of patients. Although to be taken with caution due to small numbers, 3 biomarkers discriminated controls from patients (Treg/CD4+PD1+/CD4+CD161+), others were associated with symptoms recovery (low IL10/IL12/IL4 and high miR766) or deterioration (high CD4+CD38+/ CD8+naiveCD62L+/low IL2) over 12 months. This study provides rational for developing targeted therapeutic strategies as well as biomarkers to stratify LC patients most likely to respond.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758665350401

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350401

Most studies have focused on the hippocampus and other higher areas. However, behavioral evidence demonstrating links between image properties and memorability and revealing image specificity of visual memory suggests an important role for mid-level visual cortex. We tested the hypothesis that area V4 contains signals that could support recognition memory. Our task increased difficulty, allowing comparisons of neuronal population responses on correct and error trials. We observed signatures of several proposed memory mechanisms including magnitude coding, repetition suppression, sparse coding, and population response consistency, but only sparse coding and population response consistency predicted behavior. Familiar images also evoked faster dynamics, consistent with pattern completion. These findings demonstrate that the building blocks of fast, high-capacity memory are present in mid-level sensory cortex, highlighting its role in distributed memory networks.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Drug Abuse"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00fq5cm18"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5T90DA059109-03;""},{""name"":""National Eye Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wkg3b53"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01EY034723;R01EY022930;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RF1NS121913;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""542961SPI;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350401

For example, someone talking about their hand is not referring to the other speakers hand, but the word hand still carries speaker-general information (e.g., having five fingers). These two requirements impose a cross-speaker generalization / differentiation dilemma that is not well addressed by existing theories. We hypothesized that the brain resolves the dilemma by use of a vectorial semantic code that blends collinear and orthogonal coding subspaces. To test this hypothesis, we examined semantic encoding in populations of hippocampal single neurons recorded during conversations between epilepsy patients and healthy partners in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). We found clear semantic encoding for both spoken and heard words, with strongest encoding just around the time of utterance for production, and just after it for reception. Crucially, hippocampal neurons codes for word meaning were poised between orthogonalized and collinearized. Moreover, different semantic categories were orthogonalized to different degrees; body parts and names were most differentiated between speakers; function words and verbs were least differentiated. Finally, the hippocampus used the same coding principle to separate different partners in three-person conversations, with greater orthogonalization between self and other than between two others. Together, these results suggest a new solution to the problem of binding word meanings with speaker identity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350401

Although single-cell RNA-sequencing studies have characterized immune cellular features of COVID-19, they have not shown how tocilizumab treatment changes these features at single-cell resolution, or which features might persist into convalescence. In this study, we analyzed 2.5 million circulating immune cells from 428 patients across time points (840 PBMC samples), encompassing three contemporaneous SARS-CoV-2 cohorts: acutely infected patients across five WHO disease severity levels and three time points, patients from the first randomized control trial to study the efficacy of tocilizumab in the management of COVID-19, and convalescent patients three months after infection. We used linear modeling to integrate multiple data types -- including single-cell RNA-seq, CITE-seq, TCR and BCR sequencing, viral load measurements, viral neutralization assays, detection of 75 autoantibodies, HLA genotype data, and serum proteomics covering 1,463 targets -- to derive the most comprehensive view to-date of the biological features of COVID-19 disease severity. Our findings show that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) act as a key immunologic pivot point in severe COVID-19. Myeloid dysfunction, which is marked by impaired antigen presentation, drives a non-productive adaptive immune response, as reflected by reduced expression of B and T cell gene programs involved in antigen recognition, immune synapse formation, and cytotoxicity. Severe disease is also linked to autoantibodies targeting type I interferons, influenced by specific HLA-DQB1 allelic variants, and strongly correlated with serum IL-6 levels. Tocilizumab treatment eliminates CLU-expressing MDSCs and ISG-positive myeloid subsets, restores antigen presentation, and reactivates productive adaptive immunity. These changes align with improved clinical outcomes and better clinical laboratory measures, including reduced CRP. While many immunologic abnormalities in acute severe COVID-19 resolve during convalescence 3-months post-infection, we observed persistently high ICOS expression in regulatory T cells, potentially linking acute infection to chronic post-COVID syndromes. Overall, we define distinct innate and adaptive host immune responses associated with acute, IL-6-responsive, and convalescent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our multimodal and high-dimensional dataset with curated clinical metadata provides a foundational and clinically relevant resource for modeling host immune response biology in health and disease.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758665350401

From segmentations and trajectories, we extracted dynamic features-cell and nuclear shape, movement, position-to create a time-resolved morphodynamic dataset spanning the full course of differentiation. While single features showed high noise and low separability of ground-truth cell types, supervised machine learning revealed that integrating time-resolved features robustly predicts final cell fate. Gradient-boosted trees and multinomial logistic regression achieved moderate but consistent accuracy, especially for abundant epithelial lineages. Key discriminants included normalized Z-position, membrane-nucleus offset, and absolute experimental time, whereas movement contributed minimally to the results.

Sideways locomotion is a defining feature of true crabs (Brachyura) and may have contributed to their ecological success. Yet, the evolutionary origin of this unique behavior remains unknown. Here we show that the prevalence of sideways locomotion in true crabs reflects a single evolutionary origin from a forward-moving ancestor. Our behavioral analysis of 50 live crab species indicates that crab locomotion can be separated into two distinct types, sideways and forward locomotion, with no intermediates. The phylogenetic comparative analysis revealed a single origin of sideways locomotion, with multiple independent reversions to forward locomotion in ecologically specialized groups. The species richness data show that the lineage in which sideways locomotion originated is far more diverse than its nearest outgroups. These results suggest that sideways locomotion acted as a key innovation, potentially promoting adaptive radiation by enabling true crabs to exploit a wide range of ecological niches. Such a rare but innovative behavioral trait provides a framework for understanding how locomotor modes shape evolutionary diversification in animals.","[{""name"":""Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from The Japan Science Society"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-4086;2025-4060;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350401

These findings reveal WTAs as a novel class of MAMPs in plants and highlight CRKs as key components in their perception.","[{""name"":""DFG"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RI 2920/3-1;GRK 2172;INST 186/1277-1 FUGG;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350401

Synteny, the conservation of gene order along a chromosome, presents a promising alternative source of phylogenetic information that is potentially less prone to these issues. Here we compare sequence and synteny phylogenetic phylogenomic approaches to unravel the evolutionary history of Cypriniformes, one of the most species-rich lineages of freshwater fishes. This clade has been plagued by uncertainty, particularly concerning the phylogenetic relationships between its four major subclades: Gyrinocheilidae (algae eaters), Catostomidae (suckers), Cobitoidei (loaches), and Cyprinoidei (minnows and carps). Phylogenomic approaches require high-quality genomic resources, which have been lacking for the family Gyrinocheilidae, a key lineage for understanding cypriniform evolution. To address this, we generated the first chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation for the Chinese Algae Eater (Gyrinocheilus aymonieri). We utilized this new genome along with 42 other fish genomes to conduct comprehensive phylogenomic analyses and compare results from sequence-based methods with a microsynteny-based approach. Although chromosome-level macrosynteny is broadly conserved among cypriniforms, we demonstrate that microsynteny has impressive power to resolve deep phylogenetic nodes. Both sequence-based and microsynteny-based analyses find that Gyrinocheilidae is the sister lineage to all other cypriniforms, resolving a long-standing phylogenetic point of contention. However, while sequence-based analyses provided weak support for the relationships among the remaining subclades, our microsynteny analysis revealed a novel and strongly supported sister relationship between Catostomidae and Cyprinoidei. This conclusion is supported by a 3- to 12-fold greater number of shared microsynteny clusters (synapomorphies) compared to the alternative topologies. We also demonstrate that microsynteny synapomorphies often arise from gene family expansions. Conservation of synteny concentrated in specific genomic regions may harbor the genomic underpinnings of the unique aspects of these clades and have played an important role in the evolutionary history of these taxa. Together, these results provide a robust phylogenomic backbone for Cypriniformes. More broadly, our findings highlight the power of microsynteny to resolve recalcitrant phylogenetic nodes where sequence data is uninformative, while also underscoring the critical importance of high-quality reference genomes, as our work also shows that including fragmented assemblies can lead to spurious results. Beyond phylogenomics, our results also provide a functional genomics glimpse into how conserved, clade-specific blocks of co-linear genes (synteny synapomorphies) might contribute to what makes this hyperdiverse clade so unique and evolutionarily successful.","[{""name"":""University at Buffalo, State University of New York"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01y64my43"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TJK laboratory startup funds;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350401

Although pain states increase vulnerability to opioid use disorders, the neural mechanisms underlying this interaction remain incompletely understood. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a key site for opioid actions, and emerging evidence suggests that pain states and opioid experience both induce transcriptional, molecular, and circuit adaptations in the VTA that contribute to motivated behaviors. However, the transcriptional responses of distinct VTA cell types to each of these factors (alone or in combination) have not been identified. Here, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to comprehensively define transcriptional alterations in the rat VTA to acute morphine administration in a chronic inflammatory pain model. We report that morphine induces gene expression changes primarily in glial cells and dopamine neurons, with minimal effects in other neuronal cell types. Surprisingly, VTA astrocytes and oligodendrocytes exhibited the most robust transcriptional responses to opioid exposure, despite lacking detectable opioid receptor expression. Among the most highly regulated glial genes was Fkbp5, which encodes a co-chaperone protein that acts in concert with heat shock proteins to modulate stress responses. Using pharmacological and CRISPR-based approaches in rat glial cells and human astrocytes, we demonstrate that regulation of Fkbp5 is mediated indirectly through glucocorticoid signaling rather than direct opioid receptor activation. These findings reveal that glial cells within reward circuits undergo profound transcriptional reprogramming in response to opioids through indirect, stress-hormone mediated mechanisms, highlighting a previously unappreciated non-neuronal contribution to opioid-induced neural adaptations.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01DA053743;R01DA054714;K99MH127244;""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Neurobiology of Brain Disorders Award;""},{""name"":""UAB Center for Addiction and Pain Prevention and Intervention"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pilot Award;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

We combine genetics, multi-omics and cryo-electron tomography to show that BAM complex inhibition by L-type pyocins or the peptide antibiotic darobactin triggers a multifaceted transcriptomic, proteomic and morphological response. Despite this, BAM inhibition ultimately leads to a catastrophic loss of membrane integrity and cell death.

Deep sequencing and de novo assembly enabled the investigation of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from periopathogens within the genus Tannerella. DNA preservation within the dental calculus of King Richard III was found to be exceptional, yielding an extraordinarily well-preserved oral microbiota. Oral microbiome species diversity fell within the range previously observed among other northern European populations over the past 7,000 years, suggesting that a royal lifestyle and a rich diet did not substantially shift his oral microbiome composition. Reconstructed Tannerella genomes contained many virulence factors found today among periopathogens, including Tannerella forsythia. Insufficient plant and animal DNA was recovered to investigate diet, suggesting that dental calculus may not be a sufficient source of dietary DNA for dietary reconstruction, even when well-preserved.

Whether chromatin assembly on newly replicated strands is also asymmetric remains unknown, as visualizing this short-lived state in cells is impossible. To circumvent this limitation, we combine in vitro reconstitution of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA and chromatin replication machineries with replication-aware single-molecule chromatin footprinting, to study how chromatin is re-assembled on replicated DNA. Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid. These pathways have implications for essential chromatin-templated processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and gene silencing at replication forks.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""851564;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.233.038;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2-HG012442;""},{""name"":""W.

In light of this, we developed FixGrower, a standardized protocol for center-port fixation training. FixGrower (1) requires a longer initial fixation requirement, (2) increases the required fixation duration at session boundaries customized to each animals performance, and (3) delays the introduction of violation penalties until the end of training. We demonstrate FixGrower decreases training time by 61%, yields low violation rates, and generalizes across rodent species and task difficulty. Moreover, the success of this curriculum is well supported by theories of operant conditioning and reinforcement learning.

Unfortunately, only minimal scientific information on the effects of 6-MN is available. Objective: To determine the extent to which 6-MN produces nicotine-like effects on body temperature, wheel activity and nociception in laboratory rodents. Methods: Middle-aged (starting at Post Natal Day 425) female Wistar rats were evaluated for rectal temperature, voluntary wheel activity, and nociceptive responses (warm water tail-withdrawal) to subcutaneous injection of nicotine (0.0, 0.8 mg/kg) or 6-methyl nicotine (6-MN; 0.0, 0.4, 0.8 mg/kg). Temperature and nociceptive responses to vapor inhalation of 6-MN [0-30 mg/mL in the propylene glycol (PG) vehicle] were assessed. Finally, the self-administration of 6-MN vapor was compared with nicotine vapor self-administration. Results: 6-MN decreased rectal temperature, suppressed wheel activity and induced modest nociceptive effects. The magnitude of the effect of 0.8 mg/kg 6-MN and 0.8 mg/kg nicotine were similar across all three assays. Vapor self-administration of 6-MN and nicotine was likewise comparable at a 10 mg/mL concentration. Conclusion: 6-MN administered by injection or by vapor inhalation produces behavioral and physiological effects that are very similar to those produced by nicotine in rats. It is therefore likely that detrimental health effects of 6-MN will be quite similar to those established for nicotine.","[{""name"":""Tobacco Related Disease Research Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T33IR6653;""},{""name"":""National Institute on Drug Abuse"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00fq5cm18"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R01 DA057423;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

Here, we use whole-brain, cellular-resolution c-Fos mapping to define brain-wide activity patterns and neuronal ensembles associated with morphine administration and withdrawal. To account for the brain's anatomically nested structure, we developed and applied a hierarchical statistical framework that detects region-specific changes in activity and outperforms conventional methods that treat brain regions as individual, unrelated units. These distributed signals formed ensembles with consistent and anatomically structured patterns of activity, both within subregions and across multiple connected brain areas. By combining TRAP2-based activity tagging with acute whole-brain c-Fos staining, we identified morphine- and withdrawal-activated ensembles and found that they are largely non-overlapping at the single-cell level, even within the same brain region. Integration with existing spatial transcriptomics datasets identified molecular markers for these state-specific ensembles in key brain areas such as the nucleus of accumbens, amygdala and ventral tegmental areas. Lastly, by integrating Allen mouse whole-brain transcriptional datasets, we identified the molecular identity of the morphine- administration and withdrawal ensembles. These findings define dissociable neuronal ensembles that encode opposing drug states and introduce a scalable framework for linking whole-brain activity to molecular and circuit-level mechanisms.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R37 DA032750;R01 DA038168;R01 DA054317;P30 DA048736;""},{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DMS-2303371;DMS-2134107;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

Interleaving the two tasks hindered performance when their structures were similar, compared to when they were different.

Here, we show that an increase in mechanical loading induces muscle fiber growth through two distinct mechanisms. Radial growth, reflected by an increase in fiber cross-sectional area, is mediated through an mTORC1-dependent signaling pathway, whereas longitudinal growth, marked by the in-series addition of sarcomeres, is mediated through an mTORC1-independent signaling pathway. To gain further insight into the events that drive longitudinal growth, we combined BONCAT-based labeling of newly synthesized proteins with high-resolution imaging and determined that the in-series addition of sarcomeres is mediated by a process that involves transverse splitting at the Z-lines of pre-existing sarcomeres. Collectively, our findings not only challenge the long-standing view that mechanically induced growth is uniformly governed by mTORC1, but they also lay the framework for a new understanding of the molecular and structural events that drive this process.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AR082816;R01AR074932;R56AR057347;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

However, the conditions and mechanisms that lead to the robust induction of respiratory IgA responses following mucosal vaccination remain poorly understood. It is also currently debatable whether mucosal vaccination is still warranted given that most individuals in developed countries have established a hybrid immunity from vaccination and infection. Here we characterized respiratory mucosal immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination or both in humans. We found that hybrid immunity resulted in moderately increased respiratory IgA and neutralizing antibody responses compared to infection or vaccination alone. However, a direct comparison of hybrid immunity and a mucosal adenovirus-based booster vaccination in animal models revealed that respiratory booster immunization elicited markedly stronger and more durable respiratory IgA, T cell response, and protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, supporting the promise of respiratory mucosal vaccination. Mechanistically, we found that mucosal booster immunization induced local IgA-secreting cells in the respiratory mucosa, aided by pulmonary CD4+ T cells in situ. Strikingly, local IL-21-producing Blimp-1+ Th1 effector cells were critical in mediating the CD4+ T cell help for respiratory IgA production. Furthermore, lung macrophages were important for this respiratory IgA response via the production of TGF-{beta}. Consequently, we demonstrated delivery of adenoviral booster to the lower airway was necessary to generate robust upper and lower airway IgA responses. Collectively, our results uncover a local cellular network supporting enhanced respiratory IgA responses, with implications for the development of optimal mucosal immunization strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

While most USPs are agnostic to polyubiquitin linkage-type, their substrate specificity is thought to be mediated by the recognition of the ubiquitylated protein itself. In addition to their catalytic domain, USPs have one or more auxiliary domains (ADs) with key functions in regulating DUB activity and subcellular localization. We hypothesize that some ADs bind short linear motifs (SLiMs) typically found in intrinsically disordered regions of proteins to achieve targeting to substrates and multiprotein complexes. To test this hypothesis, we systematically assessed the potential of 29 USP-ADs and two full-length USPs for SLiM binding using a combination of proteomic-peptide phage display, peptide arrays and affinity measurements. We discovered SLiM-based interactions for 14 ADs from 9 USP-DUBs, including CYLD, USP11, USP19, USP20, USP22 and USP33, and define the consensus motif and properties of the SLiM-AD binding. Interestingly, we established that the zf-UBP and DUSP2 domains of USP20 and USP33 are SLiM binding ADs with similar binding profiles, explaining the functional redundancy between the two DUBs. Our work reveals unique motifs recognized by the auxiliary domains CAP-Gly, UBL, zf-UBP and DUSP, with potential functional implications for substrate recognition and complex assemblies.","[{""name"":""Swedish Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03zttf063"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2020-03380;""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101002428;""},{""name"":""Israel Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04sazxf24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""301/2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

Previous studies investigating the mechanism of toxin secretion from the bacterium have yielded disparate results as to whether the bacteria undergo lysis and whether TcdE is required. Here, we demonstrate that TcdE and TcdA are only expressed in a small subset of cells in culture. The cells with high TcdE and TcdA expression show disrupted membranes, consistent with a form of bacterial lysis. The artificial overexpression of TcdE and TcdA through TcdR induction promotes tcdE-dependent bacterial lysis and cell death, even in 630{triangleup}erm, a strain previously thought to have tcdE-independent toxin secretion.

Consortia of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME-2) and sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) represent globally relevant syntrophic associations capable of growing with minimal amounts of free energy and can persist when methane becomes limiting. Their potential for physiological plasticity, including the use of electron donors beyond methane is poorly understood. Carbon monoxide (CO) has been reported in seep environments and represents a thermodynamically favourable alternative electron donor due to its low reduction potential. We demonstrate that environmental ANME-SRB consortia can oxidize CO in the absence of methane, in anoxic microcosm experiments using a combination of stable isotope geochemical tracers, metatranscriptomics, and single cell activity measurements (FISH-nanoSIMS). The oxidation of CO was coupled with sulphate-reduction by syntrophic consortia, and, in the absence of sulphate, through CO2 reduction to methane by ANME-2. Under these conditions, the production of methane was one ninth the rate of methanotrophy coupled to sulphate-reduction. Paired single cell FISH-nanoSIMS analysis of anabolic activity indicates that CO respiration appears to support cell maintenance rather than active growth, consistent with the observed down-regulation of energy generating complexes in ANME (e.g., mtr, rnf, etc.). The versatile capability of CO oxidation by anaerobic methanotrophic consortia broadens our understanding of carbon cycling in methane seeps and highlights potential mechanisms of resilience by methanotrophic archaea under changing geochemical regimes.","[{""name"":""U.S. Department of Energy"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0022991;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

Current pathological models emphasize defects in nuclear mechanics and transcription regulation. Yet these models do not fully explain the complexity of EDMD or other laminopathies. Here, we uncover an emerging pathway linking nuclear lamina defects to the reorganization of cytoplasmic biophysics, revealing how nuclear dysfunction cascades throughout the cell. Using Caenorhabditis elegans EDMD models, we demonstrate that lamin mutations dramatically alter cytoplasmic organization, reducing macromolecular crowding and increasing diffusivity of 40 nm Genetically Encoded Multimeric (GEM) nanoparticles. These striking biophysical changes coincide with nuclear positioning defects and collapsed endoplasmic reticulum architecture, mirroring phenotypes associated with ribosome depletion. We propose a mechanism where mutations in the C. elegans lamin lmn-1 disrupt nucleolar density and ribosome biogenesis, creating a nucleolar-ribosomal axis that propagates defects from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Genetic interactions between lmn-1 and ribosomes support this regulatory relationship. While individual depletion of other nuclear envelope proteins produces minimal effects, combined loss of the functionally redundant emerin ortholog emr-1 and LEM-domain protein lem-2 phenocopied lmn-1 mutants, demonstrating that cytoplasmic biophysical disruption lies at EDMD's pathogenic core.

Poly-substance use is rarely assessed in rodent models of drug seeking and this study determined if training drug alters the apparent reinforcing properties of methamphetamine (MA) and -pyrrolidinopentiophenone (-PVP).

MethodsFemale and male Wistar rats (N=8 per group) were trained in the intravenous self-administration (IVSA) of -PVP or MA. The impact of dose substitution (0.0125, 0.0250, 0.100, 0.300 mg/kg/infusion) for each training drug was then assessed in all groups under FR and Progressive Ratio schedules of reinforcement.

ResultsMale and female rats obtained similar numbers of infusions of MA (0.05 mg/kg/infusion) and of -PVP (0.05 mg/kg/infusion) during acquisition, however more infusions of -PVP than of MA were obtained by each sex. Mean lever discrimination ratios exceeded 80% on the drug-associated lever within 5 training sessions for -PVP groups but were not consistently at this level for either MA group. Drug potency was similar across groups but was less effective in the MA-trained males.

ConclusionsInterpretations of sex differences in the acquisition of drug IVSA require caution when dose is not varied across or within group. This study also further confirms that the apparent efficacy of a drug as a reinforcer depends at least partially on the behavioral antecedents, including the identity of the drug used for initial IVSA acquisition.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Drug Abuse"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00fq5cm18"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 DA042211;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

Predictive models, called epigenetic clocks, are being built across the tree of life, including humans, other mammals and vertebrates and, recently, invertebrates. However, it always involves cross-fertilizing organisms, thus presenting a high level of genetic diversity. To decipher the exact role of epigenetics in adaptation and evolution, distinguishing true epigenetic variation from changes that reflect genetic variation is essential. Results: Here, we used the mangrove rivulus, the only self-fertilizing vertebrate, to study epigenetic aging in the brain and construct an epigenetic clock. We generated a reduced representation bisulfite sequencing dataset of 90 brain tissues from individuals aged 60-1100 days to construct a highly accurate age predictor using 40 CpG sites (R squared > 0.96, mean absolute error of 28.7 days). We associated the CpG sites with their respective closest genes and explored their biological functions. Genes relevant to aging include lamin-A (responsible for several age-related processes), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (whose absence causes premature aging) and several genes associated with Alzheimer's disease identified in human studies. We also propose several methods to improve classic epigenetic clock regression. Conclusions: This study is the first construction of an epigenetic clock in a self-fertilizing species, demonstrating that DNA methylation patterns undergo consistent changes across the lifespan of isogenic individuals. These findings emphasize putative changes in DNA methylation related to functional changes across aging in the brain.","[{""name"":""Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique BE"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

Methods and Findings We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of urban and rural differences in adult pulmonary TB prevalence in low- and middle-income countries between 1993 and 2024.

We also stratified analysis by survey-level risk of bias and TB screening algorithm, investigated time trends, and evaluated associations with country-level TB incidence and population proportion living in urban areas. To estimate the number of people with prevalent TB in urban and rural areas in study countries, and how these have changed between 2000 and 2023, we fitted a Bayesian multivariate model to WHO incidence and case detection ratio data and combined these estimates with assumptions about the duration of treated and untreated TB and the distribution of urban and rural populations.

The pooled urban-to-rural prevalence ratio of bacteriologically-confirmed TB was 1.08 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 0.87-1.33) and was 1.21 (95% CrI: 0.92-1.57) for smear-positive TB. However, there were substantial differences between WHO regions: the African Region had higher urban bacteriologically-confirmed prevalence (PR: 1.29, CrI: 1.01-1.61), while the Western Pacific Region had higher rural prevalence (PR: 0.64, CrI: 0.45-0.89), and burden was broadly similar in the South-East Asia Region (PR: 0.86, 95% CrI: 0.64-1.10). Time trends indicated a small increase in the overall bacteriologically-confirmed urban-to-rural prevalence ratio between 2000 and 2019, with a mean PR increase of 2.2% (95% CrI: -2.5 to 8.0%) per year. We estimated that, for 2023 in the 26 represented study countries (combined population: 2.2 billion urban, 2.4 billion rural), 47% (95% CrI: 34-62%; 6.5 million, 95% CrI: 3.6-11.8 million) of prevalent TB was in urban areas, and 53% (95% CrI: 38-66%; 7.3 million, 95% CrI: 4.2-12.8 million) in rural areas. Within countries, there were striking changes in the urban and rural distribution between 2000 and 2023, with the share of urban cases increasing in nearly all countries. Conclusion Between 2000 and 2023, TB epidemics have become increasingly urbanised, both in proportional and absolute terms, although with considerable variation across countries and regions. Public health approaches tailored to urban and rural TB epidemiology and demography will be required to end TB.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758665350402

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

Despite its clinical relevance, the structural basis of Cdr1 function has remained elusive. Here, we present four high-resolution cryo-EM structures of Candida glabrata Cdr1 under active turnover with ATP-Mg, itraconazole, and vanadate. Itraconazole is seen to curve deeply into the drug-binding pocket. A deep exploration of the variability within these particle datasets uncovered 80 transient conformations, including two nucleotide-bound states- one closed and one open- that capture, for the first time, the conformational transitions triggered by ATP hydrolysis in both nucleotide-binding and transmembrane domains. At the catalytic site, motion initiates in the C-helix adjacent to the ABC signature motif, retracting 4 A from the gamma-phosphate/vanadate position. This movement, transmitted to nearby TMH-1, opens the drug-binding site via its lateral displacement. A second set of conformations reveals coordinated rearrangements of transmembrane helices that drive substrate extrusion. These findings provide a direct structural and dynamic framework for understanding Cdr1-mediated azole resistance, and, more broadly, illuminate the conserved chemo-mechanical cycle of nucleotide-binding domains across the ABC superfamily, including non-membranous members.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

Myotonia results from mis-regulated splicing of chloride channel 1 (ClC-1), leading to loss of channel function and runs of involuntary action potentials in muscle fibers. Heralding the onset of weakness, myotonia is often the first symptom of DM1, and raising the possibility that muscle hyperexcitability promotes the subsequent development of myopathy. We used genome editing to test this possibility by deleting the alternatively spliced and frameshift inducing ClC-1 exon 7a (E7a) in the Mbnl1 knockout model of DM1. Although several ClC-1 exons exhibit mis-regulated splicing in DM1, deletion of this single cryptic exon was sufficient to restore ClC-1 function and eliminate myotonia systemically and permanently. As determined by long-read sequencing, deletion of E7a reduced the frequency of other splicing defects in ClC-1 transcripts, likely as a passive consequence of restoring reading frame and nonsense surveillance. Furthermore, we observed significantly improved muscle force generation, fiber-type distribution, and histology, and partial restoration of the muscle transcriptome, including differential gene expression and alternative splicing, in non-myotonic Mbnl1 knockout mice. These results suggest that E7a inclusion is a lynchpin splice event that contributes to skeletal myopathy, highlighting myotonia as a therapeutic target and an outcome of interest in DM1.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006zn3t30"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1F31AR082284;R01AR079424;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T90DE021985;T32GM135134;""},{""name"":""Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""The Marigold Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018g3kw79"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""German Research Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""470092532;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

Single cell RNA sequencing, CITE seq, V(D)J clonotyping, and metabolomic/lipidomic profiling revealed a coordinated reprogramming of the CD8+ compartment in ARIA+ patients. CD8+ TEM and TEMRA subsets were numerically expanded, transcriptionally enriched for cytotoxic and migratory programs, and exhibited increased clonal expansion. Transcription factor inference and metabolomics converged on a glycolytic bias, supporting short lived effector activity. Ligand receptor modeling identified ARIA associated signaling from CD14 and CD16 monocytes that augmented antigen presentation, adhesion, and chemokine axes directed toward effector CD8s. Finaly, integration with an external cerebrovascular atlas confirmed that ARIA associated TEM/TEMRAs are transcriptionally addressed for vascular engagement. Together, these findings establish a peripheral immune vascular axis linking immunometabolic reprogramming, clonal cytotoxic CD8+ expansion, and altered monocyte signaling to ARIA, with implications for biomarker development and risk mitigation during anti-amyloid therapy.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758665350402

Yet, conventional fluorescence imaging can suffer from phototoxicity, limited labeling efficiency, or perturbation of biological function. Label-free techniques such as interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT) offer a powerful alternative by detecting nanoscale structures based on their light scattering, without the need for dyes or genetic tags. iSCAT has enabled high-sensitivity detection of single proteins and viruses on clean surfaces. More recently, its application to live cells has been extended by using confocal illumination and detection, allowing suppression of out-of-focus light, yielding subcellular structures with high contrast. This development laid the foundation for biologically relevant label-free imaging. Here, we introduce interferometric image scanning microscopy (iISM). This next-generation technique combines interferometric detection with image scanning microscopy to achieve about 120 nm lateral resolution while operating at tenfold lower incident illumination power per diffraction limited spot, significantly reducing photodamage while enhancing signal-to-noise and contrast. Using iISM, we are able to visualize intracellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, actin cytoskeleton, mitochondria, and vesicles in live cells at essentially unlimited observation times. Importantly, iISM can be readily combined with confocal fluorescence microscopy, enabling correlation of label-free dynamics and structural information with molecular specificity. Our approach opens new avenues for studying dynamic biological processes, such as host-pathogen interactions, intracellular trafficking, or cytoskeletal rearrangements, under label-free, near-native conditions. iISM thus offers a powerful new tool for high-resolution, low-impact imaging of live cells, paving the way for new biological insights.","[{""name"":""NIH-National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35-GM118067;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

Normal aging is associated with a reduction in the functional capacity of OPCs and induces distinct transcriptional signatures even in the absence of an autoimmune inflammatory demyelination insult. To determine how aging impacts the OPC response to an acute inflammatory insult comparable to a demyelinating event in multiple sclerosis (MS), we performed adoptive transfer of young myelin-reactive Th17 T cells into young and aged mice. Spinal cord OPC responses were quantified using lineage tracing and myelin sheath thickness was quantified using transmission electron microscopy. In the subacute phase 9-10 days after adoptive transfer, the density of both young and aged OPCs is enriched in spinal cord lesions compared to non-lesion white matter. After adoptive transfer, the density of aged OPCs is significantly higher than naive/non-adoptive transfer aged spinal cord. Differentiated oligodendrocytes (OLs) are relatively preserved within lesions of aged and young animals despite an overall reduction in OL density after adoptive transfer. While lineage tracing identified newly formed oligodendrocytes after adoptive transfer in both young and aged lesions, less oligodendrocyte differentiation was observed in aged animals. Despite the reduction of OPC differentiation in aged animals, there was no significant difference in the extent of remyelination observed for young and aged lesions. Aged OPCs rise to the challenge in response to a strong auto-immune attack, suggesting that compensatory strategies allow both young and aged OPCs to survive and remyelinate in the inflammatory environment. Identifying pathways that promote resilience of young and aged OPCs in the face of an inflammatory challenge will facilitate the development of remyelinating therapies for the treatment of people with MS across the full spectrum of human aging.","[{""name"":""American Academy of Neurology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00mv9dj85"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Career Development Award;""},{""name"":""The Ohio State University College of Medicine"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

However, identifying protein-coding genes in newly assembled genomes remains complex, time-consuming, and labour-intensive. As a result, many eukaryotic genome sequences in public databases lack comprehensive gene annotations, limiting their use in ortholog identification and restricting their value for evolutionary and functional genomics. Here, we present fDOG-Assembly, a novel tool for targeted, feature architecture-aware ortholog searches directly in unannotated genome assemblies. Our benchmarks show that fDOG-Assembly performs similarly to BUSCO in genome mode in the identification of orthologs, while offering the added advantage of not being limited to universal or single-copy genes. When applied to identify orthologs for 5,000 human genes in Nematostella vectensis and Rattus norvegicus, fDOG-Assembly approaches the performance of traditional ortholog search tools that rely on pre-annotated proteomes. Importantly, it can also uncover orthologs that escape detection by conventional methods due to incomplete gene annotations, helping to fill gaps in phylogenetic profiles. As a case study, we screened 176 soil invertebrate genome assemblies for genes involved in antibacterial compound production. Notably, we found that orthologs of genes involved in beta-lactam biosynthesis are widespread in springtails. With one exception, individual springtail species contain the full gene repertoire for cephamycin synthesis, suggesting they are significant natural producers of beta-lactams. In summary, fDOG-Assembly is a powerful resource that enables orthology-based analysis of the growing number of unannotated genome assemblies.","[{""name"":""LOEWE Centre for Translational Biodiversity Genomics"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0396gab88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors1-5, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

Although ""correlation does not imply cau-sation"" has become a cliche, leveraging correlations effectively--and understanding their inferential pitfalls--remains a nuanced challenge. Correlation-based analyses are typically not able to yield causal conclusions, yet they are fre-quently used to underpin causal narratives in neuroscience research and especially in clinical contexts, which represent a problematic case of overinterpretation.

Using causal inference reasoning, simulations and analytic methods, we address three critical questions when performing resting-state fMRI:

O_LIHow reliable are correlation estimates for capturing cross-regional synchrony?
C_LIO_LIWhat are the consequences of inaccuracies in estimated correlations?
C_LIO_LITo what extent do estimated correlations reflect causal neural interactions?
C_LI

We identify two principal pitfalls. First, correlation estimates are systematically distorted by diverse noise sources, including variability in neurovascular coupling, which can generate spurious, suppressed, or even reversed effects. Second, graph-based approaches lack causal interpretability, meaning that even large samples and strong statistical evidence may obscure fundamental ambiguities in what the correlations represent. In light of these challenges, we advocate for three priorities: (1) cautious interpretation that avoids causal overreach, (2) multimodal validation to cross-check findings against independent measures, and (3) enhanced methodological rigor, particularly in biomarker discovery and clinical trials, to ensure that resting-state fMRI provides meaningful insights.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ZICMH002888;ZIAMH002783;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

While culture systems for chicken PGCs have been well established for nearly two decades, efforts to propagate PGCs from other avian species have proved exceptionally challenging, limiting the broader application of artificial reproductive technologies in birds. Here we report the first successful derivation and long-term culture of PGCs from the rock dove, or common pigeon (Columba livia). Guided by transcriptomic profiling of PGCs, we developed a species-specific medium that supports PGC maintenance and expansion. We identify insulin signaling as essential for survival and demonstrate that retinoic acid receptor inhibition, while maintaining vitamin A, is necessary for propagation. Supplementation with BMP4, LIF, GDNF, and pleiotrophin further enhances PGC proliferation. Cultured cells express canonical germline markers and migrate to the gonads following injection into both rock dove and chicken embryos, confirming functional competency. These findings establish a platform for germline manipulation and biobanking in Columbidae, broadening the applicability of reproductive technologies to conservation efforts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

However, it remains unclear how the nutrients released during cell lysis affect the growth dynamics of the remaining bacterial population. Addressing this gap, we built a controlled system consisting of two Escherichia coli lysogenic strains: one carrying a wild-type{lambda} prophage and the other a temperature-inducible variant that can be induced to lyse at 38 {degrees}C. Using this system, we selectively induced phage lysis in a defined fraction of the population and quantified both total biomass and the biomass of surviving, non-lysed cells. We observed that the biomass loss was consistently smaller than expected based on the fraction of lysed cells, supporting the idea that some of the released biomass is rapidly recycled by the non-lysed population. To formalize the observed dynamics and obtain quantitative insight, we developed a mathematical model showing that nutrients released during lysis can transiently enhance the growth rate of the surviving, non-lysed cells. This effect emerges on a short timescale of minutes, consistent with the rapid onset of biomass compensation observed experimentally. The growth rate increase was confirmed in single-cell experiments using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, where we cultured wild-type lysogens in lysate-containing culture supernatants. In summary, the results suggest that nutrients released through lysis are rapidly consumed, leading to an acceleration in the growth rate of non-lysed cells. The consequent partial compensation for cell loss can substantially influence the population dynamics, highlighting phage lysis as a direct modulator of bacterial growth. Overall, our findings provide quantitative insights into how phage-mediated lysis affects the physiology of non-lysed bacterial cells, extending beyond its well-established role in biomass recycling.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""180575;225148;188642;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

Yet it remains a major bottleneck, as the current gold standard relies on manual counting by multiple blinded observers. This process is slow, labor intensive, and prone to variability. While some software can measure total neurite length, they aren't made to specifically measure new growth in complicated images from real-life injury models, like the thoracic crush and pyramidotomy model. Existing software can measure total neurite length in culture, but it is not designed to capture new growth in complex images from injury models, such as thoracic crush or pyramidotomy. Crucially, these tools lack the ability to selectively analyze growth within user-defined regions, a key requirement for injury paradigms. To address this need, we developed the Deep Neurite Analysis Tool (DeNAT), an accessible deep-learning based platform that automatically measures neurite outgrowth after injury. DeNAT allows users to define regions of interest to specifically quantify sprouting in images from common spinal cord injury paradigms. We benchmarked its performance against manual scoring and conventional automated approaches. DeNAT achieved 87 percent accuracy in detecting neurite sprouts relative to manual counts, while reducing variability and labor. By combining user-guided region selection with automated deep learning analysis, DeNAT offers an accurate, reproducible, and efficient solution for measuring neurite outgrowth in injury models.","[{""name"":""Council of Scientific and Industrial Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021wm7p51"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Department of Biotechnology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03tjsyq23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Science and Engineering Research Board"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03ffdsr55"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

While maternal uterine NK cells have been studied in pre-eclampsia, and fetal Hofbauer cells in early gestation, much less is known about fetal-derived adaptive immune cells in the placenta and their contributions to healthy gestation versus complications of pregnancy including preterm birth. In this study, we enriched immune cells from 32 term and preterm placentas (chorionic villi, decidua basalis, and cord blood) and conducted single cell transcriptomics to evaluate the state and putative function of innate and adaptive immunity accompanying fetal trophoblast cells. Gestational age was a major driver of pro-labor pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1B and TNF that in some cases were elevated too early by preterm complications. Similarly, term placentas exhibited notable expansion of TCR clones, which were gestational age-dependent except in pathologies like chorioamnionitis and vasa previa. We used genome-wide SNP calling to deconvolute the origin of fetal cells and maternal cells, finding that both mother and fetus contribute substantially to all major immune cell lineages within the placental villi. Comparing these cells to one another, we report novel candidate markers specific to fetal-derived T cells and strong expression of IL1RL1 by fetal mesenchymal cells from preterm birth cases. This work adds to our knowledge of fetal immune development and seeks to identify what immunological steps go awry in preterm birth, paving the way towards risk evaluation in pregnant mothers and ultimately preventive care.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

Unexpectedly, cells are extremely sensitive to RPB1 dosage, with a mere 30% reduction sufficient to perturb cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and global transcription. Importantly, alterations in RPB1 abundance trigger hierarchical gene expression changes that are highly organized rather than stochastic. Using a combination of sequencing and proteomic approaches, we uncover the existence of multiple feedback loops between transcriptional initiation, promotor-proximal pause release, transcript elongation, splicing, and mRNA half-life, which together establish RNAPII abundance as a crucial systems-level regulator of transcriptional homeostasis.","[{""name"":""Danish National Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00znyv691"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DNRF166;""},{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04txyc737"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF19OC0055875;""},{""name"":""The Francis Crick Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04tnbqb63"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FC001166;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

This method supplies evidence for at least three classes of intra-Golgi vesicles with different cargo compositions.

To this end, large-scale CRISPR screens have been conducted to perturb thousands of candidate enhancers. Using these data, predictive models have been developed that aim to generalize such findings to predict which enhancers regulate which genes across the genome. However, existing CRISPR methods and large-scale datasets have limitations in power, scale, or selection bias, with the potential to skew our understanding of the properties of distal regulatory elements and confound our ability to evaluate predictive models. Here, we develop a new framework for highly powered, unbiased CRISPR screens, including an optimized experimental method (Direct-Capture Targeted Perturb-seq (DC-TAP-seq)), a random design strategy, and a comprehensive analytical pipeline that accounts for statistical power. We applied this framework to survey 1,425 randomly selected candidate regulatory elements across two human cell lines. Our results reveal fundamental properties of distal regulatory elements in the human genome. Most element-gene regulatory interactions are estimated to have small effect sizes (<10%), which previous experiments were not powered to detect. Most cis-regulatory interactions occur over short genomic distances (<100 kb). A large fraction of the discovered regulatory elements bind CTCF but do not show chromatin marks typical of classical enhancers. Housekeeping genes have similar frequencies of distal regulatory elements compared to other genes, but with 2-fold weaker effect sizes. Comparisons to the predictions of the ENCODE-rE2G model suggest that, while performance is similar across two cell types, new models will be needed to detect elements with weaker effect sizes, regulatory effects of CTCF sites, and enhancers for housekeeping genes. Overall, this study describes the first unbiased, perturbation-based survey of thousands of distal regulatory element-gene connections, and provides a framework for expanding such efforts to build more complete maps of distal regulation in the human genome.","[{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Genomic Mechanisms of Disease"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF21SA0072102;""},{""name"":""NHGRI Impact of Genomic Variation on Consortium"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UM1HG011972;""},{""name"":""NHLBI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HL159176;""},{""name"":""NHGRI Genomic Innovator Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35HG011324;""},{""name"":""NSF Graduate Research Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DGE-1656518;""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG011664;""},{""name"":""AHA Postdoctoral Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""821920 and 23POSTCHF1019753;""},{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DMS-2113072 and NSF DMS-2310654.;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

The worldwide pest Drosophila suzukii, which oviposits in ripe rather than overripe fruits, provides a powerful model to study these mechanisms and their behavioral consequences. Here, we show that this shift is linked to functional remodeling in four olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs): ab2B, ab3A, ab4B, and ab10A. While ab3A and ab10A exhibit tuning changes shared with the non-pest relative D. biarmipes, ab2B and ab4B display species-specific adaptations in D. suzukii. These changes result not only from receptor sequence divergence but also from novel innovations: receptor co-expression in ab3A and partitioned expression of Or67a paralogs in ab2B and ab10A. Together, these findings show how genomic plasticity in chemosensory gene families enables rapid sensory adaptation and niche transition.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04mhx6838"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K01DC020145;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits.

Recent advances in conventional single-particle techniques have enabled the determination of an in-creasing number of structures smaller than 100 kDa, achieving resolutions relevant to drug research. Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions. We envision that this method will further lower the molecular weight limit of single-particle cryo-EM, enabling its application to important drug-binding complexes that are below 50 kDa.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

Human participants learned sequences of environments in immersive virtual reality. They then learned novel environment transitions connecting previously separate sequences. During subsequent fMRI, participants predicted multiple steps into the future in both the newly connected sequence and control sequences that remained separate. The hippocampus integrated representations of the connected sequence, such that activity patterns became more similar across trials for the connected sequence vs. the unconnected sequences. These integrated sequence representations in the hippocampus emerged soon after learning, incorporated representations of the initial sequences as well as new activity patterns not previously present in either sequence, and predicted participants ability to update their predictions in behavior.

Genetic deletion of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in mice resulted in weakened uterine contractions and severe parturition defects. Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either the uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects, whereas combined loss significantly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing showed that loss of PIEZO reduced expression of connexin43 (Gja1), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction. These findings highlight the critical role of PIEZO channels in mechanotransduction during parturition and suggest therapeutic targets for labor dysfunction.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 NS105067;R01AT012051;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-2405-20;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CMMI-2135428;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2DK128800;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

However, this knowledge is fragmented across resources and often is not directly accessible for analytical methods. We developed OmniPath (https://omnipathdb.org/), a database combining diverse molecular knowledge from 168 resources. It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

We show experimentally that ARMADA protects bacteria against a broad range of phages via a direct, non-abortive mechanism.

Primary sensory cortices receive topographically segregated information from first-order thalamic nuclei, which process distinct sensory modalities. In contrast, higher-order cortical regions integrate information from multiple information channels. While such hierarchical processing and integration of information is the foundation for neural computations in the mammalian cortex, the fundamental principles of thalamocortical computations in non-mammalian vertebrates remains unexplored. The zebrafish pallium, located in the dorsal telencephalon, is regarded as the homolog of the mammalian cortex. However, it remains unclear how the zebrafish pallium receives and processes sensory information, and how the architecture and function of these processes compare to the thalamocortical circuits in other vertebrates. Using anatomical tracing, electrophysiological circuit mapping, and in vivo Ca2+ imaging, we revealed a thalamocortical-like pathway in the zebrafish brain. We found that the preglomerular nucleus (PG) is the primary source of visual and mechano-vibrational information to the zebrafish pallium. We demonstrated that PG neurons and their pallial projections exhibit sensory-specific and topographically organized responses. In contrast, the sensory responses of pallial neurons display multiple layers of topographically organized hierarchies, ranging from simple sensory-specific responses to multimodal and coincidence-detecting nonlinear responses. Notably, we observed a progressive increase in the complexity of sensory computations, which is organized topographically along the posterior-anterior axis of the zebrafish pallium.

Although limited zoonotic cases have resulted from the current epizootic outbreak, the wide diversity of influenza viruses in avian hosts means the emergence of new strains that could transmit to humans more readily cannot be ruled out. There is therefore a need to anticipate zoonotic potential before spillover occurs.

Here, we develop a novel zoonotic prediction model for avian influenza viruses, building upon ""host-predictor"" machine learning methods that estimate host potential given only a viral genome sequence. We construct a machine learning framework combining individual sub-models of influenza genome segments, each trained on many genomic and proteomic traits (e.g., k-mer composition, codon biases, protein physicochemistry).

To prevent over-fitting to heavily sampled lineages and ensure models generalise to phylogenetically distant viruses, we pre-process training data by considering clusters of shared sequence identity. Curated training sets cover [~]4,000 representative, complete genome sequences of avian influenza from 120 subtypes including 9 containing known zoonotic viruses.

We combine best-performing models into a single ensemble that can distinguish zoonotic capability of sequences held out from training with strong performance (AUROC = 0.95, F1 score = 0.90), including sequences of rarely-sampled subtypes, e.g., H10N8. Interrogating ensemble model decisions also allows us to identify influential genomic motifs most associated with human infection.

These findings suggest specific genomic traits that are key to understanding and monitoring evolution of influenza viruses that circulate within bird populations. Our ensemble model can estimate zoonotic potential for new sequence inputs, offering a means to quickly risk-assess emerging avian influenza strains as soon as a sequence becomes available.","[{""name"":""Seqirus (United Kingdom)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022 â 2027 Framework Research Collaboration Agreement Influenza Research Partnership collaboration plan 002;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

We modified an automated patch-clamp system with a multispectral light source and a custom light path to enable high-throughput electrophysiological measurements of opsin functional properties. Using this approach, we screened over 1,750 opsins from a range of families. We discovered that the F240A mutation of the light-gated potassium channel WiChR abolished potassium selectivity, turning it into a sensitive excitatory channel that we dubbed ""WAChR"". We systematically mutated WAChR and identified variants that expand the frontier of speed-sensitivity tradeoffs. Multiple WAChR variants produced large inward currents in response to indoor ambient office light, and responded to irradiances as low as 15 nW/mm2, something that we did not observe with other ultra-sensitive opsins. In vivo recording from the mouse cortex confirmed that WAChRs exhibit enhanced sensitivity in neurons. These ambient-light sensitive channels should be broadly useful for neuroscience research and vision restoration therapies.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

While mechanobiology has primarily focused on factors such as cell-generated contractility and mechanical properties of extracellular matrix (ECM), a novel mechanobiological paradigm highlights the role of osmotic and mechanical pressures in shaping epithelial tissues. In our study, we developed an in vitro model of cell coated micro-sized hydrogel spheres (MHSs) which allows to decipher the interplay between cellular activities and tissue mechanics. Drastic, isotropic MHS compressions were observed once the epithelia reached confluence. Further studies revealed that the compression was a process independent of cell contractility but rather regulated by active transepithelial fluid flow. Compressive stresses of about 7 kPa are generated by such an active hydraulic mechanism. Tissue homeostasis is then maintained by a fine balance between cell proliferation and extrusion. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of fluid transport in generating mechanical forces within epithelial tissues. Supported by a theoretical mechano-hydraulic model, a mechanistic framework for understanding the intricate interplay between cellular processes and tissue mechanics was established. These results challenge traditional views of epithelial tissue mechanics, emphasizing the pivotal influence of osmotic and mechanical pressures in shaping tissues. We anticipate that this study will advance the understanding of epithelial tissue development, the maintenance of homeostasis, and the mechanisms underlying pathological conditions.

Significance StatementEpithelial tissues are vital for many bodily functions, but their mechanics remain poorly understood. Our study uncovers a novel mechanism by which epithelial cells generate mechanical stress, not through traditional cell contractility, but by actively pumping ions and water across their membranes. Using a model of micro-sized hydrogel spheres (MHSs) coated with epithelial cells, we demonstrate that epithelial cells actively transport fluid across the tissue to compress the MHSs. This facilitates the establishment of tissue homeostasis, which is further maintained by a balanced cell proliferation and extrusion rate. Supported by a theoretical model, our findings highlight the overlooked role of fluid transport in tissue mechanics, offering new insights into how epithelial tissues develop, maintain stability, and respond to disease.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Adv-101019835;""},{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0071;DFG-ANR-22-CE92-0048;ANR-10-INBS-04;""},{""name"":""Institut National Du Cancer"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03m8vkq32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INCa_16712;INCa_18429;""},{""name"":""Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012kf4317"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Alexander von Humboldt Professorship;""},{""name"":""La Ligue Contre le Cancer"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rkrv905"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Equipe labellisee 2029;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

However, manipulation using short-wavelength light to activate ChRs causes cell toxicity and is hampered by low tissue penetration. To overcome these difficulties, although several red-shifted ChR variants have been identified, further red-shift is required for more efficient and noninvasive neural control. While molecular screening of ChRs requires high-cost experiments, recent machine-learning-based protein functionality prediction enables more efficient selection of target proteins for characterization. Here, we constructed an elastic-net machine-learning model trained on 1,163 experimental data to predict the maximum absorption wavelength ({lambda}max) of uncharacterized ChRs.

However, the mechanisms underlying rearrangements of L1 retrotransposition intermediates are poorly understood. To address this gap, we developed GFP-based recombination reporter assays to study the formation of L1 retrotransposition-mediated rearrangements. Using these reporters combined with long-read sequencing approaches, we find that L1 retrotransposition intermediates can recombine with distal DNA breaks to generate chromosomal rearrangements. We also find that two distinct L1 insertion intermediates can recombine with each other to generate chromosomal rearrangements. Both types of rearrangements depend on L1-encoded ORF2p endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities. Using these reporters, we discover that L1 retrotransposition-mediated rearrangements are robustly induced when the recombining sequences share homology and that their formation requires the homologous recombination factor BRCA1. Given the repetitive nature of our genome, these findings highlight the risk of L1 insertion intermediates becoming substrates for aberrant recombination and promoting genome instability.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01CA240816;R01CA276112;R01CA289390;""},{""name"":""American Cancer Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02e463172"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""C.-T.L. is supported by an American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellowship Award;""},{""name"":""Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04yhme281"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""C.M.-D. is a fellow of The Jane Coffin Childs Fund for Medical Research;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3NS132127;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of ChR024 in detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs at resolutions of 3.22 and 2.45 [A], respectively. The structures reveal an architecture strikingly similar to that of ion-pumping rhodopsins, even more so than other pump-like channelrhodopsins such as ChRmine. Structural, theoretical, and spectroscopic analyses uncover a unique color-tuning mechanism, in which charged residues close and distant from the retinal chromophore cooperatively modulate the pKa of the Schiff base counterion and thereby determine the absorption maximum wavelength. Finally, comparative structural analysis of channel- and pump-type rhodopsins, combined with electrophysiology, provides insights into the molecular boundary between these two functional classes and demonstrates the conversion of an outward proton pump into a light-gated channel.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mating-type switching is a central feature of the life cycle that enables homothallism, i.e., mating between mitotic descendants of the same haploid cell. Yet heterothallic isolates that have lost this ability are found across diverse niches, indicating that this trait is polymorphic. Here we experimentally characterized loss of mating-type switching in a representative panel of strains. Analysis of 117 telomere- to-telomere genome assemblies revealed multiple independent loss-of-function mutations in the Ho endonuclease gene and structural variants in the silent HML and HMR cassettes, the three loci essential for switching. We estimated that at least 13 independent transitions from homothallism to heterothallism have occurred in the species history. Analysis of the HO genotype of 2,915 strains show that at least 27% are heterothallic. We found that heterothallism is strongly associated with polyploidy and elevated genome-wide heterozygosity, although the strength of these associations varies between populations. Heterothallic isolates are most prevalent in domesticated and clinical clades, consistent with an origin linked to human-associated environments. However, they are also found, though less frequently, in natural niches. Signatures of recombination in HO sequences suggest that outcrossing contributed to the ecological and geographical distribution of the trait. Our findings reveal that mating-type switching has undergone repeated losses in S. cerevisiae evolution, with major consequences for genome architecture and ecological diversification.

Significance StatementMating-type switching evolved multiple times in yeasts, enabling haploid selfing, which became a key feature of their life cycles. We show that this trait has been lost repeatedly in the history of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, producing heterothallic isolates that cannot switch mating type. Analysis of thousands of genomes reveals that these losses involve multiple mutations in the Ho endonuclease and structural changes in the silent mating-type cassettes. Heterothallism is associated with polyploidy and increased genome-wide heterozygosity. It is more frequent in domesticated and clinical lineages, but also occurs in natural ecological niches. Our findings illustrate how repeated changes in a single life-history trait can reshape genome architecture and highlight the dynamic interplay between genetics, environment, and evolution in a model eukaryote.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE12-0020;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758665350402

In most organisms, cilia form dense arrays of thousands of filaments that coordinate their motion into persistent, temporally synchronized patterns known as metachronal waves. Despite their ubiquity, the dynamics of these patterns and their role in tuning propulsion remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate how metachronal coordination shapes the navigation of Didinium nasutum, a highly agile unicellular predator with two circumferential ciliary bands. Using high-speed imaging of freely swimming cells, we capture and quantify the dynamics of metachronal wave coordination and track their evolution across different swimming states and transitions. Combining these measurements with a hydrodynamic model, we uncover how dynamic changes in coordination directly regulate propulsion and maneuverability. We show that stable metachronal waves support persistent directed swimming, local inhomogeneities in coordination give rise to curved trajectories, and global wave reversals accommodate rapid evasion-like reorientations. Our findings reveal that transitions between coordination modes allow Didinium to access a diverse swimming repertoire, highlighting dynamic ciliary patterning as a key mechanism to encode complex microscale navigation strategies. More broadly, they provide mechanistic insights into how metachronal coordination shapes fluid flows generated by dense ciliary arrays found in unicellular protists and airway epithelia alike, ultimately influencing swimming and transport in biological systems.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Project Grant 315230_215678;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UPenn MRSEC DMR- 2309043;""},{""name"":""Charles E.

This study identified more than 421 million single-nucleotide variants and indels and more than 600 million copy-number and structural variants. Small variants had 756 million molecular effects annotated. Of 7.7 million polymorphic variants having an allele frequency (AF) of more than 5% in EGP, 1,348 have a predicted deleterious effect on a protein. Characterization with respect to global variation shows that EGP represents a genetic continuum encompassing the range of African, Asian, and European populations. It is best described by two Arabian, an Eurasian, and an African component, with the predominant Arabian component linked to mitochondrial haplogroups J and T that are commonly attributed to the Middle East. Various aneuploidies of sex chromosomes were detected in 93 individuals overall, and aneuploidy of chromosome 21 was identified in 41 individuals. Median inbreeding coefficient and cumulative runs of homozygosity (ROHs) lengths were increased due to extensive consanguinity, were largest in the groups with Arabian main ancestry components, and were higher than reported for Qatar. Families were identified based on genetic relatedness and classified into 264 families with unrelated parents and 247 families with third- and fourth-degree consanguineous parents. Representative consanguineous pedigrees of families in EGP were outlined. Cumulative ROHs were affected by the main ancestry component and significantly increased in offspring of consanguineous parents, with a pronounced difference between 3rd and 4th-degree relatedness. Investigation of cumulative AFs of variants causing Mendelian diseases highlighted genes related to alpha- and beta-thalassemia (HBB, HBA2) and showed a high burden of variants causing severe recessive diseases, metabolic and retinal disorders, and hearing loss. In summary, EGP represents a landmark effort in characterizing the genetic diversity of the Emirati population, leveraging the largest Middle Eastern cohort reported to date.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758665350402
