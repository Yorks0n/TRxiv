Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

However, recent and heavily disputed debates on data quality have raised questions on the accuracy of demographic data at older ages. Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

Previously published in 2019, 57 HCM-associated genes were curated providing the first systematic evaluation of gene-disease validity. Here we report work by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel (HCVD-GCEP) to reappraise the clinical validity of previously curated and new putative HCM genes.

MethodsThe ClinGen systematic gene curation framework was used to re-classify the gene-disease relationships for HCM and related syndromic entities involving left ventricular hypertrophy. Genes previously curated were included if their classification was not definitive, and if the time since curation was >2-3 years. New genes with literature assertions for HCM were included for initial evaluation. Existing genes were curated for new inheritance patterns where evidence existed. Curations were presented on twice monthly calls, with the HCVD-GCEP composed of 29 individuals from 21 institutions across 6 countries.

ResultsThirty-one genes were re-curated and an additional 5 new potential HCM-associated genes were curated. Among the re-curated genes, 17 (55%) genes changed classification: 1 limited and 4 disputed (from no known disease relationship), 9 disputed (from limited), and 3 definitive (from moderate). Among these, 3 (10%) genes had a clinically relevant upgrade, including TNNC1, a 9th sarcomere gene with definitive HCM association. With new evidence, two genes were curated for multiple inheritance patterns (TRIM63, disputed for autosomal dominant but moderate for autosomal recessive; ALPK3, strong for autosomal dominant and definitive for recessive). CSRP3 was curated for a semi-dominant mode of inheritance (definitive). Nine (29%) genes were downgraded to disputed, further discouraging clinical reporting of variants in these genes. Five genes recently reported to cause HCM were curated: RPS6KB1 and RBM20 (limited), KLHL24 and MT-TI (moderate), and FHOD3 (definitive).

ConclusionsWe report 29 genes with definitive, strong or moderate evidence of causation for HCM or isolated LVH, including sarcomere, sarcomere-associated and syndromic conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

Yet, technical limitations associated with short reads challenge their use for detection of disease-associated variation in complex regions of the genome. Long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies may overcome these challenges, potentially qualifying as a first-tier test for all rare diseases. To test this hypothesis, we performed LRS (30x HiFi genomes) for 100 samples with 145 known clinically relevant germline variants that are challenging to detect using short-read sequencing and necessitate a broad range of complementary test modalities in diagnostic laboratories. We show that relevant variant callers readily re-identify the majority of variants (120/145, 83%), including ~90% of structural variants, SNVs/InDels in homologous sequences and expansions of short tandem repeats. Another 10% (n=14) was visually apparent in the data but not automatically detected. Our analyses also identified systematic challenges for the remaining 7% (n=11) of variants such as the detection of AG-rich repeat expansions. Titration analysis showed that 89% of all automatically called variants could also be identified using 15-fold coverage. Thus, long-read genomes identified 93% of pathogenic variants that are most challenging to detect using short-read technologies. Even with reduced coverage, the vast majority of variants remained detectable, possibly enhancing cost-effective diagnostic implementation. Most importantly, we show the potential to use a single technology to accurately identify all types of clinically relevant variants.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

Herein, our goal was to map specific mucin glycoforms in diseased tissue, enabling correlation of the tumor glycan profile with malignant features. To this end, we developed a workflow implementing on-tissue digestion with mucinase StcE, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). To optimize our workflow, we analyzed four different mucinous carcinomas derived from colon, esophageal, and salivary gland tissue. Using this technique, we deduced the spatial distribution of StcE-generated O-glycopeptides within mucinous tumors using MALDI-IMS. Subsequent LC-MS analyses revealed the identity of different species detected in imaging experiments, in addition to comprehensively characterizing the mucinome and proteome of each tissue. Our coupled MS approach unveiled a striking mucin 2 (MUC2) expression pattern in two colorectal mucinous adenocarcinomas, in which different glycoforms clearly stratified regions within the tumor. Notably, our LC-MS experiments obtained near-complete sequence coverage over the mucin domains of MUC2, enabling glycoproteomic mapping of this canonical mucin in unprecedented depth. MUC2 glycosylation was dominated by the T and Tn antigens, with surprisingly little sialylation detected. However, O-glycans containing mono- and di-O-acetylated sialic acid were detected in low abundance. Finally, we obtained spectral evidence for an endogenous O-acetylated GalNAc, an O-glycan structure not previously reported in the literature. Overall, this proof-of-concept work underscores the potential of this technique to generate new research avenues in oncology and beyond.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar.

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis. In the first six months of follow-up in the two-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.27-0.46); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.19-1.94). In the first six months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9% (95% CI: 94.0-97.1) and 34.1% (95% CI: -46.4-76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

ConclusionA strong healthy vaccinee effect was observed in the first six months following vaccination. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

However, the majority of antibody therapeutics are not genetically human, with initial therapeutic designs typically obtained from animal models. Humanisation of these precursors is essential to reduce immunogenic risks when administered to humans. Here, we present Humatch, a computational tool designed to offer experimental-like joint humanisation of heavy and light chains in seconds. Humatch consists of three lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained to identify human heavy V-genes, light V-genes, and well-paired antibody sequences with near-perfect accuracy. We show that these CNNs, alongside germline similarity, can be used for fast humanisation that aligns well with known experimental data. Throughout the humanisation process, a sequence is guided towards a specific target gene and away from others via multiclass CNN outputs and gene-specific germline data. This guidance ensures final humanised designs do not sit `between' genes, a trait that is not naturally observed. Humatch's optimisation towards specific genes and good VH/VL pairing increases the chances that final designs will be stable and express well and reduces the chances of immunogenic epitopes forming between the two chains. Humatch's training data and source code are provided open-source.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

This outbreak is still ongoing and expanding to other regions and countries. Here, we describe the epidemiological and genomic evolution of the outbreak from September 2023 to June 2024. Methods Consenting patients with mpox-like symptoms admitted to the Kamituga and the Kamanyola hospitals were recruited to the study. Samples from throat, lesions, breast milk and placenta were collected for PCR testing and sequencing. For the patients from Kamituga hospital, data on place of residence and possible exposures were collected by interviews. The location and numbers of employees were collected for all bars with sex workers. Where possible, exposures were linked to the genomic sequencing data for cluster analysis. Findings In total, 670 (suspected) mpox cases were admitted to the Kamituga hospital. There were slightly more female than male cases (351/670 [52,4%] versus 319/670, [47,6%], and cases were reported from 17 different health areas. The majority of cases were reported in Mero (205/670 [30,6%]), followed by Kimbangu (115/670 [17,2%]), Kabukungu (105/670 [16,7%]), and Asuku (73/670 [10.9%]). During this period, 7 deaths occurred and 8 out of 14 women who were pregnant had fetal loss. Three healthcare workers acquired mpox infection when caring for patients. In depth case ascertainment showed that 83,4% of patients reported recent visits to bars for (professional) sexual interactions as a likely source of infection. Whole genome sequencing resulted in the generation of 58 genome sequences. Three main clusters characterized by specific mutations were identified and several miniclusters of 2 or more sequences with over two shared mutations. No clear link between sequence cluster, bar or health area was observed. The more recent sequences from Kamanyola were related to the sequences in Kamituga and confirmed to be Clade Ib. However, relatively long branches were observed and one of the sequences clustered with publicly released sequences from travelers in Kenya, Uganda, Sweden and Thailand, indicating more undocumented ongoing spread for cluster A than for the other clusters. Most observed mutations were APOBEC-3 related mutations indicative of ongoing human-to-human transmission. Interpretation These data suggests that the rapid transmission of monkeypox virus until June 2024 was mostly related to interactions with professional sex workers (PSW) within densely populated health areas. The expanding number of cases and the recent expansion to 29 other nearby health zones of South -Kivu as well as Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and Kenya stresses the need for cross border surveillance and collaboration. Urgent enhanced response action is needed, including case finding, diagnostic capacity building, health education programmes focussing on sex workers, and possibly vaccination to limit further escalation and stop this outbreak.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

In particular, RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 proteins are promising single-effector systems to regulate target mRNAs without altering genomic DNA, yet the current Cas13 systems are still restrained by suboptimal efficiencies. Here, we show that U1-driven CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) can dramatically increase the efficiency of various applications, including RNA knockdown and editing, without modifying the Cas13 protein effectors. We confirm that U1-driven crRNAs are exported into the cytoplasm, while conventional U6 promoter-driven crRNAs are mostly confined in the nucleus. Furthermore, we reveal that the end positions of crRNAs expressed by the U1 promoter are consistent regardless of different guide sequences and lengths. We also demonstrate that U1-driven crRNAs, but not U6-driven crRNAs, can efficiently repress the translation of target genes in combination with catalytically inactive Cas13 proteins. Finally, we show that U1-driven crRNAs can counteract the inhibitory effect of miRNAs. Our simple and effective engineering enables unprecedented cytosolic RNA-targeting applications.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

MVA-BN was globally well tolerated despite higher reactogenicity for the intradermal than the subcutaneous route, especially for the reactions at the local injection site. The intradermal dose-sparing strategy was proven safe and immunogenic and would make vaccination available to more people.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

We report that in 2023-2024, MPXV clade Ib genomes are diverging at a faster rate than clade IIb (2022), primarily due to an unusually high incidence of recombination. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Ib strains have diverged into four lineages, and they have evolved into 14 subgroups based on nine tandem repeat (TR) polymorphisms. These findings confirms that TRs in MPXV Ib are mutating at a significantly higher frequency compared to the 2022 outbreak (clade IIb, 11 subgroups). Linkage disequilibrium analysis also identified 10 recombination clusters among all 4 lineages, with recombination incidence in Ib being twice as high as in IIb. This suggests that a higher rate of superinfection is contributing to ongoing recombination among populations infected with clade Ib. Prompt action is necessary to prevent the emergence of more lethal mpox strains.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

Logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the prevalence and incidence of chronic diseases. In both the KNHANES and NHANES cohorts, an increased HSI was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of chronic metabolic diseases. Longitudinal data from the KoGES cohort showed that MASLD and MetALD were significant predictors of chronic metabolic disease in both men and women. MetALD showed a higher hazard ratio for the development of chronic metabolic diseases than MASLD in Cox regression analysis. This study highlighted the intertwined nature of SLD and metabolic health, with an emphasis on the role of MetALD.

This study examined the effectiveness of these policies to contribute to the ongoing discussions on proactive and pre-emptive interventions for similar future outbreaks.  A mix of qualitative and quantitative methods were used for the analysis. Data were drawn from multiple sources, including peer-reviewed and grey literature, and academic experts from Ghanaian universities. The data from the literature informed a questionnaire that was sent to independent academic experts to explore their opinions on whether the policies met their intended objectives. The experts opinions were collected on a 5-point Likert scale and from an open-ended question using an online data collection platform, Qualtrics. The data were evaluated using narrative synthesis, descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. We identified and evaluated eight key COVID-19 policy responses in Ghana: (1) partial lockdown of epicentres; (2) COVID-19 public awareness campaigns; (3) ban on public gatherings; (4) COVID-19 vaccination; (5) border closures; (6) entry border COVID-19 screening; (7) incentives for healthcare workers (HCWs); and (8) the Ghana Alleviation and Revitalisation of Enterprises Support (GCARES). Two policies - the COVID-19 awareness campaigns and border closure - effectively improved public awareness of COVID-19 and helped to reduce COVID-19 case importation (median score [&ge;]4).

Longitudinal studies exploring the link between DNA methylation clocks and cognitive decline have been constrained by limited sample sizes and a lack of diversity. Objective: Our study aimed to investigate the longitudinal associations between DNA methylation clocks and incident cognitive impairment using a larger sample size encompassing a US nationally representative sample from the Health and Retirement Study. Methods: We measured DNA methylation age acceleration in 2016 by comparing the residuals of DNA methylation clocks, including GrimAge, against chronological age. Cognitive decline was determined by the change in Langa-Weir cognition status from 2016 to 2018. Using multivariable logistic regression, we evaluated the link between DNA methylation age acceleration and cognitive decline, adjusting for cell-type proportions, demographic, and health factors. We also conducted an inverse probability weighting analysis to address potential selection bias from varying loss-to-follow-up rates. Results: The analytic sample (N=2,713) at baseline had an average of 68 years old, and during the two years of follow-up, 12% experienced cognitive decline. Participants who experienced cognitive decline during follow-up had higher baseline GrimAge (mean = 1.2 years) acceleration compared to those who maintained normal cognitive function (mean = -0.8 years, p < 0.001). A one-year increase in GrimAge acceleration was associated with 1.05 times higher adjusted and survey-weighted odds of cognitive decline during follow-up (95% CI: 1.01-1.10). This association was consistent after accounting for loss-to-follow-up (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.04-1.11).

We identified more than a thousand independent introduction events, resulting in clusters of varying sizes, with earlier clusters presenting larger sizes and posing greater control challenges. Characterization of the sources of these introductions showed that domestic origins were more significant than international ones. Further examination of locally circulating clusters across different subregions of Greater Houston revealed varied transmission dynamics. Notably, subregions that served as primary viral sources sustained the local epidemic effectively, evidenced by: (1) a smaller proportion of new cases driven by external viral importations, and (2) longer persistence times of circulating lineages. Overall, our high-resolution spatiotemporal reconstruction of the epidemic in Greater Houston enhances understanding of the heterogeneous transmission landscape, providing key insights into regional response strategies and public health planning.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

Our findings reveal that, under normal conditions, hippocampal neurons exhibit varying degrees of stability in their spatial memory coding. However, microstrokes disrupted this functional network architecture, leading to cognitive impairments. Notably, the preservation of stable coding place cells, along with the stability, precision, and persistence of the hippocampal network, was strongly predictive of cognitive outcomes. Mice with more synchronously active place cells near important locations demonstrated recovery from cognitive impairment.

Despite these far-ranging effects, their impacts are generally underappreciated by both the public and policymakers, resulting in insufficient management and inadequate conservation outcomes. Recognizing the gap in effective quantitative measurement tools, we introduce the Extinction Potential Metric (EPM) and its derivative, EPM for Unique species (EPM-U; adjusted for phylogenetic uniqueness) to quantify the ecological damage caused by invasive alien species (IAS). These metrics estimate the number of current and projected extinct species within a 50-year horizon under a business-as-usual scenario due to specific IAS. We applied EPM and EPM-U to assess threats to native terrestrial vertebrates from IAS, examining impacts on 2178 amphibians, 920 birds, 865 reptiles, and 473 mammals. The analysis identified that damage mostly stems from a limited number of IAS, notably two pathogenic fungi affecting amphibians (up to 380 equivalent extinct species) and primarily cats (139 equivalent extinct species) and rats (50 equivalent extinct species) impacting other groups, through mechanisms such as predation, disease, and reduced reproductive success in birds. The proposed metrics not only provide a standardised measure of ecological impacts but are sufficiently versatile to be tailored for specific spatial and temporal scales or taxonomic groups. Furthermore, EPM could serve as a model for developing unified indicators to monitor global biodiversity targets, such as those defined in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), by assessing the ecological effects of various individual and combined anthropogenic stresses. Also, EPM and EPM-U could support the enforcement of Target 6 of the GBF, by establishing lists of IAS requiring urgent prevention and control. Thus, EPM and EPM-U offer critical tools for improving the management of biological invasions and enhancing global conservation strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

Methods were evaluated based on in vivo validation data from hundreds of cortical cell type-specific enhancers that were previously packaged into individual AAV vectors and retro-orbitally injected into mice. We find that open chromatin was a key predictor of functional enhancers, and sequence models improved prediction of non-functional enhancers that can be deprioritized as opposed to pursued for in vivo testing. Sequence models also identified cell type-specific transcription factor codes that can guide designs of in silico enhancers. This community challenge establishes a benchmark for enhancer prioritization algorithms and reveals computational approaches and molecular information that are crucial for the identification of functional enhancers for mammalian cortical cell types.

The arcuate nucleus (ARC), located in the mediobasal hypothalamus, contains neuronal populations with eminent roles in energy and glucose homeostasis as well as reproduction. These neuronal populations are of great interest for translational research. To fulfill this promise, we used a robotic cell culture platform to provide a scalable and chemically defined approach for differentiating human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), somatostatin (SST), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuronal subpopulations with an ARC-like signature. This robust approach is reproducible across several distinct hPSC lines and exhibits a stepwise induction of key ventral diencephalon and ARC markers in transcriptomic profiling experiments. This is further corroborated by direct comparison to human fetal hypothalamus, and the enriched expression of genes implicated in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiling by ATAC-seq identified accessible regulatory regions that can be utilized to predict candidate enhancers related to metabolic disorders and hypothalamic development. In depth molecular, cellular, and functional experiments unveiled the responsiveness of the hPSC-derived hypothalamic neurons to hormonal stimuli, such as insulin, neuropeptides including kisspeptin, and incretin mimetic drugs such as Exendin-4, highlighting their potential utility as physiologically relevant cellular models for disease studies. In addition, differential glucose and insulin treatments uncovered adaptability within the generated ARC neurons in the dynamic regulation of POMC and insulin receptors. In summary, the establishment of this model represents a novel, chemically defined, and scalable platform for manufacturing large numbers of hypothalamic arcuate neurons and serves as a valuable resource for modeling metabolic and reproductive disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

Birdsong is a signal used in agonistic interactions between territorial rivals, and birds may modify their song and singing behaviour in response to noise. However, if these modifications are still ineffective, this can lead to increased conflict between rivals. Here, we asked whether experimental traffic noise induces immediate changes in acoustic characteristics of song and aggressive behaviour in populations and territories that differ greatly in traffic noise exposure. We conducted simulated territorial intrusions on Galapagos yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia aureola) living on Santa Cruz (high traffic) and Floreana (low traffic) islands. Territories were either adjacent to the nearest road or at least 100 m away from it. We assessed the focal birds' physical response levels and recorded their vocalisations in response to playback of conspecific song (control) and conspecific song coupled with traffic noise (noise treatment). We found that physical response levels mostly depended on treatment and distance to the nearest road: on both islands, birds living adjacent to the nearest road increased their aggression levels with experimental noise compared to control, while birds living farther away decreased their aggression levels. Birds on all islands irrespective of their distance to a road increased minimum frequency of their songs during the noise treatment. However, change in peak frequency and duration of their songs depended on the habitat they live in. Our results suggest behavioural flexibility in territorial responses and birdsong in response to traffic noise, which appears to depend at least in part on prior experience with traffic noise.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

Recent advancements in single-cell sequencing techniques have uncovered that cell transition dynamics during development are confined on low-dimensional manifolds. However, existing methods are inadequate for directly quantifying the manifolds from experimental data. Here we present SCIM (single cell information manifolds), a novel geometry- guided method to quantify the CPT manifolds using information geometry. In particular, we convert single cells' high-dimensional gene vectors into probability distributions via Gaussian embedding. The Fisher metric is naturally defined in this embedding space. With the transformed Gaussian distributions, we calculate the coarse Ricci curvature of each single cell. Our analyses reveal that the cells with low curvature are associated with critical transitions. To further examine the invariant characteristics of the manifolds of CPT, we compute the information velocity of each single cell based on RNA velocity. Remarkably, the regions with high information velocity correspond with the low curvature regions, indicating that the geometry can guide the dynamics of single cells on the manifolds. The proposed method not only unveils the invariant characteristics of the CPT manifolds, but also establishes a generic approach for quantifying the intricate dynamics on the CPT manifolds.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

By contrast, the HLA-bound complex adopts the open and extended conformation, and conformation-locking disulfide mutants show that ectodomain opening is necessary for maximal ligand-dependent T-cell activation. Together, these results reveal allosteric conformational change during TCR activation and highlight the importance of native-like lipid environments for membrane protein structure determination.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

Recordings in monkey dlPFC have revealed possible neural correlates of the underlying cognitive processes like attention, planning, or decision-making, both at the single-neuron and population levels. Integrating these observations into a coherent picture of dlPFC function is challenging, as these studies typically focused on neural activity in relation to a few, specific events within a single, fully learned behavioral task. Here we obtain a more comprehensive description of dlPFC activity from a large dataset of population recordings in monkeys across a variety of behavioral contexts. We characterized neural activity in relation to saccades that monkeys made freely, or at different stages of training in multiple tasks involving instructed saccades, perceptual discriminations, and reward-based decisions. Across all contexts, we observed reliable and strong modulations of neural activity in relation to a retrospective representation of the most recent saccadic movement. Prospective, planning-like activity was instead limited to task-related, delayed saccades that were directly eligible for a reward. The link between prospective and retrospective representations was highly structured, potentially reflecting a hard-wired feature of saccade responses in these areas. Only prospective representations were modulated by the recent behavioral history, but neither representations were modulated by learning occurring over days, despite obvious concurrent behavioral changes. Dorso-lateral PFC thus combines tightly linked flexible and rigid representations, with a dominant contribution from retrospective signals maintaining the memory of past actions.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

Here, we show the PPAR{gamma} AF-1 contains an evolutionary conserved Trp-Pro motif that undergoes cis/trans isomerization, populating two long-lived conformations that participate in intradomain AF-1 and interdomain interactions including two surfaces in the C-terminal LBD ({beta}-sheet and the AF-2 surface), which are predicted in AlphaFold 3 models but not AlphaFold 2. NMR and chemical crosslinking mass spectrometry show that interdomain interactions occur for soluble isolated AF-1 and LBD proteins, as well as in full-length PPAR{gamma} in a phase separated state. Mutation of the region containing the Trp-Pro motif, which abrogates cis/trans isomerization of this region, impacts LBD interaction and reduces basal PPAR{gamma} transcription and agonist-dependent activation of PPAR{gamma}. Our findings provide structural insight into published in vitro and cellular studies that reported interdomain functional communication between the PPAR{gamma} AF-1 and LBD suggesting some of these effects may be mediated via AF-1/LBD interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

Many GxG interactions have been identified in model organisms through experimental breeding studies, but they have been difficult to identify in human populations. To address this challenge, we applied two complementary variance QTL (vQTL)-based approaches to identify GxG interactions that contribute to human blood traits and blood-related disease risk. First, we used the previously validated genome-wide scale test for each trait in ~450,000 people in the UK Biobank and identified 4 vQTLs. Genome-wide GxG interaction testing of these vQTLs enabled discovery of novel interactions between (1) CCL24 and CCL26 for eosinophil count and plasma CCL24 and CCL26 protein levels and (2) HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 for lymphocyte count and risk of celiac disease, both of which replicated in ~140,000 NIH All of Us and ~70,000 Vanderbilt BioVU participants. Second, we used a biologically informed approach to search for vQTL in disease-relevant genes. This approach identified (1) a known interaction for hemoglobin between two pathogenic variants in HFE which cause hereditary hemochromatosis and alters risk of cirrhosis and (2) a novel interaction between the JAK2 46/1 haplotype and a variant on chromosome 14 which modifies platelet count, JAK2 V617F clonal hematopoiesis, and risk of polycythemia vera. This work identifies novel disease-relevant GxG interactions and demonstrates the utility of vQTL-based approaches in identifying GxG interactions relevant to human health at scale.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

The identification and use of efficient enzymes in the applied biocatalyst is key to establishing economically feasible production processes. The generation and selection of favorable enzyme variants in adaptive laboratory evolution experiments using growth as a selection criterion is facilitated by tightly coupling enzyme catalytic activity to microbial metabolic activity. Here, we present a computational workflow to design strains that have a severe, growth-limiting metabolic chokepoint through a shared class of enzymes. The resulting chassis cell, termed enzyme selection system (ESS), is a platform for growth-coupling any enzyme from the respective enzyme class, thus offering cross-pathway application for enzyme engineering purposes. By applying the constraint-based modeling workflow, a publicly accessible database of 25,505 potential and experimentally tractable ESS designs was built for Escherichia coli and a broad range of production pathways with biotechnological relevance. Model-based analysis of the generated design database reveals a general design principle that the target enzyme activity is linked to overall microbial metabolic activity, not just the synthesis of one biomass precursor. Furthermore, the use of currently available genome-reduced strains or one preeminent carbon source does not significantly enable or improve growth-coupling of target enzymes. Most importantly, observed trade-offs between the predicted viability of ESSs, the design-inflicted metabolic perturbations, and the coupling strength suggest that a suboptimal coupling has benefits regarding the experimental implementation of ESSs and growth-coupling in general. Overall, the computed design database, which is accessible through https://biosustain.github.io/ESS-Designs/, and its analysis lay the foundation for generating valuable in vivo ESSs for a range of biotechnological applications.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

We also investigate the potential mediating role of hormone therapy (HT) in early postmenopause (within 5 years of menopause onset or surgery) in these relationships. Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), we employ sequence and cluster analysis, followed by mediation analysis. Our findings indicate that women with early menopause, compared to those who undergo menopause at 45 or older, are less likely to have flexible working arrangements (part-time work or self-employment) compared to full-time work during this sensitive period. However, they are equally likely to exit the labour market as to work full-time, indicating distinct experiences. Surgical menopause, compared to natural menopause, is associated with an increased risk of labour market exit, particularly for women aged 45 or older at the time of surgery, potentially due to higher comorbidities and increased age-related precarity. HT use appears to mitigate the risk of labour market exit for women with both early and surgical menopause, although other factors (e.g., health) may play a more significant role in this transition out of work. We advocate for further research on the impact of early and surgical menopause on womens labour market circumstances and for workplace policies that consider the diverse experiences of women with early and surgical menopause, including their increased risk of chronic conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

We followed a hierarchical analysis approach partially based on higher criticism (HC) statistics as previously applied in a larger sister-project in fetal alcohol syndrome.

ResultsAfter exclusions for excessive head movement, 11 female young adults with early-treated PKU (age: 27.2 {+/-} 3.7 years) and 11 age-matched female healthy controls (age: 25.9 {+/-} 3.8 years) were included in the analysis. We observed effects within attention networks and the default mode network, but not in fronto-parietal networks, at the HC-based intermediate analysis level. No between-network FC differences were found. In the most detailed analysis level, we could not identify single affected functional connections. Despite statistical power limitations in this small sample, findings are in line with previously reported FC alterations in PKU and the cognitive profile in young adults with PKU, particularly with the still uncertain notion that cognitive control deficits might become less pronounced when PKU patients reach adulthood.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

Here, we discovered and characterized rare coding alleles contributing to genetic dyslipidemia, a principal risk for coronary artery disease, among over a million individuals combining three large contemporary genetic datasets (the Million Veteran Program, n = 634,535, UK Biobank, n = 431,178, and the All of Us Research Program, n = 92,304) totaling 1,158,017 multi-ancestral individuals. Unlike previous rare variant studies in lipids, this study included 238,243 individuals (20.6%) from non-European-like populations.

Testing 2,997,401 rare coding variants from diverse backgrounds, we identified 800 exome-wide significant associations across 209 genes including 176 predicted loss of function and 624 missense variants. Among these exome-wide associations, 130 associations were driven by non-European-like populations. Associated alleles are highly enriched in functional variant classes, showed significant additive and recessive associations, exhibited similar effects across populations, and resolved pathogenicity for variants enriched in African or South-Asian populations. Furthermore, we identified 5 lipid-related genes associated with coronary artery disease (RORC, CFAP65, GTF2E2, PLCB3, and ZNF117). Among them, RORC is a potentially novel therapeutic target through the down regulation of LDLC by its silencing.

Previous research has demonstrated that targeting tissue senescence with senolytics can enhance tissue regeneration and repair by selectively eliminating SnCs in specific aged tissues. In this study, we focused on eliminating SnC skin cells in aged mice to assess the effects on subsequent wound healing. We applied ABT-263 directly to the skin of 24-month-old mice over a 5-day period. Following topical ABT-263, aged skin demonstrated decreased gene expression of senescent markers p16 and p21, accompanied by reductions in SA-{beta}-gal and p21-positive cells compared to DMSO controls. However, ABT-263 also triggered a temporary inflammatory response and macrophage infiltration in the skin. Bulk RNA sequencing of ABT-263-treated skin revealed prompt upregulation of genes associated with wound healing pathways, including hemostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, collagen synthesis, and extracellular matrix organization. Aged mice skin pre-treated with topical ABT-263 exhibited accelerated wound closure. In conclusion, topical ABT-263 effectively reduced several senescence markers in aged skin, thereby priming the skin for improved subsequent wound healing. This enhancement may be attributed to ABT-263-induced senolysis which in turn stimulates the expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and wound repair pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

Here we show that Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the motor thalamus improved speech and swallowing functions in two participants with dysarthria and dysphagia. First, we proved that DBS increased excitation of the face motor cortex, augmenting motor evoked potentials, and range and speed of motion of orofacial articulators in n=10 volunteers with intact neural pathways. Then, we demonstrated that this potentiation led to immediate improvement in swallowing functions in a patient with moderate dysphagia and profound dysarthria as a consequence of a traumatic brain lesion. In this subject and in another with mild dysarthria, we showed that DBS immediately ameliorated impairments of respiratory, phonatory, resonatory, and articulatory control thus resulting in a clinically significant improvement in speech intelligibility.

Here we draw on drug checking results from around the United States to report a rapid shift in the illicit drug supply with important implications for public health. Bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl) sebacate, or ""BTMPS"" is a hindered amine light stabilizer with various industrial applications. Animal studies indicate multiple kinds of adverse health effects.

MethodsDrug samples collected by community-based drug checking programs in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, along with drug residue samples from other jurisdictions in California, Delaware, Maryland, and Washington, were submitted to the National Institute on Standards and Technology. Samples were qualitatively tested with Direct Analysis in Real Time mass spectrometry, with reflex to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) for confirmatory testing. Quantitation - percent by mass - was performed using LCMS. At both sites where drug samples were collected, participants were asked to respond to a survey that included questions about what the substance was sold as and any unexpected effects.

ResultsBetween June 1, 2024 and August 31, 2024, a total of 178 samples sold as fentanyl were tested. Of these, 43 (24%) contained BTMPS, with the proportion per month rising from 0% in June to more than a third in August. An additional 23 residue samples from sites doing residue testing contained BTMPS. Fentanyl samples with BTMPS also contained many other compounds, including local anesthetics and alpha-2 agonists. Average fentanyl purity was significantly lower in samples with BTMPS compared to samples without.

ConclusionsThe introduction of an industrial chemical to the illicit drug supply at this speed and scale is unprecedented and concerning. Further research is urgently needed to determine why it is present in the fentanyl supply and characterize effects on human health.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

We investigated whether a diverse refugee committee could utilize participatory methods to identify health priorities and a research agenda to address them.

MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study with focus groups of current and former refugees, asylum claimants and evacuees from a specialized refugee clinic over a year. We collected sociodemographic data using standardized instruments, then utilized a four-step nominal group technique process (idea generation, recording, discussion, and voting) to identify and rank participants health and research priorities. Participants ranked their top five priorities across three time periods: Pre-migration/early arrival (0-3 months), post-migration (3 months-2 years), and long-term health (>2 years). Participants created overarching priorities and corroborated findings via a member checking step.

FindingsTwenty-three participants (median age 35 years) attended one or more of five focus groups. Twenty-one completed sociodemographic surveys: 16/21 (76%) were women, representing 8 countries of origin. Participants identified ""more family physicians"" and ""improving health system navigation"" (11/60 votes each) as top health and research priorities respectively across all resettlement periods. Participants also prioritized pre-departure healthcare system orientation and improved post-arrival and long-term mental health services. Twelve participants completed the member checking process, affirming the results with minor clarifications.

InterpretationThis proof-of-concept study illustrates how refugees can use a rigorous consensus process without external influence to prioritize their healthcare needs, direct a health research agenda to address those needs, and co-produce research. These low-cost participatory methods should be replicated elsewhere.

Pathogen exposure led to an array of architectural changes including faster nest growth, increased spacing between entrances, transmission-inhibitory changes in overall nest network topology, and reduced chamber centrality. Simulations confirmed that these changes reduced disease spread.

While extensive research has examined the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on various surfaces, there is limited understanding of how efficiently it transfers to human skin, and how long it survives on the skin. This study investigates two key aspects of SARS-CoV-2 transmission: (1) the transfer efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 from non-porous (plastic and metal) and porous (cardboard) surfaces to a 3D human skin model (LabSkin), and (2) the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on the skin under different temperature conditions. First, we validated LabSkin as a suitable surrogate for human skin by comparing the transfer efficiency of the bacteriophage Phi 6 from surfaces to LabSkin and to human volunteers fingers. No significant differences were observed, confirming LabSkin's suitability for these studies. Subsequently, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces to LabSkin was assessed, showing that plastic and metal surfaces had similar transfer efficiencies (~13%), while no transfer occurred from cardboard once the inoculum had dried on the surface. Finally, the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on skin was assessed, showing a rapid decay at higher temperatures, with a half-life ranging from 2.8 to 17.8 hours depending on the temperature.

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

In an open-label study the hyaluronidase bovhyaluronidase azoximer (BA) was associated with improved pulmonary function and exercise tolerance in patients with pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial we evaluated the effect of BA on patients up to 12 months after COVID-19, characterized by reduced pulmonary function, dyspnea, and decreased oxygen saturation. Methods: Patients (n=392) were randomized 1:1 to receive BA (3000U) or placebo every 5 days for 71 days. Percent of predicted forced vital capacity (ppFVC), respiratory symptoms, and exercise tolerance indicators were assessed at baseline and on days 71 and 180. The primary endpoint was a change from baseline in ppFVC by Day 71. Results: On Day 71, BA was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of patients with exertional desaturation (OR=0.35, p=0.0051) and dyspnea (OR=0.62, p=0.043). There were no significant intergroup differences in the ppFVC growth rate. Analysis of sub-populations revealed that by Day 180, BA was associated with increased ppFVC in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities (diff=3.31%, p=0.042) and those with earlier SARS-CoV-2 infection (diff=4.17%, p=0.021). BA was generally safe and well-tolerated. Conclusion: In patients with long-term pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19, BA was associated with increased exercise tolerance. There was evidence of shorter pulmonary function recovery time following BA in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities and those with earlier COVID-19 disease.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been playing an important role by noninvasively assessing structural and functional muscular changes. This exploratory study investigated the potential of dynamic MRI during neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to detect differences between healthy controls (HCs) and patients with metabolic and myotonic myopathies. The study included 14 HCs and 10 patients with confirmed muscular diseases. All individuals were scanned with 3T MRI with a protocol that included a multi-echo gradient echo sequence for fat fraction quantification, multi-echo spin-echo for water T2 relaxation time calculation, and 3D phase contrast sequences during NMES. The strain tensor, buildup and release rates were calculated from velocity datasets. Results showed that strain and strain buildup rate were reduced in the soleus muscle of patients compared to HCs, suggesting these parameters could serve as biomarkers of muscle dysfunction. Notably, there were no significant differences in fat fraction or water T2 measurements between patients and HCs, indicating that the observed changes reflect alterations in muscle contractile properties that are not reflected by structural changes. The findings provide preliminary evidence that dynamic muscle MRI during NMES can detect abnormalities in muscle contraction in patients with myotonia and metabolic myopathies, warranting further research with larger, more homogeneous patient cohorts.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

As COVID-19 remains a threat, it is imperative to improve current forecasting approaches by incorporating reliable data and alternative forecasting targets to better inform decision-makers.

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a viable method to track COVID-19 transmission, offering a more reliable metric than reported cases for forecasting critical outcomes like hospitalizations. Recognizing the natural alignment of wastewater systems with city structures, ideal for leveraging WBE data, this study introduces a multi-city, wastewater-based forecasting model to categorically predict COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Using hospitalization and COVID-19 wastewater data for six US cities, accompanied by other epidemiological variables, we develop a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to generate two categorization types. The Hospitalization Capacity Risk Categorization (HCR) predicts the burden on the healthcare system based on the number of available hospital beds in a city. The Hospitalization Rate Trend (HRT) Categorization predicts the trajectory of this burden based on the growth rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Using these categorical thresholds, we create probabilistic forecasts to retrospectively predict the risk and trend category of six cities over a 20-month period for 1, 2, and 3 week forecasting windows.

We also propose a new methodology to measure forecasting model performance at change points, or time periods where sudden changes in outbreak dynamics occurred. We also explore the influence of wastewater as a predictor for hospitalizations, showing its inclusion positively impacts the models performance. With this categorical forecasting study, we are able to predict hospital capacity risk and disease trends in a novel and useful way, giving city decision-makers a new tool to predict COVID-19 hospitalizations.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

We previously developed a pooled CRISPR screening method for Drosophila melanogaster and mosquito cell lines using plasmid transfection and site-specific integration to introduce single guide (sgRNA) libraries, followed by PCR and sequencing of integrated sgRNAs. While effective, the method relies on early constitutive Cas9 activity that potentially can lead to discrepancies between genome edits and sgRNAs detected by PCR, reducing screen accuracy. To address this issue, we introduce a new method to co-transfect a plasmid expressing the anti CRISPR protein AcrIIa4 to suppress Cas9 activity during early sgRNA expression, which we term IntAC (integrase with anti-CRISPR). IntAC allowed us to construct a new CRISPR screening appraoch driven by the high strength dU6:3 promoter. This new library dramatically improved precision-recall of fitness genes across the genome, retrieving 90-95% of essential gene groups within 5% error, allowing us to generate the most comprehensive list of cell fitness genes yet assembled for Drosophila. Our analysis determined that elevated sgRNA levels, made permissible by the IntAC approach, drove much of the improvement. The Drosophila fitness genes show strong correlation with human fitness genes and underscore the effects of paralogs on gene essentiality. We further demonstrate that IntAC combined with a targeted sgRNA sub library enabled precise positive selection of a transporter under solute overload. IntAC represents a straightforward enhancement to existing Drosophila CRISPR screening methods, dramatically increasing accuracy, and might also be broadly applicable to virus-free CRISPR screens in other cell types, including mosquito, lepidopteran, tick, and mammalian cells.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

Limited research exists on the impact of School Distress on the parents/carers supporting these CYP. Using a case-control, concurrent embedded mixed-method design, we explored this lived experience. 947 parents of CYP with School Distress completed a bespoke online questionnaire, alongside two control parent groups (n=149, n=25) and one professional group (n=19).

Findings revealed a devastating impact on the mental health of parents, with parents displaying significantly heightened daily anxiety and significantly lower mood during, but not before, their childrens school attendance difficulties. In addition, parents with children experiencing School Distress reported significantly more negative emotion states and significantly fewer positive emotion states. Parents also reported overwhelmingly negative treatment from professionals, including being disbelieved or blamed for their childrens difficulties, threatened with fines and court action, and disempowered by the actions of professionals surrounding their child. Significant, deleterious impacts were also evident across all aspects of their lives, including their careers, finances, and other children. Perhaps unsurprisingly, half of these parents reported developing a new mental health condition since their childs difficulties began, with the experience itself rated as the second most threatening potential life event, superseded only by the death of a first-degree relative (including a child or spouse). On the other hand, professionals working with CYP with School Distress did not experience these deleterious mental health or wider life consequences. Despite understanding how threatening the experience is for parents, they were often quick to blame parents for their childrens difficulties. Professionals, like parents, expressed frustration with the lack of help available for these CYP and their families.

This study highlights a bleak, adversarial, and lonely picture for parents of CYP struggling to attend school. More specifically, the findings depict a system rife with parental blame; a system that appears to isolate parents through hostile, threatening, and punitive actions. A wider lack of societal understanding of the experience of School Distress further compounds this dearth of support for parents, placing parental mental health in further peril.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

Our previous work discovered a blood-based DNA methylation prognostic signature (PLAT-M8) that uses 8 CpG sites related to chemoresistance. We aim to validate this biomarker and its correlation with clinicopathological features and treatment profiles in additional cohorts. Methods: Extracted DNA from whole blood was provided from the BriTROC-1 (n=47) and OV04 cohorts (n=57) upon the first relapse. Additional samples from Hammersmith Hospital (n=100) were collected during first-line chemotherapy (cycles 3-4 and 6). Bisulphite pyrosequencing was used to quantify DNA methylation at the previously identified 8 CpG sites. The methylation data obtained were combined with previous data from ScoTROC-1D and 1V (n=141) and OCTIPS (n=46). Cox regression was used to assess overall survival (OS) after relapse concerning clinicopathological characteristics. The DNA methylation Class (Class 1 vs 2) was determined by consensus clustering. Findings: Blood DNA methylation at relapse predicts better clinical outcomes. Methylation Class shows no association with outcome during first-line chemotherapy treatment. Methylation Class 1 is associated with shorter survival, as indicated by a meta-analysis of five cohorts (OS: HR 2.54, 1.67-3.85). Class 2 patients on carboplatin monotherapy have the best prognosis, while Class 1 patients on the same treatment have the poorest prognosis (OS: aHR 9.69, 2.38-39.47). Class 1 is linked to older patients (>75 years) with advanced-stage, platinum-resistant cases, correlating with residual disease, and shorter progression-free survival. In contrast, Class 2 of PLAT-M8 is linked to platinum-sensitive patients, and higher complete response rates by RECIST criteria, but shows no correlation with CA-125. These findings emphasise the potential of PLAT-M8 in guiding second-line chemotherapy decisions. Interpretation: PLAT-M8 methylation biomarker is associated with survival in OC patients with relapse and hypothetically may predict platinum treatment response at second-line chemotherapy.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

The frequency and pace of these major genome structural changes are unknown, and it remains unclear whether or how they impact long-term genome evolution. Here, we compare whole chromosomal sequences of 3,631 genomes from 2,291 species spanning all major animal clades and show that animal karyotypes evolve primarily via karyotype contraction, associated with increased rates of chromosomal fusion-with-mixing and dispersion that largely obey chromosomal algebra1, or karyotype expansion, which breaks up ancestral linkage groups and forms new chromosomal elements via non-algebraic changes. We show that chromosomal changes can be associated with major extinction events. Using a multi-scale encoding of pan-animal genome homology and a manifold representation of genomic changes, we find that genome evolution is not only driven by changes at the chromosomal level, but that subchromosomal mixing and irreversibility define clade-specific evolution. Using this  evolutionary genome topology approach, we calculate extrema of irreversible genomic configurations and identify species that occupy intermediate manifold positions, providing evidence for distinct macro-evolutionary trajectories. We propose that investigation of mixed state accumulation around important gene loci (such as Hox) will be crucial in capturing and further study of clade-specific regulatory innovations.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

The unique insights from a genome-level perspective have revealed a striking pattern of conserved macrosynteny within chromosomes across huge evolutionary distances in animals, yet progress in many lineages has been hampered by the absence of genome-level data. Here, we show that the tectonics of genome evolution in clitellates, a clade composed of most freshwater and all terrestrial species of the phylum Annelida, is characterised by extensive genome-wide scrambling that resulted in a massive loss of macrosynteny between marine annelids and clitellates, to the point that ancient bilaterian linkage groups (ie, groups of genes inherited as a block in most bilaterian phyla) are fully disrupted. These massive rearrangements included the formation of putative neocentromeres with newly-acquired transposable elements, and preceded a further period of genome-wide reshaping events including whole-genome duplications and massive macrosyntenic reshuffling between clitellate lineages, potentially triggered by the loss of genes involved in genome stability or homeostasis of cell division. Notably, while these rearrangements broke short-range interactions observed between genes in marine annelids (including Hox), they were reformed as long-range interactions in clitellates. These genomic rearrangements gave rise to new genetic elements that may have facilitated the adaptation to freshwater and terrestrial environments in clitellates. Our findings provide evidence of a massive genomic reshaping through genome-wide chromosome scrambling in clitellates consistent with the punctuated equilibrium model, which sharply contrasts with the highly conserved chromosomal architecture observed in most animal taxa. Our study thus suggests that the genomic landscape of this animal lineage resulted from a rare burst of genomic changes that ended a long period of stability that persists across large evolutionary distances.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

In line with the age-related neural dedifferentiation hypothesis, we predicted that middle-aged adults show less distinct cortical representations of phonemes and acoustic-phonetic features relative to younger adults. In addition to an extensive audiological, auditory electrophysiological, and speech perceptual test battery, we measured electroencephalographic responses time-locked to phoneme instances (phoneme-related potential; PRP) in naturalistic, continuous speech and trained neural network classifiers to predict phonemes from these responses. Consistent with age-related neural dedifferentiation, phoneme predictions were less accurate, more uncertain, and involved a broader network for middle-aged adults compared with younger adults. Representational similarity analysis revealed that the featural relationship between phonemes was less robust in middle-age. Electrophysiological and behavioral measures revealed signatures of cochlear neural degeneration (CND) and speech perceptual deficits in middle-aged adults relative to younger adults. Consistent with prior work in animal models, signatures of CND were associated with greater cortical dedifferentiation, explaining nearly a third of the variance in PRP prediction accuracy together with measures of acoustic neural processing. Notably, even after controlling for CND signatures and acoustic processing abilities, age-group differences in PRP prediction accuracy remained. Overall, our results reveal ""fuzzier"" phonemic representations, suggesting that age-related cortical neural dedifferentiation can occur even in middle-age and may underlie speech perceptual challenges, despite a normal audiogram.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

MethodsThis study included all rheumatology RCTs published from 2009 to 2023. The gender of authors was determined using forenames and countries of affiliation via the gender API service. The percentage of women in RCT publications and its association with potential factors was assessed using generalized estimating equations, considering women gender as the main binary outcome and the RCTs continent, international collaboration status, industrial funding, intervention type, sample size, journal adherence to ICMJE recommendations, impact factor, publication year, authors non-academic affiliation, and author position as covariates.

ResultsAmong the 1,092 RCTs authored by 10,794 persons, women accounted for 34.1% of authors. Woman authorship was more frequent in African-based RCTs compared to North America, when the author had a non-academic affiliation and when the last author was a woman (1.83 [1.46, 2.29], +6.1 percentage points - pp). Woman authorship was less frequent in Asian and European-based RCTs, industry-funded RCTs (OR 0.64 [0.56-0.73]; -10.3pp). Women were less often in the last (0.63 [0.54-0.74]; -10.2 pp) and second to last author position (0.73 [0.62-0.85]; -7.3pp). There were no difference looking at international status or year of publication.

ConclusionThe overall presence of women authors was 34.1%. The stagnant year-over-year representation of women in RCTs, and the lower likelihood of a woman having a position as senior author, underscores the need for more effective strategies to bridge the gender gap. RCTs with a woman last author were more likely to have a woman first author, suggesting a potential role-model effect.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

ME diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME patients low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428

To date, the cnidarian Turritopsis dohrnii is the only known species capable of undergoing reverse development after the onset of sexual reproduction. Here, we demonstrate that the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi is capable of reversal from mature lobate to early cydippid when fed following a period of stress. Our findings illuminate central aspects of ctenophore development, ecology, and evolution, and show the high potential of M. leidyi as a new model system to study reverse development and rejuvenation. Besides shedding light on the plasticity of developmental programs, our results raise fundamental questions about early animal development, body plans and life cycles.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

The fossil, known on the basis of two specimens, has been historically assigned to seamoths (Pegasidae), then to oarfish and relatives (Lampriformes). We describe its enigmatic skeletal anatomy in detail, and provide a new genus name. ""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1727042844428

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1727042844428
