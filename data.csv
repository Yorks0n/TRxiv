However, the complexity of the structural features that determine PPIs makes their design challenging. We present BindCraft, an open-source and automated pipeline for de novo protein binder design with experimental success rates of 10-100%. BindCraft leverages the weights of AlphaFold21 to generate binders with nanomolar affinity without the need for high-throughput screening or experimental optimization, even in the absence of known binding sites. We successfully designed binders against a diverse set of challenging targets, including cell-surface receptors, common allergens, de novo designed proteins, and multi-domain nucleases, such as CRISPR-Cas9. We showcase the functional and therapeutic potential of designed binders by reducing IgE binding to birch allergen in patient-derived samples, modulating Cas9 gene editing activity, and reducing the cytotoxicity of a foodborne bacterial enterotoxin. Lastly, we utilize cell surface receptor-specific binders to redirect AAV capsids for targeted gene delivery. This work represents a significant advancement towards a ""one design-one binder"" approach in computational design, with immense potential in therapeutics, diagnostics, and biotechnology.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

This primary genetic cue is often located on a single locus, referred to as sex chromosomes, and can be limited to females (in a ZZ/ZW system) or males (in an XX/XY system). One trademark of sex chromosomes is a restriction or cessation of recombination surrounding the sex-limited region (to prevent its inheritance in the homogametic sex). This may lead to, through a variety of mechanisms, higher amounts of genetic divergence within this region, i.e. between the X/Z and Y/W chromosomes, especially when compared to their autosomal counterparts. Recent advances in genome sequencing and computation have brought with them the ability to resolve haplotypes within a diploid individual, permitting assembly of previously challenging genomic regions like sex chromosomes. Leveraging these advances, we identified replicable diagnostic characteristics between typical autosomes and sex chromosomes (within a single genome assembly). Under this framework, we can use this information to identify putative sex chromosome linkage groups across divergent vertebrate taxa and simultaneously curate misassembled regions on autosomes. Here, we present this conceptual framework and associated tool for identifying candidate sex chromosome linkage groups from a single, diploid individual dubbed Sex Chromosome Identification by Negating Kmer Densities, or SCINKD.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures.

We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","medrxiv",1752271830799

However, the impact of disrupting anti-ferroptotic pathways in the broader tumor microenvironment (TME), such as in immune cells, is still undefined and may complicate treatments. Here, we show that Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1 (FSP1/Aifm2) is critically required for regulatory T cell (Treg) resistance to ferroptosis and their immunosuppressive function within the TME. Compared to other canonical ferroptosis regulators such as GPX4, GCH1, and NRF2, only FSP1 was induced upon T cell activation. Deletion of Aifm2 in all T cells, or Tregs specifically, enhanced tumor control by selectively disrupting Treg immunosuppression within tumors without inciting autoimmune pathology in mice. As opposed to deletion of Gpx4 in all T cells, T cell deletion of Aifm2 did not impair antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. These results reveal a unique opportunity for targeting a regulator of ferroptosis that can not only directly target cancer cells, but also simultaneously enhance anti-cancer immune responses without inciting autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

As a solution, we introduce Metalorian, a conditional diffusion model that generates de novo heavy metal-binding peptides, guided by MetaLATTE, a multi-label classifier fine-tuned to include underrepresented metal classes. Leveraging both continuous protein embeddings and discrete metal-binding constraints, Metalorian produces peptides with controllable lengths and user-defined binding specificity while preserving essential physicochemical properties. Crucially, our data augmentation strategy enables robust classification and generation even with sparse training data for certain metals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through peptides designed for copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), and zinc (Zn), which retain key features such as net charge and hydrophobicity, while significantly reducing sequence length and molecular weight compared to known metal-binding proteins. Metalorian-generated peptides exhibit stable conformations and favorable binding energetics, as confirmed through molecular dynamics simulations. To validate binding in vitro, we developed a streamlined SUMO-fusion expression and cleavage system coupled with ELISA-based quantification, confirming robust Cu and Zn binding by multiple Metalorian-generated peptides. Overall, our work establishes a foundational platform for engineering heavy metal-binding peptides tailored to diverse and underrepresented targets, and highlights the potential of well-trained continuous latent spaces for diffusion-based de novo peptide design.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

However, it is not well understood whether personal light exposure patterns predicts and individuals risk of cardiovascular diseases.

ObjectiveTo assess whether day and night light exposure predicts incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and whether relationships of light with cardiovascular diseases differ according to genetic susceptibility, sex, and age.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

ParticipantsN=88,905, age (M{+/-}SD) = 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 56.9% female.

ExposureApproximately 13 million hours of personal light exposure data, tracked by wrist-worn light sensors (one week each).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, derived from UK National Health Service records, across a 9.5-year follow-up after light tracking.

ResultsPeople with the brightest nights (90-100th percentiles) had significantly higher risks of developing coronary artery disease (adjusted-HR range: 1.23-1.32), myocardial infarction (aHRs: 1.42-1.47), heart failure (aHRs: 1.45-1.56), atrial fibrillation (aHRs: 1.28-1.32), and stroke (aHRs: 1.28-1.30), compared to people with dark nights (0-50th percentiles). These relationships were robust after adjusting for established risk factors for cardiovascular health, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol, diet, sleep duration, socioeconomic status, and polygenic risk. Relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and coronary artery disease were stronger for women, and relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were stronger for younger individuals in this cohort.

Conclusions and RelevanceNight light exposure was a significant risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases in this cohort. In addition to current preventative measures, avoiding light at night may be a useful strategy for reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases.

Key Points

QuestionDoes personal light exposure predict incidence of cardiovascular diseases?

FindingsIn this study of [~]89,000 adults aged >40 years, exposure to brighter light at night predicted higher incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors.

MeaningAvoiding exposure to night light may lower risk for cardiovascular diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1752271830799

We aimed to map the production of scientific publications worldwide in terms of democracy and freedom of press ratings of countries. Democracy ratings used the Democracy Index in 2024 and in 2006 (when first released by the Economist Intelligence Unit) and Freedom of Press ratings used the 2024 index by Reports Without Borders. The Scopus database was used for publications from each country. Fractional counts were assigned for publications co-authored by authors from different countries. Full articles, reviews, conference papers, books and book chapters were included. In 2024, countries characterized as full democracies produced only 22% of the Scopus-indexed publications, versus 66% in 2006. There was no correlation between the ratio of publications indexed in 2024 versus 2006 and the absolute or relative change in Democracy Index between 2006 and 2024 (r=0.02 and r=0.00, respectively). 78% of publications in 2024 came from countries with problematic (including USA) or worse (including China) freedom of press. Proportions of publications originated from countries with problematic or worse situations were 81%, 91%, 61%, 62%, and 63% for political, economic, legislative, sociocultural, and safety/security dimensions, respectively.

How these cancer-specific methylation changes are established in the decades before cancer, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we use a unique collection of longitudinal blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia to sensitively track the dynamics of DNA methylation changes at high temporal resolution. We identify thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that exhibit altered patterns of methylation up to 10 years before acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) diagnosis. Most of these DMRs are strongly associated with expanding clones carrying somatic driver mutations. We identify a subset of  epigenetic driver DMRs characterised by recurrent CpG alterations that are highly shared across pre-AML cases. These are likely to reflect early epigenetic reprogramming associated with AML development. We also reveal large numbers of stochastic  passenger CpGs whose differential methylation results from hitch-hiking with clonal expansions driven by somatically acquired genetic events. These passenger CpGs can be exploited for lineage tracing to discover clonal expansions driven by missing driver mutations.

Average reported losses since the preceding spring exceeded 60%, with substantial variation among operations. Many colonies were still actively collapsing in January, 2025, when pooled and individual samples were collected then screened for levels of known honey bee pathogens and parasites. Deformed wing virus strains A and B, along with Acute bee paralysis virus, were found at unusually high levels, either in pooled colony samples or in individual bees exhibiting shaking behaviors and morbidity.

Differences between these two analyses suggest that direct collections of morbid bees provide a superior diagnostic for causal viruses, a suggestion borne out by confirmation of symptoms and morbidity following isolation and new inoculations. Since these viruses are known to be vectored by parasitic Varroa mites, mites from collapsed colonies were in turn screened for resistance to amitraz, a critical miticide used widely by beekeepers. Miticide resistance was found in all collected Varroa, underscoring the urgent need for new control strategies for this parasite. While viruses are a likely end-stage cause of colony death, other stressors such as nutritional stress and agrochemicals may have also played significant roles.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

The reason often invoked is the dysregulation of the immune system, which is both cause and consequence of ageing. However, we do not all age in the same way, and increased susceptibility may not be solely due to immune dysregulation affecting resistance to infection. There are many possible ways to make a host less tolerant to infection by dysregulating key physiological or metabolic processes. We hypothesised that the increase in susceptibility to infection over age can be linked to both immune ageing and decreased tolerance, and importantly, that it will depend on genotype and sex of the host. We assessed susceptibility to Gram-negative bacterial challenge in both sexes in 22 Drosophila isolines at young and old ages, and leveraged variation between genotypes to investigate how frequently an increase in susceptibility to infection was more associated with a decline in resistance or disease tolerance mechanisms. To achieve this, we assessed pathogen load to report on host immune decline. Strikingly, in most cases, greater infection susceptibility at old age was driven by reduced tolerance, although we also frequently identify cases that suffered bona fide immunosenescence, e.g. impaired resistance. We screened across bacterial pathogens during systemic and oral infections and found sex-specific signatures in survival in young and old individuals, but increased susceptibility with age occurred in both sexes. Pairing infection survival with lifespan data, we find that transcending genotype variation, susceptibility at old age predicts lifespan in males only, regardless of the existence or direction of sex bias in longevity. This work highlights that increased infection susceptibility is an early-arising ageing phenotype that occurs in both sexes, but only predicts lifespan in males, paralleling burgeoning evidence in mammals for male-biased effects of age on infection and its connection with mortality. Our data support a model where infection susceptibility increases with age following the same multiplicative pattern as organismal mortality, with existing failures making new failures more consequential. We propose that the term immunosenescence be used specifically to describe proven dysregulation of immune tissue resistance mechanisms. We argue that to fully understand the drivers of age-related susceptibility to infection, it is essential to consider genotype, sex, and their interaction, as well as the dysregulation of non-immune functions that influence the ability to control pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

Whether computational prediction tools can identify amyloid-forming potential in thrombus proteomes remains unclear. Methods: AmyloGram is a computational tool that estimates amyloid-forming potential based on n-gram sequence encoding and random forest classification. Using AmyloGram, we analyzed 204 proteins tagged by humans as amyloidogenic in UniProt. We then applied the same approach to proteins identified in thrombi retrieved using mechanical thrombectomy from patients with cardioembolic and atherothrombotic stroke. In addition we used AmyloGram to analyse the amyloidogenicity of 83,567 canonical human protein sequences. Results: Among the UniProt-annotated ""amyloid"" set, nearly all proteins received AmyloGram scores above 0.7, including 23 of the 24 human proteins. Even the lowest-scoring human protein, lysozyme (scoring 0.675), is known to form amyloid under certain conditions. In thrombi from both stroke subtypes, all detected proteins had AmyloGram scores above 0.7, suggesting a high likelihood of amyloid content. A majority of unannotated proteins also achieve AmyloGram scores exceeding 0.7. Conclusions: AmyloGram reliably identifies known amyloid-forming proteins and reveals that stroke thrombi are enriched for proteins with high amyloidogenic potential. These findings support the hypothesis that thrombus formation in stroke involves amyloid-related mechanisms and warrant further investigation using histological and functional validation.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

However, comprehensively identifying the ""secretome"", along with their tissues of origin, remains extremely challenging. To address this, we employed multiple 'omics methods to define a tissue-secretome map of 535 blood plasma proteins derived from specific cell-types and organs in Drosophila melanogaster. This map was enabled by methodological improvements including a collection of transgenic flies to label endogenous secreted proteins in 10 major tissue types, large-scale blood isolation, whole animal snRNA-seq, and a collection of 40 knock-in strains. Using this map, we discover surprising findings about circulating proteins: most originate from specific tissues including unusual sources (e.g. glia), many are uncharacterized, and some are shed ectodomains of transmembrane proteins. In addition, in vivo experiments revealed circulating proteins with remarkably tissue-specific expression, as well as proteins that are deposited in a different tissue from where they are synthesized, suggesting potential inter-organ functions. Our secretome map will serve as a resource to investigate blood protein function, discover novel tissue-tissue communication signals, and mine for homologues of human biomarkers.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

In this work, we sequenced the complete genome of the new species Embleya australiensis MST-11070 and validated the assembly using optical mapping. The genome of E. australiensis MST-11070 consists of a 7.1 Mb linear chromosome and three additional replicons, including a 4.2 Mb linear replicon, EEC1, significantly larger than all previously described secondary replicons from bacteria. EEC1 is typified by its similar composition to the chromosome in terms of GC-content, codon usage and gene functions. It also carries terminal inverted repeats identical to the chromosome. EEC1 is enriched in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), including the only copy of the BGCs for the spore pigment and the surfactant peptide SapB, metabolites essential for the organisms lifecycle. EEC1 contains an origin of replication with at least some chromosomal properties, and its replication is likely to depend on functions provided by chromosomally located genes. Further comparison of Embleya spp. genomes suggests that EEC1-like replicons are conserved across the genus, in contrast to other known large linear extrachromosomal replicons (megaplasmids) in the order. EEC1 is thus a hallmark of the Embleya genus and is central to its evolution within the Streptomycetaceae family. We propose EEC1 as a secondary chromosome, distinct from previously described secondary chromosomes that utilise plasmid-like replication mechanisms (chromids) and the largest secondary replicon reported in bacteria, to date.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

However, the regulatory logic and specific gene networks that define cell identities remain poorly resolved across the animal tree of life. As early-branching metazoans, cnidarians can offer insights into the early evolution of cell type-specific genome regulation. Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility in 60,000 cells from whole adults and gastrula-stage embryos of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We identified 112,728 CREs and quantified their activity across cell types, revealing pervasive combinatorial enhancer usage and distinct promoter architectures. To decode the underlying regulatory grammar, we trained sequence-based models predicting CRE accessibility and used these models to infer ontogenetic relationships among cell types. By integrating sequence motifs, transcription factor expression, and CRE accessibility, we systematically reconstructed the gene regulatory networks that define cnidarian cell types. Our results reveal the regulatory complexity underlying cell differentiation in a morphologically simple animal and highlight conserved principles in animal gene regulation. This work provides a foundation for comparative regulatory genomics to understand the evolutionary emergence of animal cell type diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

However, recent studies have uncovered their role in antigen surveillance and immune signalling initiation. To investigate how membrane protrusions initiate and contribute to signalling, from the first cell-cell contact to immunological synapse formation, we performed dynamic imaging experiments of endogenously tagged signalling proteins in T cells. To quantitatively capture the early dynamics of cell-cell interactions, we employed HER2-CAR-expressing T cells targeting HER2+breast cancer cells. By harnessing live-cell imaging and super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy we were able to capture topological membrane changes and their correlation with mesoscale protein rearrangements over time. Our findings indicate that, prior to activation, key molecular players in T cell activation, including the kinase Lck, the phosphatase CD45 and the adaptor LAT, as well as the exogenously expressed CAR, lack any enrichment in actin-rich protrusions. However, upon initial contact of the T cell with the target cell, a dynamic and fast rearrangement of the surface receptors, phosphatases, and kinases occurs within the protrusions, ensuring a rapid and effective initiation of the immune signalling cascade. The rapid clustering of the HER2-CAR occurs preferentially within protrusions rather than flat membrane regions and is accompanied by enhanced recruitment of the kinase ZAP-70 and LAT. While the localisation of the kinase Lck remained unchanged, protrusion-cell contacts trigger a pronounced exclusion of the phosphatase CD45, an effect observed both with and without the cytosolic signalling domain of the CAR. Overall, the signalling machinery rearranged more rapidly and efficiently at contacts mediated by protrusive structures compared to non-protrusive regions. Together, our data provide a quantitative framework illustrating how signalling proteins are dynamically reorganised to facilitate CAR-mediated activation within these specialised structures.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

Immune effector proteins that disrupt the nucleotide pool allow animal and bacterial cells to broadly restrict diverse viruses, but reduced nucleotide availability induces cellular toxicity and can limit host fitness(Ahmad et al., 1998; Goldstone et al., 2011; Hsueh et al., 2022; Itsko & Schaaper, 2014; Tal et al., 2022). Here we discover a bacterial anti-phage defense system named Clover that overcomes this tradeoff by encoding a deoxynucleoside triphosphohydrolase enzyme (CloA) that dynamically responds to both an activating phage cue and an inhibitory nucleotide immune signal produced by a partnering regulatory enzyme (CloB). Analysis of Clover phage restriction in cells and reconstitution of enzymatic function in vitro demonstrate that CloA is a dGTPase that responds to viral enzymes that increase cellular levels of dTTP. To restrain CloA activation in the absence of infection, we show that CloB synthesizes a dTTP-related inhibitory nucleotide signal p3diT (5'-triphosphothymidyl-3'5'-thymidine) that binds to CloA and suppresses activation. Cryo-EM structures of CloA in activated and suppressed states reveal how dTTP and p3diT control distinct allosteric sites and regulate effector function. Our results define how nucleotide signals coordinate both activation and inhibition of antiviral immunity and explain how cells balance defense and immune-mediated toxicity.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

To this end, we first established and characterized a PUREfrex 1.0-based TTcDR system.

Our final DNA-encoded TetR circuit allows [~]1000-fold DNA replication, [~]100-fold repression, and [~]4-fold induction with anhydrotetracycline.

Despite forays into the description and quantification of these punctuated events, the effects of such events on subsequent cancer evolution remain incompletely understood. Here we investigate how non-gradual mutagenesis affects the ability of tumor cells to acquire and retain fitness-enhancing adaptations. We find that punctuated mutagenesis significantly facilitates adaptation in scenarios where adaptation requires crossing a fitness valley, i.e. when multiple mutations are required which individually are maladaptive but jointly confer a fitness advantage. By increasing the probability that multiple mutations occur in close succession, punctuation increases the chance that mutants in a fitness valley mutate further to reach a fitness peak before going extinct. Analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we find that tumors with signatures of APOBEC mutagenesis, which has been shown to proceed in episodic bursts, exhibit patterns consistent with higher rates of crossing fitness valleys. Lastly, we characterize how the interplay between this enhanced ability to cross fitness valleys and adaptation-limiting effects of clonal interference affects overall adaptability in complex fitness landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

However, the specific metabolic adaptations driven by fructose in prostate cancer (PCa) remain unexplored.

MethodsWe investigated the metabolic consequences of chronic fructose exposure in androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (PC-3) PCa cell lines. We evaluated the expression, localization, and function of the fructose transporter Glut-5 and assessed metabolic fluxes, enzyme expression, lipid accumulation, and global metabolite profiles using molecular, imaging, and metabolomic approaches.

ResultsGlut-5 was primarily localized to early endosomes under basal and fructose-stimulated conditions, suggesting a non-canonical role potentially consistent with transceptor function. Chronic fructose exposure significantly upregulated Glut-5 expression and enhanced fructose uptake, but did not alter substantially its subcellular localization. Functionally, fructose reduced lactate production and mitochondrial ATP output, indicating a metabolic shift away from glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. In LNCaP cells, fructose induced robust activation of de novo lipogenesis (DNL), evidenced by upregulation of FASN and G6PD, increased lipid droplet accumulation, and enhanced levels of key fatty acid metabolites (e.g., TG, EPA, DHA). In contrast, PC-3 cells exhibited a distinct metabolic response, characterized by increased ceramide and amino acid metabolites. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of lipid metabolism using etomoxir abrogated proliferation in both cell lines under fructose stimulation.

ConclusionsThese findings reveal that fructose promotes a metabolic reprogramming in PCa cells that is cell type- and AR-dependent, enhancing lipogenesis and potentially contributing to tumor progression. Our study identifies Glut-5-mediated fructolysis and lipid metabolic pathways as key vulnerabilities in PCa, offering potential avenues for metabolic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

Moving beyond fear conditioning, extinction and habits formed by associative learning, we consider conserved neuromodulatory mechanisms related to harm expectation, defensive mobilisation, and context (in)sensitivity. Our account of harm-mitigating, neurobehavioural responses furnishes a mechanistic understanding of maladaptive behaviour and impaired belief-updating, which are often underspecified in conceptual analyses. Grounded in neurobiological evidence, we specify PTSD-related impairment in terms of Bayesian belief-updating, and establish an adaptive/maladaptive boundary using active inference and simulation studies. The ensuing model plausibly illustrates PTSD pathogenesis, which remains understudied relative to aetiology. We locate pathogenesis in maladaptive precision following traumatic learning, characterised by aberrant Bayesian credit assignment. Future scientific and clinical studies can test the validity of these insights, which could underwrite our understanding of the phenomenology, diagnostics and ultimately treatment intervention in post-traumatic disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

Within allopolyploids, duplicated genes across subgenomes, called homeologs, are thought to enhance environmental robustness by shifting their expression ratios depending on environmental and developmental changes. However, existing methods for detecting such ratio shifts, including HomeoRoq and Fishers exact test, are limited to allopolyploids with two subgenome sets inherited from two progenitors, and thus cannot handle more complex cases (e.g., allohexaploid wheat). Here, we present the HOmeolog Bias Identification Test (HOBIT), a statistical method for detecting shifts in homeolog expression ratios across different conditions using RNA-Seq count data. HOBIT performs a likelihood ratio test for each homeolog, comparing a full model allowing homeolog expression ratios to vary across conditions with a reduced model assuming constant ratios. Simulation benchmarks for allotetraploids and allohexaploids demonstrated that HOBIT outperforms existing methods in both area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and F1 score. Application to real RNA-Seq datasets from allotetraploid Cardamine flexuosa, allotriploid Cardamine insueta, and Triticum aestivum (wheat) produced biologically consistent results reflecting experimental settings. HOBIT provides a promising framework for uncovering homeolog regulation and adaptive responses in allopolyploids, without restrictions of ploidy complexities.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

Here, using confocal microscopy and genetically encoded fluorescent sensors targeted to mitochondria and cytosol, we visualized beat-to-beat ATP dynamics in ventricular myocytes from adult male and female mice. These probes showed fluctuations in mitochondrial ATP levels with each contraction, revealing two distinct, spatially localized waveforms--ATP ''gain'' and ATP ''dip''--representing transient increases or decreases in matrix ATP levels, respectively. These waveforms were tightly phase-locked to intracellular Ca2+ transients and organized into energetic microdomains. Although female myocytes exhibited larger local mitochondrial ATP transients than their male counterparts, their total mitochondrial volume was lower. Female myocytes also exhibited tighter coupling between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria and showed a higher concentration of mitofusin 2 and ATP synthase catalytic -subunit per unit volume, suggesting more efficient ATP production. Cytosolic ATP transients mirrored mitochondrial waveforms and domain structure in both male and female myocytes. During faster pacing, diastolic cytosolic ATP rose more rapidly in female myocytes, whereas the accompanying beat-locked ATP transients increased in both sexes but did so proportionally more in males than in females. These findings demonstrate that ATP is synthesized on demand--beat by beat--in a modular, microdomain-specific manner. We propose that male myocytes rely on greater mitochondrial mass for energetic scaling, whereas female cells employ architectural precision to optimize ATP delivery.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

Residential CD4 T cells, regulatory T cells, B cells, and NK cells have been demonstrated to share phenotypic properties with residential CD8 T cells, but the migratory kinetics are even more poorly defined. Here we used probabilistic modelling on a large parabiosis dataset, covering multiple time-points and tissues, to calculate migration kinetics and dwell times of multiple lymphocyte subsets across a diverse set of tissues. Markov chain modelling identified distinct cell type-specific and tissue-specific residency patterns. The liver and gut were prone to prolonged residency compared to other tissue types, and a hierarchy of residency was observed with CD8 T cells and NK cells demonstrating longer residency than CD4 conventional T cells and regulatory T cells, which in turn resided in tissues longer than B cells. With few exceptions, however, average residency was at least an order of magnitude shorter than the life-span of the mouse, indicating a more dynamic form of steady-state tissue residency than usually assumed.

While both classical and AI-based structural approaches have recently provided crucial insights into ligand-LRR-RK binding mechanisms, our understanding of ligand perception by LRR-RPs remains limited. In contrast to LRR-RKs, many LRR-RPs typically embed one or more loopout regions in their extracellular domains that are crucial for functionality. Here, we employed an AI-based approach to reveal a novel ligand-binding mechanism shared by the Arabidopsis LRR-RPs RLP23 and RLP42 - the PRRs for the short peptide ligands nlp20 and pg13, derived from NECROSIS- AND ETHYLENE-INDUCING PEPTIDE 1-like proteins (NLPs) and fungal endopolygalacturonases (PGs), respectively. This mechanism relies on a {beta}-strand interaction with the N-terminal part of the island domain (ID) loopout, which adopts an antiparallel {beta}-sheet conformation. Additionally, we investigated the larger and more complex binding interface of RLP32 - the PRR for proteobacterial TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 1 (IF1), a folded protein ligand that requires its tertiary structure for recognition. Finally, we describe a mechanistic role of the ID for co-receptor recruitment conserved across LRR-RPs. Together, our results shed light on the ligand-binding mechanisms and receptor complex formation of this important class of PRRs.

In this work, we solved the crystal structure of the RXLR-LWY effector AVRcap1b in complex with the ENTH domain of NbTOL9a. The structure revealed that unlike other RXLR-LWY effectors, AVRcap1b has a novel L-shaped fold that defines a new structural family of effectors in the Phytophthora genus. Moreover, we defined the AVRcap1b/NbTOL9a binding interface and designed effector mutants that dont bind NbTOL9a, impairing immune suppression. This indicates that ENTH binding is required for full virulence activity of this effector. Lastly, we show that AVRcap1b associates specifically with activated NbNRC2 independently of NbTOL9a binding.

We found significant alterations in DNA methylation patterns in genes related to neurodevelopmental pathways that overlap with cellular processes hijacked by viruses for their own replication. The alterations were further confirmed in cord blood mononuclear cells. Subsequently, we determined the functional consequences of epigenetic rewiring due to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection without fetal infection and found that fetal exposure to mediators driven by maternal infection, results in an altered responsiveness of the infants immune cells upon subsequent cell activation in vitro.

Alternative therapies are urgently needed to manage the growing burden of untreatable A. baumannii infections. Phage therapy is a promising avenue that has already seen some success in isolated compassionate-use cases, including the famous Patterson case. A. baumannii capsule is highly diverse both in structure and composition, and provides the first immunity barrier against phages. Here, we perform a detailed molecular characterization of three recently isolated, distinct A. baumannii phages that breach the capsule via different mechanisms. Like many previously described A. baumannii phages, a specific capsule type is necessary and sufficient for StAb1 infection. We found that StAb2 and its relatives adsorb to either a specific capsule type or the conserved outer membrane protein CarO, a porin normally occluded by the capsule. Thus, this phage has a narrow host range amongst capsulated strains, but can broadly infect A. baumannii strains lacking capsule. We also show that an unclassified siphophage, StAb3, requires a conserved and uncharacterized glycan, likely containing ManNAc, that enables StAb3 to infect a broad range of A. baumannii strains without depolymerizing the capsule. We demonstrate how rationally combining phages with distinct capsule interactions reduces the rapid emergence of phage escape mutants, with potential applications for more effective phage therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

This prolonged domestication has led to phenotypic adaptations that distinguish A. oryzae from its wild relative, Aspergillus flavus. While genomic and phenotypic differences between these species have been partially characterized, their comparative production of volatile compounds during food fermentation remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluated alpha-amylase activity, aflatoxin production, taste attributes (via electronic tongue), and volatile profiles (via dynamic headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of the food-grade strain A. oryzae RIB40 and two wild A. flavus strains, NPK13tox and AflaGuard. A. oryzae RIB40 exhibited significantly higher alpha-amylase activity during rice fermentation, and only A. flavus NPK13tox produced aflatoxin. Sensory analysis revealed that rice fermented by A. oryzae RIB40 exhibited more favorable taste attributes, including significantly lower astringency, aftertaste, and bitterness, as well as significantly higher richness (defined as umami aftertaste). Additionally, A. oryzae RIB40 produced a greater number and higher concentrations of volatile compounds, with 20 compounds significantly elevated compared to rice fermented by A. flavus. Many of these volatiles, including 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol, 3-octen-2-one, 2-methyl-butanal, and 3-methyl-butanal, are associated with pleasant sensory attributes and have previously been linked to A. oryzae-fermented foods. These findings suggest that the volatilome of A. oryzae RIB40 has been shaped by domestication to produce a more desirable sensory profile, enriched in alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and heterocyclic compounds contributing fruity, umami, and malty notes.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

To assess reproducibility, we extracted claims from 400 articles on the Drosophila immune response to bacteria and fungi and performed preliminary verification by comparing these claims to other published literature in the field. Using alternative approaches, we also experimentally tested some  unchallenged claims, which had no published follow-up. The intent of this analysis was to centralize evidence on insights and findings to improve clarity for scientists that may base research programs on these data.

Among these compounds, HP-29 demonstrates potent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus by inducing rapid iron starvation. As maintenance of trace metals homeostasis is critical for the survival of Streptococcus mutans, this study investigated the antimicrobial efficacy of HP-29 and the impact of metal supplementation on this major oral and occasional systemic pathogen. As anticipated, HP-29 inhibited S. mutans growth in a dose-dependent manner, with iron supplementation alleviating the antimicrobial effect. Cobalt, manganese, or nickel supplementation also mitigated the inhibitory activity of HP-29 but, unexpectedly, the addition of zinc greatly enhanced HP-29 antimicrobial activity. This zinc-driven potentiation of HP-29 extended to other Gram-positive pathogens, including Enterococcus faecalis and S. aureus. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis revealed that intracellular iron content decreased significantly following exposure to HP-29. At the same time, exposure to HP-29 led to a slight increase in intracellular zinc, mirroring the increase observed in cells exposed to excess zinc. When combined with zinc, HP-29 triggered a 5-fold increase in intracellular zinc and reduced manganese levels by about 50%. Transcriptome analysis showed that HP-29, with or without zinc, altered expression of genes linked to iron and manganese uptake as well as zinc efflux, suggesting broad disruption of metal ion regulation. These findings highlight HP-29 as a potent antimicrobial that broadly impairs metal homeostasis. The unexpected synergy of HP-29 with zinc points toward a promising dual-agent therapeutic strategy against Gram-positive pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

We previously reported that AAV2-derived capsids developed using the BRAVE (Barcoded Rational AAV Vector Evolution) approach have enhanced retrograde transport properties in the rodent brain, compared to parental AAV2. Retrograde transport enables broader coverage of connected brain regions after a single focal intraparenchymal brain injection and is therefore a powerful tool for delivery of vectors to distant sites with potentially higher specificity, transduction efficacy and safety. Because transport properties can vary among species, we further characterized a barcoded library of 25 BRAVE-derived AAV2 capsid variants, along with the parental AAV2 serotype and benchmark AAV capsids, in brains of adult cynomolgus monkeys after intraputaminal dosing. Based on RNA and DNA amplicon sequencing, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and histological assessment, we report here capsid variants with enhanced retrograde transport and expression compared to the parental AAV2 capsid. These properties make them potentially useful for disease indications in which broader brain coverage is desirable beyond the injection site.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

ObjectivesWe used electroencephalography (EEG) and the Linear Predictive Coding EEG Algorithm for PD (LEAPD) for binary classification of 3-year mortality status and correlation between LEAPD indices and time to death.

Methods2-minutes resting-state EEG from 94 PD patients (59 channels, 22 deceased within 3 years of recording) was used for binary classification of 3-year mortality status. Single-channel classification using a balanced dataset of 44 was performed using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Robustness was evaluated by truncating the recordings. LOOCV Spearmans correlation coefficient ({rho}) was obtained between LEAPD indices and time to death. Optimum hyperparameters obtained from a balanced training dataset of 30 were tested on the remaining 64 patients by 10,000 randomized comparisons of 7 vs 7, using 5 channel combinations Hyperparameters for the best {rho}, using the same training dataset were for the out-of-sample correlation for the remaining 7 deceased.

ResultsIn LOOCV analysis several channels yielded 100% accuracy with robust performance from five. The correlations ranged between {rho} =-0.59 to-0.86; were significant after adjusting for age, cognitive and motor impairment. Out-of-sample testing using the best-performing 5-channel combination yielded a mean accuracy of 83%. Out-of-sample Spearmans {rho} was-0.82.

ConclusionLEAPD provides a robust approach for binary classification of mortality in PD from resting-state EEG. LEAPD indices correlate with survival duration, independent of clinical predictors, suggesting potential utility as a continuous neurophysiological biomarker.","NA","medrxiv",1752271830799

Although the molecular basis of cellular heat shock responses is well understood, how thermosensory neurons contribute to systemic stress adaptation remains unclear. Here, using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, we examine whether thermosensory receptor guanylyl cyclases (rGCs) in AFD neurons regulate organism-wide stress responses under noxious temperatures and how individual rGCs contribute to this coordination. Among the AFD-expressed rGCs, we identify gcy-18 and gcy-23 as key regulators of the physiological response to thermal stress, acting through modulation of canonical heat shock response (HSR) genes. Our findings indicate that rGC signaling is crucial for activation of heat shock chaperones and maintenance of proteostasis under high temperatures (35{degrees}C). Supporting this, quantitative analysis of HSP-16.2 revealed that rGC activity in AFD neurons modulates the HSR magnitude in distal tissues, such as the intestine.

Within the sand flys alimentary tract, these parasite forms encounter shifts in temperature, pH and nutrient availability, which trigger significant morphological and physiological adaptations. Membrane transporter proteins, channels and pumps play a crucial role in facilitating the movement of solutes across eukaryotic membranes. Previously, a systematic loss-of-function screen of the L. mexicana ""transportome"" identified forty transporter deletion mutants that caused significant loss of fitness in macrophage and mouse infections. Here, using an independently generated library of over 300 barcoded gene deletion mutants, we monitored their growth fitness for seven days in vitro and tested which transporters are required for Leishmania promastigotes to successfully colonise Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies for nine days. Overall, fitness scores correlated between promastigotes from long-term in vitro culture and in vivo sand fly infections. More importantly, for 34 mutants, a significant loss of fitness was observed exclusively in vivo. Moreover, deletion of the vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) proved detrimental for parasite persistence and promastigote differentiation in the sand fly, uncovering a key role for the V-ATPase at different stages throughout the Leishmania life cycle.

Author SummaryLeishmania parasites cause leishmaniases - a group of neglected tropical diseases that affect millions of people worldwide. These parasites must survive in two radically different environments: inside a mammalian host and within the gut of a blood-feeding sand fly. To thrive in the sand fly, Leishmania undergo extensive physiological changes and depend on transporter proteins to move nutrients and other molecules across their cell membranes. In this study, we focused on identifying which of these transporters are critical for the parasites survival inside the sand fly. We used a genetically engineered library of Leishmania promastigotes - the parasite form adapted to the insect vector - to assess the importance of more than 300 different transporter genes. We discovered that 34 of these transporters are essential for successful colonization of the sand fly. Among them, one key protein complex - the vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) pump - was found to be crucial for parasite survival in the insect vector. Our findings deepen our understanding of how Leishmania adapts to life within the sand fly and highlight potential molecular targets for disrupting its transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

Applying this technology to mouse embryogenesis and postnatal brain resulted in rich DNA-RNA bimodal tissue maps. These maps revealed the spatial context of known methylation biology and its interplay with gene expression. The two modalities concordance and distinction in spatial patterns highlighted a synergistic molecular definition of cell identity in spatial programming of mammalian development and brain function. By integrating spatial maps of mouse embryos at two different developmental stages, we reconstructed the dynamics of both epigenome and transcriptome underlying mammalian embryogenesis, revealing details in sequence, cell type, and region-specific methylation-mediated transcriptional regulation.

The viral S protein evolved towards highly efficient antibody evasion and replicative capacity in the upper respiratory tract resulting in high transmissibility. At the same time, the mutations acquired in the S protein diminish infection of the lung epithelium and pathogenic potential. The changing entry requirements for Omicron sub-lineages that lead to this shift in tropism remain poorly understood. We resolve the changing replication requirements of SARS-CoV-2 to be related to two distinct pools of ACE2. The first pool relates to ACE2s role in the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and this pool can complex with TMPRSS2 (RAS-ACE2). The second pool relates to ACE2s role as a protein solute carrier chaperone than cannot complex with TMPRSS2 (Chaperone ACE2). Here, we demonstrate that pre-Omicron lineages replicate in a TMPRSS2 dependent manner across both ACE2 pools, whilst Omicron lineages can only spread and replicate using chaperone ACE2. This provides a mechanistic basis for the evolving infectivity requirements of SARS-CoV-2 and furthermore provides approaches to track and monitor ACE2 utilizing coronaviruses.

Graphical AbstractMechanistic basis for shift in SARS-CoV-2 tropism with the arrival of Omicron. A. Chaperone ACE2 is defined structurally as a heterodimer of dimers with a solute carrier protein-SLC6A19 or SLC6A20. Here this ACE2 structure can exist uncomplexed from TMPRSS2 and enables TMPRSS2 use by both pre-Omicron and Omicron lineages. B. Renin Angiotensin ACE2 is defined by ACE2 with an exposed collectrin-like domain (CLD), which enables binding of TMPRSS2 or ADAM-17. Here ACE2 can form a complex with TMPRSS2 in a manner that allows pre-Omicron but not Omicron lineages to utilize TMPRSS2 to facilitate infection. Here Omicron lineages are heavily attenuated as they cannot use TMPRSS2 to spread. C. to E. Based on single cell profiles, ACE2 can exist as a chaperone with SLC6A20 in C. the Nasal Cavity or D. primarily as RAS-ACE2 in the lung to respond to acute lung injury. E. The largest pool of ACE2 in our body resides within the small intestine on enterocytes and this further facilitates replication in this tissue by pre-Omicron and Omicron lineages.

Here we measure fluctuations in neuronal activity and blood volume associated with the same events across the mouse brain, and find that their relationship is consistent across brain regions but differs in two opposing brainwide neural populations. Functional Ultrasound Imaging (fUSI) revealed that whisking, a marker of arousal, is associated with brainwide fluctuations in blood volume. Simultaneous fUSI and Neuropixels recordings in cortex and hippocampus showed that neurons that increase vs. decrease activity with whisking have distinct hemodynamic response functions. Brainwide Neuropixels recordings revealed that these two opposing populations are present in the entire brain. When summed, their contributions predicted blood volume across brain regions better than predictions from bulk neural activity. The mouse brain thus contains two neural populations with opposite relation to brain state and distinct relationships to blood supply, which together account for brainwide fluctuations in blood volume.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830799

We aimed to characterize pathways of clinical progression associated with SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections using data from patients in an integrated healthcare system, whose encounters were monitored across all levels of acuity spanning virtual, ambulatory, and inpatient care settings. Using parametric survival models, we estimated probabilities of progression and distributions of time to progression from each care setting to all higher-acuity settings on a cascade encompassing the following classes of events or healthcare encounters: symptoms onset; diagnostic testing; telehealth or other virtual care appointment; outpatient physician office visit; urgent care presentation; emergency department presentation; hospital admission; mechanical ventilation; and death. Our analyses included data from 59,668, 22,705, and 1,668 episodes associated with positive SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV tests, respectively, between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024. First clinical encounters occurred in inpatient settings for only 4.7%, 3.4%, and 18.7% of SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV episodes, respectively, with median times (interquartile range) of 6.8 (3.6-13.2), 6.6 (3.5-12.1), and 6.4 (3.8-10.6) days from symptoms onset to admission. Overall, 7.9% of SARS-CoV-2 episodes, 5.8% of influenza episodes, and 33.8% of RSV episodes resulted in inpatient admission, ventilation, or death. Between 40.4-62.1%, 71.6-87.3%, and 47.9-58.7% of SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV infections, respectively, had encounters in lower-acuity virtual care, outpatient, or urgent care settings. For all three viruses, the proportions of cases receiving care at each level of acuity increased with older age and greater numbers of comorbid conditions. Median durations of hospital stay were 4.2 (2.6-7.3), 4.0 (2.3-6.8), and 4.3 (2.5-7.4) days for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV episodes resulting in admission. These estimates provide a basis for modeling real-world clinical care requirements and the progression of respiratory viral infections.

AUTHOR SUMMARYModels of respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV are used to forecast disease burden and plan the allocation of healthcare resources. Early healthcare system encounters--for instance, for receipt of care in virtual or outpatient settings--may provide a basis for anticipating higher-acuity care requirements as patients progress to more severe disease. However, limited data are available addressing patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with these infections. Using electronic healthcare records from an integrated healthcare system, we estimated probabilities and rates of progression from lower-acuity states, such as virtual or outpatient visits, to increasingly higher-acuity states including inpatient admission, ventilation, and death. We quantified associations of demographic and clinical risk factors with progression probabilities for each infection. We provide a databank containing fitted distributions for progression to inform infectious disease modeling.","NA","medrxiv",1752271830799

Understanding how the Healthy Eating Index-2020 (HEI-2020) can be used as a measure of diet quality to create benchmarks for national nutrition monitoring can assist in surveillance and improve the design of nutrition programs and policies.

ObjectiveTo examine the utility of the HEI-2020 to create benchmarks for national diet quality monitoring.

MethodsThis serial cross-sectional study used data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Nationally representative data for 22,168 US adults ([&ge;]20 years) who completed two 24-hour recalls were analyzed. We derived HEI-2020 scores (0-100) from participants two 24-hour dietary recalls. Diet quality categories were established: high diet quality (>70-100), marginal (>60-70), low (>50-60), and very low (0-50).

ResultsOnly 13% of US adults had high diet quality while nearly two-thirds had low or very low diet quality. Diet quality was higher for older adults, female, ""Other"" race or ethnicity, born outside of the US, have higher education attainment, higher income, and food security. Compared to adults with high diet quality, adults with very low diet quality had lower intakes of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and seafood and the highest intakes of ultra-processed foods, refined grains, and red and processed meats (all P-trends <0.01). Adults with very low diet quality were more likely to have elevated adiposity, lower HDL cholesterol, and higher triglycerides, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c (all P-trends [&le;]0.01).

ConclusionsThe HEI-2020 is a robust measure of diet quality that can be directly linked to biological measures associated with chronic disease risk. Using evidence-based HEI categories could allow policymakers, public health practitioners, and nutrition professionals to set benchmarks and nationwide targets for achieving improved diet quality.","NA","medrxiv",1752271830800

Although RXLR-EER motifs are critical for host translocation and are cleaved prior to secretion, the relevance of this processing is poorly understood. Prior evidence suggests RXLR effectors utilize a distinct, unconventional secretion pathway, raising the question of whether the RXLR-EER motifs influence selection of the secretion route. Here, we combined genetic, molecular and cell biology approaches to investigate the secretion pathways of RXLR effectors. Confocal microscopy revealed that RXLR and apoplastic effectors localize to distinct vesicular compartments in cultured hyphae. Moreover, fusing the ER retention signal KDEL to RXLR effectors did not impair their secretion, in contrast to apoplastic effectors, which were retained in the endomembrane system, indicating that RXLR effectors bypass the canonical ER-to-Golgi pathway. Importantly, RXLR effectors associate with extracellular vesicles, whereas RXLR-EER motif mutants show reduced association and are rerouted through the ER-to-Golgi secretion pathway. These findings demonstrate that the RXLR-EER motif governs effector sorting into an unconventional, EV-linked secretion route.

Here, we report the discovery of Candidatus Sukunaarchaeum mirabile, a novel archaeon with an unprecedentedly small genome of only 238 kbp --less than half the size of the smallest previously known archaeal genome-- from a dinoflagellate-associated microbial community. Phylogenetic analyses place Sukunaarchaeum as a deeply branching lineage within the tree of Archaea, representing a novel major branch distinct from established phyla. Environmental sequence data indicate that sequences closely related to Sukunaarchaeum form a diverse and previously overlooked clade in microbial surveys. Its genome is profoundly stripped-down, lacking virtually all recognizable metabolic pathways, and primarily encoding the machinery for its replicative core: DNA replication, transcription, and translation. This suggests an unprecedented level of metabolic dependence on a host, a condition that challenges the functional distinctions between minimal cellular life and viruses. The discovery of Sukunaarchaeum pushes the conventional boundaries of cellular life and highlights the vast unexplored biological novelty within microbial interactions, suggesting that further exploration of symbiotic systems may reveal even more extraordinary life forms, reshaping our understanding of cellular evolution.

We found that NRC4 membrane enrichment coincided with calcium influx. This is followed by sequential mitochondria and plastid disruption, endoplasmic reticulum fragmentation and cytoskeleton depolymerization. Subsequent loss of plasma membrane integrity, nuclear shrinkage, and vacuolar collapse mark the terminal stage of cell death. Our findings reveal a spatiotemporally-resolved cascade of subcellular events downstream of resistosome activation, providing new mechanistic insight into the execution phase of plant immune cell death.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription. Together, these findings redefine H3K4me3 as a post-transcriptional histone mark, revealing an unexpected layer of epigenetic regulation with broad implications for gene expression control.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2. These structural predictions were based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database, together with corresponding protein sequences obtained from UniProt. We then assessed the predicted interaction structures through various confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we performed a limited evaluation against experimentally determined human protein complex structures not included in the Boltz-2 training regimen, which indicated prediction accuracy consistent with AlphaFold3. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, while highlighting both strengths and limitations. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the comparative organization of mouse and human tumor microenvironments (mu/huTMEs). Through immunoprofiling of commonly used mouse models, we found that the immune composition of most muTMEs resemble poorly infiltrated human tumors extensively biased toward high macrophages densities. Relatedly, we discover species-specific biases of chemokine expression networks, factors which drive TMEs assembly. Further, assessing coarse cellular networks, we find conserved correlations between some immune cell frequencies, while other relationships only appear conserved in the huTMEs matching muTME profiles. Despite this variable alignment, we define robust cell type-specific gene expression programs conserved in TMEs across species and cohorts and identify ones that are coordinated between cell populations in both species. Together, we isolate and offer methods to study the multiple areas of hazard and opportunities for using mice to model human cancer.

The majority of described species are arthropods, which tend to be small and require taxonomic expertise to identify to species level. Therefore, the ability to collect and preserve specimens in a suitable way for long read and Hi-C data generation using very simple approaches with minimal infrastructure is certain to be important in scaling up reference genome generation. Using Anopheles mosquitoes as an insect representative we evaluate how well different preservation liquids protect high molecular weight DNA, RNA, and nuclei for Hi-C when mosquitoes are held intact versus slightly squished. We find that squished samples stored in 100% ethanol and Allprotect held at room temperature for one week result in excellent preservation of both high molecular weight DNA and nuclei for Hi-C. Other tested buffers, including RNAlater, EDTA at several pHs, and DMSO Salt Solution (DESS) performed satisfactorily for long read data generation and RNA retrieval, but less ideally for Hi-C, which may have bigger negative impacts when aiming to generate data for organisms with larger genomes. Field collections requiring dry ice or dry shippers can be logistically challenging to arrange, are notoriously expensive, and DNA degrades rapidly if ultra-cold temperature is not maintained, which is devastating given how expensive and time consuming field work can be. Here we present multiple viable options for room temperature collection and/or shipment for arthropod samples. Further exploration across a broader range of species will hopefully enable cheaper and more widely available reference genome generation globally.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

However, the molecular basis of these functions remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the CHD4 subunit is essential to antagonize CTCF and silence transcription of transposons, while HP1 proteins are dispensable. Although the remodeling activity of CHD4 is not required for ChAHP chromatin association, it is critical for both transposon repression and CTCF antagonism. Our findings support a model wherein ADNP recruits chromatin remodeling activity in a sequence-specific manner, enabling transcriptional control and local modulation of chromatin architecture.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

Most current methods fall at one of two extremes: either opaque deep learning models that obscure biological meaning, or simplified frameworks that treat genes as isolated units. As such, these approaches overlook a crucial insight: gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cellular states can be harnessed to model perturbation responses. Here we present CIPHER (Covariance Inference for Perturbation and High-dimensional Expression Response), a conceptual framework leveraging linear response theory from statistical physics to predict transcriptome-wide perturbation outcomes using gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cells. We validated CIPHER on synthetic regulatory networks before applying it to 11 large-scale single-cell perturbation datasets covering 4,234 perturbations and over 1.36M cells. CIPHER robustly recapitulated genome-wide responses to single and double perturbations by exploiting baseline gene covariance structure. Importantly, eliminating gene-gene covariances, while retaining gene-intrinsic variances, reduced model performance by 11-fold, demonstrating the rich information stored within baseline fluctuation structures. Moreover, gene-gene correlations transferred successfully across independent experiments of the same cell type, revealing stereotypic fluctuation structures. Furthermore, CIPHER outperformed conventional differential expression metrics in identifying true perturbations while providing uncertainty-aware effect size estimates through Bayesian inference. Finally, most genome-wide responses propagated through the covariance matrix along approximately three independent and global gene modules. CIPHER underscores the importance of theoretically-grounded models in capturing complex biological responses, highlighting fundamental design principles encoded in cellular fluctuation patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

The patterning and spacing of stomata are primarily regulated by the ERECTA leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK). Ubiquitination is a crucial mechanism to regulate the homeostasis of RKs by impacting their protein stability and localization. It has been shown that plant U-box ubiquitin E3 ligases, PUB30 and PUB31, act as key attenuators of the ERECTA signaling pathway. However, the molecular link between ubiquitination and function of ERECTA remains unclear. Here, we reveal that perception of the peptide ligand EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR2 (EPF2) by ERECTA induces the K63-linked ubiquitination of ERECTA mediated by PUB30 and PUB31. We further identify the specific ubiquitination sites within the juxtamembrane and kinase domains of ERECTA. Importantly, the site-directed mutagenesis of these K63-linked ubiquitination sites overly inhibited stomatal development, indicating that the ubiquitination-deficient ERECTA is hyperactive. The ubiquitination-deficient ERECTA stably accumulates at the plasma membrane and fails to internalize upon EPF2 application. Our findings thus uncover a mechanism by which ligand-induced ubiquitination orchestrates receptor homeostasis and endocytosis for proper stomatal patterning and differentiation.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

Using Staphylococcus aureus as a model, we found that gene transfer via various mechanisms is significantly restricted between strains from different clonal complexes (CCs), with the notable exception of lateral transduction, which occurs at high frequency. Interestingly, some strains exhibited a ""promiscuous"" ability to accept diverse mobile genetic elements. These strains were defective in the key immune defences of S. aureus, specifically the Type I restriction-modification systems that normally protect against foreign DNA. A broader analysis revealed that such immune-deficient mutants are widespread within S. aureus populations. Our study uncovered a trade-off that explains their persistence in nature: although these mutants are more susceptible to phage attack, they gain an evolutionary advantage by acquiring beneficial genes - such as those conferring antibiotic resistance - which enhance survival under selective pressure. These immune-deficient cells act as gateways for foreign DNA, which, once integrated and advantageous, can spread within the same CC. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for immune-deficient bacteria in facilitating the emergence of novel virulence factors and antibiotic resistance, emphasising their importance in shaping bacterial evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

While prior work has shown that tool use alters body representation, little is known about how artificial augmentations alter body representations as they are worn and used. Here, we investigated the dynamics of somatosensory plasticity using a custom-built exoskeletal device that extended users fingers by 10 cm. Across four time points, before, during (pre- and post-use), and after exoskeleton wear, participants completed a high-density proprioceptive mapping task. We observed three distinct phases of plasticity. First, simply wearing the exoskeleton led to a contraction of the perceived length of the biological finger. Second, following active use, both biological and artificial finger representations expanded significantly, an effect absent when participants trained with a non-augmenting control device. Third, a lasting aftereffect on biological finger representation was observed even after device removal. Our findings demonstrate that wearable augmentations are rapidly integrated into the body representation, with dynamic adjustments in proprioceptive space shaped by both structural and functional properties of the device. This work advances our understanding of how the sensorimotor system accommodates artificial extensions and highlights the potential for body- augmenting technologies to be intuitively integrated into body representation. These results have direct implications for the design of prosthetics, exoskeletons, and other assistive technologies aimed at extending human physical capacity.

Significance statementHow do wearable augmentations reshape our sense of the body? Using a custom- built exoskeleton that extended the fingers, we tracked changes in body representation across four stages of wear and use. We found that the sensorimotor system rapidly integrates artificial extensions into its somatosensory map: first contracting, then expanding perceived finger length in response to structure and function, with the shifts persisting after device removal. Our findings reveal dynamic, use-dependent plasticity in body representation, which has direct relevance for designing prosthetics, exoskeletons, and assistive devices.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

A previous study identified a population of cells in the proventriculus which incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of DNA synthesis, and proposed that these cycling cells are multipotent stem cells that replace dying cells elsewhere in the tissue. Here, we re-investigate these cycling cells and find that they do not undergo mitosis, do not generate clonal lineages, and do not proliferate in response to tissue damage, and are therefore not stem cells. Instead, we find that these cells continually endoreplicate throughout the flys life, increasing their ploidy and cell volume, while at the same time nearby cells are lost into the gut lumen in an age-dependent process. These cells play a critical role in the synthesis of peritrophic membrane components, and we show that when endocycling in these cells is experimentally increased or decreased, nuclear and cellular volume as well as peritrophic membrane synthesis is concomitantly enhanced or reduced. Further, we show that blocking endocycling in these cells leads to functional defects in the peritrophic membrane, ultimately leading to increased susceptibility to orally infectious bacteria. Altogether, we show that continual endocycling of these cells is critical for maintaining tissue size and function over the course of the adult lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

By merging data from 58 such nanocrystals, we obtained diffraction to 0.85 [A] resolution with an overall correlation coefficient of over 99% and solved the structure ab initio using a five-residue helical fragment to initiate density modification. The resulting map was of exceptional quality, enabling fully automated model building and resolving individual hydrogen atoms. This work represents the highest-resolution protein structure (0.85 [A]) determined from spontaneously formed protein nanocrystals and is the first ab initio structure of crambin solved by electron diffraction. Our workflow demonstrates that complex biological matrices can be mined directly for sub-[a]ngstrom protein structures, establishing a practical and scalable pipeline from raw biomass to atomic-level models of previously intractable targets.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1752271830800
"A Novel Insertion Site for Group I Introns in tRNA Genes of Patescibacteria","10.1101/2025.07.03.662931","biorxiv",10.95,0,0,10.95,10.95,"Nakagawa, Y.; Amikura, K.; Omae, K.; Suzuki, S.","Shino Suzuki","RIKEN","2025-07-03","1","new results","cc_no","microbiology","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2025/07/03/2025.07.03.662931.source.xml","Patescibacteria is a bacterial phylum with small genomes, frequent loss of essential genes, and the presence of introns. While many aspects of Patescibacteria remain enigmatic, an intriguing feature is the widespread occurrence of introns within their compact genomes. To better understand the diversity, roles, and evolution of bacterial introns, we focused on tRNA introns and analyzed Patescibacteria complete genome. Notably, 20% of these genomes lacked at least one tRNA gene for a canonical amino acid, primarily tRNAAsn and tRNAAsp, whereas other tRNA genes were readily detected. This observation led us to conduct further analyses, resulting in the discovery of a novel group I intron insertion site at position 35/36 within the anticodon loop that likely prevented detection by conventional annotation tools. Splicing assays demonstrated that these bacterial introns are catalytically active and capable of self-splicing. To assess the broader distribution of this insertion site across bacteria, we analyzed 4,934 bacterial genomes and identified 269 group I introns within tRNA genes across 14 phyla. Nearly 70% of introns at position 35/36 originate from Patescibacteria, indicating that this feature is largely confined to the phylum. Subgroup classification showed that 79% of all tRNA introns belonged to the IC subgroup, whereas almost all Patescibacteria introns were assigned to IA, suggesting a distinct evolutionary origin. As most tRNA introns lacked homing endonuclease genes, horizontal transfer appears limited. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of the phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary history of bacterial group I introns in tRNAs, with particular emphasis on Patescibacteria.

IMPORTANCEGroup I introns in bacterial tRNA genes were previously known only in a limited number of phyla. Our study expands this knowledge by identifying a novel insertion position in tRNA genes of phylum Patescibacteria and mapping their phylogenetic distribution across bacterial lineages. Our result revealed that group I introns inserted in tRNA genes differed in subgroups between Patescibacteria and other bacteria, highlighting the evolutionary uniqueness of introns of Patescibacteria. Additionally, we found that group I introns are maintained in 43% of bacterial phyla, with tRNA insertions being the most common. Our findings highlight that even in complete genomes, the presence of group I introns can hinder the detection of all 20 canonical tRNA genes by conventional tRNA annotation tools. This study illustrates the overlooked phylogenetic distribution of group I introns across the bacterial domain.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

We combined chemically imposed immune activation with single-cell transcriptomics to profile ETI responses across all leaf cell types in Arabidopsis. Despite uniform ETI perception, we find striking divergence between transcriptional outputs: a core set of defense genes is broadly induced, while distinct cell types activate specialized immune modules. We infer that downstream immune execution is shaped not only by immune receptor activation, but also by cell identity and its associated transcriptional regulatory context, including local transcription factor availability and chromatin accessibility. We further demonstrate that transcriptional regulators preferentially induced in epidermal cells are required to restrict invasion by non-adapted pathogens. Their absence permits pathogen entry into deeper tissues despite intact recognition, revealing a spatial division of immune functions. Our findings uncover a layered immune architecture in plants, challenges the assumption of uniform immune execution, and provides a framework for exploring cell-type-specific resistance logic in multicellular hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

The mechanisms that initiate endocytic actin assembly are incompletely understood. In the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, actin assembly is initiated by Dip1, an Arp2/3 activator. In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the initiation of actin assembly has remained a mystery. Here we show that S. cerevisiae Ldb17, the homolog of Dip1, functions as an on-switch for endocytic actin assembly. Unexpectedly, the regulation of Ldb17 is more complicated than that of constitutively active Dip1. Ldb17 is controlled by a coat protein, Sla1, via separate recruitment and activation steps. This regulation was likely lost in the S. pombe lineage and this simplification may be related to other changes in actin assembly between these species. Our findings add a key missing piece in the understanding of endocytosis in S. cerevisiae and reveal an intriguing evolutionary tinkering of the actin on-switch.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

In Caenorhabditis elegans, favorable conditions promote dispersal, while stressors like food scarcity or overcrowding trigger aggregation. Here, we describe a distinct behavior termed as swarming, where C. elegans move and feed in aggregates despite abundant food availability. While environmental factors have been implicated in this behavior, the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We identify a novel role for the conserved calsyntenin protein CASY-1 in regulating swarming. Through genetic, behavioral, and optogenetic approaches, we show that CASY-1 functions in sensory neurons to modulate the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) signaling. Mutants in casy-1 show impaired PDF-1 signaling and reduced inhibition of the serotonin pathway, a known regulator of social behaviors. This dysregulation, along with its associated mechanosensory and foraging defects, likely contributes to the swarming phenotype. Our findings reveal a putative neuromodulatory pathway critical for swarming behavior in C. elegans.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

We observed a reduction in neural progenitors and corticothalamic neurons and concomitant increase of intratelencephalic neurons, accompanied by accelerated time to neuronal specification. We uncovered widespread changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility and cell interaction networks impacting neurogenesis, specification and maturation and gene-regulatory networks directing these processes, including those downstream of transcription factors encoded in chromosome 21. Finally, we identified cell-specific molecular pathways shared with other neurodevelopmental disorders as well as heritability enrichment of GWAS signals in altered chromatin.

The success of motor augmentation devices, such as supernumerary robotic limbs, hinges on users capacity for generalised motor performance.

We trained participants over seven days to use an extra robotic thumb (Third Thumb, Dani Clode Design), worn on the right hand and controlled via the toes. We tested whether motor learning was confined to the specific tasks and body parts involved in controlling and interacting with the Third Thumb, or whether it could generalise beyond them.

Participants showed broad skill generalisation across tasks, body postures, and even when either the Third Thumb or the controller was reassigned to a different body part, suggesting the development of abstract, body-independent motor representations.

Training also reduced cognitive demands and increased the sense of agency over the device. However, participants still preferred using their biological hand over the Third Thumb when given the option, suggesting that factors beyond motor skill generalisation, cognitive effort, and embodiment must be addressed to support the real-world adoption of such technologies.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

However, their robust silica cell wall renders diatoms impermeable to many dyes and antibodies, and complicates the intracellular delivery of gene editing tools - driving in part the eventual decline of diatoms as mainstream model species despite their unique cellular physiology and remarkable ecological success. Here, we demonstrate that cryo-fixation combined with ultrastructural expansion microscopy (cryo-ExM) can overcome the silica barrier across diverse diatom species spanning over 80 million years of evolutionary time. We illustrate the potential of cryo-ExM to provide scalable, cost-effective volumetric imaging of diatom ultrastructure in laboratory cultures, as well as field-collected samples from the pan-European TREC expedition. We first reveal striking similarities in interphase microtubule organization across diverse diatom species by characterizing cytoskeletal arrangements throughout cell cycles and populations, uniting both pennate and centric morphologies under shared principles. We further unveil diatom photosynthetic diversity through qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis of chloroplast and pyrenoid morphologies, demonstrating that each diatom species architects unique photosynthetic machinery. Using cryo-ExM on environmental samples further exposes intricate diatom symbioses, revealing tight spatial organisation of ecological interactions. This methodology makes diatoms more accessible for modern and comparative cell biology research, providing new opportunities to investigate the cellular mechanisms of one of Earths most successful photosynthetic groups.

In a comprehensive analysis of N. benthamiana agroinfiltration experiments, we model sources of variability that affect transient expression. Our findings emphasize the need to validate normalization methods under the specific conditions of each study, as distinct normalization schemes do not always reduce variation either within or between experiments. Using a dataset of 1,813 plants collected over three years, we develop a comprehensive model of variation in N. benthamiana transient expression, using power analysis to determine the number of individual plants required for a given effect size.

The viral non-structural protein NS3 is a membrane-bound AAA+ ATPase of superfamily 3 (SF3) with multiple proposed roles in the norovirus replication cycle. However, the structure of NS3, and the mechanisms by which it contributes to genome replication and membrane remodeling, have remained unknown. We engineered a soluble, hexameric, and catalytically active form of NS3 and determined its cryo-EM structure in the presence of a nucleotide analogue at 2.9 [A] resolution. The structure adopts a split lock-washer architecture characteristic of AAA+ motors that operate via a hand-over-hand translocation mechanism2. Modeling of the nucleotide-binding site reveals conserved features governing ATP binding and hydrolysis. Using integrative modeling with AlphaFold3, we generated a full-length, membrane-associated model of NS3, in which an N-terminal transmembrane domain, central helical bundle, and AAA+ motor form a continuous conduit. This model supports a role for NS3 as a candidate membrane-spanning RNA translocase that couples ATP hydrolysis to genome movement. This structural framework helps address long-standing gaps in our understanding of norovirus replication and establishes a basis for mechanistic studies and structure-guided antiviral design.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

As part of a broader long-term study on African leopard (Panthera pardus) population ecology in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, we deployed camera traps on animal trails and at Python Cave, a known roost site of Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and a confirmed Marburg and virus reservoir. This serendipitous deployment yielded the first visual documentation of a multi-trophic predator and scavenger guild interacting at a filovirus reservoir site. Over a five month period (February 16th - June 5th 2025) across 304 trap nights, we recorded at least 14 different vertebrate species, including leopards, primates, raptors, and small carnivores, engaging in bat predation, scavenging on bat remains, guano foraging, or cave exploration across 261 temporally and spatially independent events (>1 hour apart). These instances were structured, repeated and the species continuously made contact with the bats or entered their roosting space. Camera traps also recorded an estimated 400 human individuals visiting the cave -- including school groups, tourists, and local trainees -- the majority with no personal protective equipment. The shallow, accessible structure of Python Cave appears to collapse the typical spatial buffers between reservoir species and both predators and humans. These observations constitute the first ecological confirmation of a dynamic, multispecies exposure network at a known Marburg virus site, and may represent a Rosetta Stone for interpreting the real-time mechanics of zoonotic spillover.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

While these have the potential to significantly accelerate scientific discoveries by creating AI-driven virtual cell models, their progress has been greatly limited by the lack of large-scale high-quality perturbation data, which remains constrained due to scalability bottlenecks and assay variability. Here, we introduce ""Fix-Cryopreserve-ScRNAseq"" (FiCS) Perturb-seq, an industrialized platform for scalable Perturb-seq data generation. We demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq exhibits high sensitivity and low batch effects, effectively capturing perturbation-induced transcriptomic changes and recapitulating known biological pathways and protein complexes. In addition, we release X-Atlas: Orion edition (X-Atlas/Orion), the largest publicly available Perturb-seq atlas. This atlas, generated from two genome-wide FiCS Perturb-seq experiments targeting all human protein-coding genes, comprises eight million cells deeply sequenced to over 16,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell. Furthermore, we show that single guide RNA (sgRNA) abundance can serve as a proxy for gene knockdown (KD) efficacy. Leveraging the deep sequencing and substantial cell numbers per perturbation, we also show that stratification by sgRNA expression can reveal dose-dependent genetic effects. Taken together, we demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq is an efficient and scalable platform for high-throughput Perturb-seq screens. Through the release of X-Atlas/Orion, we highlight the potential of FiCS Perturb-seq to address current scalability and variability challenges in data generation, advance foundation model development that incorporates gene-dosage effects, and accelerate biological discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

Can these divergent perspectives on cortical organization be reconciled within a unifying framework? Using data-driven decomposition of fMRI responses in face-, body-, and scene-selective areas, we identified overlapping activity patterns shared across individuals. Each area encoded multiple interpretable dimensions tuned to both finer subcategory features and coarser cross-category distinctions beyond its preferred category, even in the most category-selective voxels. These dimensions formed distinct clusters within category-selective areas but were also sparsely distributed across the broader visual cortex, supporting both locally selective, category-specific, and globally distributed, feature-based coding. Together, these findings suggest multidimensional tuning as a fundamental organizing principle that integrates feature-selective clusters, category-selective areas, and large-scale tuning maps, providing a more comprehensive understanding of category representations in human visual cortex.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

The protein C2CD3 is critical for distal appendage assembly, with mutations linked to orofaciodigital syndrome and other ciliopathies. However, its precise molecular role in appendage recruitment remains unclear. Using Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM), iterative U-ExM, and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), we reveal that C2CD3 adopts a radially symmetric 9-fold organization within the centrioles distal lumen. We show that the C-terminal region of C2CD3 localizes close to a [~]100 nm luminal ring structure consisting of [~]27 nodes, while its N-terminal region localizes close to a hook-like structure that attaches to the A-microtubule as it extends from the centriole interior to exterior. This hook structure is adjacent to the DISCO complex (MNR/CEP90/OFD1), which marks future appendage sites. C2CD3 depletion disrupts not only the recruitment of the DISCO complex via direct interaction with MNR but also destabilizes the luminal ring network composed of C2CD3/SFI1/centrin-2/CEP135/NA14, as well as the distal microtubule tip protein CEP162. This reveals an intricate ""in-to-out"" molecular hub connecting the centriolar lumen, distal microtubule cap, and appendages. Although C2CD3 loss results in shorter centrioles and appendage defects, key structural elements remain intact, permitting continued centriole duplication. We propose that C2CD3 forms the luminal ring structure and extends radially to the space between triplet microtubules, functioning as an architectural hub that scaffolds the distal end of the centriole, orchestrating its assembly and directing appendage formation.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

His Y-chromosome has been hypothesized to belong to haplogroup C3* (C2a1a3-F1918) but this has yet to be substantiated.

Protein- and RNA-rich liquid-like condensates form through phase separation on and around chromatin, driving diverse condensate morphologies with varying sphericity and intra-condensate chromatin density3,4. However, a unifying set of physical principles underlying these varied interactions and their implications for chromatin organization remains elusive. Here, we develop and experimentally validate a mesoscopic model that bridges the physics of phase separation and chromatin mechanics. Specifically, by integrating computational modeling with experiments using two canonical condensate proteins, the heterochromatin protein HP1, and the euchromatin protein BRD4, we demonstrate that wetting properties and chromatin stiffness shape condensate morphology, while condensates remodel chromatin mechanics and organization. This two-way interplay is governed by elastocapillarity--the deformation of chromatin by condensate interfacial tension -- and resolves discrepancies in nuclear condensate behavior, with emergent behaviors that deviate from the simplest liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) models5-8. Our findings underscore that nuclear condensates and chromatin cannot be studied in isolation, as they are fundamentally interdependent, impacted by biomolecularly-defined wetting properties, with implications for genome organization, transcriptional regulation, and epigenetic control in diverse phenotypes, including cancer2,9,10.

However, while fine root carbon (FRC) inputs can increase SOC accrual in soils, FRC can also enhance SOC loss by stimulating microbial respiration and cause a net loss of SOC through priming. It remains unclear how SOC varies as a function of FRC at broad spatial scales and across ecosystems and depths. Here, we tested the relationship of SOC and FRC using data from 43 sites across the US National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). We found that total stocks of SOC and FRC in the top 2 meters of soil were positively related with an across-ecosystem slope of 7 {+/-} 3 kg SOC m-2 per kg FRC m-2. However, grassland sites primarily drove this relationship. Grasslands had 15 {+/-} 2 kg SOC m-2 per kg FRC m-2, which is double the across-ecosystem slope. We used deviations from the standardized 1:1 relationship between FRC and SOC to infer whether ecosystems were net priming (indicated by observed SOC being lower than the 1:1 line) or SOC accruing (higher SOC than the 1:1 line). Grassland soils and especially their deep soil layers (>30 cm) showed primarily SOC accrual with increasing fine root abundance. Meanwhile, forest soils had high variability in whether increasing fine roots were associated with net SOC priming or accrual across both shallow and deeper soil layers. We found that in grasslands, FRC inputs are strongly related to SOC accrual, especially at depth and at sites with high moisture and clay content. In contrast, SOC-FRC relationships in forests remain difficult to characterize. Nevertheless, deep grassland soils may serve as optimal environments in which increasing FRC could lead to meaningful increases in SOC stocks.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

In the anterior limb cells of wild-type mice, Shh is inactive, but the ZRS is accessible and marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. We demonstrate that this poising signature explains how over 20 independent rare variants within the ZRS cause Shh misexpression in the same anterior limb bud cell population, resulting in similar limb malformations, despite affecting binding sites for different activators and repressors. Disabling pioneer transcription factor binding to the ZRS suppresses its poised state in anterior cells, prevents aberrant activation of the ZRS by rare variants, and fully rescues limb malformations in variant knock-in mice. A thorough examination of other disease-associated enhancers with pathogenic gain-of-function variants revealed that they are all poised in tissues with ectopic activity. We use this poising signature to predict and validate in vivo ectopic forebrain activity of previously uncharacterized autism-associated non-coding variants. Our findings suggest that spatial enhancer poising, likely a byproduct of development, creates a susceptibility to non-coding mutations and offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the burden of disease-associated non-coding variants.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

However, these methods are inherently specialized, relying on predefined assumptions and/or limited scalability. Recent advances in simulation and deep learning provide an alternative approach: learning directly to generalize from synthetic genetic data to infer specific hidden evolutionary processes. Here we reframe the inference of coalescence times as a problem of translation between two biological languages: the sparse, observable patterns of mutation along the genome and the unobservable ancestral recombination graph (ARG) that gave rise to them. Inspired by large language models, we develop cxt, a decoder-only transformer that autoregressively predicts coalescent events conditioned on local mutational context. We show that cxt performs on par with state-of-the-art MCMC-based likelihood models across a broad range of demographic scenarios, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Trained on simulations spanning the stdpopsim catalog, the model generalizes robustly and enables efficient inference at scale, producing over a million coalescence predictions in minutes. In addition cxt produces a well calibrated approximate posterior distribution of its predictions, enabling principled uncertainty quantification. Our work moves towards a foundation model for population genetics, bridging deep learning and coalescent theory to enable flexible, scalable inference of genealogical history from genomic data.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1752271830800

While the virus itself contributes to pathogenesis, disease severity is primarily influenced by the hosts response to infection. One factor observed to impact the host response is sex, as epidemiological data indicates that male persons have a higher case fatality rate than females infected with MERS-CoV. However, the mechanism underlying this sex bias is unknown and disease course remains difficult to predict. This study investigates how male and female transgenic mice expressing humanized dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (hDPP4) respond to MERS-CoV infection following exposure to either a tolerance-inducing low dose or lethal high dose. We observed that female hDPP4 mice display dose-dependent tolerance to infection and males experienced uniformly lethal disease in both dosing groups. Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis revealed that males suppress innate and inflammatory responses early after infection, causing delayed induction of the host antiviral response. In contrast, high dose females mount an immediate and sustained interferon and inflammatory response, activating antiviral effectors and interferon-stimulated genes. Tolerant females displayed the greatest transcriptional control, showing no pathway enrichment and minimal changes in weight throughout infection. Our results suggest that the magnitude of the response is driven by dose while the nature of the response in shaped by sex. Females mount a more robust response to MERS-CoV infection, allowing females to tolerate low-dose infection but causing uncontrolled inflammation after high dose infection. In contrast, males experienced lethal outcomes regardless of dose. By examining the dynamics of sex-biased host transcriptional responses in determining disease severity, this study highlights the importance of sex as a biological variable in coronavirus pathogenesis research.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

Here we report evolutionary analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data of male and female human, marmoset (New World monkey), and mouse gonadal cells spanning key prenatal stages. We find that the two primates and mouse share similar X chromosome expression dynamics, including X chromosome reactivation (XCR), and that in Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) testes, germ cells undergo female-like XCR and escape of X inactivation. New male-specific regulatory regions have emerged progressively during mammalian evolution, especially on the X following sex chromosome origination. Further analyses revealed that male-specific regulatory regions evolved faster than female-specific ones in both supporting and pre-meiotic germ cells. However, female meiotic germ cells show even higher rates of molecular evolution and exhibit a permissive chromatin state that facilitates the birth of new genes, thus resembling their adult spermatogenic counterparts. Finally, we traced both conserved and species-specific gene expression trajectories across the three mammals, uncovering candidate genes for disorders of sex development that are typically central to cell-type-specific regulatory networks. Together, our study unveils both ancestral mammalian and recently evolved gene regulatory programs that control human- and primate-specific aspects of gonadal development in both sexes.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800

Transcription factors such as BABY BOOM can induce somatic embryogenesis when ectopically expressed and are widely used for aiding regeneration in tissue culture for transformation and gene editing of crops. Nevertheless, regeneration remains a bottleneck and alternative morphogenic genes are highly desired. Here, we co-expressed BABY BOOM and WUSCHEL2 in zygotic maize (Zea mays L.) embryos and studied gene regulatory networks in induced somatic embryos at the single-cell level. By inferring cell-type-specific regulons, we prioritized candidate regulators and confirmed functionality of four transcription factors, bHLH48, EREB152, GRF4, and HB77, for enhanced maize transformation frequency, leading to fertile, transgenic plants. Interestingly, the basic helix-loop-helix and homeodomain-leucine zipper families had previously not been associated with induced somatic embryogenesis. Our work will contribute to more efficient transformation, much needed to deliver on the promise of gene editing for agriculture.","NA","biorxiv",1752271830800
