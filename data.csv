Throughout this outbreak, spillovers of the virus to mammals have been frequently documented. Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state. These results demonstrate the transmission of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus at a non-traditional interface and to a new and highly relevant livestock species, underscoring the ability of the virus to cross species barriers.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559262

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded. We report the value of wastewater sequencing to track avian influenza.","NA","medrxiv",1716588559262

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

We selected colorectal tumor as an example of a cold tumor, uncovering an immunosuppressive macrophage barrier impeding T cell infiltration and regionally altering lymphocyte proteomes. Spatial proteomic analysis revealed distinct functional states of T cells in different tumor compartments. In tonsil cancer - a hot tumor, we identified significant heterogeneity of cell proteomes influenced by proximity to cytotoxic T cell subtypes. Tumor-infiltrating T cells exhibited metabolic adaptations and enhanced stress resilience, enabling migration into hypoxic regions. Our spatially-resolved, highly multiplexed strategy deciphers the complex cellular interplay within the tumor microenvironment, with implications for identifying new immunotherapy targets and signatures.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559262

Here, we investigated JN.1-derived subvariants SLip, FLiRT, and KP.2 for their ability to be neutralized by antibodies in bivalent-vaccinated human sera, XBB.1.5 monovalent-vaccinated hamster sera, sera from people infected during the BA.2.86/JN.1 wave, and class III monoclonal antibody (Mab) S309. We found that compared to parental JN.1, SLip and KP.2, and especially FLiRT, exhibit increased resistance to COVID-19 bivalent-vaccinated human sera and BA.2.86/JN.1-wave convalescent sera. Interestingly, antibodies in XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccinated hamster sera robustly neutralized FLiRT and KP.2 but had reduced efficiency for SLip. These JN.1 subvariants were resistant to neutralization by Mab S309. In addition, we investigated aspects of spike protein biology including infectivity, cell-cell fusion and processing, and found that these subvariants, especially SLip, had a decreased infectivity and membrane fusion relative to JN.1, correlating with decreased spike processing. Homology modeling revealed that L455S and F456L mutations in SLip reduced local hydrophobicity in the spike and hence its binding to ACE2. In contrast, the additional R346T mutation in FLiRT and KP.2 strengthened conformational support of the receptor-binding motif, thus counteracting the effects of L455S and F456L. These three mutations, alongside D339H, which is present in all JN.1 sublineages, alter the epitopes targeted by therapeutic Mabs, including class I and class III S309, explaining their reduced sensitivity to neutralization by sera and S309. Together, our findings provide insight into neutralization resistance of newly emerged JN.1 subvariants and suggest that future vaccine formulations should consider JN.1 spike as immunogen, although the current XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine could still offer adequate protection.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559263

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study across twenty-nine healthcare institutions from March 2020 to September 2023, including 413,455 pediatric patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1,163,478 controls without infection. Infection was confirmed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), serology, antigen tests, or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and related conditions. We examined the incidence of predefined GI symptoms and disorders during the post-acute (28 to 179 days post-infection) and chronic (180 to 729 days post-infection) phases. The adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) were calculated using stratified Poisson regression, with stratification based on propensity scores. Results: Our cohort comprised 1,576,933 patients, with females representing 48.0% of the sample. The analysis revealed that children with SARS-CoV-2 infection had an increased risk of developing at least one GI symptom or disorder in both the post-acute (8.64% vs. 6.85%; aRR 1.25, 95% CI 1.24-1.27) and chronic phases (12.60% vs. 9.47%; aRR 1.28, 95% CI 1.26-1.30) compared to uninfected peers. Specifically, the risk of abdominal pain was higher in COVID-19 positive patients during the post-acute phase (2.54% vs. 2.06%; aRR 1.14, 95% CI 1.11-1.17) and chronic phase (4.57% vs. 3.40%; aRR 1.24, 95% CI 1.22-1.27). Interpretation: Children with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection are at an increased risk of GI symptoms and disorders during the post-acute and chronic phases of COVID-19. This highlights the need for ongoing monitoring and management of GI outcomes in this population.","NA","medrxiv",1716588559263

Bulk sequencing of tissue microdissection captures mutation frequencies, but cannot distinguish which mutations co-occur in the same clones to reconstruct clonal architectures, nor phenotypically profile clonal populations to delineate how driver mutations impact cellular behavior. To address these challenges, we developed single-cell Genotype-to-Phenotype sequencing (scG2P) for high-throughput, highly-multiplexed, single-cell joint capture of recurrently mutated genomic regions and mRNA phenotypic markers in cells or nuclei isolated from solid tissues. We applied scG2P to aged esophagus samples from five individuals with high alcohol and tobacco exposure and observed a clonal landscape dominated by a large number of clones with a single driver event, but only rare clones with two driver mutations. NOTCH1 mutants dominate the clonal landscape and are linked to stunted epithelial differentiation, while TP53 mutants and double-driver mutants promote clonal expansion through both differentiation biases and increased cell cycling. Thus, joint single-cell highly multiplexed capture of somatic mutations and mRNA transcripts enables high resolution reconstruction of clonal architecture and associated phenotypes in solid tissue somatic mosaicism.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559263

Most experts agree that anthropogenic ecosystem change and high-risk contact among people, livestock, and wildlife have contributed to the recent emergence of new zoonotic, vector-borne, and environmentally-transmitted pathogens. However, the extent to which these factors also structure landscapes of human infection and outbreak risk is not well understood, beyond certain well-studied disease systems. Here, we consolidate 58,319 unique records of outbreak events for 32 emerging infectious diseases worldwide, and systematically test the influence of 16 hypothesized social and environmental drivers on the geography of outbreak risk, while adjusting for multiple detection, reporting, and research biases. Across diseases, outbreak risks are widely associated with mosaic landscapes where people live alongside forests and fragmented ecosystems, and are commonly exacerbated by long-term decreases in precipitation. The combined effects of these drivers are particularly strong for vector-borne diseases (e.g., Lyme disease and dengue fever), underscoring that policy strategies to manage these emerging risks will need to address land use and climate change. In contrast, we find little evidence that spillovers of directly-transmitted zoonotic diseases (e.g., Ebola virus disease and mpox) are consistently associated with these factors, or with other anthropogenic drivers such as deforestation and agricultural intensification. Most importantly, we find that observed spatial outbreak intensity is primarily an artefact of the geography of healthcare access, indicating that existing disease surveillance systems remain insufficient for comprehensive monitoring and response: across diseases, outbreak reporting declined by a median of 32% (range 1.2%-96.7%) for each additional hour's travel time from the nearest health facility. Our findings underscore that disease emergence is a multicausal feature of social-ecological systems, and that no one-size-fits-all global strategy can prevent epidemics and pandemics. Instead, ecosystem-based interventions should follow regional priorities and system-specific evidence, and be paired with investment in One Health surveillance and health system strengthening.","NA","medrxiv",1716588559263

The mechanism by which Haspin binds to nucleosomes to phosphorylate H3T3 is not known. We report here cryo-EM structures of the Haspin kinase domain bound to a nucleosome. In contrast with previous structures of histone-modifying enzymes, Haspin solely contacts the nucleosomal DNA, inserting into a supergroove formed by apposing major grooves of two DNA gyres. This unique binding mode provides a plausible mechanism by which Haspin can bind to nucleosomes in a condensed chromatin environment to phosphorylate H3T3. We identify key basic residues in the Haspin kinase domain that are essential for phosphorylation of nucleosomal histone H3 and binding to mitotic chromatin.

Strikingly, the majority of direction reversals between retrograde and anterograde movement occurred on the time scale of single steps (16 ms), suggesting a rapid regulatory reversal mechanism. Tug-of-war-like behavior during pauses or reversals was unexpectedly rare. By analyzing the dwell time between steps, we concluded that a single rate-limiting process underlies the dynein stepping mechanism whereby dynein consumes one adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) per step. Our study underscores the power of MINFLUX localization to elucidate the spatiotemporal changes underlying protein function in living cells.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559263

These are key features in the pathophysiology of lymphatic system diseases, including lymphedema and lipedema; however, the role of TRPV4 channels in the lymphatic system remains largely unexplored. TRPV4 channels are calcium permeable, non-selective cation channels that are activated by diverse stimuli, including shear stress, stretch, temperature, and cell metabolites, which may regulate lymphatic contractile function. Objective: To characterize the expression of TRPV4 channels in collecting lymphatic vessels and to determine the extent to which these channels regulate the contractile function of lymphatics. Methods and Results: Pressure myography on intact, isolated, and cannulated lymphatic vessels showed that pharmacological activation of TRPV4 channels with GSK1016790A (GSK101) led to contractile dysregulation. The response to GSK101 was multiphasic and included, 1) initial robust constriction that was sustained for [&ge;]1 minute and in some instances remained for [&ge;]4 minutes; and 2) subsequent vasodilation and partial or complete inhibition of lymphatic contractions associated with release of nitric oxide. The functional response to activation of TRPV4 channels displayed differences across lymphatics from four anatomical regions, but these differences were consistent across different species (mouse, rat, and non-human primate). Importantly, similar responses were observed following activation of TRPV4 channels in arterioles. The initial and sustained constriction was prevented with the COX inhibitor, indomethacin. We generated a controlled and spatially defined single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) dataset from intact and microdissected collecting lymphatic vessels. Our data uncovered a subset of macrophages displaying the highest expression of Trpv4 compared to other cell types within and surrounding the lymphatic vessel wall. These macrophages displayed a transcriptomic profile consistent with that of tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs), including differential expression of Lyve1, Cd163, Folr2, Mrc1, Ccl8, Apoe, Cd209f, Cd209d, and Cd209g; and at least half of these macrophages also expressed Timd4. This subset of macrophages also highly expressed Txa2s, which encodes the thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthase. Inhibition of TXA2 receptors (TXA2Rs) prevented TRPV4-mediated contractile dysregulation. TXA2R activation on LMCs caused an increase in mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores through Ip3 receptors which promoted store operated calcium entry and vasoconstriction. Conclusions: Clinical studies have linked cancer-related lymphedema with an increased infiltration of macrophages. While these macrophages have known anti-inflammatory and pro-lymphangiogenic roles, as well as promote tissue repair, our results point to detrimental effects to the pumping capacity of collecting lymphatic vessels mediated by activation of TRPV4 channels in macrophages. Pharmacological targeting of TRPV4 channels in LYVE1-expressing macrophages or pharmacological targeting of TXA2Rs may offer novel therapeutic strategies to improve lymphatic pumping function and lymph transport in lymphedema.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559263

We find that the inhibitory arm of this feedforward motif is implemented by astroglial purinergic signaling. Neuromodulator imaging, behavioral pharmacology, and perturbations of neurons and astroglia reveal that norepinephrine triggers astroglial release of adenosine triphosphate, extracellular conversion into adenosine, and behavioral suppression through activation of hindbrain neuronal adenosine receptors.

The virologic factors that have driven the success of the 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses, which has not been achieved by previous H5N1 clades, is unclear. We show that the 2.3.4.4b H5 haemagglutinin (HA) paired exclusively with full length (long stalk) N1 neuraminidase (NA) in birds and mammals, unlike previous clades of H5 viruses, which preferentially paired with N1 proteins with stalk deletions (short stalk). We found that the emergence of a 2.3.4.4b H5 HA with seven glycosylation sites was critical in driving its pairing with long stalk N1. The earlier H5 clades that paired with short stalk N1s showed a pattern of eight or more glycosylation sites. A prior shift in a glycosylation site from position 103 to 171 in the receptor binding domain of H5 HA and the subsequent S173A mutation that removed it triggered the emergence of 2.3.4.4b clade H5N1 viruses. Thus, the evolution of novel variations in the H5 HA and their preference for long stalk N1 pairing led to increased fitness and pathogenicity. These observations led us to establish and validate the hypothesis that the pairing of avian virus HA and NA subtypes is not stochastic but is rather molecularly programmed by HA glycosylation and NA stalk length, modulating fitness and emergence of novel avian influenza viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559263

Here, as proof of concept, we searched for viral remnants in sequence reads of Neanderthal genome data by mapping to adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus, which are double stranded DNA viruses that may establish lifelong latency and can, produce persistent infections. The reconstructed ancient viral genomes of adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus revealed conserved segments, with nucleotide identity to extant viral genomes, and variable regions in coding regions with substantial divergence to extant close relatives. Sequence reads mapped to extant viral genomes showed deamination patterns of ancient DNA and that these ancient viral genomes showed divergence consistent with the age of these samples ({approx}50,000 years) and viral evolutionary rates (10exp-5 to 10exp-8 substitutions/site/year). Analysis of random effects shows that the Neanderthal mapping to genomes of extant persistent viruses is above the expected by random similarities of short reads. Also, negative control with a nonpersistent DNA virus does not yield statistically significant assemblies. This work demonstrates the feasibility of identifying viral genome remnants in archaeological samples with signal-to-noise assessment.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559263

This response must be tightly regulated to avoid excessive responses that result in the disruption of tissue barrier integrity or inefficient responses that allow for pathogen escape. Here we examine the contribution of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling on IFN{lambda}-mediated antiviral activity. We find that extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5), a poorly characterized member of the conventional MAPK family, potentiates the antiviral efficacy of IFN{lambda}. Chemical inhibition and genetic targeting of ERK5 during IFN{lambda} treatment of cells results in a decrease in ISG induction and impaired control of viral infections. This decrease in IFN{lambda} antiviral efficacy in the absence of ERK5 kinase activity corresponded to lowered STAT1 phosphorylation, revealing a noncanonical role for ERK5 in STAT1 activation downstream of IFN{lambda}. In contrast, type I IFN antiviral signaling is largely resistant to ERK5 modulation. Altogether, we identify ERK5 as a potentiator of STAT1 activation, ISG expression, and antiviral activity following type III IFN stimulation.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559263

Here, we show that NE remodeling of synaptic function is independent from its binding on neuronal receptors. Instead, astrocytic adrenergic receptors and Ca2+ dynamics fully gate the effect of NE on synapses as the astrocyte-specific deletion of adrenergic receptors and three independent astrocyte-silencing approaches all render synapses insensitive to NE. Additionally, we find that NE suppression of synaptic strength results from an ATP-derived and adenosine A1 receptor-mediated control of presynaptic efficacy. An accompanying study from Chen et al. reveals the existence of an analogous pathway in the larval zebrafish and highlights its importance to behavioral state transitions. Together, these findings fuel a new model wherein astrocytes are a core component of neuromodulatory systems and the circuit effector through which norepinephrine produces network and behavioral adaptations, challenging an 80-year-old status quo.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559263

To validate these findings experimentally, we developed a bromine-labeled CL probe to enhance cryoEM contrast and characterize the structure of OPA1 assemblies bound to the CL-brominated lipid bilayers.

These organisms have a limited capacity to disperse across different habitats and the thermal buffer offered by freshwater systems is small. Understanding determinants and patterns of their physiological sensitivity across life history is, therefore, imperative to predicting the impacts of climate change in freshwater systems. Based on a systematic literature review including 345 experiments with 998 estimates on 96 amphibian (Anura/Caudata) and 93 freshwater fish species (Teleostei), we conducted a quantitative synthesis to explore phylogenetic, ontogenetic, and biogeographic (thermal adaptation) patterns in upper thermal tolerance (CTmax) and thermal acclimation capacity (Acclimation Response Ratio, ARR) as well as the influence of the methodology used to assess these thermal traits using a conditional inference tree analysis. We found globally consistent patterns in CTmax and ARR, with phylogeny (taxa/order), experimental methodology, climatic origin, and life stage as significant determinants of thermal traits. The analysis demonstrated that CTmax does not primarily depend on the climatic origin but on experimental acclimation temperature and duration, and life stage. Higher acclimation temperatures and longer acclimation times led to higher CTmax values, whereby Anuran larvae revealed a higher CTmax than older life stages. The ARR of freshwater fishes was more than twice that of amphibians. Differences in ARR between life stages were not significant. In addition to phylogenetic differences, we found that ARR also depended on acclimation duration, ramping rate, and adaptation to local temperature variability. However, the amount of data on early life stages is too small, methodologically inconsistent, and phylogenetically unbalanced to identify potential life cycle bottlenecks in thermal traits. We therefore propose methods to improve the robustness and comparability of CTmax/ARR data across species and life stages, which is crucial for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity under climate change.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559263

Design: Nested population-based case-control study. Setting: Comprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022). Participants: PCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1). Main outcome measures: Relative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables. Results: At the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests. Conclusions: This nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.","NA","medrxiv",1716588559263

These data support gene activation via targeting enhancers of haploinsufficient genes, as a therapeutic intervention in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559263

Forty-one EOAD individuals aged [&ge;]65 years and, as comparison, late-onset AD (LOAD, [&le;]70 years, n=154) and A{beta}-negative cognitively unimpaired controls were included. MTL subregions and biomarkers of (co-)pathologies were measured.

ResultsAD groups showed smaller MTL subregions compared to controls. Atrophy patterns were similar across AD groups, although LOAD showed thinner entorhinal cortices compared to EOAD. EOAD showed lower WMH compared to LOAD. No differences in MTL tau-PET or transactive response DNA binding protein 43-proxy positivity was found.

ConclusionsWe found in vivo evidence for MTL atrophy in amnestic EOAD and overall similar levels to LOAD of MTL tau pathology and co-pathologies.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559263

Despite diverse etiologies, patients with these disorders may share symptoms.

In this study, we aimed to explore potential common mechanisms between seven neurological disorders spanning three categories: neurodegenerative diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders, by comparing gene expression profiles and focusing on the most prominent dysregulated genes consistently reported within and across disorders. Our results demonstrate 31 genes that are commonly differentially expressed in brain cells and tissues derived from human disease models when compared to healthy controls. These genes were enriched in brain Extracellular Matrix (ECM) pathways, Growth factor binding, Response to acid chemical, and External encapsulating structure. Remarkedly, dysregulation of ECM genes was evident separately in each of the three categories of disorders. This suggests a notable distinction in the brain ECM in disease states. Furthermore, we identified that the most frequently reported genes among all disorders were GFAP, and IFITM3.

However, the diversity within each clade as a function of sex chromosome evolution is largely unknown. Here, we anchor ourselves to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, for which a well-studied mechanism of dosage compensation occurs through a specialized structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complex, and explore the diversity of dosage compensation in the surrounding phylogeny of nematodes. Through phylogenetic analysis of the C. elegans dosage compensation complex and a survey of its epigenetic signatures, including X-specific topologically associating domains (TADs) and X-enrichment of H4K20me1, we found that the condensin-mediated mechanism evolved recently in the lineage leading to Caenorhabditis through an SMC-4 duplication. Intriguingly, an independent duplication of SMC-4 and the presence of X-specific TADs in Pristionchus pacificus suggest that condensin-mediated dosage compensation arose more than once. mRNA-seq analyses of gene expression in several nematode species indicate that dosage compensation itself is ancestral, as expected from the ancient XO sex determination system. Indicative of the ancestral mechanism, H4K20me1 is enriched on the X chromosomes in Oscheius tipulae, which does not contain X-specific TADs or SMC-4 paralogs. Together, our results indicate that the dosage compensation system in C. elegans is surprisingly new, and condensin may have been co-opted repeatedly in nematodes, suggesting that the process of evolving a chromosome-wide gene regulatory mechanism for dosage compensation is constrained.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559263

Indicator species can serve as efficient tools for predicting the functional response of an ecosystem to climate change. Here I leverage the decades of citizen science data coupled with high-resolution spatiotemporal climate data to dissect the climate change response of hybridizing Setophaga warblers, indicator species of the temperate rainforest of North America. I found that breeding habitat temperature and precipitation significantly predicted the breeding occupancy of the northern species (S. townsendi) and especially strongly in the southern species (S. occidentalis). Both species showed positive climatic responses in the recent decade, when the recent breeding occupancy was greater than expected based on the historical contingency of occupancy-climate-coupling. This implies the potential climate adaptation or life history plasticity in the breeding warbler populations. However, the southern species (S. occidentalis) showed compromised climate response in 2000-10, when the predicted breeding occupancy was significantly lower than the expected contingency. I further evaluated the potential of breeding niche competition between the hybridizing warblers, reflected by their overlap of breeding occupancy. I found that the competition potential was the lowest in 2000-10 when both species were at the trough of breeding occupancy, which recovered in 2010-20. Future investigation of the physiological and behavioral mechanism underlying this climate change response could illuminate the effect of climate change on speciation and adaptation in the rainforest ecosystem.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559263

ObjectiveTo characterize the ability of non-probability online surveys to longitudinally estimate the number of COVID-19 infections in the population both in the presence and absence of institutionalized testing.

DesignInternet-based non-probability surveys were conducted, using the PureSpectrum survey vendor, approximately every 6 weeks between April 2020 and January 2023. They collected information on COVID-19 infections with representative state-level quotas applied to balance age, gender, race and ethnicity, and geographic distribution. Data from this survey were compared to institutional case counts collected by Johns Hopkins University and wastewater surveillance data for SARS-CoV-2 from Biobot Analytics.

SettingPopulation-based online non-probability survey conducted for a multi-university consortium --the Covid States Project.

ParticipantsResidents of age 18+ across 50 US states and the District of Columbia in the US.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe main outcomes are: (a) survey-weighted estimates of new monthly confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US from January 2020 to January 2023, and (b) estimates of uncounted test-confirmed cases, from February 1, 2022, to January 1, 2023. These are compared to institutionally reported COVID-19 infections and wastewater viral concentrations.

ResultsThe survey spanned 17 waves deployed from June 2020 to January 2023, with a total of 408,515 responses from 306,799 respondents with mean age 42.8 (STD 13) years; 202,416 (66%) identified as women, and 104,383 (34%) as men. A total of 16,715 (5.4%) identified as Asian, 33,234 (10.8%) as Black, 24,938 (8.1%) as Hispanic, 219,448 (71.5%) as White, and 12,464 (4.1%) as another race. Overall, 64,946 respondents (15.9%) self-reported a test-confirmed COVID-19 infection. National survey-weighted test-confirmed COVID-19 estimates were strongly correlated with institutionally reported COVID-19 infections (Pearson correlation of r=0.96; p=1.8 e-12) from April 2020 to January 2022 (50-state correlation average of r=0.88, SD = 0.073). This was before the government-led mass distribution of at-home rapid tests. Following January 2022, correlation was diminished and no longer statistically significant (r=0.55, p=0.08; 50-state correlation average of r=0.48, SD = 0.227). In contrast, survey COVID-19 estimates correlated highly with SARS-CoV-2 viral concentrations in wastewater both before (r=0.92; p=2.2e-09) and after (r=0.89; p=2.3e-04) January 2022. Institutionally reported COVID-19 cases correlated (r = 0.79, p=1.10e-05) with wastewater viral concentrations before January 2022, but poorly (r = 0.31, p=0.35) after, suggesting both survey and wastewater estimates may have better captured test-confirmed COVID-19 infections after January 2022. Consistent correlation patterns were observed at the state-level. Based on national-level survey estimates, approximately 54 million COVID-19 cases were unaccounted for in official records between January 2022 and January 2023.

Conclusions and RelevanceNon-probability survey data can be used to estimate the temporal evolution of test-confirmed infections during an emerging disease outbreak. Self-reporting tools may enable government and healthcare officials to implement accessible and affordable at-home testing for efficient infection monitoring in the future.

Trial RegistrationNA

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan non-probability survey data accurately track institutionally confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States, and provide estimates of unaccounted infections when rapid athome tests are popularized and institutionalized tests are discontinued?

FindingsThe proportion of individuals reporting a positive COVID-19 infection in a longitudinal non-probability survey closely tracked the institutionally reported proportions in the US, and nationally-aggregated wastewater SARS-CoV-2 viral concentrations, from April 2020 to February 2022. Survey estimates suggest that a high number of confirmed infections may have been unaccounted for in official records starting in February 2022, when large-scale distribution of rapid at-home tests occurred. This is further confirmed by viral concentrations in wastewater.

MeaningNon-probability online surveys can serve as an effective complementary method to monitor infections during an emerging pandemic. They provide an alternative for estimating infections in the absence of institutional testing when at-home tests are widely available. Longitudinal surveys have the potential to guide real-time decision-making in future public health crises.","NA","medrxiv",1716588559263

Here, we introduce ""InducTn-seq"", which leverages inducible mutagenesis for temporal control of transposition. InducTn-seq generates millions of transposon mutants from a single colony, enabling the sensitive detection of subtle fitness defects and transforming binary classifications of gene essentiality into a quantitative fitness measurement across both essential and non-essential genes. Using a mouse model of infectious colitis, we show that InducTn-seq bypasses a highly restrictive host bottleneck to generate a diverse transposon mutant population from the few cells that initiate infection, revealing the role of oxygen-related metabolic plasticity in pathogenesis. Overall, InducTn-seq overcomes the limitations of traditional Tn-seq, unlocking new possibilities for genome-scale forward genetic screens in bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559263

This method transforms AlphaFold2 into a diffusion model by implementing a conformation-based diffusion process and adapting the architecture to process diffused inputs effectively. To counteract the inherent conformational bias in the Protein Data Bank, we developed a novel hierarchical reweighting protocol based on structural clustering. Our evaluations demonstrate that Diffold outperforms existing methods in terms of successful sampling and structural validity. The comparisons with long time molecular dynamics show that Diffold can overcome the energy barrier existing in molecular dynamics simulations and perform more efficient sampling. Furthermore, We showcase Diffolds utility in drug discovery through its application in neural protein-ligand docking. In a blind test, it accurately predicted a novel protein-ligand complex, underscoring its potential to impact real-world biological research. Additionally, we present other modes of sampling using Diffold, including partial sampling with fixed motif, langevin dynamics and structural interpolation.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559263

Indexes based on k-mers and de Bruijn graphs are limited to answering questions at a specific substring length k. We present Maximal Exact Match Ordered (MEMO), a pangenome indexing method based on maximal exact matches (MEMs) between sequences. A single MEMO index can handle arbitrary-length queries over pangenomic windows. MEMO enables both queries that test k-mer presence/absence (membership queries) and that count the number of genomes containing k-mers in a window (conservation queries). MEMOs index for a pangenome of 89 human autosomal haplotypes fits in 2.04 GB, 8.8x smaller than a comparable KMC3 index and 11.4x smaller than a PanKmer index. MEMO indexes can be made smaller by sacrificing some counting resolution, with our decile-resolution HPRC index reaching 0.67 GB. MEMO can conduct a conservation query for 31-mers over the human leukocyte antigen locus in 13.89 seconds, 2.5x faster than other approaches.

Combining these data with 67 previously published phylogenetic trees, we find that the highly variable structures of preleukemic trees emerge naturally from a simple model of somatic evolution in which there is pervasive positive selection acting throughout the disease trajectory. We infer that selective advantages of preleukemic clones are typically in the range of 9%-24% per year, but vary considerably between individuals. At these level of positive selection, we show that the identification of early multiple-mutant clones identifies individuals at risk of future AML.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

Unlike log-based specific metabolic rates (sMRs), the distribution of cellular MRs (cMRs) can be matched to relevant traits like body temperature and the number of microRNA families (mirFam). We demonstrate that the mirFam-based cMRs of the four most thermogenic organs (kidney, heart, liver and brain) form a core with a joint cMR that scales as M0.52, as predicted by a biophysical model of thermoregulation. Across Euarchontoglires, the evolution of the core organs is not independent: while organ sizes depend on body size, organ cMRs depend on the core cMR. Consequently, brain and liver cMRs are strictly anti-correlated, echoing the expensive tissue hypothesis. We propose a positive feedback relationship between larger brain size and greater reliability of the energy supply, on the one hand, and decreasing reliance on liver gluconeogenesis on the other. The corresponding logistic model accounts for size adaptation to a low-energy regime among the smallest primates and, among the primates with the largest brains, thermoregulatory adaptation to the physiological limit on the rate of heat dissipation.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

MethodsWe analyzed Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort data (n=2,296; 46% male; baseline age M=62, SD=9, range=25-101y). We measured cognitive decline across two decades of neuropsychological-testing follow-up. We measured pace of aging using the DunedinPACE epigenetic clock. Analysis tested if participants with faster DunedinPACE values experienced more rapid preclinical cognitive decline as compared to those with slower DunedinPACE values.

ResultsParticipants with faster DunedinPACE had poorer cognitive functioning at baseline and experienced more rapid cognitive decline over follow-up. Results were robust to confounders and consistent across population strata. Findings were similar for the PhenoAge and GrimAge epigenetic clocks.

DiscussionFaster pace of aging is a risk factor for preclinical cognitive decline. Metrics of biological aging may inform risk stratification in clinical trials and prognosis in patient care.","NA","medrxiv",1716588559264

This suggests that, despite their diversity, ARDs could potentially share common biological processes deeply rooted in the mechanisms of ageing, presenting opportunities for unified therapeutic strategies. Using a network approach, we analysed gene proximity to 52 ARDs from the UK Biobank, integrating with protein-protein interaction (PPI), gene coexpression, KEGG pathways, and ageing-related genes. Interestingly, while most ageing-related genes did not associate with ARDs, they were closer to multiple ARDs than random genes. This was mainly due to indirect connections to diverse Communities of ARDs (ARCs), what we call iARC-Interactors, implying indirect association to multiple ARDs through interaction with ARD-related genes, primarily via PPI and KEGG. Genes that are associated with multiple ARCs, i.e., Pleiotropic genes, were predominantly related to immunological disorders. We found a polarizing effect. When compared to multiple ageing- and disease-related genes, high Pleiotropic genes showed the highest tissue specificity and lowest coexpression with themselves and other diseases. In contrast, high iARC-interactive genes (as those of ageing) significantly displayed the exact opposite effects, suggesting two mechanisms for genes to affect multiple ARDs, one operating through modulatory genes that simultaneously affect numerous tissues and processes; and another rather specialised, affecting single tissues that are widespread across the body, as potentially occurring in autoimmune diseases. Lastly, we used Machine Learning (ML) to predict potentially novel ageing-related genes based on each network's iARC-Interactions and genes' proximity to ARDs. PPI and KEGG showed the best performance with their top candidate genes enriched for regulation of protein metabolic process, protein stabilization, positive regulation of developmental process, and cellular response to chemical stimulus. This work paints a deeper picture of the multiple types of interactions between ageing-related processes and ARDs.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

In this study, we used optogenetic-fMRI in rats to investigate the impact of LC stimulation on the global signal and three primary spatiotemporal patterns. We report small, spatially specific changes in global signal distribution as a result of tonic LC stimulation, as well as regional changes in spatiotemporal patterns of activity at 5 Hz tonic and 15 Hz phasic stimulation. We also found that LC stimulation had little to no effect on the spatiotemporal patterns detected by complex principal component analysis. These results show that the effects of LC activity on the BOLD signal in rats may be small and regionally concentrated, as opposed to widespread and globally acting.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

FEF-TMS without sensory input led to a top-down controlled occipital phase-realignment, alongside higher fronto-occipital phase-connectivity, in the alpha/beta-band. Sensory input in the absence of FEF-TMS increased occipital gamma activity. Crucially, testing the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes (FEF-TMS during sensory input) revealed an increased nesting of the bottom-up gamma activity in the alpha/beta-band cycles.

Addressing these limitations, we describe reCRAC (reverse CRAC), a novel adaptation of the CRAC (crosslinking and analysis of cDNA) technique, optimized for yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Like CRAC, reCRAC applies tandem affinity purification to yield highly enriched protein preparations. However, reCRAC is redesigned to work with unstable proteins. This is achieved by lysing the cells directly into highly denaturing buffer conditions, followed by stringent purification steps. The reCRAC method was successfully applied to the easily degraded yeast protein Pin4, allowing identification of precise binding sites at base-pair resolution with greatly reduced target protein degradation and improved signal-to-noise ratios.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

Correspondingly, C. elegans has evolved an ability to discern between nutritive and infectious bacterial food sources. Here we show that C. elegans can learn to avoid the pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens 15 (PF15), and that this learned avoidance behavior is passed on to progeny for four generations, as we previously demonstrated for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) and Pseudomonas vranovensis, using similar mechanisms, including the involvement of both the TGF-{beta} ligand DAF-7 and Cer1 retrotransposon-encoded virus-like particles. PF15 small RNAs are both necessary and sufficient to induce this transgenerational avoidance behavior. Unlike PA14 or P. vranovensis, PF15 does not use P11, Pv1, or a small RNA with maco-1 homology for this avoidance; instead, an unrelated PF15 small RNA, Pfs1, that targets the C. elegans vab-1 Ephrin receptor gene is necessary and sufficient for learned avoidance, suggesting the evolution of yet another bacterial sRNA/C. elegans gene target pair involved in transgenerational inheritance of pathogen avoidance. As VAB-2 Ephrin receptor ligand and MACO-1 knockdown also induce PF15 avoidance, we have begun to understand the genetic pathway involved in small RNA targeted pathogenic avoidance. Moreover, these data show that axon guidance pathway genes (VAB-1 and VAB-2) have previously unknown adult roles in regulating neuronal function. C. elegans may have evolved multiple bacterial specificity-encoded small RNA-dependent mechanisms to avoid different pathogenic bacteria species, thereby providing progeny with a survival advantage in a dynamic environment.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

While attentional re-orienting is well characterized for external attention, whether and how humans re-orient their attention in mind following expected and unexpected working-memory tests remains elusive. Here, we developed a visual working-memory task in which we varied the reliability of retrocues such that ensuing memory tests called upon memory content that was certain, expected, or unexpected to be tested. We leveraged spatial modulations in EEG-alpha activity and eye-movements to track orienting and re-orienting within the spatial layout of visual working memory following central retrocues and memory tests. Both markers reliably tracked orienting of attention following retrocues and scaled with cue reliability. In addition, we unveil a second stage of attentional deployment following memory tests. When tests were expected (but not certain), attentional deployment was not contingent on prior orienting, suggesting an additional verification (double checking) in memory. When memory tests were unexpected, re-focusing of alternative memory content was prolonged. These findings bring attentional re-orienting to the domain of working memory and underscore the relevance of studying attentional dynamics in memory not only following cues, but also following ensuing memory tests that can invoke a revision or verification of our internal focus.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

Viruses detected from national surveillance and disease investigations between 2020-2022 revealed 27 genomes, 24 of which have at least one segment more closely related to Eurasian or North American avian influenza lineages than those already circulating in Australia. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that H4 viruses circulating in shorebirds represent a recent incursion from Asia that is distinct from those circulating concurrently in Australian waterfowl. Analysis of the internal segments further demonstrates exclusive, persistent circulation in shorebirds. This contrasts with H10, where a novel lineage has emerged in wild waterfowl, poultry and captive birds across Australia, and has likely replaced previously circulating H10 lineages through competitive exclusion.

Methods: We analyzed the Associated Press ""Lethal Restraint"" national dataset (United States, 2012-2021; N = 1,036), which included deaths following police use of non-firearm force. Our primary outcomes included whether the death investigator: (1) classified manner of death as a homicide, (2) mentioned a force-related injury/condition in the cause-of-death statement, and (3) mentioned any force. Inverse-probability-weighted logistic models estimated the association of these outcomes with death-investigator jurisdiction type, local political composition (quartile of Republican Party vote %), decedent race/ethnicity, and each agency's prior classifications. Findings: We removed 96 deaths based on exclusion criteria.

In contrast, 73.9% of statements mentioned drugs. Unadjusted results showed homicide classification increased from 25.0% in 2012-2014 to 32.2% in 2018-2021. Models estimating adjusted prevalence differences (aPD) showed that, compared to medical examiner jurisdictions, coroners (aPD: -0.19; 95% CI: -0.31, -0.06) and sheriff-coroners (a PD: -0.17; 95% CI: -0.28, -0.05) were less likely to classify deaths as homicides. Model results also showed that classifications for incidents occurring in the least-Republican counties were most likely to reflect force across all three manner and cause outcomes. Interpretation: Non-homicide classifications and cause-of-death statements making no mention of force were widespread for US in-custody deaths. We identified novel evidence suggesting coroner and sheriff-coroner jurisdictions were especially unlikely to categorize in-custody deaths as homicides, and that incidents occurring in highly Republican counties were least likely to reflect force in the cause or manner of death.

To achieve these for diploid and even polyploid genomes, the contemporary approach involves at least two long-read sequencing technologies: high-accuracy HiFi or Duplex nanopore long reads and ultra-long noisy nanopore reads. Using two different technologies increases the cost and the required amount of genomic DNA. Here, we show that comparable results are possible using error correction of nanopore Simplex ultra-long reads and then assembling them using existing state-of-the-art de novo assembly methods. We have developed the HERRO model based on deep learning, which corrects Simplex nanopore reads longer than 10kbp and with a quality value higher than 10. Taking into account informative positions that vary between haplotypes or segments in duplications, HERRO achieves an increase of accuracy of up to 100-fold. Combing HERRO with Verkko assembler, we achieve high contiguity on human genomes by reconstructing many chromosomes telomere-to-telomere, including chromosomes X and Y. We show that HERRO generalises well to other species and it supports both R9.4.1. and R10.4.1 nanopore Simplex reads.

Within spatial biology, spatial transcriptomics platforms are among the most advanced, allowing researchers to characterize the expression of thousands of genes across space. These new technologies are transforming our understanding of how cells are organized in space and communicate with each other to determine emergent phenotypes with unprecedented granularity. This is particularly important in cancer research, as it is becoming evident that tumor evolution is shaped not only by the genetic properties of cancer cells but also by how they interact with the tumor microenvironment and their spatial organization. While many platforms can generate spatial transcriptomics profiles, it is still unclear in which context each platform better suits the needs of its users. Here we compare the results obtained using 4 different spatial transcriptomics (VISIUM, VISIUM CytAssist, Xenium and CosMx) and one spatial proteomics (VISIUM CytAssist) platforms across serial sections of 6 FFPE samples from primary human tumors covering some of the most common forms of the disease (lung, breast, colorectal, bladder, lymphoma and ovary). We observed that the VISIUM platform with CytAssist chemistry yielded superior data quality. Xenium consistently produced more reliable results for in situ platforms, with better gene clustering and fewer false positives than CosMx. Interestingly, these platform-based variations didnt significantly affect cell type identification. Finally, by comparing VISIUM protein profiles with the spatial transcriptomics data from all four platforms on each sample, we identified several genes with mismatched RNA and protein expression patterns, highlighting the importance of multi-omics profiling to reveal the true biology of human tumors.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

These neurological symptoms frequently persist for months (post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 or PASC). The molecular origins of neuro-COVID and how it contributes to PASC are unknown, however a growing body of research highlights that the self-assembly of protein fragments from SARS-CoV-2 into amyloid nanofibrils may play a causative role. Previously, we identified two fragments from the proteins Open Reading Frame 6 (ORF6) and ORF10 that self-assemble into neurotoxic amyloid assemblies. Here we further our understanding of the self-assembly mechanisms and nano-architectures formed by these fragments as well as performing a more in-depth study of the biological responses of co-cultured neurons. By solubilising the peptides in a fluorinated solvent we eliminate insoluble aggregates in the starting materials (seeds) that change the polymorphic landscape of the assemblies. The resultant assemblies are dominated by structures with higher free energies (e.g. ribbons and amorphous aggregates) that are less toxic to cultured neurons. We also show the first direct evidence of cellular uptake by viral amyloids. This work highlights the importance of understanding the polymorphic behaviour of amyloids particularly in the context of neuro-COVID and PASC.

Graphical Abstract for ToCThe neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are likely to be, in part, caused by the aggregation of viral proteins into neurotoxic amyloid nanofibrils. Changes in aggregation conditions alters the balance of fibril structures formed (polymorphism), influencing their toxicity to a neuronal cell line. These findings increase our understanding of viral amyloids and highlight the importance of careful choice of experimental protocol when studying these systems.

Here we report that a nitrogenase-like enzyme (NFL) and a radical SAM enzyme (RSE) are involved in the novel anaerobic assimilation pathway of a sulfonate, isethionate, in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus. The nflHDK genes for NFL are localized at a locus containing genes for known sulfonate metabolism in the genome. A gene nflB encoding an RSE is present just upstream of nflH, forming a small gene cluster nflBHDK. Mutants lacking any nflBHDK genes lost the ability to grow with isethionate as the sole sulfur source under anaerobic photosynthetic conditions, indicating that all four NflBHDK proteins are essential for the isethionate assimilation pathway. Heterologous expression of the islAB genes encoding a known isethionate lyase that degrades isethionate to sulfite and acetaldehyde restored the isethionate-dependent growth of a mutant lacking nflDK, indicating that the enzyme encoding nflBHDK is involved in an isethionate assimilation reaction to release sulfite. Furthermore, heterologous expression of nflBHDK and ssuCAB encoding an isethionate transporter in the closely related species R. sphaeroides, which does not have nflBHDK and cannot grow with isethionate as the sole sulfur source, conferred isethionate-dependent growth ability to this species. We propose to rename nflBHDK as isrBHDK (isethionate reductase). The isrBHDK genes are widely distributed among various prokaryote phyla. Discovery of the isethionate assimilation pathway by IsrBHDK provides a missing piece for the anaerobic sulfur cycle and for understanding the evolution of ancient sulfur metabolism.

ImportanceNitrogenase is an important enzyme found in prokaryotes that reduces atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia and plays a fundamental role in the global nitrogen cycle. It has been noted that nitrogenase-like enzymes (NFLs), which share an evolutionary origin with nitrogenase, have evolved to catalyze diverse reactions such as chlorophyll biosynthesis (photosynthesis), coenzyme F430 biosynthesis (methanogenesis), and methionine biosynthesis. In this study, we discovered that an NFL with unknown function in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus is a novel isethionate reductase (Isr), which catalyzes the assimilatory degradation of isethionate, a sulfonate, releasing sulfite used as the sulfur source under anaerobic conditions. Isr is widely distributed among various bacterial phyla, including intestinal bacteria, and is presumed to play an important role in sulfur metabolism in anaerobic environments such as animal guts and microbial mats. This finding provides a clue for understanding ancient metabolism that evolved under anaerobic environments at the dawn of life.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

The recurrent evolution of this adaptation is achieved through changes in the expression and localisation of several enzymes and transporters that are conventionally used in non-photosynthetic metabolism. These alterations result in the establishment of a biochemical CO2 pump that increases the concentration of CO2 around rubisco in a cellular environment where rubisco is protected from oxygen thus preventing the occurrence of photorespiration. A key step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis is the change in subcellular localisation of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity from the mesophyll cell chloroplast to the cytosol, where it catalyzes the first biochemical step of the C4 pathway. Here, we achieve this key step in C4 evolution in the C3 plant Oryza sativa (rice) using genome editing. We show that editing the chloroplast transit peptide of the primary CA isoform in the leaf results in relocalisation of leaf CA activity from the chloroplast to the cytosol. Through analysis of fluorescence induction kinetics in these CA relocalisation lines we uncover a role a new role for chloroplast CA in photosynthetic induction. We also reveal that relocalisation of CA activity to the cytosol causes no detectable perturbation to plant growth or leaf-level CO2 assimilation. Collectively, this work uncovers a novel role for chloroplast CA in C3 plants, and demonstrates that it is possible to achieve a key step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis by genome editing.

Significance statementC4 photosynthesis is a highly efficient adaptation to photosynthesis that fuels the worlds most productive crop plants. It evolved from conventional C3 photosynthesis through a series of changes in leaf biochemistry and anatomy. Here we achieve a key evolutionary step on the path to C4 photosynthesis in rice using genome editing. Specifically, we alter the primary location of carbonic anhydrase activity in the rice leaf from the chloroplast to the cytosol. In doing so, we uncover a novel role for carbonic anhydrase in facilitating the rapid induction kinetics of photosystem II, and initiate a new era of C4 engineering using precision breeding techniques.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

Even though it is well-established that the complex interplay between different cell types determines the overall healing response after MI, the precise changes in the tissue architecture are still poorly understood. Here we generated an integrative cellular map of the acute phase after murine MI using a combination of imaging-based transcriptomics (Molecular Cartography) and antibody-based highly multiplexed imaging (Sequential Immunofluorescence), which enabled us to evaluate cell-type compositions and changes at subcellular resolution over time. One striking finding of these analyses was the identification of a novel mode of leukocyte accumulation to the infarcted heart via the endocardium - the inner layer of the heart. To investigate the underlying mechanisms driving this previously unknown infiltration route, we performed unbiased spatial proteomic analysis using Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP). When comparing endocardial cells of homeostatic hearts and infarcted hearts, DVP identified von Willebrand Factor (vWF) as an upregulated mediator of inflammation 24 hours post-MI. To further explore the immune mediating capabilities of vWF and its effect on tissue repair, we performed functional blocking of vWF during acute murine MI. This resulted in a reduced amount of infiltration by CCR2+ monocytes and worse cardiac function post-MI. Our study provides the first spatial map of acute murine MI with subcellular resolution and subsequently discovers a novel route of immune infiltration. Furthermore, we identified vWF as a critical immune mediating agent for endocardial immune cell infiltration.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

To understand the origin and evolution of these new structures, it is essential to investigate which are the genes and gene regulatory networks participating during the embryonic development of insects. Great efforts have been made to fully understand, from a gene expression and gene regulation point of view, the development of holometabolous insects, in particular Drosophila melanogaster, with the generation of numerous functional genomics resources and databases. Conversely, how hemimetabolous insects develop, and which are the dynamics of gene expression and gene regulation that control their embryogenesis, are still poorly characterized. Therefore, to provide a new platform to study gene regulation in insects, we generated ATAC-seq (Assay for transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) for the first time during the development of the mayfly Cloeon dipterum. This new available resource will allow to better understand the dynamics of gene regulation during hemimetabolan embryogenesis, since C. dipterum belongs to the paleopteran order of Ephemeroptera, the sister group to all other winged insects. These new datasets include six different time points of its embryonic development and identify accessible chromatin regions corresponding to both general and stage-specific promoters and enhancers. With these comprehensive datasets, we characterised pronounced changes in accessible chromatin between stages 8 and 10 of embryonic development, which correspond to the transition from the last stages of segmentation to organogenesis and appendage differentiation. The application of ATAC-seq in mayflies has contributed to identify the epigenetic mechanisms responsible for embryonic development in hemimetabolous insects and it will provide a fundamental resource to understand the evolution of gene regulation in winged insects.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

Combination treatment of both K-Ras inhibitor-resistant cell lines and multidrug resistant patient-derived organoids resulted in superior anti-cancer activity compared to single agent treatment, while sparing hiPSC-derived neurons.

To understand why these cycles occur, much work has been done to model the genomic consequences and evolutionary significance of WGD. Since the machinations of diploidization are strongly influenced by the mode of speciation (whether a lineage was derived from ancient allo or autopolyploid), methods which can classify ancient whole genome duplication events as allo or auto are of great importance. Here we present a forward-time polyploid genome evolution simulator called SpecKS. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate that allo and autopolyploid-derived species exhibit differently shaped Ks histograms. We also demonstrate sensitivity of the Ks histogram to the effective population size (Ne) of the ancestral species. Our findings indicate that error in the common method of estimating WGD time from the Ks histogram peak scales with the degree of allopolyploidy, and we present an alternative, accurate estimation method that is independent of the degree of allopolyploidy. Lastly, we use SpecKS results to derive tests that reveal whether a genome is descended from allo or autopolyploidy, and whether the ancestral species had a high or low Ne. We apply this test to transcriptomic data for over 200 species across the plant kingdom, validating the theory that the majority of angiosperm lineages are derived from allopolyploidization events.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

It has been hypothesized that the glycocalyx mediates leukocyte migration by masking adhesion molecules and reducing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Leukocyte recruitment is a key driver of inflammatory diseases, including the chronic skin disease, psoriasis. Here, we show that leukocytes express heparan sulfate, an important glycocalyx component, on their cell surface which is lost in response to psoriasis-like skin inflammation, whilst endothelial heparan sulfate expression is not affected. Treatment with a heparan sulfate mimetic during psoriasis-like skin inflammation protected heparan sulfate from cleavage by heparanase and resulted in reduced leukocyte accumulation in skin, yet unexpectedly, led to increased clinical signs of inflammation due to reduced Treg numbers. These findings change our understanding of immune cell recruitment by demonstrating the presence and function of a heparan sulfate glycocalyx on immune cells and urge caution on the use of heparanase inhibitors as therapies for inflammatory diseases.

It is uncontroversial because the cessation of gene flow during allopatry will allow reproductive isolation to readily emerge as a by-product of evolutionary divergence. However, whether allopatric speciation is common has rarely been systematically tested across a continuum of closely-related species. Here, we fit a range of demographic models of evolutionary divergence to whole-genome sequence data from 93 pairs of Drosophila species to infer speciation histories and levels of post-divergence gene flow. We find that speciation with gene flow is common, even between currently allopatric pairs of species. Estimates of historical gene flow are not predicted by current range overlap, nor is there convincing support that secondary contact commonly leads to the cessation of gene flow as predicted by models of reinforcement. Instead, our analyses suggest that most speciation processes involve some long-term gene flow perhaps due to repeated cycles of allopatry and contact, without requiring an extensive allopatric phase.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

It has been hypothesized that host organisms have expanded the Kruppel-associated box-containing zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs), which epigenetically suppress TEs, to counteract disorderly TE transpositions. This process is referred to as the evolutionary arms race. However, the extent to which this evolutionary arms race occurred across various TE families remains unclear. In the present study, we systematically explored the evolutionary arms race between TE families and KRAB-ZFPs using public ChIP-seq data. We discovered and characterized new instances of evolutionary arms races with KRAB-ZFPs in endogenous retroviruses. Furthermore, we found that the regulatory landscape shaped by this arms race contributed to the gene regulatory network. In summary, our results provide insight into the impact of the evolutionary arms race on TE families, the KRAB-ZFP family, and host gene regulatory networks.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

While cancer is a disease of dysregulated proliferation, cancer cells can retain the ability to enter quiescence which confers advantages to tumour cells by protecting them from chemotherapy or by allowing metastasis to distant sites. Multiple mechanisms exist to induce and maintain quiescence that are not yet fully understood. Here, we show that high expression of the CDK inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf1 correlates with a poor prognosis in TP53 wild-type, but not TP53 mutant, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Using quantitative single-cell imaging of genetically-engineered NSCLC reporter cell lines, we show that TP53 wild-type NSCLC cells can enter a p21-dependent spontaneous quiescent state, downstream of replication stress. Furthermore, p21 expression confers survival advantages to TP53 wild-type NSCLC cells, both under normal proliferation and in response to chemotherapy. We also show that p21 can promote tumour relapse by allowing cells to recover from both G1 and G2 arrest states after drug removal. Together, our data suggest that targeting p21 function in TP53 wild-type tumours could lead to better outcomes for chemotherapy treatment in NSCLC patients.

Statement of SignificanceWe show that TP53WT Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer cells can enter a p21-dependent spontaneous quiescent state and that p21 maintains the viability of NSCLC cells, is chemoprotective and can promote tumour relapse.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

This array utilizes extensive data from previous Infinium platform-based epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). It incorporates knowledge from the latest single-cell and cell type-resolution whole genome methylome profiles. The MSA is engineered to achieve scalable screening of epigenetics-trait association in an ultra-high sample throughput. Our design encompassed diverse human trait associations, including those with genetic, cellular, environmental, and demographical variables and human diseases such as genetic, neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, infectious, and immune diseases. We comprehensively evaluated this arrays reproducibility, accuracy, and capacity for cell-type deconvolution and supporting 5-hydroxymethylation profiling in diverse human tissues.

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

While much progress has been made on predicting which missense variants may cause disease, our ability to predict the underlying molecular mechanisms remain limited. One common mechanism is that missense variants cause protein destabilization resulting in lowered protein abundance and loss of function, while other variants directly disrupt key interactions with other molecules. We have here leveraged machine learning models for protein sequence and structure to disentangle effects on protein function and abundance, and applied our resulting model to all missense variants in the human proteome. We find that approximately half of all missense variants that lead to loss of function and disease do so because they disrupt protein stability. We have predicted functionally important positions in all human proteins, and find that they cluster on protein structures and are often found on the protein surface. Our work provides a resource for interpreting both predicted and experimental variant effects across the human proteome, and a mechanistic starting point for developing therapies towards genetic diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

However, unintended bystander editing beyond the target nucleotide poses a challenge to their translation into effective therapies. While many efforts have been made in the design of a universal enzyme with minimal bystander editing, the context dependent activity represents a major challenge for base editing-based therapies. In this work, we designed a sequence-specific guide RNA library with 3-extensions and detected guides that were able to reduce bystander and increase editing efficiency in a context dependent manner. The best candidate was later used for phage assisted non-continuous evolution to find a new generation of precise base editors. Simultaneously, we use protein language models trained on massive protein sequence datasets to find the evolutionarily plausible mutational patterns that can improve deaminase activity and precision. Both strategies provide a collection of precise TadA variants that not only drastically reduced bystander edits, but also was not in detriment of on-target activity. Our findings introduce a guide/enzyme parallel engineering pipeline, which lays the foundation for the development of new personalized genome editing strategies, ultimately enhancing the safety and precision of this groundbreaking technology.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

Here, we report the development of the ""tagless LysoIP method"" to enable rapid enrichment of lysosomes, via immunoprecipitation, using the endogenous integral lysosomal membrane protein TMEM192, directly from clinical samples and human cell lines (e.g. induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSCs) derived neurons). Isolated lysosomes are intact and suitable for subsequent multimodal omics analyses. To validate our approach, we employed the tagless LysoIP to enrich lysosomes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from fresh blood from patients with CLN3 disease, a neurodegenerative LSD. Metabolic profiling of isolated lysosomes showed massive accumulation of glycerophosphodiesters (GPDs) in patients lysosomes. Interestingly, a patient with a milder phenotype and genotype displayed lower accumulation of lysosomal GPDs, consistent with their potential role as disease biomarkers. Altogether, the tagless LysoIP provides a framework to study native lysosomes from patient samples, identify novel biomarkers and discover human-relevant disease mechanisms.

Recently, the emergence and dominance of the JN.1 lineage over XBB variants have prompted a reevaluation of current vaccine strategies.

In this study, we compared the humoral immunogenicity of XBB and JN.1 lineage infections in human subjects with diverse immune histories to understand the antigenic and immunogenic distinctions between these variants. Similar to observations in naive mice, priming with XBB and JN.1 in humans without prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure results in distinct NAb responses, exhibiting minimal cross-reactivity. Importantly, breakthrough infections (BTI) with the JN.1 lineage induce 5.9-fold higher neutralization titers against JN.1 compared to those induced by XBB BTI.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway.

While RdRp is the target of several viral inhibitors, the active site has several pitfalls when translating in vitro inhibitors to the clinic. The highly polar residues within the active site often necessitate the use of highly polar or charged compounds, especially when designing nucleoside analog inhibitors, posing significant challenges in optimizing drug-likeness and membrane permeability for clinical efficacy. Here, we investigated the broad-spectrum potential of the allosteric Thumb-1 cryptic site of the RdRp, which to date has only been adequately studied in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). To explore this potential antiviral target, we used a suite of bioinformatics techniques, including homology modeling and multiple sequence alignments, to reveal the conserved landscape of the Thumb-1 site across +ssRNA viruses. We then used ChemPrint, our Mol-GDL (Molecular-Geometric Deep Learning) machine learning model to predict drug inhibition of the Thumb-1 site in RdRp across +ssRNA viruses. Here, we identify MDL-001 as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate with favorable properties that enable oral and once-a-day dosing. We also show how the cryptic nature of the Thumb-1 site masks itself to conventional virtual screening techniques, like docking, where activity prediction is heavily based on solving or predicting an accurate structure of the open pocket. This study demonstrates the utility of this approach in drug discovery for broad-spectrum antivirals that target the Thumb-1 site.

Lay SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThis paper addresses the challenge of developing broad-spectrum antivirals against +ssRNA viruses, which include pathogens like HCV and SARS-CoV-2. The highly conserved RdRp Thumb-1 site across these viruses is identified as a potential target for broad spectrum antiviral drugs, which would be vital tools in prophylactic and therapeutic responses to future viral threats.

MethodologyUtilizing bioinformatics and deep learning (through our proprietary AI platform called GALILEO), the study maps the conserved landscape of the RdRp Thumb-1 site across a range of human pathogenic +ssRNA viruses and screens for potential inhibitory compounds.

Key DiscoveriesMDL-001 emerges as a potential broad-spectrum non-nucleoside antiviral drug candidate and the RdRp Thumb-1 site exists as a family of targets, many of which may be targetable by a single drug.

Impact and ImplicationsThe discovery that the Thumb-1 site of RdRp can be targeted by small molecules for antiviral activity against a range of +ssRNA viruses.

Preterm birth was the most frequently reported pregnancy-specific AE, followed by preterm premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, cervical dilatation, and hemorrhage during pregnancy. The median time from immunization to reported preterm birth was 3 days, with two-thirds of cases within a week. Disproportionality analysis indicated a significant signal for various AEs, particularly highlighting preterm birth with an IC of 2.18 (95%CI, 1.54-2.63), suggesting that reports of preterm birth associated with RSVPreF vaccination occurred more frequently than statistically expected.

ConclusionsWhile reported AEs were generally consistent with the safety profile observed in prelicensure studies, this study highlights ongoing concern about preterm birth among pregnant individuals following RSVPreF vaccination. Comprehensive longitudinal follow-up, including prospective pregnancy registries and infant follow-up studies is urgently required.","NA","medrxiv",1716588559264

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

FundingNational Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2701800 and 2022YFC2304700), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82202567 and 32270003), Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2022278), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (23QA1410500), and Shanghai municipal three-year action plan for strengthening the construction of the public health system (2023-2025) GWVI-2.1.2.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1716588559264

Here, we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), a genome editing system that combines the programmability and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 with the RNA-mediated gene insertion capabilities of the human LINE1 (L1) element. CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1716588559264

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

With no current treatments or reliable diagnostic markers, there is an urgent need to define the molecular underpinnings of these conditions. By studying bioenergetic characteristics of peripheral blood lymphocytes in over 16 healthy controls, 15 ME/CFS, and 15 LC, we find both ME/CFS and LC donors exhibit signs of elevated oxidative stress, relative to healthy controls, especially in the memory subset. Using a combination of flow cytometry, bulk RNA-seq analysis, mass spectrometry, and systems chemistry analysis, we also observed aberrations in ROS clearance pathways including elevated glutathione levels, decreases in mitochondrial superoxide dismutase levels, and glutathione peroxidase 4 mediated lipid oxidative damage. Critically, these changes in redox pathways show striking sex-specific trends. While females diagnosed with ME/CFS exhibit higher total ROS and mitochondrial calcium levels, males with an ME/CFS diagnosis have normal ROS levels, but larger changes in lipid oxidative damage. Further analyses show that higher ROS levels correlates with hyperproliferation of T cells in females, consistent with the known role of elevated ROS levels in the initiation of proliferation. This hyperproliferation of T cells can be attenuated by metformin, suggesting this FDA-approved drug as a possible treatment, as also suggested by a recent clinical study of LC patients. Thus, we report that both ME/CFS and LC are mechanistically related and could be diagnosed with quantitative blood cell measurements. We also suggest that effective, patient tailored drugs might be discovered using standard lymphocyte stimulation assays.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

Recent research has highlighted the therapeutic potential of psychoactive substances and especially 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), in alleviating trauma symptoms in chronic patients. However, little is known regarding the consequences of trauma that is acutely experienced under the influence of psychoactive substances. Here we investigated the acute experiences and peritraumatic processing of 657 survivors from the high-casualty terror attack at the Supernova music festival in Israel on October 7th, 2023. Data were collected four to twelve weeks following the TE. Approximately two-thirds of survivors were under the influence of psychoactive substances at the time of the TE, offering a tragic and unique natural experiment on the impact of psychoactive compounds on TE processing. Our findings reveal that individuals who experienced the trauma while under the influence of MDMA demonstrated significantly improved intermediate outcomes compared to those who were under the influence of other substances or no substances at all. Specifically, the MDMA group reported increased feelings of social support, more social interactions and enhanced quality of sleep during the peritraumatic period, yielding reduced levels of mental distress and reduced PTSD symptom severity. These novel findings suggest that the influence of MDMA during the TE may carry protective effects into the peritraumatic period, possibly mediated through the known effects of MDMA in reducing negative emotions and elevating prosociality. These protective effects in turn may mitigate the development of early psychopathology-related symptoms. Current preliminary results underscore the need for further understanding of the cognitive and physiological processes by which psychedelic substances intersect with trauma recovery processes.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

To localize the ancestral and geographical origins of the Yamnaya among the diverse Eneolithic people that preceded them, we studied ancient DNA data from 428 individuals of which 299 are reported for the first time, demonstrating three previously unknown Eneolithic genetic clines. First, a ""Caucasus-Lower Volga"" (CLV) Cline suffused with Caucasus hunter-gatherer (CHG) ancestry extended between a Caucasus Neolithic southern end in Neolithic Armenia, and a steppe northern end in Berezhnovka in the Lower Volga. Bidirectional gene flow across the CLV cline created admixed intermediate populations in both the north Caucasus, such as the Maikop people, and on the steppe, such as those at the site of Remontnoye north of the Manych depression. CLV people also helped form two major riverine clines by admixing with distinct groups of European hunter-gatherers. A ""Volga Cline"" was formed as Lower Volga people mixed with upriver populations that had more Eastern hunter-gatherer (EHG) ancestry, creating genetically hyper-variable populations as at Khvalynsk in the Middle Volga. A ""Dnipro Cline"" was formed as CLV people bearing both Caucasus Neolithic and Lower Volga ancestry moved west and acquired Ukraine Neolithic hunter-gatherer (UNHG) ancestry to establish the population of the Serednii Stih culture from which the direct ancestors of the Yamnaya themselves were formed around 4000BCE. This population grew rapidly after 3750-3350BCE, precipitating the expansion of people of the Yamnaya culture who totally displaced previous groups on the Volga and further east, while admixing with more sedentary groups in the west. CLV cline people with Lower Volga ancestry contributed four fifths of the ancestry of the Yamnaya, but also, entering Anatolia from the east, contributed at least a tenth of the ancestry of Bronze Age Central Anatolians, where the Hittite language, related to the Indo-European languages spread by the Yamnaya, was spoken. We thus propose that the final unity of the speakers of the ""Proto-Indo-Anatolian"" ancestral language of both Anatolian and Indo-European languages can be traced to CLV cline people sometime between 4400-4000 BCE.

Stress-induced exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following translational shutoff is thought to cause condensation by allowing new multivalent RNA-dependent interactions, with RNA length and associated interaction capacity driving increased condensation. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNA species condense in response to multiple unrelated stresses in budding yeast, length plays a minor role, and instead, stress-induced transcripts are preferentially excluded from condensates, enabling their selective translation. Using both endogenous genes and reporter constructs, we show that translation initiation blockade, rather than resulting ribosome-free RNA, causes condensation. These translation initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are biochemically detectable even when stress granules, defined as microscopically visible foci, are absent or blocked. TIICs occur in unstressed yeast cells, and, during stress, grow before the appearance of visible stress granules. Stress-induced transcripts are excluded from TIICs primarily due to the timing of their expression, rather than their sequence features. Together, our results reveal a simple system by which cells redirect translational activity to newly synthesized transcripts during stress, with broad implications for cellular regulation in changing conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

Prospective large library docking against the AF2 models, however, yielded similar hit rates for both receptors versus docking against experimentally-derived structures; hundreds of molecules were prioritized and tested against each model and each structure of each receptor. The success of the AF2 models was achieved despite differences in orthosteric pocket residue conformations for both targets versus the experimental structures. Intriguingly, against the 5-HT2A receptor the most potent, subtype-selective agonists were discovered via docking against the AF2 model, not the experimental structure. To understand this from a molecular perspective, a cryoEM structure was determined for one of the more potent and selective ligands to emerge from docking against the AF2 model of the 5-HT2A receptor. Our findings suggest that AF2 models may sample conformations that are relevant for ligand discovery, much extending the domain of applicability of structure-based ligand discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264

However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.","NA","biorxiv",1716588559264
