However, the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood, with ongoing debate about whether sensory neurons can be directly infected by the virus. In this study, human iPSC-derived sensory neurons were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, a mutant virus, or viral S1 proteins. Under control conditions, sensory neurons exhibited low expression of ACE2. However, exposure to BA.5 or S1 proteins significantly upregulated ACE2 expression in peripherin-positive sensory neurons. Virological analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, including olfactory neurons. Moreover, exposure to the live virus or S1 proteins induced TRPV1 upregulation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in axonal destruction. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that viral exposure enhanced cAMP signaling, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels, which collectively contributed to synaptic and axonal damage. Importantly, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist demonstrated neuroprotective effects. These findings underscore the need for further research into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TRPV1, as well as its downstream signaling pathways, to develop therapeutic strategies for preventing sensory neuron loss during viral infections.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

Many recent studies have quantified their adverse events with a focus on gastrointestinal adverse events. However, no large epidemiologic study has investigated the risk of hair loss with these medications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide or liraglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of alopecia areata. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 926 semaglutide users, 17,898 liraglutide users, and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. We found that compared to bupropion-naltrexone, the crude hazard ratio and adjusted hazard ratio for alopecia areata for semaglutide or liraglutide use was 1.73 (95% confidence interval: 1.00-3.01) and 2.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.20-3.65) respectively. Our results demonstrate an increased risk of alopecia areata with GLP-1 agonists. Future studies are required to ascertain the association between GLP-1 agonists and alopecia areata.","NA","medrxiv",1741730926583

Both cardio-selective bisoprolol and non-selective propranolol improved cardiac perceptual sensitivity, with bisoprolol exerting an enhanced effect on cardiac metacognition. In contrast, both beta-blockers increased respiratory perceptual precision, with no corresponding changes in sensitivity or metacognition. These findings reveal a novel dissociation between central and peripheral beta-adrenergic mechanisms in interoception, highlighting the pivotal role of peripheral noradrenaline in regulating multi-organ brain-body interactions.

While LC symptoms vary widely, neuropathy is one of the most prevalent symptoms and drastically affects quality of life. However, the underlying pathophysiology of LC neuropathy remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the prevalence and potential mechanisms of LC neuropathy in the largest LC neuropathy cohort to date.

MethodsWe conducted an observational study of 977 adults with LC at Dell Medical School. Participants underwent clinical assessments, skin punch biopsy, and comprehensive metabolic, endocrine and immunological profiling. A subset of patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment.

FindingsNeuropathic symptoms were reported by 55% (534/977) participants, with skin biopsy confirming small fiber neuropathy in 56.5% (48/85) cases, affecting both epidermal and autonomic nerve fibers. Common risk factors for neuropathy, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, did not fully explain neuropathic symptoms. While general immunological markers (lymphocyte, T cell, and B cell count and CRP) were unremarkable, unexpectedly, we detected anti-ganglioside antibodies (AGAs) in 25% of patients with LC neuropathy, a comparable rate to other AGA-associated neuropathies. Longitudinal testing revealed persistent AGA positivity, and multiple elevated AGAs in a subset of patients. In a pilot treatment cohort of eight patients, IVIG treatment resulted in improvement of patient reported neuropathic symptoms.

InterpretationOur findings reveal a high prevalence of small fiber neuropathy in LC, with evidence suggesting an autoimmune mechanism involving AGAs in one in four LC neuropathy patients. The therapeutic response to IVIG further supports an autoimmune pathophysiology, suggesting potential benefits of immunomodulation in LC neuropathy patients.","NA","medrxiv",1741730926583

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1741730926583

Perturbation-based approaches allow the precise estimation of neural dynamic models and have been extensively applied in studies of brain functions and neural state transitions. However, the question of how optimal perturbations which most effectively identify dynamical models in neuroscience should be designed remains unclear. To address this, we propose a novel theoretical framework for estimating optimal perturbation inputs for system identification in linear time-invariant systems. The model represents neural dynamics using a connectivity matrix and an input matrix. Our framework derives an objective function to optimize perturbation inputs, which minimizes estimation errors in the model matrices. Building upon this, we further explore the relationship of this function with stimulation patterns commonly used in neuroscience, such as frequency, impulse, and step inputs. We then outline an iterative approach to perturbation input design. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating perturbation inputs significantly improves system identification accuracy as dictated by the objective function. Moreover, perturbation inputs tuned to a parameter related to the eigenvalues and a network structure of the intrinsic model enhance system identification. Through this iterative approach, the estimated model matrix gradually approaches the true matrix. As an application, we confirmed that the framework also contributes to the optimal control theory. This study highlights the potential of designing perturbation inputs to achieve the advanced identification of neural dynamics. By providing a framework for optimizing perturbations, our work facilitates deeper insights into brain functions and advances in the study of complex neural systems.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

Despite this, only 3% of their encoded specialised metabolites have been matched to molecules and understanding how their biosynthesis is controlled is essential to fully exploit their potential. Here we use Streptomyces formicae and the formicamycin biosynthetic pathway as a model to understand the complex regulation of specialised metabolism. We analysed all three pathway-specific regulators and found that biosynthesis is subject to negative feedback and redox control via two MarR-family proteins while activation of the pathway is dependent on a cytoplasmic two-component system. Like many Streptomyces antibiotics, formicamycins are only produced in solid culture and biosynthesis is switched off in aerated liquid cultures. Here, we demonstrate that a redox-sensitive repressor named ForJ senses oxygen via a single cysteine residue that is required to repress formicamycin biosynthesis in liquid cultures.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

To go much beyond this number, smaller and simpler genetic systems are needed to avoid significant technical challenges. Chloroplast genomes offer multiple advantages for codon compression and reassignment. Here we report a recoding scheme for the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast genome, in which two stop codons and one or more of the codons for arginine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine and serine, all of which have two cognate tRNAs, are absent, compressing the genetic code to 51 codons. Firstly, several recoding strategies were tested on the essential rpoA gene, encoding a subunit of the chloroplast RNA polymerase. A defined compression scheme, which relied on swapping the target codons with the permitted frequent codons, could replace the native protein coding sequence without affecting chloroplast protein expression levels or the strain fitness. The same strategy was successfully used for codon compression of ycf1, encoding a subunit of the chloroplast translocon, psaA and psbA, intron-containing highly-expressed genes encoding reaction centres subunits of both photosystems, and an 8.5 kb operon encoding essential and non-essential genes. Finally, we tested degeneracy of the 51-codon genetic code by exploring the combinatorial design for the large subunit of RuBisCO, relying on restoration of photosynthesis in an rbcL mutant strain. More than 70 functional sequences with diverse codon adaptation indices were recovered. In all codon-compressed genes there was no observable penalty on photosynthetic growth.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

Using magnetic tweezers, we show that nsp13-helicase specifically associates with the CoV polymerase and tranlocates on the strand opposite to the template, increasing the overall RNA synthesis rate on a double-stranded (ds) RNA template by ten-fold. Nsp13-helicase utilizes both ATP hydrolysis and allostery to assist the CoV polymerase through the dsRNA fork.

Most prominently, ribosome expression scales near linearly with the cellular growth rate to provide sufficient translational capacity while preventing metabolically wasteful ribosomal excess. In microbes, such proteome adjustments can passively perpetuate through symmetric cell division. However, in animals, a passive propagation is hindered by the separation between soma and germline. This separation raises the crucial question whether the proteome of animals is reset at every generation or can be propagated from parent to offspring despite this barrier. We addressed this question by exploring the intergenerational effects of dietary restriction in C. elegans, combining proteomics and live imaging. While most proteins showed no intergenerational regulation, ribosomal proteins remained reduced in offspring after maternal dietary restriction. When offspring of dietarily restricted mothers were raised under improved dietary conditions, this reduced ribosome content delayed their growth until normal ribosomal protein levels were restored. Soma-specific maternal inhibition of mTORC1 signalling replicated these effects, while other growth-reducing perturbations, such as reduced insulin signalling or maternal ribosome depletion, did not impact offspring ribosomes. Thus, mTORC1 signalling bridges across the soma-germline divide to regulate ribosome levels of the next generation, likely priming the offspring for the anticipated demand in protein synthesis.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

The GrimACE uses computer vision to provide automated mouse grimace scale (MGS) assessment together with pose estimation in a dark, safe environment. We validated the system by analysing pain after brain surgeries (craniotomies) with head implants under two analgesia regimes. Human-expert and automated MGS scores showed very high correlation (Pearson's r=0.87). Both expert and automated scores revealed that a moderate increase in pain can be detected for up to 48 hours after surgeries, but that both a single dose of meloxicam (5mg/kg s.c.) or 3 doses of buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg) + meloxicam (5mg/kg s.c.) provide adequate and comparable pain management. Simultaneous pose estimation demonstrated that mice receiving buprenorphine + meloxicam showed increased movement 4h after surgery, indicative of hyperactivity, a well-known side-effect of opioid treatment. Significant weight loss was also detected in the buprenorphine + meloxicam treatment group compared to the meloxicam-only group. Additionally, detailed BehaviorFlow analysis and automated MGS scoring of control animals suggests that habituation to the GrimACE system is unnecessary, and that measurements can be repeated multiple times, ensuring standardised post-operative recovery monitoring.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

Here, we developed a high-throughput combinatorial screening strategy, that we term NeMECiS, to investigate signal-dependent synthetic CREs (synCREs) in differentiating mammalian stem cells. By concatenating fragments of functional CREs from genes that respond to Sonic Hedgehog in the developing vertebrate neural tube, we found that CRE activity follows hierarchical design rules. While individual 200-base-pair fragments showed minimal activity, their combinations generated thousands of functional signal-responsive synCREs, many exceeding the activity of natural sequences. Statistical modelling revealed CRE function can be decomposed into specific quantitative contributions in which sequence fragments combine through a multiplicative rule, tuned by their relative positioning and spacing. These findings provide a predictive framework for CRE redesign, which we used to engineer synthetic CREs that alter the pattern of motor neuron differentiation in neural tissue.

However, concerns remain that increased telehealth availability may contribute to higher overall healthcare utilization and spending. To assess telehealths impact on outpatient evaluation and management (E&M) visit volume, we compared overall E&M utilization before and after the pandemic across specialties with varying levels of telehealth use.

MethodsWe analyzed 100% Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) claims to compare monthly outpatient E&M visit rates between two periods: pre-pandemic (January 2019-February 2020) and post-pandemic (January 2021-June 2024). Specialties were categorized by telehealth use as high (behavioral health), medium (primary care), and low (orthopedic surgery). A difference-in-differences (DID) analysis was used to assess changes in visit volume associated with telehealth.

ResultsPrior to the pandemic, telehealth accounted for just 0.1% of monthly E&M visits but surged to 41.0% in April 2020 before stabilizing between 5.7% and 7.0% in 2023-2024. The average monthly E&M visit rate per 1,000 FFS beneficiaries was 906.8 pre-pandemic and 918.6 post-pandemic. In the post-pandemic period, telehealth comprised 1.2% of E&M visits in low-use specialties, 8.4% in medium-use specialties, and 43.8% in high-use specialties. Compared to the expected trend based on the low telehealth-use specialty, high and medium telehealth-use specialties experienced a 4.1% and 7.2% relative decline in overall E&M visits, respectively, in the post-pandemic period.

ConclusionFollowing an initial surge, telehealth use stabilized in 2021 and beyond. Overall outpatient utilization remained stable post-pandemic, and increased telehealth adoption was not associated with a rise in total outpatient E&M visits. These findings suggest that broad telehealth adoption has not led to increased healthcare utilization among Medicare FFS beneficiaries.","NA","medrxiv",1741730926583

ObjectiveThis retrospective cohort study compares the overall spending, rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging procedures within 30 days for Medicare fee-for-service patients who underwent in-person and telehealth evaluations between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022.

DesignA large-scale retrospective cohort study using propensity score matching

SettingPatients with no prior visits and 30-day episodes of care initiated by telehealth or in-person visits from July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022.

ParticipantsThis study included 100% of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who are aged >65 years while excluding those with Medicare Advantage coverage and those without continuous Medicare Parts A and B.

Exposure(s)Comparison of index visits initiated by telehealth versus in-person visits.

Primary outcomeAdjusted 30-day total spending.

Secondary outcomes30-day rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging.

ResultsThe study included 30,079,958 participants with 36,709,528 and 429,891,125 episodes initiated by telehealth and in-person visits, respectively. The mean age was 76 for telehealth and 75 years for in-person. Telehealth-initiated visits were associated with lower 30-day spending ($260 vs. $342; net: -$82), though return visit rates were higher for telehealth (16.1% vs. 14.1%). Both lab test rates (7.8% vs. 24.2%) and imaging rates (3.5% vs 7.8%) were lower for telehealth-initiated care episodes compared to in-person-initiated care episodes.

Conclusions and RelevanceTelehealth-initiated episodes of care were associated with lower 30-day Medicare spending and reduced utilization of labs and imaging. These findings suggest that telehealth, when used as a substitute for office visits, may reduce overall Medicare spending.","NA","medrxiv",1741730926583

It poses the difficult problem of continuous tracking of multiple agents, including both self and others. To understand how this tracking is implemented neurally, we examined responses of hippocampal neurons while humans performed a joystick-controlled continuous prey-pursuit task involving two simultaneously fleeing prey (and, in some cases, a predator) in a virtual open field. We found neural maps encoding the positions of all the agents. All maps were multiplexed in single neurons and were disambiguated by the use of the population coding principle of semi-orthogonal subspaces, which can facilitate cross-agent generalization. Some neurons, more common in the posterior hippocampus, had narrow tuning functions reminiscent of place cells, lower firing rates, and high information per spike; others, which were found in both anterior and posterior hippocampus, had broad tuning functions, higher firing rates, and less information per spike. Semi-orthogonalization was selectively associated with the broadly tuned neurons. These results suggest an answer to the problem of navigational individuation, that is, how mapping codes can distinguish different agents, and establish the neuronavigational foundations of pursuit.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

Using Xenopus egg extracts, we show that a replication fork encountering an SSB on either the leading- or lagging-strand template produces a single-ended double-strand break (seDSB). These broken ends are efficiently resolved through homologous recombination to yield D-loop intermediates and erroneous end-to-end fusions. Surprisingly, DNA synthesis downstream of an seDSB is highly inefficient. In contrast, when two forks converge at an SSB, they generate a double-ended DSB (deDSB) that efficiently completes DNA synthesis through double-strand break repair that is not dependent on homologous recombination. Leading, but not lagging, seDSBs can undergo extensive nucleolytic degradation that disassembles the divergent fork. These secondary collapse events efficiently resolve seDSBs but without completion of DNA synthesis. Moreover, PARP inhibition can enhance fork collapse at unmodified SSBs but not abasic site SSBs, contrary to expectations. Our findings distinguish end resolution from replication completion and demonstrate flexibility in how PARP inhibition affects fork collapse.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

In the zebrafish heart, spatially confined single-cell delamination in the ventricle outer curvature initiates trabeculation, a conserved morphogenetic process critical for heart function and embryonic life. Yet, what confines delamination in the ventricle outer curvature remains ill-understood. Contrary to the prevailing notion of patterning through biochemical signals, we now show that mechanical fracturing of the cardiac extracellular matrix (cECM) patterns delamination in the outer curvature. cECM fractures emerge preferentially in the outer curvature, cells delaminate into these fractures and experimental blocking of fractures blocks delamination. These fractures display characteristic signature of mechanical defects and myocardial tissue contractility is sufficient to fracture the cECM, independent of molecular signals, enzymatic activity, or delamination events. Notably, the anisotropic geometry of myocardial tissue generates higher mechanical strain in the outer curvature, thereby locally patterning cECM fractures and delamination. Consequently, cECM fractures evolve in response to dynamic changes in tissue geometry, and experimental manipulation of tissue geometry is sufficient to alter the fracture pattern. Together, our findings underscore mechanical fractures as a morphogenetic strategy, and more generally, corroborate the long-standing but understudied paradigm that tissue form-function can feed back to steer its own patterning.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

Prx1/AhpC-type peroxiredoxins are found throughout the eukaryotic kingdom, where multiple isoforms frequently coexist within the same cell and even in the same subcellular compartment. Long thought to form exclusively homooligomeric structures, we reveal that heterooligomerization is a conserved and important feature of eukaryotic Prx1/AhpC-type peroxiredoxins. We demonstrate that heterooligomer formation modulates peroxoredoxin oligomeric state and enhances structural stability. In yeast, Tsa1-Tsa2 peroxiredoxin heterodecamers form in response to oxidative stress and incorporated Tsa2 stabilizes the decameric state. Beyond yeast, we show that human PRDX1 and PRDX2, as well as plant and parasitic peroxiredoxins, engage in functional heterooligomerization. These findings challenge the long-held paradigm of peroxiredoxin homooligomerization and reveal a novel mechanism for regulating redox homeostasis. Our study provides new insights into peroxiredoxin structural plasticity with broad implications for redox biology, stress responses, and cellular adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

For example, Jurkat leukemic T cells fundamentally contributed to uncovering T cell signaling, activation, and immune responses. However, the immortalization process can alter key cellular properties, and researchers widely believe this process could significantly change RNA modification machinery and modification sites. In this study, we focus on pseudouridine ({psi}), one of the most abundant mRNA modifications, and compare {psi} profiles in mRNA from primary and immortalized T cells using direct RNA sequencing (DRS). Surprisingly, 87% of {psi}-sites were shared between the two cell types, primarily in transcripts encoding proteins involved in essential cellular processes, including RNA-modification regulation. Furthermore, the analysis of the 13% of sites unique to each cell type reveals that Jurkat cells contained transcripts linked to immune activation and oncogenesis, while primary T cells contained transcripts associated with calcium signaling and intracellular trafficking. We provide a list of these genes, which should be considered when using immortalized cells to study RNA modifications in immunology contexts. Most differences were driven by whether the mRNA was present or absent in the immortalized or primary cell type. Interestingly, RNA-modification enzyme expression levels were highly conserved in both cell types. This suggests that site-specific differences in {psi} levels arise from regulatory processes acting in trans rather than differences in modification enzyme levels.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

In these conditions, fibrotic tissues are characterized by the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts. However, the role of CD8+ T cells in driving myofibroblast activity remains unexplored. Our aim was to investigate this interaction between CD8+ T cells and skin myofibroblasts and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Methods: Primary skin-derived myofibroblasts were co-cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or sorted T cells in a 3D collagen type I hydrogel. To model autoimmunity, allogeneic mismatching was applied. T cell activation and cytokine expression were assessed using flow cytometry and Luminex. Myofibroblast activation was analysed through immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), while activation-induced contraction was measured macroscopically. Intracellular signaling pathway activation in myofibroblasts was evaluated using luciferase reporter cell lines. Results: Co-culture of myofibroblasts with PBMCs strongly induced hydrogel contraction and expression of activation-related markers such as podoplanin, fibroblast activation protein, pSTAT3 and IL-6 in myofibroblasts. CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were also activated by co-culture as identified by increased CD25 and CD69 expression and elevated IL-2 and IFN-{gamma} production. Upon co-culture with either sorted CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, CD8+ T cells more strongly induced myofibroblast contraction and activation than CD4+ T cells. This was not associated with cytotoxicity but with increased IL-6 production by CD8+ T cells compared to CD4+ T cells and STAT3/TGF{beta}-induced signaling in myofibroblasts. Use of either the JAK/STAT3-inhibitor tofacitinib or the TGF{beta} receptor inhibitor SB-505124 blocked the activated myofibroblast phenotype, and combined use of both inhibitors had an additive effect on myofibroblast activation and contraction. Conclusions: CD8+ T cells drive primary skin derived myofibroblast contraction and activation not via cytotoxicity-related program but via cytokine release. This sheds light on novel mechanisms of immune cell mediated tissue fibrosis. Furthermore, our results suggest that combining JAK/STAT inhibition with an anti-fibrotic agent that blocks matrix synthesis might be promising in mitigating immune cell mediated tissue fibrosis in connective tissue rheumatic disorders and has added value over blocking these pathways individually.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

Yet to date, the mechanism of HGT among eukaryotes has remained a mystery. Here, we demonstrate that Starships, a newly discovered group of cargo-mobilizing transposable elements, are active vectors of horizontally transferred DNA among eukaryotic species. We find that multiple Starships simultaneously transfer themselves and their cargo within and between fungal genera separated by upwards of 100 million years of evolution. Transferred Starships are recovered in strains with and without selection for particular Starship-encoded phenotypes. Using whole genome sequencing, we exclude alternative hypotheses such as heterokaryosis, parasex or the random uptake of exogenous DNA by showing that only Starship DNA is precisely transferred. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the introduction of the Hephaestus Starship into a new species increases metal resistance due to the genes carried by this element. Between 18-27% of all Starships in our focal genus, Paecilomyces, have evidence of horizontal transfer under natural conditions, including to other fungal genera, revealing Starship-mediated HGT to be a widespread and frequent phenomenon across filamentous fungi. This study identifies the first active genetic mechanism for HGT between eukaryotic species.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

We integrated new and published single-cell RNA-sequencing data to profile murine small-intestinal lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and identified three distinct subsets. Lacteal LECs display a transcriptional signature resembling Ptx3 immune-interacting LECs characterized by high expression of Aqp1, encoding the aquaporin-1 water channel. LEC-specific deletion of Aqp1 reduced lacteal length, impaired lipid uptake, and limited weight gain on a high-fat diet, underscoring the importance of water homeostasis in lacteal maintenance. AQP1 also promoted VEGF-C-dependent LEC migration under osmotic stress and, uniquely, was upregulated during inflammatory remodelling in secondary lymphedema and lymphatic malformations, but not during embryonic lymphangiogenesis. These findings link lacteal regeneration to inflammatory lymphatic remodelling and highlight tissue osmolarity as a key biophysical factor in postnatal lymphangiogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

Reflecting these diverse roles, the DRN is composed of molecularly distinct and topographically organized groups of neurons that target specific regions of the forebrain. Despite these insights, fundamental questions remain regarding how DRN neurons process sensory information, what do DRN communicate to forebrain, and the role of DRN inputs in forebrain computations and animal behavior. To address these questions, we investigated the spatiotemporal activity patterns of DRN neurons, along with DRN axons and their targets in the juvenile zebrafish forebrain. Our findings revealed a remarkable topographic organization of ongoing activity and sensory-motor responses within the DRN. We discovered that a large fraction of DRN neurons are primarily driven by animals locomotor activity. We also observed that an anterior group of DRN neurons, marked by Gad1, exhibited distinct activity patterns during rest, locomotor activity and sensory stimulation. DRN axons broadly innervating the forebrain exhibit topographically organized excitation and inhibition in response to sensory stimulation and motor activity. Notably, we observed significant and rapid covariation between the activity of DRN axons and nearby forebrain neurons. Chemogenetic ablation of the DRN led to a marked reduction in the synchrony and sensory-motor responses across forebrain neurons, accompanied by significant deficits in adaptive behaviors.

Studies on rodents have confirmed this reduced FL is driven by a loss of sarcomeres aligned in series (serial sarcomere number; SSN) along a muscle. However, studies on rodents have focused primarily on rat plantar flexor SSN at two aging timepoints, leaving an incomplete view of age-related changes in SSN. Hence, this study investigated SSN as a contributor to the age-related loss of muscle mass in five hindlimb muscles across four aging timepoints in rats. Methods: The soleus, medial gastrocnemius (MG), plantaris, tibialis anterior (TA), and vastus lateralis (VL) were obtained from 5 young (8 months), 5 middle-aged (20 months), 5 old (32 months), and 5 very old (36 months) male F344BN rats. After fixation of muscles in formalin and digestion in nitric acid, fascicles were teased out end-to-end to measure FL. SSN was determined by dividing FL by sarcomere length measured via laser diffraction. Muscle wet weight, anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSA), and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) were also determined for insight on age-related losses of whole-muscle mass and in-parallel muscle morphology. Results: Age-related SSN loss was apparent after middle age for all muscles, with the plantaris showing the smallest (8%) and the VL the greatest (21%) loss. The MG and VL appeared to plateau in their SSN loss by 32 months, while the soleus and TA underwent continued loss from 32 to 36 months. In all muscles, SSN loss evidently contributed in part to the loss of muscle mass, alongside losses of contractile tissue in parallel (indicated by ACSA and PCSA). Conclusion: As SSN is closely tied to biomechanical function, these findings present SSN as a distinct target for improving muscle performance in older adults.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

This barrier is heavily glycosylated by O-linked sugars covalently linked to mucin glycoproteins, and N-linked sugars that coat epithelial surface proteins. Gut O- and N-glycans are thought to play central roles in barrier function, host defense, nutrition and attachment for commensals and pathogens, immunoregulation and cell-cell interactions.

By mapping individual glycan species spatially and temporally we identify 57 O- and 18 N-glycans in the mouse intestine, and observe that fucosylation and sialylation varies according to intestinal region and developmental stage. We identify a subset of glycans regulated by the gut microbiome, and observe a constriction of the glycan repertoire during inflammation in both mice and humans. Together, these results provide an atlas of individual intestinal glycans and their dynamic range through ontogeny and inflammation, and represent a significant resource for our understanding of the role of intestinal glycans in health and disease and glycan-focused therapies for intestinal inflammation and shaping the gut microbiome.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

In a preregistered study (OSF), we examined how this interaction may result in sensory interference during WM storage using a delayed-match-to-sample task. Participants memorized the color of a target stimulus for later report on a color wheel. The shape of the target indicated which hand they would adjust the color wheel with. During the retention interval, an interference task was presented, requiring a response with either the same or different hand as the main task. In half of the interference trials, the interfering task cue was also colored to introduce visual interference. EEG results showed early motor planning during sensory encoding, evidenced by mu/beta suppression contralateral to the responding hand. The interference task only impaired WM performance when it included an irrelevant color, indicating that the interference effect was primarily driven by the irrelevant sensory information. In addition, color reporting in the WM task was biased toward the irrelevant color. This was more pronounced when both tasks were performed with the same hand, suggesting a selective gating mechanism dependent on motor control processes. This effect was mitigated by a control mechanism, which was evident in frontal theta activity, where higher power predicted lower bias on the single-trial level. Our findings thus reveal that sensory WM updating can be induced by interfering motor actions, which can be compensated by a reactive control mechanism.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWorking memory is increasingly recognized not only as a system for maintaining sensory representations of the past, but also as one that creates prospective representations serving future actions. This shift in perspective raises fundamental questions about how motor planning shapes the way information enters and is maintained in working memory. Our study demonstrates a novel interaction between motor processes and working memory: When a stored memory representation is linked to a specific motor response, it becomes particularly vulnerable to interference from sensory information requiring the same motor response. Using EEG recordings, we identify neural signatures of this interaction and reveal a frontal control mechanism that can counteract the influence of irrelevant mental representations on working memory. These findings provide important insights into the fundamental architecture of memory, showing for the first time that motor processes not only guide the use of stored information but also influence how new information is integrated into working memory representations.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

In heterodichogamy, two hermaphroditic morphs exploit distinct temporal reproductive niches by alternating phases of male and female flowering, promoting disassortative mating. This system is widespread within Juglandaceae, and known to be controlled by ancient balanced polymorphisms in walnuts (Juglans) and hickories (Carya). Here we identify distinct inheritance mechanisms controlling heterodichogamy in two separate Juglandaceae genera, the wingnuts (Pterocarya and Cyclocarya). We first document the occurrence of heterodichogamy in Pterocarya and map its genomic basis to haplotypes overlapping a single candidate gene in the FANTASTIC FOUR superfamily (GFAFL). These haplotypes segregate throughout the entire genus and the dominant haplotype controls female-first flowering. We show heterodichogamy in the sister genus Cyclocarya is associated with a distinct pair of ancient haplotypes at the same locus in both diploids and tetraploids, but with a dominant allele controlling male-first flowering. We infer a well-resolved fossil-calibrated phylogeny of Juglandaceae and date the divergence of the Pterocarya and Cyclocarya haplotypes to 51 and 44 million years ago, more recent than the divergence of these genera. In Pterocarya female-first heterozygotes, the dominant haplotype is associated with allele-specific suppression of the recessive copy of GFAFL during early male flower development. In Cyclocarya male-first heterozygotes, the dominant haplotype is associated with allele-specific activation of the recessive copy of GFAFL during male flower development, while the dominant copy itself shows higher expression in female flowers. We propose a model for the evolution of reciprocal sex matching heterodichogamy through the combination of cis-regulatory divergence and allelic interactions involving 'fast' and 'slow' alleles at a single gene regulating flowering time. The non-independent expression of alleles in both systems is reminiscent of trans-sensing phenomena in other systems and suggests a mechanism mediated by DNA homology or an RNA intermediary. Notably, the dominant haplotypes in both genera show parallel architecture with a hemizygous region containing tandem duplicates of the same 1 kb motif downstream of the transcribed region of GFAFL which may be linked with such a mechanism. Our findings shed light on the molecular basis of heterodichogamy and contribute to an emerging view that diverse genetic pathways can be co-opted during its evolution and facilitate turnover in its genetic control.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

ACLY-deficient NK cells had significant defects upon activation via IL-15 priming including impaired glycolysis, proliferation, cytokine production, and killing, without decreased intracellular lipids . Notably, Acly-deficiency specifically led to dampened NK cell responses to activating receptors that partner with the adapter proteins DAP10 or DAP12, with ACLY-deficient NK cells having decreased DAP12 and increased DAP10 transcript and protein. Epigenetic profiling demonstrated altered histone acetylation of these genes. Supplementation of ACLY-deficient NK cells with acetate was sufficient to overcome most functional defects, including restoring DAP10/12 expression and activating receptor function, demonstrating the importance of ACLY-generated cytosolic acetyl-coenzyme A for NK effector functions.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

This predilection introduces a major behavior bias that is known as reference-point dependence in Prospect Theory, and that has close links to mental accounting. Here we examined neural activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) of macaques performing a token-based risky choice task, in which the acquisition of 6 tokens (accumulated over several trials) resulted in a jackpot reward. We find that subjects make faster and more accurate choices as the jackpot reward becomes more likely to be achieved, suboptimal behavior that can readily be explained by reference dependence. This biased behavior systematically covaries with the neural encoding of corresponding offer values. Moreover, we found significant enhancement in speed, accuracy and neural encoding strength for easier levels of difficulty in detecting the offer with the best expected value. These results suggest a neural basis of reference dependence biases in shaping decision-making behavior and highlight the critical role of value representations in dACC in driving those biases.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

Phylogeographic methods can reconstruct historical patterns of disease dissemination by combining the evolutionary history of sampled pathogen genomes with geographic information. Despite a substantial expansion of pathogen genomics during and since the COVID-19 pandemic, only a small fraction of infections are typically sampled and sequenced, leading to an underestimation of the true intensity of viral importation. Here, we seek to understand the sampling processes underlying this underestimation. We show that the coupling of viral importation and local transmission dynamics can result in local transmission lineages with different size distributions, influencing the probability that individual viral importation events will be detected. Using analytical and simulation approaches, we demonstrate that both the proportion of importation events detected and the temporal patterns of inferred importation are highly sensitive to importation dynamics and local transmission parameters. Our findings highlight the importance of interpreting phylogeographic estimates in the context of outbreak conditions, particularly when comparing viral movements across time and among different epidemic settings. These insights are critical for improving the reliability of genomic epidemiology approaches in the design of public health responses.","NA","medrxiv",1741730926583

In human adults, visual performance declines with eccentricity and varies around polar angle for many visual dimensions and tasks: Performance is superior along the horizontal than the vertical meridian (horizontal-vertical anisotropy, HVA), and along the lower than the upper vertical meridian (vertical meridian asymmetry, VMA)(Carrasco et al., 2001). However, it remains unknown whether visual adaptation differs around polar angle. In this study, we investigated adaptation effects at the fovea and perifovea across the four cardinal locations, for horizontal and vertical adaptor and target orientations, with stimulus size adjusted as per a cortical magnification factor (Rovamo & Virsu, 1979). We measured contrast thresholds at each location separately for adaptation and non-adaptation conditions. Results confirmed the expected HVA and VMA effects in non-adapted conditions and showed they are stronger for horizontal than vertical orientations. They also revealed that, for both orientations, adaptation effects are stronger along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, which in turn is stronger than at the fovea. Furthermore, for both orientations, individual's adaptation effects at the perifoveal locations positively correlated with their cortical surface area of V1. The association of a stronger adaptation effect with larger V1 surface area suggests a more pronounced conservation of bioenergetic resources along the horizontal than the vertical meridian. Visual adaptation alleviates the HVA in contrast sensitivity, promoting a more homogeneous perception around the visual field.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

Using amplicon sequencing, metagenomics, and microbial experiments, we investigate the drivers of stingless bee microbiome assembly. We reveal a spatially structured, site-adapted microbiome, where high microbial influx hive components are segregated from the brood, which harbors a stable, multi-kingdom community.

In vivo crosslinking is a powerful tool for probing these interactions, with photoactivatable amino acids representing a promising next step. Here, we evaluated the application of photo-leucine in the gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis. This amino acid analog is incorporated into proteins, but high concentrations inhibit the growth of B. subtilis. We investigated photo-leucine homeostasis and identified the branched-chain amino acid importers BcaP and BraB as well as the bipartite exporter AzlCD as key players of its uptake and export, respectively. Additionally, we identified a previously uncharacterized exporter, AexB, a member of the ""sleeping beauty"" group of EamA amino acid exporters. Expression of the aexB gene is positively regulated by the transcription factor AerB, that is normally normally inactive. Selective pressure by photo-leucine triggered the acqusition of a point mutation in aerB, allowing AerB to activate aexB expression. Mutants highly resistant to photo-leucine carried a single amino acid exchange, Ala-494 to Thr, in the leucine-tRNA synthetase LeuS. Molecular docking analysis revealed that this mutation alters the leucine-binding pocket, in a manner that still allowed binding of leucine, but not photo-leucine. While high photo-leucine incorporation is beneficial for effective crosslinking, our results suggest that B. subtilis intrinsically limits its incorporation to maintain cellular tolerance. Thus, evolutionary processes provide adaptive mechanisms to adjust amino acid analogue incorporation to tolerable levels, making photo amino acids a candidate for life cell investigation of protein struture and interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

Despite established links between the infant gut microbiome and health, knowledge is limited for how complementary feeding influences colonization. Using FoodSeq, an objective DNA-based dietary assessment technique, we analyzed 1,036 fecal samples from 729 children aged 0-3 years across countries in North America, Central America, Africa, and Asia. We detected a wide diversity of 199 unique plant food sequences, of which only eight staple foods were consistently present across all countries. Despite this variation in global diet, we identified universal trajectories in early life dietary exposure: weaning stage, which tracked with dietary diversity, emerged as the dominant dietary signature across populations. Still, dietary diversity did not correlate with gut microbial diversity. Instead, dietary diversity and weaning stage specifically predicted the abundance of adult-like bacterial taxa, including known fiber-degrading taxa, which colonized after age 1. Our findings support a two-stage model of microbiome maturation: an early phase dominated by milk-adapted taxa independent of complementary feeding, followed by a maturation phase where diet shapes adult-like microbiota colonization. This model suggests that tracking and promoting plant dietary diversity may support the timely emergence of an adult-like microbiome.","NA","medrxiv",1741730926583

We design PINCHs that achieve efficient polymerization of three homomeric targets. In cells, we observed that a PINCH targeting Keap1 exhibited a longer duration of action compared to its monomeric inhibitor, and a PINCH targeting BCL6 displayed selective and improved B cell toxicity compared to its monomeric parent.

We developed a mechanistic analytically tractable model to study the underlying processes of social foraging, tying the microscopic individual to the macroscopic group levels. Based on a stochastic evidence accumulation framework, we developed a model of patch-leaving decisions in a large hierarchical group with leading and following individuals. Across a variety of information sharing mechanisms, we were able to analytically quantify emergent collective dynamics. We found that follower-leader dynamics through observations of leader movements or through counting the number of individuals in a patch confers, for most conditions, a benefit for the following individuals by increasing their accuracy in inferring patch richness. On the other hand, misinformation, through the communication of false beliefs about food rewards or patch quality, shows to be detrimental to following individuals, but paradoxically may lead to increased group cohesion. In an era where there is a huge amount of animal foraging data collected, our model provides a systematic way to conceptualize and understand those data by uncovering hidden mechanisms underlying social foraging decisions.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

Following triggering of the pathway, cytosolic ERK1 is phosphorylated and translocated into the nucleus to activate DNA-bound factors and target genes. This study reports a novel role of human ERK1 as a DNA endonuclease to catalyze single-strand DNA breaks without sequence-specificity. ERK1 catalysis required magnesium ion and was independent of ATP. Biochemical and structural analyses indicated that the ERK1 N-terminal domain allosterically modulates substrate binding and catalytic rate. Fluorescence imaging showed that ERK1 interacts with cytoplasmic DNAs in condensates. Collectively, our study reveals an unprecedented role of ERK1 in breaking DNA molecules, a finding which highlights the potential of ERK1 to regulate cytoplasmic DNA topology and fate.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

Current approaches to diagnosis rely on histology, which exhibits wide diagnostic variability and lacks access to molecular phenotypes that may stratify therapeutic response. Here, we leverage image-based spatial transcriptomics at sub-cellular resolution in longitudinal human cardiac biopsies to characterize transcriptional heterogeneity in 62 adult and pediatric heart transplant (HT) recipients during and following histologically-diagnosed rejection. Across 28 cell types, we identified significant differences in abundance in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells across different biological classes of rejection (cellular, mixed, antibody-mediated). We observed a broad overlap in cellular transcriptional states across histologic rejection severity and biological class and significant heterogeneity within rejection severity grades that would qualify for immunomodulatory treatment. Individuals who had resolved rejection after therapy had a distinct transcriptomic profile relative to those with persistent rejection, including 216 genes across 6 cell types along pathways of inflammation, IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling, IFN/IFN{gamma} response, and TNF signaling. Spatial transcriptomics also identified genes linked to long-term prognostic outcomes post-HT. These results underscore importance of subtyping immunologic states during rejection to stratify immune-cardiac interactions following HT that are therapeutically relevant to short- and long-term rejection-related outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

However, designing RNA sequences that selectively bind to proteins remains a significant challenge due to the vast sequence space and limitations of current experimental and computational methods. Traditional approaches rely on in vitro selection techniques or computational models that require post-generation optimization, restricting their applicability to well-characterized proteins. We introduce RNAtranslator, a generative language model that formulates protein-conditional RNA design as a sequence-to-sequence natural language translation problem for the first time. By learning a joint representation of RNA and protein interactions from large- scale datasets, RNAtranslator directly generates binding RNA sequences for any given protein target without the need for additional optimization. Our results demonstrate that RNAtranslator produces RNA sequences with natural-like properties, high novelty, and enhanced binding affinity compared to existing methods. This approach enables efficient RNA design for a wide range of proteins, paving the way for new RNA-based therapeutics and synthetic biology applications.

By depleting glucose levels in cortical organoids, we increased outer radial glia, astrocytes, and inhibitory neurons. We found the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) was impacted in these experiments and leveraged pharmacological and genetic manipulations to recapitulate these radial glia cell fate changes.

The slit diaphragm, a critical component of the glomerulus, is formed between podocytes by the immunoglobulin domain proteins nephrin and Neph1. The molecular architecture of the slit diaphragm has remained elusive for decades. Using cryo-electron tomography on focused ion beam-milled Drosophila nephrocytes, an invertebrate podocyte model, we show that the slit diaphragm adopts a fishnet-like pattern. Comparison of hundreds of slit diaphragm segments reveals that it is bi-layered and highly periodic. Based on the cryo-electron tomography map, we propose four possible models for the arrangement of the Drosophila nephrin ortholog (Sns), and the Drosophila Neph1 ortholog (Kirre), the main components of the slit diaphragm in Drosophila. In each model, precise and consistent homo- and heterophilic interactions between crossing immunoglobulin domains of Sns and Kirre become apparent, with immediate implications for the stability and the assembly of the slit diaphragm. Cryo-electron tomography shows that sns silencing disrupts this fishnet pattern, linking this directly to Drosophila nephrin. After Rab5 silencing, causing Sns mistrafficking and ectopic SD formation, the fishnet pattern appears ectopically as well. Our findings align with observations applying cryo-electron tomography to podocytes in mice, indicating that the molecular architecture is evolutionarily conserved across animals. This highlights the value of the nephrocyte as a podocyte model and establishes a crucial link between the architecture of the slit diaphragm and its function.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

Understanding the relationships between environmental factors, microbial communities, and resistance mechanisms is vital for elucidating environmental resistome dynamics. In this study, we characterized the environmental resistome of the Baltic Sea and evaluated how environmental gradients and spatial variability, alongside its microbial communities and associated functional genes, influence resistome diversity and composition across geographic regions. We analyzed the metagenomes of benthic sediments from 59 monitoring stations across a 1,150 km distance of the Baltic Sea, revealing an environmental resistome comprised of predicted antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) associated with resistance against 26 antibiotic classes. We observed spatial variation in its resistance profile, with higher resistome diversity in the northern regions and a decline in the dead zones and the southern areas. The combined effects of salinity and temperature gradients, alongside nutrient availability, created a complex environmental landscape that shaped the diversity and distribution of the predicted ARGs. Salinity predominantly influenced microbial communities and predicted ARG composition, leading to clear distinctions between high-saline regions and those with lower to mid-level salinity. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that microbial community composition and mobile genetic elements might be crucial in shaping ARG diversity and composition. We presented that salinity and temperature were identified as the primary environmental factors influencing resistome diversity and distribution across geographic regions, with nutrient availability further shaping these patterns in the Baltic Sea. Our study also highlighted the interplay between microbial communities, resistance, and associated functional genes in the benthic ecosystem, underscoring the potential role of microbial and mobile genetic element composition in ARG distribution. Understanding how environmental factors and microbial communities modulate environmental resistomes will help predict the impact of future environmental changes on resistance mechanisms in complex aquatic ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

The essential analysis of the primary sequencing reads, however, is complex and led to the development of diverse computational strategies. The plethora of available methods and their numerous parameters poses a practical challenge for practitioners and creates a visibility barrier for developers of novel approaches. In addition to technical limitations related to user computing environment, algorithmic solutions, and their scalability, there are critical considerations regarding the reference database, i.e. the knowledge against which the data is interpreted, as well as the target of the analysis, expected sample composition, and peculiarities of read data from different sequencing platforms.

Borrelia is known to disseminate through organs, including the skin, joints, spinal cord, bladder, and heart, leading to Lyme arthritis, neuroborreliosis, and Lyme carditis. While previous studies have investigated the impact of LD on pregnancy in both mice and humans and have found the presence of B. burgdorferi in the uterus of mice, we studied the impact of LD on the non-pregnant female reproductive tract. We use a mouse model for LD and find an ongoing and severe infection of the reproductive tract of female mice, which persists up to 15-months post-inoculation. This infection results in uterine glandular cysts and endometrial hyperplasia as well as vaginal epithelial thickening, polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell epithelial infiltration, and epithelial desquamation into the vaginal lumen. Strikingly, we find that age has an impact on the extent of gynecologic pathology such that aged female mice (1-year old) that are reproductively senescent have more gynecologic pathology with infection compared to young mice (15-weeks old) when infected for the same length of time. Using large-scale electronic healthcare record data, we report that LD additionally results in increased infection-associated risk of menorrhagia (1.5-fold), miscarriage (1.62-fold), uterine fibroids (1.42-fold), and endometriosis (1.93-fold). Underreporting of gynecological outcomes is pervasive throughout many different infectious diseases, and LD-associated gynecological pathologies may have been similarly underappreciated in the field. This work suggests that further study of the female reproductive tract and the effects of B. burgdorferi infection therein will help clarify and expand the knowledge of myriad LD outcomes.

The prefrontal cortex is thought to control the balance between these two systems, allowing automatic processing where possible, but stepping in when deliberative processes are required, such as in novel, uncertain, or conflicting situations. Despite the central importance of this idea in cognitive neuroscience, there is little understanding of how this control process is implemented. We used Neuropixel recordings in rhesus macaques to decode neural activity and reveal the cognitive processes in prefrontal cortex and striatum during automatic and deliberative decisions. During automatic decisions, the chosen option was decoded simultaneously from both areas. During deliberative choices, the prefrontal cortex serially considered multiple options while neither could be decoded from the striatum. This suppression occurred via an increase in alpha band coherence between the two structures and scaled with the volatility of prefrontal representations. Our findings reveal a specific neural mechanism that may explain how frontostriatal circuits implement cognitive control and provide a novel mechanism by which to treat disorders of behavioral control.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

However, there is an ongoing need for novel TCM preparations. The aim of this study was to assess the potential and mechanism of a de novo designed TCM preparation: JinHuangJieDu (JHJD), which is composed of JIN YIN HUA, HUANG QIN, GUANG HUO XIANG, BAI ZHI, PU GONG YING and BO HE, for the treatment of COVID-19 using network pharmacology analysis and in vitro experimental validations. Methods: First, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established to validate whether JHJD inhibits the binding of wild type and mutant receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by JHJD was assessed with pseudovirus neutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and COS7-hACE2 cells. Network pharmacology analysis using Encyclopedia of Chinese Traditional Medicine (ETCM) and Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology databases (TCMSP) were further performed to identify the meridional network, active ingredients and targeted genes of JHJD. Interaction networks were constructed and gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analysis were performed using Cytoscape (3.7.1) software with ClueGO and CluePedia plugins. Vital genes were identified using CytoHubba and MCODE plugins. In vitro experiments were performed to confirm one of the targeted crucial gene and to validate whether JHJD may mitigate inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2. Results: JHJD effectively blocked the binding of both wild type and Omicron RBD of SARS-CoV-2 to human ACE2 and completely inhibited the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to ACE2-positive host cells in vitro. Network pharmacology analysis uncovered that JHJD comprises a total of 378 active ingredients and 339 targeted genes, with its primary actions likely focused on lung, stomach and spleen. A total of 63 significant KEGG pathways were enriched, predominantly related to viral infection and inflammation pathways. Two pivotal genes, CCND1 and HIF1A, were identified by intersecting the MCODE module genes with different node algorithms in CytoHubba. In vitro validation confirmed that JHJD could target HIF-1, reducing virus-induced inflammation, which may potentially mitigate the symptoms of COVID-19. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that a de novo designed TCM JHJD could effectively inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV-2 through blocking of the interaction between RBD and ACE2. The inhibitory effect appears to be particularly potent against Omicron variants, as JHJD demonstrated enhanced efficacy in inhibiting the RBD-ACE2 interaction for several Omicron variants. Furthermore, JHJD could mitigate the virus-induced inflammation by targeting HIF-1. Collectively, this study suggested that JHJD preparation holds promise as a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID-19, as it not only inhibits the viral entry into host cells but also reduces the inflammatory responses triggered by the infection.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

To investigate this question, we generated a transcriptomic atlas of primary tumor and diverse metastatic samples from a patient with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who underwent rapid autopsy. Unsupervised archetype analysis identified both shared and site-specific gene programs, including lipid metabolism and gastrointestinal programs prevalent in peritoneum and stomach wall lesions, respectively. We developed a probabilistic approach for inferring clonal phylogeny from single-cell and matched whole-exome data. Distantly related genetic clones in the peritoneum express the lipid metabolism program, likely due to signaling by the adipocyte-rich peritoneum environment, and cells in most clones express multiple programs, suggesting that transcriptomic plasticity is a prevalent feature of metastatic cells. These deeply annotated analyses using a patient-centric platform provide a model for investigating metastatic mechanisms and plasticity in advanced cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

The evolutionary association of mobile elements with host-beneficial genes is known to be hindered by the stability of chromosomal loci and competition with mobile elements lacking accessory genes. Using a mathematical model that incorporates these constraints, we identify two key mechanisms that help over-come these barriers, resulting in the evolutionary linkage of accessory genes, like virulence genes, to prophages. First, we show that migration in between bacterial populations favours this linkage when the gene is beneficial in an environment (e.g. virulence genes) where prophage induction is also upregulated. Second, we show that within-population spatial dynamics also promotes the association of weakly selected genes and phages. Here, virion dispersal allows phage-encoded genes to spread into patches of bacteria lacking the gene, giving them a selective advantage over immobile chromosomal genes. While both of these mechanisms are evidently applicable to phages, this is less clear for plasmids and other mobile elements. This helps to resolve the long-standing question of why phages, rather than other mobile genetic elements, appear to frequently carry virulence genes as cargo. By demonstrating how spatial heterogeneity and phage lifecycle dynamics drive gene association, our work provides new insights into the evolution of phage-encoded pathogenicity and bacterial adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926583

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the isochorismate (IC) pathway is the primary route for pathogen-induced SA biosynthesis. First, the IC synthase (ICS) catalyzes the isomerization of chorismate to IC in chloroplasts. Second, the chloroplast-localized MATE transporter EDS5 appears to transport IC from chloroplasts to the cytosol. Cytosolic IC is then further converted to SA via the GH3 amino acid-conjugating enzyme PBS3. While this pathway is genetically well-characterized in A. thaliana, its evolutionary origin and conservation remain controversial. In this study, through comprehensive phylogenetic, structural, and functional analyses, we demonstrate that the IC pathway emerged within the Brassicales order in a time span between the divergence of Carica papaya and Capparis spinosa. The evolution of the IC pathway was driven by three key adaptations during the time span: (1) enhancement of ICS activity, (2) neofunctionalization of EDS5 after duplication of its ancestral gene, and (3) evolution of a PBS3, whose activity is specialized for glutamate-conjugation to IC. Structural modeling and functional assays reveal that an enhanced salt bridge network in ICS enhanced its activity. One of the duplicated genes, EDS5, acquired key amino acid substitutions in the C-lobe, which likely contributed to the EDS5 neofunctionalization. In addition, the functional PBS3 clade, including A. thaliana PBS3, is restricted to a Brassicales clade. Taken together, this study addresses the evolutionary trajectory of IC-based SA biosynthesis.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926584

To address these obstacles, we present the DASH assembly toolset, which combines features of Golden Gate-based cloning, recombineering, and site-specific recombinase systems. We developed (1) a set of donor vectors based on the GoldenBraid platform, (2) an acceptor vector derived from the plant transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC) vector, pYLTAC17, and (3) a re-engineered recombineering-ready E. coli strain, CZ105, based on SW105. The initial assembly steps are carried out using the donor vectors following standard GoldenBraid assembly procedures. Importantly, existing parts and transcriptional units created using compatible Golden Gate-based systems can be transferred to the DASH donor vectors using standard single-tube restriction/ligation reactions. The cargo DNA from a DASH donor vector is then efficiently transferred in vivo in E. coli into the acceptor vector by the sequential action of a rhamnose-inducible phage-derived PhiC31 integrase and arabinose-inducible yeast-derived Flippase (FLP) recombinase using CZ105. Furthermore, recombineering-based post-assembly modification, including the removal of undesirable scars, is greatly simplified. To demonstrate the utility of the DASH system, a 116 kb DNA construct harboring a 97 kb cargo consisting of 35 transcriptional units was generated. One of the CDSs in the final assembly was replaced through recombineering, and the in planta functionality of the entire construct was tested in both transient and stable transformants.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926584

In the most extreme case, a gene can be essential for viability in one genetic background, but dispensable in another. Although genetic context-dependency of mutant phenotypes is frequently observed, the underlying causes often remain elusive. Here, we investigated the genetic changes responsible for differences in gene essentiality across 18 genetically diverse natural yeast strains. First, we identified 39 genes that were essential in the laboratory reference strain but not required for viability in at least one other genetic background, suggesting that the natural strain contained suppressor variants that could bypass the need for the essential gene. We then mapped and validated the causal bypass suppressor variants using bulk segregant analysis and allele replacements. Bypass suppression was generally driven by a single modifier gene that tended to differ between genetic backgrounds. The suppressors often indirectly counteracted the effect of deleting the essential gene, for instance by changing the transcriptome of a cell. Context-dependent essential genes and their bypass suppressors were frequently co-mutated across 1,011 yeast isolates and identified naturally occurring evolutionary trajectories. Overall, our results highlight the relatively high frequency of bypass suppression in natural populations, as well as the underlying variants and mechanisms. A thorough understanding of the causes of genetic background effects is crucial for the interpretation of genotype-to-phenotype relationships, including those associated with human disease.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926584

Here, we aimed to elucidate the extent of glycolysis dependence in AML by focusing on the role of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), a key glycolytic enzyme converting pyruvate to lactate coupled with the recycling of NAD+. We compared the glycolytic activity of primary AML patient samples to protein levels of metabolic enzymes involved in central carbon metabolism including glycolysis, glutaminolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting glycolysis in AML, we treated AML primary patient samples and cell lines with pharmacological inhibitors of LDHA and monitored cell viability. Glycolytic activity and mitochondrial oxygen consumption were analyzed in AML patient samples and cell lines post-LDHA inhibition. Perturbations in global metabolite levels and redox balance upon LDHA inhibition in AML cells were determined by mass spectrometry, and ROS levels were measured by flow cytometry. Among metabolic enzymes, we found that LDHA protein levels had the strongest positive correlation with glycolysis in AML patient cells. Blocking LDHA activity resulted in a strong growth inhibition and cell death induction in AML cell lines and primary patient samples, while healthy hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells remained unaffected. Investigation of the underlying mechanisms showed that LDHA inhibition reduces glycolytic activity, lowers levels of glycolytic intermediates, decreases the cellular NAD+ pool, boosts OXPHOS activity and increases ROS levels. This increase in ROS levels was however not linked to the observed AML cell death. Instead, we found that LDHA is essential to maintain a correct NAD+/NADH ratio in AML cells. Continuous intracellular NAD+ supplementation via overexpression of water-forming NADH oxidase from Lactobacillus brevis in AML cells effectively increased viable cell counts and prevented cell death upon LDHA inhibition. Collectively, our results demonstrate that AML cells critically depend on LDHA to maintain an adequate NAD+/NADH balance in support of their abnormal glycolytic activity and biosynthetic demands, which cannot be compensated for by other cellular NAD+ recycling systems. These findings also highlight LDHA inhibition as a promising metabolic strategy to eradicate leukemic cells.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926584

TBCK-Encephaloneuronopathy (TBCKE) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by stop-gain variants in the TBCK gene. Clinically, patients show evidence of profound neurodevelopmental delays, but also symptoms of progressive encephalopathy and motor neuron disease. Yet, the physiological role of TBCK protein remains unclear. We report a human neuronal TBCKE model, derived from iPSCs homozygous for the Boricua variant (p.R126X). Using unbiased proteomic analyses of human neurons, we find TBCK interacts with PPP1R21, C12orf4, and Cryzl1, consistent with TBCK being part of the FERRY mRNA transport complex. Loss of TBCK leads to depletion of C12ORF4 protein levels across multiple cell types, suggesting TBCK may also play a role regulating at least some members of the FERRY complex. We find that TBCK preferentially, but not exclusively, localizes to the surface of endolysosomal vesicles and can colocalize with mRNA in lysosomes. Furthermore, TBCK-deficient neurons have reduced mRNA content in the axonal compartment relative to the soma. TBCK-deficient neurons show reduced levels of the lysosomal dynein/dynactin adapter protein JIP4, which functionally leads to TBCK-deficient neurons exhibiting striking lysosomal axonal retrograde trafficking defects. Hence, our work reveals that TBCK can mediate endolysosomal trafficking of mRNA, particularly along lysosomes in human axonal compartments. TBCK-deficiency leads to compartment-specific mRNA and lysosomal trafficking defects in neurons, which likely contribute to the preferential susceptibility to neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926584

This flexibility relies on network interactions encompassing premotor and prefrontal regions, including the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). However, the dynamic interplay between these regions during action preparation and execution based on contextual demands remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that contextual information is encoded in SMA and rIFG interareal connectivity before action. Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) during Go/No-Go tasks with varying target probabilities, we found that, during the preparatory stages of action, -band rIFG connectivity increased in contexts where motor responses were more frequently withheld. In contrast, SMA exhibited a reversed pattern only near the target onset. Finally, {beta}-band connectivity encoded proactive inhibition processes, increasing when action likelihood was low. Accordingly, during response implementation, both areas exhibited greater {beta}-band connectivity when action was withheld compared to when a motor response was required, further supporting its role in inhibitory control. Our results demonstrate that - and {beta}-band oscillatory network dynamics support context-sensitive adaptations, illustrating how premotor and prefrontal regions synergistically modulate their interactions as they transition from preparation to response. These findings advance understanding of how the brain integrates predictive information to dynamically organize motor and cognitive resources before an action unfolds, revealing that connectivity encodes critical information driving behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926584

Mitochondria and plastids evolved from bacteria and therefore also use prokaryotic-type expression machineries to synthesize proteins. However, fungi and animal mitochondria are highly sensitive to mistranslation, which for instance manifests in lethal mitochondrial cardiomyopathy disorder 2. The response in plant cells is unknown. Glutaminyl-transferRNAs (Gln-tRNAGln) of bacteria, mitochondria, and plastids are synthesized indirectly 3,4. Initially, tRNAGln gets charged with glutamate. Subsequently, Gln is produced through trans-amidation by the aminoacyl-tRNA amido-transferase complex GatCAB. Consequentially, affected GatCAB activity results in pools of misloaded Glu-tRNAGln. Here we show that Arabidopsis mutants with decreased GatCAB level provide global insights into organellar mistranslation in plants. Proteomics revealed Gln-to-Glu misincorporation in plastid- and mitochondrially-expressed protein complexes with only modest abundance changes in mutant plants. Plastids appear more lenient to mistranslation as they exhibit much higher Gln-to-Glu misincorporation. Through efficient compensatory mechanisms, mutant plants display surprisingly subtle phenotypes. However, their acclimation to temperature stress differs. Interestingly, wild-type plants under similar stress also have altered Gln-to- Glu misincorporation. Our study shows that the response towards organellar mistranslation varies among eukaryotes. In plants, this knowledge can be used to improve stress tolerance.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926584

Their compact size makes them ideal for space-limited environments, controlled growth chambers, speed breeding, ornamental horticulture, and urban horticulture. To validate their potential for gene editing, in vitro regeneration experiments were performed on a medium containing zeatin riboside. Regeneration was similar to parental S. melongena (1.2 shoots/explant), with Micro-Mel developing 1.0 and Mini-Mel 0.8. Whole-genome sequencing (23X coverage) identified 179,653 SNPs between the parental lines, revealing heterozygosity rates of 0.00098% for Micro-Mel and 0.00123% in Mini-Mel.

However, recent studies have emphasised local continuity with some individual-level mobility. We generated and analysed 248 historic genomes from Late Roman (3rd and 4th century CE) and Early Medieval (5th-8th century CE) burial sites in southern Germany, comparing them to over 2,500 contemporary and Iron Age genomes in addition to 1,344 modern-day genomes from Germany, Italy and Great-Britain. Despite small inferred Early Medieval period community sizes, genetic diversity exceeded that of modern German cities. In the Altheim graveyard, established in the 5th century by a group of Northern European descent, we inferred a demographic shift in the 6th century with the integration of newcomers with ancestry typical of a nearby Roman military camp, likely as a result of the collapse of Roman state structures. We reconstructed multigenerational pedigrees and, using a novel approach to infer ancestry of unsampled relatives, inferred immediate intermarriage between incoming and local groups, with a distinct tendency for men from former Roman background marrying women of northern descent. Burial proximity correlates strongly with kinship, in some cases spanning six generations. These communities were organized around small family units, exhibited loosely patrilineal or bilateral descent patterns, practiced reproductive monogamy, and avoided close-kin marriages. Such practices reflect broader transformations in family structures that began during the Late Roman period, were transferred to small agrarian societies in the Early Medieval period, and continued to shape European societies. By the 7th century, ongoing admixture had shaped genetic diversity patterns into those resembling Central Europe today.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926584

We analyzed visual opsin genes and their expression using 109 retina transcriptomes, focusing on differences among species at varying depths, and seasonal changes in the visual system of a seasonally migrating species. All species exhibit a multichromatic system with at least five cone opsins. While opsin sequence variability among species was minimal due to the flocks evolutionary youth, opsin expression patterns varied significantly. Deep-water species showed reduced SWS1 and SWS2B expression, consistent with diminished UV-to-violet light in deeper waters. Unexpectedly, we observed increased proportional expression of the red-sensitive LWS opsin gene, contrary to trends seen in other lacustrine fishes. Additionally, in the seasonally deep-dwelling species Coptodon imbriferna, opsin expression varied plastically between the rainy (shallow) and dry (deep) seasons, with reduced SWS2B expression when the fish reside in the deeper habitats. To add context of other cichlid systems and to explore shared patterns of molecular adaptation, we compared Bermin cichlids to the deep-water species of the Barombi Mbo crater lake. Both cases exemplify independent evolution of deep-water species, yet their visual systems adapted similarly in the single cones (less UV- and violet-sensitive and more blue-sensitive cones), whereas differently in the long-wavelength sensitive double cones (LWS expression lost in Barombi while increased in Bermin). Overall, our study focuses on an evolutionarily young example of cichlid adaptive radiation, providing a unique opportunity to examine the initial phases of molecular adaptation in visual systems.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926584

They also represent a complex ecosystem as intricate holobionts made up of microbes from all domains of the Tree of Life, that can play significant roles in host health and fitness [4]. The corallicolids are a clade of apicomplexans that infect a wide variety of anthozoans across the world, and can influence the thermal tolerance of habitat-forming corals [1, 5]. Despite their potentially important impacts on reef ecosystems, much of the basic biology and ecology of corallicolids remains unclear. Apicomplexans often have a closed life cycle, with minimal environmental exposure, and sometimes multiple hosts. Corallicolids have only been documented in anthozoan hosts, with no known secondary/reservoir hosts or vectors [6]. Here, we show that abundant corallicolid sequences are recovered from bearded fireworms (Hermodice carunculata) in tropical reef habitats off Curacao, and that they are distinct from corallicolids infecting the corals on which the fireworms were feeding at the time of their collection. The data are consistent with an active infection of fireworms, as opposed to corallicolids being a byproduct of feeding on infected corals, and we suggest that H. carunculata is potentially a vector moving corallicolids among coral hosts through its faeces. These findings not only expand our understanding of the ecological interactions within coral reef ecosystems but also highlight the potential role of host-associated parasites in shaping the resilience of reef habitats.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926584

While UCST-type (upper critical solution temperature) phase behavior has been studied extensively and can now be predicted reliably using computational models, LCST-type (lower critical solution temperature) phase transitions remain less explored, with a lack of computational models capable of accurate prediction. This gap limits our ability to probe fully how proteins undergo phase transitions in response to temperature changes. Here, we introduce Mpipi-T, a residue-level coarse-grained model designed to predict LCST-type phase behavior of proteins. Parametrized using both atomistic simulations and experimental data, Mpipi-T accounts for entropically driven protein phase separation that occurs upon heating. Accordingly, Mpipi-T predicts temperature-driven protein behavior quantitatively in both single- and multi-chain systems. Beyond its predictive capabilities, we demonstrate that Mpipi-T provides a framework for uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying heat stress responses, offering new insights into how proteins sense and adapt to thermal changes in biological systems.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926584

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying small-molecule partitioning remain largely unknown. Here, we first exploit atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of model condensates to elucidate physicochemical rules governing small-molecule partitioning. We find that while hydrophobicity is a major determinant, solubility becomes a stronger regulator of partitioning in more polar condensates. Additionally, more polar condensates exhibit selectivity toward certain compounds, suggesting that condensate-specific therapeutics can be engineered. Building on these insights, we develop minimal models (MAPPS) for efficient prediction of small-molecule partitioning into biologically relevant condensates. We demonstrate that this approach reproduces atomistic partition co-efficients in both model systems and condensates composed of the low complexity domain (LCD) of FUS. Applying MAPPS to various LCD-based condensates shows that protein sequence can exert a selective pressure, thereby influencing small-molecule partitioning. Collectively, our findings reveal that partitioning is driven by both small-molecule-protein affinity and the complex interplay between the compounds and the condensate chemical environment.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926584

This is predominantly because they cannot be modeled by a standard phylogenetic Q-matrix approach due to their non-discrete nature. In this manuscript, we explore the use of continuous traits under two Brownian Motion models to estimate a phylogenetic tree for Dicynodontia, a well-studied group of early synapsids (stem mammals) in which continuous characters have been extensively used in parsimony-based tree reconstruction. We examine the differences in phylogenetic signal between a continuous trait partition, a discrete trait partition, and a joint analysis with both types of characters. We find that continuous and discrete traits contribute substantially different signal to the analysis, even when other parts of the model (clock and tree) are held constant. Tree topologies resulting from the new analyses differ strongly from the established phylogeny for dicynodonts, highlighting continued difficulty in incorporating truly continuous data in a Bayesian phylogenetic framework.","NA","biorxiv",1741730926584
