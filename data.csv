MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]). Negative control outcomes did not show any indication of meaningful unobserved residual confounding.

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Genomic exploration continually reveals novel microbial lineages, often exhibiting extreme genome reduction, particularly within symbiotic relationships. Here, we report the discovery of Candidatus Sukunaarchaeum mirabile, a novel archaeon with an unprecedentedly small genome of only 238 kbp --less than half the size of the smallest previously known archaeal genome-- from a dinoflagellate-associated microbial community. Phylogenetic analyses place Sukunaarchaeum as a deeply branching lineage within the tree of Archaea, representing a novel major branch distinct from established phyla. Environmental sequence data indicate that sequences closely related to Sukunaarchaeum form a diverse and previously overlooked clade in microbial surveys. Its genome is profoundly stripped-down, lacking virtually all recognizable metabolic pathways, and primarily encoding the machinery for its replicative core: DNA replication, transcription, and translation. This suggests an unprecedented level of metabolic dependence on a host, a condition that challenges the functional distinctions between minimal cellular life and viruses. The discovery of Sukunaarchaeum pushes the conventional boundaries of cellular life and highlights the vast unexplored biological novelty within microbial interactions, suggesting that further exploration of symbiotic systems may reveal even more extraordinary life forms, reshaping our understanding of cellular evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1746396513796

While multiplexed single-molecule assays can address these issues, suitable functionalization of surfaces is required, which remains a technical challenge -- many commonly used approaches are constrained by random and sparse biomolecules arrangements, limiting programmability and throughput. An ideal anchoring method would enable (i) high surface densities to maximize throughput, (ii) precise control of spatial position and molecular identity for maximum control, (iii) covalent linking for high force application, and (iv) efficient patterning without the need for expensive facilities to maximize accessibility. To achieve these aims, we have developed a light-guided surface patterning method that can covalently organize oligonucleotides (oligos) without the need for lithographic equipment. Oligos with 3-Cyanovinylcarbazole (CNVK) nucleoside are crosslinked by UV patterns reflected through a digital micromirror device (DMD), with beads arranged accordingly. To demonstrate compatibility with established single-molecule methods, we performed single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments on patterned coverslips, using both magnetic tweezers and hydrodynamic-based systems. Our light-guided approach provides a scalable and accessible solution for biomolecular patterning that allows precise control over molecular identity and spatial positioning, enabling high-throughput measurements in single-molecule research.","NA","biorxiv",1746396513796

However, its direct cellular functions remain largely undefined. Using a multidisciplinary approach, our new data shows that LRP10 is required for the efficient trafficking of progranulin and prosaposin to lysosomes. Loss of LRP10 resulted in aberrant Golgi accumulations of progranulin and prosaposin and their reduced abundance in lysosomes. Disease-linked LRP10 missense mutations failed to support this lysosomal trafficking. Moreover, LRP10 KO mice developed striking microgliosis marked by enlarged and hyper-ramified microglia, accompanied by progranulin accumulation in the Golgi. Our results define LRP10 as a positive regulator of progranulin and prosaposin lysosomal protein trafficking and microglia homeostasis and thus shed new light on how its dysfunction may drive neurodegeneration in Parkinson's Disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.","NA","biorxiv",1746396513796

In this study we investigated the causative agent of acute conjunctivitis outbreak which occurred in Dar es Salaam between Jan 2024 and Feb 2024.

MethodologyWe conveniently collected a pair of eye swab samples from twenty-five patients presenting with symptoms of acute conjunctivitis at clinics in Dar es Salaam during the outbreak. One for bacterial culture and another for molecular detection. MacConkey and Blood agar were used to culture patient samples to identify possible bacterial causes. A Multiplex Real-time RT-PCR targeting Adenovirus, Metapneumovirus, Human Enterovirus and Parainfluenza. Positive samples with Ct value less than 30 for enterovirus were subjected to genomic sequencing by Illumina Miseq after library preparation and enrichment by Illuminas Respiratory Pathogen ID/AMR enrichment panel kit as per manufacturers instructions (RPIP kit), followed by bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis.

ResultsOut of 25 samples, nine samples were positive for human enterovirus by Real-time PCR. Of the nine positive samples four were sequenced and Coxsackievirus A24 variant, was identified as the most probable cause of the outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis showed that samples collected during the outbreak (28AO and 26HB) belong to a clade with Coxsackievirus A24 sequences from France Mayotte from a 2024 outbreak, also close to sequences from neighbouring East African countries (Uganda, Kenya) as well as South American countries (Brazil, Mexico, and French Guiana).

ConclusionThis study demonstrated the utility of genomic epidemiology in identifying Coxsackievirus A24 as the pathogen responsible for the outbreak and its circulation within the East African region.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

Since most of the neural matrix is composed of sugars, development of genetically encoded tags has been limited. Therefore, although several staining protocols exist for ECM in fixed tissue, there are no reliable matrix labels for live imaging. Here we report a viral-mediated fluorescent probe that binds to HA and labels the mouse brain ECM. The vector encodes the HA binding domain from neurocan fused to GFP and an externalization tag (AAV-Ncan-GFP), enabling transduced cells to secrete the fluorescent hyalectan into the extracellular space, thereby labeling HA. We demonstrate stable probe expression in organotypic brain slices, as well as in vivo in the mouse cortex, where it labels both perineuronal nets and interstitial matrix. We validate HA labeling through colocalization with HABP and sensitivity to hyaluronidase, and confirm the probes extracellular localization by shadow imaging. As a proof of concept, we combine AAV-Ncan-GFP with dendritic spine imaging ex vivo and calcium transient imaging in vivo, providing a real-time map of local ECM alongside neural function. The probe enables time-lapse imaging of ECM dynamics in live mice, facilitating longitudinal studies across a wide range of timescales, from minutes to days. The results establish AAV-Ncan-GFP as a valuable tool for real-time observation of brain ECM and a promising resource to explore ECM dynamics and brain function in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1746396513796

Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

Nasal anti-CD3 treats animal models of progressive MS by inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and lessen clinical disease. Methods: Ten patients with non-active secondary progressive MS (naSPMS) that continued to progress on B cell therapy were treated with nasal anti-CD3 (foralumab) for a minimum of six months in an open label study. Safety monitoring included otolaryngology evaluation and neurologic assessments including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC-4), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) and Low Contract Visual Acuity (LCVA). MRI and microglial translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging with [F-18]PBR06 were conducted. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic biomarkers and single cell RNA sequencing of blood was performed to evaluate foralumab-induced immunomodulation. The endpoints of our study were safety, clinical effects, microglial signal and immune measures. Results: All patients stabilized on EDSS scores and three of four patients treated continuously for 12 months had improvement on EDSS. Six of 10 patients had improvement in fatigue on the MFIS scale. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) or severe AEs and no new T2 lesions were observed on MRI. There was a reduction in TSPO-PET signal over six months (p<0.05). Changes in peripheral blood gene expression occurred as early as three months and affected antigen presentation, interferon responses and regulatory pathways in multiple cell types including FoxP3+ Tregs, CD4+ Tcm cells, CD8+ Tem cells, CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes and B cells. TGF{beta} expression was increased across cell multiple subsets. Interpretation: These findings identify a novel, non-toxic immune based therapy for the treatment for PIRA that acts by the induction of a regulatory immune responses and dampens microglial inflammation. Double blind placebo-controlled trials are warranted to explore nasal foralumab for the treatment of naSPMS.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

Building on recent research delineating a transdiagnostic ""neurodevelopmental spectrum"", we examined longitudinal associations between this spectrum in late childhood and other psychiatric dimensions in early adolescence, and the role of environmental/lifestyle factors as potential mediators of these associations.

MethodIn 11,875 children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, we extracted neurodevelopmental, externalizing, internalizing, detachment, and somatoform dimensions at ages 10, 11, and 12 years through confirmatory factor analysis of Child Behavior Checklist items. Using linear mixed models, we tested prospective associations between the neurodevelopmental spectrum at age 10 and other psychiatric dimensions at ages 11 and 12. Mediation models examined whether environmental (e.g., family conflict, school involvement) and lifestyle (e.g., sleep problems, screen use) factors at age 11 mediated these associations.

ResultsStrong longitudinal associations emerged between the neurodevelopmental spectrum and all other psychiatric dimensions ({beta}=0.417-0.641, p<0.001). Sleep problems were the most consistent mediator, accounting for 12-29% of the associations with all outcomes. Most results remained significant after multiple testing corrections and adjusting for covariates, mediators, and outcomes at baseline.

ConclusionOur transdiagnostic dimensional approach revealed a wide range of poor dimensional psychiatric outcomes in children with high neurodevelopmental traits. Sleep problems emerged as a key lifestyle factor underlying these associations and promising target for transdiagnostic prevention programs to improve mental health outcomes in this population.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

Caffeine is one of the most frequently administered medicines in neonatology - prescribed for the management of apnoea of prematurity, to aid extubation and increasingly for conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Caffeine guidelines for the management of apnoea of prematurity indicate use based on age of the infant, but this does not account for individual variation in apnoea rate. Consequently, infants may risk caffeine undertreatment or adverse events due to over-exposure. Apnoea in preterm infants is related to brainstem immaturity, hence as an essential first step to assessing whether brain maturity may be a useful biomarker for caffeine treatment, we tested the hypothesis that apnoea rate is related to brain maturity. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we demonstrate that apnoea rate in late preterm infants is dependent on brain maturity, not postmenstrual age. We provide initial evidence that when caffeine is discontinued, infants with immature brain activity have more frequent apnoeas and desaturations compared with those with more mature brain function. These findings indicate that brain maturity (assessed automatically using machine learning) is a candidate biomarker for personalised caffeine treatment in preterm infants.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

These technologies offer potential benefits, including addressing data privacy concerns, overcoming limited sample sizes, and accelerating research timelines by providing alternative data sources. By leveraging its internal knowledge, GPT-4o demonstrated the capability to replicate overall symptom prevalence distributions observed in a real PD patient dataset without significant statistical deviation. Despite these advantages, the widespread utility of AI-generated diaries based solely on internal knowledge is hindered by significant limitations identified in this case study. Key challenges include the failure to capture complex inter-variable correlations essential for understanding symptom co-occurrence, and a lack of the narrative richness, contextual depth, and linguistic nuance found in authentic patient reports. These findings underscore the constraints of current models in replicating real-world patient experiences without specific domain grounding. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach, including domain-specific fine-tuning, enhanced prompt engineering, and potentially hybrid data strategies to improve fidelity for high-stakes research applications. This case study explored the baseline capabilities and limitations of using GPT-4o's internal knowledge for synthetic PD diary generation. It emphasizes the need for a balanced approach, acknowledging the potential for exploratory uses while highlighting the necessity for rigorous validation and further development before deployment in contexts requiring high fidelity.

This study quantitatively assesses the structural and distributional fidelity of synthetic tabular data designed to represent PD patients. Methods: We compared a synthetically generated dataset (N=500 hypothetical entries) against an anonymized real-world dataset (N=57 PD patients) containing demographics, clinical scores (UPDRS, MoCA), and mobility data (6MWT-related variables). The evaluation focused on three key quantitative metrics: (1) Column Correlation Stability, measured by the average absolute difference between Pearson correlation matrices, assessed overall and for clinically relevant variable subgroups (6MWT, UPDRS, MoCA); (2) Principal Component Analysis (PCA), evaluating the variance captured by the top principal components in both datasets; and (3) Jensen-Shannon Distance (JSD), quantifying the distributional similarity between real and synthetic variables across different groups. Results: The overall average absolute correlation difference between the real and synthetic datasets was 0.049, indicating moderate preservation of pairwise variable relationships globally. However, stability varied across subgroups, with the 6MWT group showing higher fidelity (difference ~0.044) compared to the UPDRS (~0.080) and MoCA (0.081) groups. PCA revealed that the first two principal components captured 21.36% and 16.36% of the variance, respectively, with visual analysis showing partial overlap between real and synthetic data clusters. Average JSD values indicated moderate distributional similarity overall, with the MoCA group exhibiting the highest fidelity (JSD = 0.0573), while Demographics (0.1167), Clinical (0.1256), and 6MWT (0.1175) groups showed lower distributional similarity. Conclusion: Synthetic data generation techniques can replicate univariate distributional properties of PD patient data with moderate success, particularly for certain variable types like cognitive assessments (MoCA). However, accurately capturing the complex multivariate correlation structures, crucial for understanding symptom interactions and building predictive models, remains a significant challenge, especially within specific clinical domains like UPDRS. While synthetic data holds promise for addressing data access issues in PD research, particularly for tasks less sensitive to correlation structure, its application requires careful, context-specific validation. Further development is needed to enhance the structural fidelity of synthetic tabular data for high-stakes, multivariate clinical research applications.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

Peripheral melanin (eumelanin and pheomelanin) is cyclically produced and degraded, while neuromelanin accumulates in dopaminergic neurons over time. Neurons containing excess neuromelanin (e.g., substantia nigra) exhibit increased degeneration in Parkinson's patients, suggesting a potential genetic interplay between pigmentation pathways and Parkinson's Disease (PD). We used linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis, Mendelian Randomization (MR), and multi-trait association analysis to examine shared genetic architecture between PD and nine pigmentation-related traits (basal cell carcinoma, brown hair, melanoma, nevi, red hair, skin colour, tanning response, vitiligo, vitamin D levels). PRS analyses identified limited shared genetic variation (max 0.15% for nevi), and MR analyses did not provide evidence of a causal relationship. Together, the ten-trait and pairwise multi-trait analyses identified 48 SNPs with suggestive pleiotropy, 31 of which were protein-coding and could be mapped to 22 different genes. Overall, while some genetic overlap exists, no definitive correlative or causal relationships were established. These results contribute to the broader understanding of the differing roles of melanin and neuromelanin, as well as potential implications in neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

We aimed to map the research landscape of digital biomarkers in early AD obtained with wearable or portable digital health technologies (DHTs). Methods: In our scoping review, we included original research on portable or wearable DHTs where digital biomarkers were measured in populations of early AD (mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia). We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science and EMBASE with a wide search strategy with independent review and data extraction by two review team members and charted data in tabular/graphical form. Results: After deduplication and screening of 8 893 records, we included 109 studies describing a wide array of wearable or portable obtained digital biomarkers. The study population consisted of 3 462 individuals with MCI due to AD (54.6% female, weighted mean age 74 years), and 3 387 individuals with mild AD (48% female, weighted mean age 73 years). The most studied biomarkers were rest/activity (39%), speech (17%), and gait (14%), with most studies focusing on one domain. Few studies reported outcomes associated with diagnosis (16%) and prognosis (3%). Conclusion: We identified a growing evidence base investigating digital biomarkers in early AD. There is a paucity of studies examining diagnostic and prognostic properties, representing a knowledge gap. This overview may help to guide future research efforts to bridge the gap between the development and clinical implementation of digital biomarkers in early Alzheimer's disease.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

However, without a sole identifying metric, LVDD is assessed by a diagnostic algorithm relying on secondary characteristics that is laborious and has potential for interobserver variability. Methods: To characterize concordance in clinical evaluations of LVDD, we evaluated historical echocardiogram studies at two academic medical centers for variability between clinician text reports and assessment by 2016 American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) guidelines. We then developed a workflow of 8 artificial intelligence (AI) models trained on over 155,000 studies to automate assessment of LVDD. Model performance was evaluated on temporally distinct held-out test sets from two academic medical centers. Results: In a validation cohort of 955 studies from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, our AI workflow demonstrated 76.5% agreement and a weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.52 with ASE guideline assessment using human measurements. In contrast, the clinician report evaluation had 48.5% agreement and a weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.29 with ASE guidelines. In the Stanford Healthcare cohort of 1,572 studies, the AI workflow had 66.7% agreement and a weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.27 with ASE guidelines, while the clinician assessment had 32.7% agreement and a weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.06. Performance was consistent across patient subgroups stratified by sex, age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and coronary artery disease. Conclusion: Clinicians are often inconsistent in evaluating LVDD. We developed an AI pipeline that automates the clinical workflow of grading LVDD, which can contribute to improved diagnosis of heart failure.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

Methods: The study included 11221 farmers and farm workers who had work in banana cultivation in the French West indies (Guadeloupe or Martinique) between 1973 and 1993, followed up from January 1981 to December 2017. We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), causal mortality ratios (CMRs) and relative standardized mortality ratios (rSMRs) using regional reference rates. Results: SMR analyses showed mortality deficits in overall mortality and for almost all causes of deaths. In contrast, analyses using CMRs revealed a significant excess in overall mortality. The CMRs were significantly elevated for all cancers combined and for stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and hematopoietic malignancies, as well as for several non-cancer causes of death, including diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, non-ischemic heart diseases, pneumonia and diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. rSMRs were in general consistent with CMRs.

Blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) have shown promising clinical utility in MS, but they are insufficient to guide clinical management. Plasma tau proteins remain underexplored despite the growing evidence of shared pathology in Alzheimer's disease and MS. We aimed to: (1) assess the utility of plasma tau biomarkers (phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau181], p-tau217, and total tau [t-tau]) in MS diagnosis, subtyping, and prognosis; and (2) compare their performance with NfL and GFAP. Methods: From a clinic-based prospective cohort, we included 160 people with MS (pwMS; 117 with relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS], 43 with progressive MS [PMS]) and 20 non-MS controls, all with baseline plasma samples. We measured baseline plasma concentrations of p-tau181, p-tau217, t-tau, NfL, and GFAP using ultrasensitive immunoassays. We collected demographics, clinical information, and longitudinal multi-modal outcomes (Patient Determined Disease Steps [PDDS], normalized age-related MS severity score [ARMSS], walking speed, manual dexterity, cognitive performance, retinal nerve fiber layer [RNFL] thickness, total brain volume, and gray matter volume) over a median follow-up of 3.0 years (IQR, 3.5). Adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates, we evaluated associations between biomarkers and MS diagnosis, subtypes, and prognosis. We examined the enhanced value of tau markers, in addition to NfL and GFAP, for subtype distinction and outcome prediction. Participants were enrolled between 2017 and 2023. Analyses were conducted in December 2024. Results: Participants (n=180) had a median age of 51 years and were predominantly women (68%) and non-Hispanic white (91%). Compared with controls, pwMS had higher levels of p-tau217 (1.0 vs 0.7 pg/mL; p=0.04) and NfL (14.1 vs 9.0 pg/mL; p<0.01). Among pwMS, higher p-tau181 (aOR [95%CI]=2.3 [1.4,4.1]) and p-tau217 (aOR [95%CI]=3.0 [1.8,5.7]) were associated with PMS. These markers improved MS subtype classification accuracy beyond clinical features, NfL, and GFAP. Higher baseline p-tau181 and p-tau217 predicted worse disability, functional outcomes, and imaging outcomes independent of other biomarkers. Conclusions: Plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 are promising biomarkers for MS subtype classification and disability prediction, providing complementary information to NfL and GFAP. Further studies to validate their potential clinical utility in guiding MS management are warranted.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

To date, reported influenza A(H5N1) human cases have typically occurred in the lower respiratory tract with a high case fatality rate. There is prior evidence of some influenza A(H5N1) strains being a small number of amino acid mutations away from achieving droplet transmissibility, possibly allowing them to be spread between humans. We present a mechanistic within-host influenza A(H5N1) infection model, novel for its explicit consideration of the biological differences between the upper and lower respiratory tracts. We then estimate a distribution of viral lifespans and effective replication rates in human H5N1 influenza cases. By combining our within-host model with a viral mutation model, we determine the probability of an infected individual generating a droplet transmissible strain of influenza A(H5N1) through mutation. For three mutations, we found a peak probability of approximately 10-3 that a human case of H5N1 influenza produces at least one virion during the infectious period. Our findings provide insights into the risk of differing infectious pathways of influenza A(H5N1) (namely avian-human vs avian-mammal-human routes), demonstrating the three-mutation pathway being a cause of concern in human cases.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

Concurrently, variants such as NB.1.8.1, LF.7.9, XEC.25.1, XFH, and XFG exhibit enhanced growth advantages over LP.8.1.1, necessitating a comparative analysis of their antigenic and virological characteristics. Here, we evaluated the infectivity, ACE2-binding efficiency, and immune evasion of these variants. Pseudovirus assays revealed BA.3.2's robust antibody evasion, including resistance to Class 1/4 monoclonal antibodies; however, its ACE2 engagement efficiency was markedly reduced due to a closed spike conformation, leading to low infectivity. While XFG and LF.7.9 demonstrated strong immune escape associated with A475V and N487D mutations, their reduced receptor-binding efficiency suggested a need for compensatory adaptations. In contrast, NB.1.8.1 retained high ACE2 affinity and humoral immune evasion, supporting its potential for future dominance. Collectively, BA.3.2's current profile limits its ability to compete with emerging variants like NB.1.8.1. Sustained monitoring of BA.3.2's evolution, particularly for mutations stabilizing an open RBD conformation or enhancing escape from Class 1 antibodies, is essential to assess its outbreak potential.","NA","biorxiv",1746396513796

Since PTB infants are also at an increased risk of developing cerebral visual impairment after birth and cognitive and sensory deficits throughout life, this systematic review seeks to understand the interplay between PTB, cognitive, visual, and motor abilities and their influence on mental health outcomes in adolescence. We conducted a registered systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO #513150). The search strategy focused on the databases PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library and included publications sampling participants born in 1980 or later. We analysed 18 studies including a total of 13.655 adolescents aged 11-20 (PTB=8.813, control=4.852) published between 2004 and 2022. PTB adolescents exhibited consistent and persistent deficits in cognitive and motor domains compared to their full-term (FT) peers, including lower intelligent quotient (IQ), attention and executive function, and a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders. Several studies demonstrate that PTB adolescents require psychiatric treatment more often and get diagnosed with more complex psychiatric disorders. Evidence for functional visual alterations is scarce. These findings highlight the multitude of challenges that PTB children face across multiple domains including their mental health. Quantifiying these challenges individually may represent potential markers for tailoring early detection and intervention to this vulnerable population and optimising their long-term outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

Here, we present the largest study to date examining faculty anxiety, analyzing data from 2,106 professors across 62 U.S. higher education institutions using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) assessment. This comprehensive dataset revealed previously unknown patterns in how familial relationships and academic lineage influence faculty anxiety. Our analysis uncovered a clear relationship between academic rank and anxiety levels, with tenure-track assistant professors showing the highest anxiety scores (predicted GAD-7 = 7.9) compared to full professors. While academic discipline explains only 0.32% of anxiety variance, we identify institutional factors and family support as major moderators of faculty mental health. We find that close family relationships significantly moderated anxiety across institution types, with particularly strong protective effects at HBCUs/HSIs (b = -4.24, p = .015). Having an academic parent emerged as a novel protective factor, especially for faculty in STEM and Humanities (p < .018 and p < .010, respectively).

In Cameroon, maternal and neonatal mortality remain a concern. Unsystematic compliance with these measures increases the risk of HAIs and other medical hazards. The present investigation aimed at assessing the baseline understanding of hand hygiene principles and perceptions, experience of occupational exposure to body fluids, and preventive vaccination coverage among HCWs in the obstetrics-gynecology ward of a referral hospital of Yaounde.

MethodsA descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in the obstetrics-gynecology department of the health facility from April to July 2024. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from consenting HCWs. It was adapted from the WHO Knowledge Questionnaire for Health Care Workers.

ResultsA total of 41 healthcare workers participated in the study. Participants were predominantly female (78%) and ranged in age from 20 to 57 years. Staff knowledge of hand hygiene was average overall, with a median score of 60%. Most of respondents considered hand hygiene to be an essential part of their care (90%). Most of paramedical staff (82%) significantly agreed that they had been properly trained on hand hygiene during their training (p=0.006). More than half of respondents (59%) experienced an accidental exposure to body fluids in the previous 12 months. A significant factor associated with the occurrence of occupational exposure to blood and other body fluids was a high level of education (aOR=14; p=0.044). The coverage of fully vaccinated HCWs was 27% for viral hepatitis B, 19% for COVID-19, and 0% for cholera. Factors associated with low adherence to vaccination included not having received training in ICP interventions (aOR=7.37; p=0.046) for hepatitis B vaccination and having completed tertiary education (aOR=14; p=0.043) for COVID-19. Half of the HCWs exposed (12/24=50%) to blood and body fluids were not fully vaccinated against viral hepatitis B.

ConclusionsThis study revealed gaps in knowledge of hand hygiene, high occupational exposure to biological fluids and low vaccination. Health facility managers and national health authorities must therefore commit to implementing specific strategies to increase staff training in standard precautions and promote vaccination.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

It is estimated to affect one in ten people and can be extremely debilitating. With few publicly funded long Covid clinics, most people rely on primary care providers as a first point of contact. There is currently limited understanding of the experience of accessing primary health care by adults living with long Covid in New Zealand.    Purpose  To explore the experiences of accessing primary health care by adults living with long Covid.   Methods  A narrative inquiry approach was used to capture participants lived experiences of accessing primary health care. Zoom interviews and discussions were conducted with study participants. The automatically generated transcripts were reviewed and corrected and the collated data were analysed using Braun and Clarkes thematic analysis.   Results  Eighteen people participated in the interviews. Codes were identified and, through an iterative process, themes were generated, reviewed, and named. The seven themes included lack of upskilling of primary care staff; let down by the Government; self-advocacy and its cost; and throwing money at it.   Conclusion(s)  The picture painted by participants was bleak with a sense that the world had moved on from Covid-19 and left them behind, with some experiencing a lack of support in primary health care.

This suggests that a small sample-scanning step size is required to satisfy the Nyquist-Shannon sampling criterion. Recently, we have shown that a careful choice of apparent undersampling leads to aliased OTF copies that can be separated and stitched together in Fourier space to form a properly sampled OTF. In our demonstrations, this led to acquisition speed gains of between two- and four-fold. Here, we introduce a deconvolution-based method to reconstruct properly sampled volumes from apparently undersampled datasets that outperforms our previous Fourier-stitching approach.","NA","biorxiv",1746396513796

Cortical structure is highly heritable, but whether heritability varies across socioeconomic status (SES) is unknown. In this preregistered study, we estimated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability of cortical thickness, surface area, sulcal depth, and grey-/white-matter contrast (GWC) among 9,080 US 10-year-olds. We then tested whether genetic and environmental influences were moderated by parental SES, defined as a composite of income, education, and neighbourhood deprivation. Cortical thickness and surface area showed high heritability, while sulcal depth and GWC exhibited moderate heritability. However, among children from lower-SES backgrounds, cortical differences were less genetically influenced and more influenced by unique environmental factors, at times exceeding genetic contributions. These findings suggest that in contexts of socioeconomic disadvantage, children's brain structure reflect lived experience more strongly than previously recognized.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

While numerous studies have established substantial genetic contribution for LOAD, the interpretation of heritability estimates remains challenging. These challenges are further complicated by the binary nature of LOAD status, where estimation and interpretation require additional considerations. Through a systematic review, we identified LOAD heritability estimates from 6 twin studies and 17 genome-wide association studies, all conducted in populations of European ancestry. We demonstrate that these heritability estimates for LOAD vary considerably. The variation reflects not only differences in study design and methodological approaches but also the underlying study population characteristics. Our findings indicate that commonly cited heritability estimates, often treated as universal values, should be interpreted within specific population contexts and methodological frameworks.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

There is broad consensus regarding the necessity to optimise the preservation of the tree of life by including evolutionary information in conservation prioritisation, a notion also endorsed by major policy frameworks1-4. However, evolutionarily-informed prioritisations are lacking for most plants, resulting in a taxonomic imbalance in the evolutionary information incorporated in global biodiversity analyses, which has undermined conservation for decades. Here, we use comprehensive species-level phylogenetic trees, and extinction risk estimates, to generate the first global assessment of angiosperm evolutionary history at risk, and to identify phylogenetically-informed conservation priorities for the worlds flowering plants. We estimate that more than one fifth of angiosperm evolutionary history is at risk of extinction in the short term. Using the Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered5,6 approach, we identify 9,945 threatened plant species that disproportionately account for total evolutionary history at risk. Species and area prioritisations incorporating evolutionary history are urgently needed to correct imbalances between plants and animals, monitor the effectiveness of conservation efforts, and optimise conservation resource allocation in the face of increasing human pressures on Earths biodiversity.","NA","biorxiv",1746396513796

Saffron (Crocus sativus) supplementation has been linked to sleep improvements and gut microbiome changes, but its effect on sleep quality through gut microbiota-brain axis modulation remains unexplored. A randomised, placebo-controlled pilot study of saffron (30mg/day for 4-weeks) was conducted with 52 older adults (55-85 years) experiencing sleep complaints. Subjective and objective sleep quality were measured using validated questionnaires and electroencephalography-based sleep tracker respectively. A subgroup (n=26) underwent microbiome analysis. Saffron supplementation improved subjective sleep quality (p=0.02) and sleep efficiency (p=0.04). Objective measures showed reduced latency to persistent sleep (p=0.003) and sleep onset latency (p=0.03). Linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis of the microbiome revealed increases in Faecalibacterium (q=0.013), Lachnoclostridium (q=0.045), Prevotella (q=0.022), UBA1819 (q=0.020) and Oscillibacter (q=0.045), while decreasing Dialister (q=0.028). Univariate analysis further indicated increases in Lachnospiraceae-UGC-001 (p=0.020) and Roseburia (p=0.03), with a decrease in Turicibacter (p=0.045) in the saffron group. Oscillibacter and UBA1819 correlated with subjective measures of sleep efficiency (r=0.63, p=0.0007) and sleep latency (r=-0.39, p=0.04. Changes in Dialister, Turicibacter and UBA1819 were correlated with several measures of objective sleep quality including wake duration, latency to persistent sleep and wake-after-sleep-onset. Four-weeks saffron supplementation improved both subjective and objective sleep quality in older adults with sleep complaints, while increasing gut bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids. These results pave the way for further randomised controlled trials exploring the links between sleep quality and gut health and may help devising new preventative strategies for age-related brain disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1746396513796
