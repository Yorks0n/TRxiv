Yet to date, the mechanism of HGT among eukaryotes has remained a mystery. Here, we demonstrate that Starships, a newly discovered group of cargo-mobilizing transposable elements, are active vectors of horizontally transferred DNA among eukaryotic species. We find that multiple Starships simultaneously transfer themselves and their cargo within and between fungal genera separated by upwards of 100 million years of evolution. Transferred Starships are recovered in strains with and without selection for particular Starship-encoded phenotypes. Using whole genome sequencing, we exclude alternative hypotheses such as heterokaryosis, parasex or the random uptake of exogenous DNA by showing that only Starship DNA is precisely transferred. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the introduction of the Hephaestus Starship into a new species increases metal resistance due to the genes carried by this element. Between 18-27% of all Starships in our focal genus, Paecilomyces, have evidence of horizontal transfer under natural conditions, including to other fungal genera, revealing Starship-mediated HGT to be a widespread and frequent phenomenon across filamentous fungi. This study identifies the first active genetic mechanism for HGT between eukaryotic species.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

While LC symptoms vary widely, neuropathy is one of the most prevalent symptoms and drastically affects quality of life. However, the underlying pathophysiology of LC neuropathy remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the prevalence and potential mechanisms of LC neuropathy in the largest LC neuropathy cohort to date. Methods: We conducted an observational study of 977 adults with LC at Dell Medical School. Participants underwent clinical assessments, skin punch biopsy, and comprehensive metabolic, endocrine and immunological profiling. A subset of patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. Findings: Neuropathic symptoms were reported by 55% (534/977) participants, with skin biopsy confirming small fiber neuropathy in 57.7% (49/85) cases, affecting both epidermal and autonomic nerve fibers. Common risk factors for neuropathy, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, did not fully explain neuropathic symptoms. While general immunological markers (lymphocyte, T cell, and B cell count and CRP) were unremarkable, unexpectedly, we detected anti-ganglioside antibodies (AGAs) in 25% of patients with LC neuropathy. Longitudinal testing revealed persistent AGA positivity, and multiple elevated AGAs in a subset of patients. In a pilot treatment cohort of eight patients, IVIG treatment resulted in improvement of patient reported neuropathic symptoms. Interpretation: Our findings reveal a high prevalence of small fiber neuropathy in LC, with evidence suggesting an autoimmune mechanism involving AGAs in one in four LC neuropathy patients. The therapeutic response to IVIG further supports an autoimmune pathophysiology, suggesting potential benefits of immunomodulation in LC neuropathy patients.","NA","medrxiv",1741471437538

Social protection interventions can benefit TB-affected households. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the effectiveness of social protection on TB treatment and socioeconomic outcomes.

MethodsWe identified articles published from January 2012 to July 2024 by searching PubMed (includes MEDLINE), Embase, and Web of Science. We included studies that described at least one social protection intervention and reported on either TB treatment or socioeconomic outcomes for people with TB or TB-affected households. Random-effects meta-analysis was used for our primary outcome of interest, TB treatment success (treatment completion or cure). We performed a meta-regression to evaluate the association of study characteristics with odds of TB treatment success. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. This review was registered prospectively in the PROSPERO database (registration number CRD42022382181).

FindingsOur search generated 47,245 articles. Of the 50 which were eligible for inclusion, 36 reported TB treatment outcomes, 8 reported on socioeconomic, and two studies reported both TB treatment and socioeconomic outcomes. Random-effects meta-analysis of 24 articles found that people with TB who received social protection interventions during treatment had 2.23 times the odds of TB treatment success (95% CI 1.82, 2.74, I2 93.8%).

ConclusionSocial protection interventions significantly improve odds of TB treatment success. Outcomes and definitions used in our study have the potential to guide further research and implementation of social protection for TB-affected populations.

Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSSeveral studies have found that social and financial interventions designed to mitigate socioeconomic risk and promote resiliency, termed social protection interventions, have the potential to improve treatment outcomes for tuberculosis (TB), including treatment completion and cure. Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that social protection interventions can improve socioeconomic outcomes among TB-affected households such as averting catastrophic costs and negative financial coping strategies.

What this study addsThis is the first systematic review and meta-analysis that comprehensively evaluates the impact of TB specific and TB sensitive social protection interventions on both TB treatment and socioeconomic outcomes, thereby generating evidence on the ability of these interventions to curb the well-known cycle of TB disease and poverty. Through the use of an extensive list of search terms, expanded and systematic inclusion of outcomes of interest, and a focused definition of social protection interventions, our systematic review included the adequate number of high-quality studies needed to conduct a meta-analysis. Additionally, our systematic review evaluated implementation outcomes described in eligible studies which provides the basis for feasibility of these strategies in programmatic settings.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyOur study provides evidence that social protection interventions, when used in conjunction with standard biomedical treatment, have the potential to significantly improve TB treatment outcomes. This study fills an essential gap in existing synthesized evidence of the impact of social protection interventions on TB, socioeconomic, and implementation outcomes. Our findings also highlight the need for standardized definitions of social protection, as well as uniform reporting procedures, to better help evaluate the impact of social protection interventions for TB-affected individuals and households. Addressing these gaps provides scientific basis for meeting the commitments articulated in the 2023 United Nations General Assembly high level meeting for TB which calls for social protection for all individuals with TB.","NA","medrxiv",1741471437538

However, there is an ongoing need for novel TCM preparations. The aim of this study was to assess the potential and mechanism of a de novo designed TCM preparation: JinHuangJieDu (JHJD), which is composed of JIN YIN HUA, HUANG QIN, GUANG HUO XIANG, BAI ZHI, PU GONG YING and BO HE, for the treatment of COVID-19 using network pharmacology analysis and in vitro experimental validations. Methods: First, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established to validate whether JHJD inhibits the binding of wild type and mutant receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by JHJD was assessed with pseudovirus neutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and COS7-hACE2 cells. Network pharmacology analysis using Encyclopedia of Chinese Traditional Medicine (ETCM) and Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology databases (TCMSP) were further performed to identify the meridional network, active ingredients and targeted genes of JHJD. Interaction networks were constructed and gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analysis were performed using Cytoscape (3.7.1) software with ClueGO and CluePedia plugins. Vital genes were identified using CytoHubba and MCODE plugins. In vitro experiments were performed to confirm one of the targeted crucial gene and to validate whether JHJD may mitigate inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2. Results: JHJD effectively blocked the binding of both wild type and Omicron RBD of SARS-CoV-2 to human ACE2 and completely inhibited the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to ACE2-positive host cells in vitro. Network pharmacology analysis uncovered that JHJD comprises a total of 378 active ingredients and 339 targeted genes, with its primary actions likely focused on lung, stomach and spleen. A total of 63 significant KEGG pathways were enriched, predominantly related to viral infection and inflammation pathways. Two pivotal genes, CCND1 and HIF1A, were identified by intersecting the MCODE module genes with different node algorithms in CytoHubba. In vitro validation confirmed that JHJD could target HIF-1, reducing virus-induced inflammation, which may potentially mitigate the symptoms of COVID-19. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that a de novo designed TCM JHJD could effectively inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV-2 through blocking of the interaction between RBD and ACE2. The inhibitory effect appears to be particularly potent against Omicron variants, as JHJD demonstrated enhanced efficacy in inhibiting the RBD-ACE2 interaction for several Omicron variants. Furthermore, JHJD could mitigate the virus-induced inflammation by targeting HIF-1. Collectively, this study suggested that JHJD preparation holds promise as a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID-19, as it not only inhibits the viral entry into host cells but also reduces the inflammatory responses triggered by the infection.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

Borrelia is known to disseminate through organs, including the skin, joints, spinal cord, bladder, and heart, leading to Lyme arthritis, neuroborreliosis, and Lyme carditis. While previous studies have investigated the impact of LD on pregnancy in both mice and humans and have found the presence of B. burgdorferi in the uterus of mice, we studied the impact of LD on the non-pregnant female reproductive tract. We use a mouse model for LD and find an ongoing and severe infection of the reproductive tract of female mice, which persists up to 15-months post-inoculation. This infection results in uterine glandular cysts and endometrial hyperplasia as well as vaginal epithelial thickening, polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell epithelial infiltration, and epithelial desquamation into the vaginal lumen. Strikingly, we find that age has an impact on the extent of gynecologic pathology such that aged female mice (1-year old) that are reproductively senescent have more gynecologic pathology with infection compared to young mice (15-weeks old) when infected for the same length of time. Using large-scale electronic healthcare record data, we report that LD additionally results in increased infection-associated risk of menorrhagia (1.5-fold), miscarriage (1.62-fold), uterine fibroids (1.42-fold), and endometriosis (1.93-fold). Underreporting of gynecological outcomes is pervasive throughout many different infectious diseases, and LD-associated gynecological pathologies may have been similarly underappreciated in the field. This work suggests that further study of the female reproductive tract and the effects of B. burgdorferi infection therein will help clarify and expand the knowledge of myriad LD outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1741471437538

Subsequently, spillovers of the virus from dairy cattle to humans have been reported. Pigs are an important reservoir in influenza ecology because they serve as a mixing vessel in which novel reassortant viruses with pandemic potential can be generated. Here, we show that oro-respiratory infection of pigs resulted in productive replication of a bovine-derived HPAI H5N1 B3.13 virus. Infectious virus was mainly identified in the lower respiratory tract of principal infected pigs, and sero-conversion was observed in most of the principal pigs at later time points. In one animal, we detected the emergence of a mutation in hemagglutinin (HA) previously associated with increased affinity for mammalian-type alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid receptors, but this mutation did not reach consensus levels. Sentinel contact pigs remained sero-negative throughout the study, indicating lack of transmission. The results support that pigs are susceptible to a bovine-derived HPAI H5N1 B3.13 virus, but this virus did not replicate as robustly in pigs as mink-derived HPAI H5N1 and swine-adapted influenza viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

Despite its suggested high genetic and morphological diversity, key aspects such as nuclear DNA (nuDNA) population structure and relationship between body color patterns and genetic populations remain unclear. To address these gaps, this study analyzed genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nuDNA and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) markers in samples from Hokkaido to the Tokara Islands, Japan. Admixture analysis identified five distinct populations with significant geographic boundaries. These populations exhibited unique geographical patterns, spanning across islands and enclave distribution, indicating that G. dehaani populations have been shaped by complex factors, including sea level changes and volcanic activity. Regional body color variations partially aligned with SNP clades. Further, combining body color with collection locality data could help identify the specimen populations. Contrasting patterns between mtDNA and nuDNA suggest historical gene flow and adaptive introgression, emphasizing the need for caution when interpreting earlier phylogenetic studies based on combined mtDNA and nuDNA sequences. Our findings provide a foundational baseline for future research into the taxonomy, phylogeny, and population dynamics of the G. dehaani species complex, advancing our understanding of its evolutionary history.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

We examine the differences in phylogenetic signal between a continuous trait partition, a discrete trait partition, and a joint analysis with both types of characters. We find that continuous and discrete traits contribute substantially different signal to the analysis, even when other parts of the model (clock and tree) are held constant. Tree topologies resulting from the new analyses differ strongly from the established phylogeny for dicynodonts, highlighting continued difficulty in incorporating truly continuous data in a Bayesian phylogenetic framework.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

However, compiling these results into comprehensive reports often requires additional effort and technical skills. This creates a barrier for non-bioinformaticians, limiting their ability to produce reports from their findings. Moreover, the lack of streamlined reporting workflows impacts reproducibility and transparency, making it difficult to communicate results and track analytical processes. Results We present VueGen, a tool that automates the creation of reports from bioinformatics outputs, allowing researchers with minimal coding experience to communicate their results effectively. With VueGen, users can produce reports by simply specifying a directory containing output files, such as plots, tables, networks, Markdown text, and HTML components, along with the report format. Supported formats include documents (PDF, HTML, DOCX, ODT), presentations (PPTX, Reveal.js), Jupyter notebooks, and Streamlit web applications.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the isochorismate (IC) pathway is the primary route for pathogen-induced SA biosynthesis. First, the IC synthase (ICS) catalyzes the isomerization of chorismate to IC in chloroplasts. Second, the chloroplast-localized MATE transporter EDS5 appears to transport IC from chloroplasts to the cytosol. Cytosolic IC is then further converted to SA via the GH3 amino acid-conjugating enzyme PBS3. While this pathway is genetically well-characterized in A. thaliana, its evolutionary origin and conservation remain controversial. In this study, through comprehensive phylogenetic, structural, and functional analyses, we demonstrate that the IC pathway emerged within the Brassicales order in a time span between the divergence of Carica papaya and Capparis spinosa. The evolution of the IC pathway was driven by three key adaptations during the time span: (1) enhancement of ICS activity, (2) neofunctionalization of EDS5 after duplication of its ancestral gene, and (3) evolution of PBS3, whose activity is specialized for glutamate-conjugation to IC. Structural modeling and functional assays reveal that an enhanced salt bridge network in ICS enhanced its activity. One of the duplicated genes, EDS5, acquired key amino acid substitutions in the C-lobe, which likely contributed to the new function as the IC transporter. In addition, the functional PBS3 clade, including A. thaliana PBS3, is restricted to a Brassicales clade. Taken together, this study addresses the evolutionary trajectory of IC-based SA biosynthesis.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

While recent studies indicate that nucleosomes are clustered as condensed chromatin domains in higher eukaryotic cells, how histone H1 mechanically condenses chromatin remains unclear. Here, using a combination of direct visualization of single-H1 molecules in living human cells and multiscale molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the majority of H1 behaves like a liquid inside chromatin domains, rather than binding stably to nucleosomes as suggested by the traditional model. H1 functions as a liquid-like ''glue'', mediating dynamic multivalent interactions between nucleosomes within chromatin domains. Consistently, rapid-depletion of H1.2 leads to decondensed chromatin domains both in cells and in silico. Our findings suggest that the H1 ''glue'' condenses chromatin domains while keeping them fluid and accessible, thereby supporting essential DNA transactions.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

The evolutionary association of mobile elements with host-beneficial genes is known to be hindered by the stability of chromosomal loci and competition with mobile elements lacking accessory genes. Using a mathematical model that incorporates these constraints, we identify two key mechanisms that help overcome these barriers, resulting in the evolutionary linkage of accessory genes, like virulence genes, to prophages. First, we show that migration in between bacterial populations favours this linkage when the gene is beneficial in an environment where prophage induction is also upregulated. Second, we show that within-population spatial dynamics also promotes the association of weakly selected genes and phages. Here, virion dispersal allows phage-encoded genes to spread into patches of bacteria lacking the gene, giving them a selective advantage over immobile chromosomal genes. While both of these mechanisms are evidently applicable to phages, this is less clear for plasmids and other mobile elements. This helps to resolve the long-standing question of why phages, rather than other mobile genetic elements, appear to frequently carry virulence genes as cargo. By demonstrating how spatial heterogeneity and phage lifecycle dynamics drive gene association, our work provides new insights into the evolution of phage-encoded pathogenicity and bacterial adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

To investigate this question, we generated a transcriptomic atlas of primary tumor and diverse metastatic samples from a patient with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who underwent rapid autopsy. Unsupervised archetype analysis identified both shared and site-specific gene programs, including lipid metabolism and gastrointestinal programs prevalent in peritoneum and stomach wall lesions, respectively. We developed a probabilistic approach for inferring clonal phylogeny from single-cell and matched whole-exome data. Distantly related genetic clones in the peritoneum express the lipid metabolism program, likely due to signaling by the adipocyte-rich peritoneum environment, and cells in most clones express multiple programs, suggesting that transcriptomic plasticity is a prevalent feature of metastatic cells. These deeply annotated analyses using a patient-centric platform provide a model for investigating metastatic mechanisms and plasticity in advanced cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

While UCST-type (upper critical solution temperature) phase behavior has been studied extensively and can now be predicted reliably using computational models, LCST-type (lower critical solution temperature) phase transitions remain less explored, with a lack of computational models capable of accurate prediction. This gap limits our ability to probe fully how proteins undergo phase transitions in response to temperature changes. Here, we introduce Mpipi-T, a residue-level coarse-grained model designed to predict LCST-type phase behavior of proteins. Parametrized using both atomistic simulations and experimental data, Mpipi-T accounts for entropically driven protein phase separation that occurs upon heating. Accordingly, Mpipi-T predicts temperature-driven protein behavior quantitatively in both single- and multi-chain systems. Beyond its predictive capabilities, we demonstrate that Mpipi-T provides a framework for uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying heat stress responses, offering new insights into how proteins sense and adapt to thermal changes in biological systems.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

Current approaches to diagnosis rely on histology, which exhibits wide diagnostic variability and lacks access to molecular phenotypes that may stratify therapeutic response. Here, we leverage image-based spatial transcriptomics at sub-cellular resolution in longitudinal human cardiac biopsies to characterize transcriptional heterogeneity in 62 adult and pediatric heart transplant (HT) recipients during and following histologically-diagnosed rejection. Across 28 cell types, we identified significant differences in abundance in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells across different biological classes of rejection (cellular, mixed, antibody-mediated). We observed a broad overlap in cellular transcriptional states across histologic rejection severity and biological class and significant heterogeneity within rejection severity grades that would qualify for immunomodulatory treatment. Individuals who had resolved rejection after therapy had a distinct transcriptomic profile relative to those with persistent rejection, including 216 genes across 6 cell types along pathways of inflammation, IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling, IFN/IFN{gamma} response, and TNF signaling. Spatial transcriptomics also identified genes linked to long-term prognostic outcomes post-HT. These results underscore importance of subtyping immunologic states during rejection to stratify immune-cardiac interactions following HT that are therapeutically relevant to short- and long-term rejection-related outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

Here, we uncover a mechanism for developmental regulation of nuclear migration directionality. The nuclear envelope KASH protein UNC-83 in Caenorhabditis elegans exists in multiple isoforms that differentially control motor activity. The shorter UNC-83c isoform promotes kinesin-1-dependent nuclear movement in embryonic hyp7 precursors, while longer UNC-83a/b isoforms facilitate dynein-mediated nuclear migration in larval P cells. We demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of UNC-83a functions as a kinesin-1 inhibitory module by directly binding kinesin heavy chain (UNC-116). This isoform-specific inhibition, combined with differential affinity for kinesin light chain (KLC-2), establishes a molecular switch for directional control. Together, these interdisciplinary studies reveal how alternative isoforms of cargo adaptors can generate developmental stage-specific regulation of motor activity during development.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

They also represent a complex ecosystem as intricate holobionts made up of microbes from all domains of the Tree of Life, where many play significant roles in host health and fitness [4]. The corallicolids are a clade of apicomplexans that infect a wide variety of anthozoans across the world, and have been shown to influence the thermal tolerance of habitat-forming corals [1, 5]. Despite their potentially important impacts on reef ecosystems, much of the basic biology and ecology of corallicolids remains unclear. Apicomplexans often have a closed life cycle, with minimal environmental exposure, and sometimes multiple hosts. Corallicolids have only been documented in anthozoan hosts, with no known secondary/reservoir hosts or vectors [6]. Here, we show that abundant corallicolid sequences are recovered from bearded fireworms (Hermodice carunculata) in tropical reef habitats off Curacao, and that they are distinct from corallicolids infecting the corals on which the fireworms were feeding at the time of their collection. The data are consistent with an active infection of fireworms, as opposed to corallicolids being a byproduct of feeding on infected corals, and we propose that H. carunculata is potentially a vector moving corallicolids between coral hosts through its faeces. These findings not only expand our understanding of the ecological interactions within coral reef ecosystems but also highlight the potential role of host-associated parasites in shaping the resilience of reef habitats.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

This study investigates the Bermin crater lake species flock in Cameroon, comprising thirteen (nine valid and four undescribed) Coptodon species, to explore the effects of deep-water light environments on visual evolution. We analyzed visual opsin genes and their expression using 109 retina transcriptomes, focusing on differences among species at varying depths, and seasonal changes in the visual system of a seasonally migrating species. All species exhibit a multichromatic system with at least five cone opsins. While opsin sequence variability among species was minimal due to the flock's evolutionary youth, opsin expression patterns varied significantly. Deep-water species showed reduced SWS1 and SWS2B expression, consistent with diminished UV-to-violet light in deeper waters. Unexpectedly, we observed increased proportional expression of the red-sensitive LWS opsin gene, contrary to trends seen in other lacustrine fishes. Additionally, in the seasonally deep-dwelling species Coptodon imbriferna, opsin expression varied plastically between the rainy (shallow) and dry (deep) seasons, with reduced SWS2B expression when the fish reside in the deeper habitats. To add context of other cichlid systems and to explore shared patterns of molecular adaptation, we compared Bermin cichlids to the deep-water species of the Barombi Mbo crater lake. Both cases exemplify independent evolution of deep-water species, yet their visual systems adapted similarly in the single cones (less UV- and violet-sensitive and more blue-sensitive cones), whereas differently in the long-wavelength sensitive double cones (LWS expression lost in Barombi while increased in Bermin). Overall, our study focuses on an evolutionarily young example of cichlid adaptive radiation, providing a unique opportunity to examine the initial phases of molecular adaptation in visual systems.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

However, concerns remain that increased telehealth availability may contribute to higher overall healthcare utilization and spending. To assess telehealth's impact on outpatient evaluation and management (E&M) visit volume, we compared overall E&M utilization before and after the pandemic across specialties with varying levels of telehealth use. Methods: We analyzed 100% Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) claims to compare monthly outpatient E&M visit rates between two periods: pre-pandemic (January 2019-February 2020) and post-pandemic (January 2021-June 2024). Specialties were categorized by telehealth use as high (behavioral health), medium (primary care), and low (orthopedic surgery). A difference-in-differences (DID) analysis was used to assess changes in visit volume associated with telehealth. Results: Prior to the pandemic, telehealth accounted for just 0.1% of monthly E&M visits but surged to 41.0% in April 2020 before stabilizing between 5.7% and 7.0% in 2023-2024. The average monthly E&M visit rate per 1,000 FFS beneficiaries was 906.8 pre-pandemic and 918.6 post-pandemic. In the post-pandemic period, telehealth comprised 1.2% of E&M visits in low-use specialties, 8.4% in medium-use specialties, and 43.8% in high-use specialties. Compared to the expected trend based on the low telehealth-use specialty, high and medium telehealth-use specialties experienced a 4.1% and 7.2% relative decline in overall E&M visits, respectively, in the post-pandemic period. Conclusion: Following an initial surge, telehealth use stabilized in 2021 and beyond. Overall outpatient utilization remained stable post-pandemic, and increased telehealth adoption was not associated with a rise in total outpatient E&M visits. These findings suggest that broad telehealth adoption has not led to increased healthcare utilization among Medicare FFS beneficiaries.","NA","medrxiv",1741471437538

ObjectiveThis retrospective cohort study compares the overall spending, rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging procedures within 30 days for Medicare fee-for-service patients who underwent in-person and telehealth evaluations between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022.

DesignA large-scale retrospective cohort study using propensity score matching

SettingPatients with no prior visits and 30-day episodes of care initiated by telehealth or in-person visits from July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022.

ParticipantsThis study included 100% of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who are aged >65 years while excluding those with Medicare Advantage coverage and those without continuous Medicare Parts A and B.

Exposure(s)Comparison of index visits initiated by telehealth versus in-person visits.

Primary outcomeAdjusted 30-day total spending.

Secondary outcomes30-day rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging.

ResultsThe study included 30,079,958 participants with 36,709,528 and 429,891,125 episodes initiated by telehealth and in-person visits, respectively. The mean age was 76 for telehealth and 75 years for in-person. Telehealth-initiated visits were associated with lower 30-day spending ($260 vs. $342; net: -$82), though return visit rates were higher for telehealth (16.1% vs. 14.1%). Both lab test rates (7.8% vs. 24.2%) and imaging rates (3.5% vs 7.8%) were lower for telehealth-initiated care episodes compared to in-person-initiated care episodes.

Conclusions and RelevanceTelehealth-initiated episodes of care were associated with lower 30-day Medicare spending and reduced utilization of labs and imaging. These findings suggest that telehealth, when used as a substitute for office visits, may reduce overall Medicare spending.","NA","medrxiv",1741471437538

This flexibility relies on network interactions encompassing premotor and prefrontal regions, including the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). However, the dynamic interplay between these regions during action preparation and execution based on contextual demands remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that contextual information is encoded in SMA and rIFG interareal connectivity before action. Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) during Go/No-Go tasks with varying target probabilities, we found that, during the preparatory stages of action, -band rIFG connectivity increased in contexts where motor responses were more frequently withheld. In contrast, SMA exhibited a reversed pattern only near the target onset. Finally, {beta}-band connectivity encoded proactive inhibition processes, increasing when action likelihood was low. Accordingly, during response implementation, both areas exhibited greater {beta}-band connectivity when action was withheld compared to when a motor response was required, further supporting its role in inhibitory control. Our results demonstrate that - and {beta}-band oscillatory network dynamics support context-sensitive adaptations, illustrating how premotor and prefrontal regions synergistically modulate their interactions as they transition from preparation to response. These findings advance understanding of how the brain integrates predictive information to dynamically organize motor and cognitive resources before an action unfolds, revealing that connectivity encodes critical information driving behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

Central to JUNIPER is a statistical model for within-host variant frequencies observed by next generation sequencing, which we validated on a dataset of over 160,000 deep-sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Combining this within-host variation model with population-level evolutionary and transmission models, we developed a method for inferring phylogenies and transmission trees simultaneously. We benchmarked JUNIPER on computer-generated and real outbreaks in which transmission links were known or epidemiologically confirmed. We demonstrated JUNIPERs real-world utility on two large-scale datasets: over 1,500 bovine H5N1 cases and over 13,000 human COVID-19 cases. Based on these analyses, we quantified the elevated H5N1 transmission rates in California and identified high-confidence transmission events, and demonstrated the efficacy of vaccination for reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Using wavelet analysis of COVID-19 cases, we find that the periodicity of epidemic COVID-19 varies markedly across the U.S. and correlates with winter temperatures, indicating seasonal forcing. However, the pattern of multiple waves per year that has been so disruptive and unique to COVID-19 cannot be explained by seasonal forcing. Using a modified SIRS model that allows specification of the tempo of waning immunity, we show that specific forms of non-durable immunity can sufficiently explain the sub-annual waves characteristic of the COVID-19 epidemic.","NA","medrxiv",1741471437538

Single nucleotide polymorphisms form the vast majority of genetic variation and play critical roles in complex, polygenic phenotypes, yet their functional impact is poorly understood from traditional gene-level analyses. In-depth knowledge on the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms has broad applications in health and disease, population genomic or evolution studies. The wealth of genomic data and available functional genetic tools make Drosophila melanogaster an ideal model species for studies at single nucleotide resolution. However, to leverage these resources and potentially combine it with the power of functional genetics to enhance genotype-phenotype research, it is essential to develop techniques to predict functional impact and causality of single nucleotide variants. Here, we present FlyCADD, a functional impact prediction tool for single nucleotide variants in D. melanogaster. FlyCADD, based on the Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) framework, integrates over 650 genomic features - including conservation scores, GC content, and DNA secondary structure - into a single metric reflecting a variants predicted impact on evolutionary fitness. FlyCADD provides impact prediction scores for any single nucleotide variant on the D. melanogaster genome. We demonstrate FlyCADDs utility with some examples of application, including the ranking of phenotype-associated variants to prioritize variants for follow-up studies, evaluation of naturally occurring polymorphisms, and refining of CRISPR-Cas9 experimental design. FlyCADD provides a powerful framework for interpreting impact of any single nucleotide variant in D. melanogaster, thereby improving our understanding of genotype-phenotype connections.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

Its widespread use for basic research and biotechnological applications is, however, hampered by low efficiencies of current ncAA incorporation strategies. We uncover poor cellular ncAA uptake as a main obstacle to efficient genetic code expansion and overcome this bottleneck by hijacking a bacterial membrane transporter to actively import isopeptide-linked ncAAs within easily synthesizable tripeptide- scaffolds. Using this approach, we enable efficient encoding of eleven previously inaccessible ncAAs, decorating proteins with bioorthogonal and crosslinker moieties, posttranslational modifications, and functionalities for chemoenzymatic conjugation. To enhance scalability of protein production, we evolve the membrane transporter for preferential import of isopeptide- linked tripeptides, creating a novel Escherichia coli strain that facilitates single and multi-site ncAA incorporation with wild type efficiencies. Additionally, we adapt the tripeptide-scaffolds for co-transport of two different ncAAs, enabling their efficient dual incorporation. This work underscores the importance of optimizing ncAA-uptake for high-yielding production of modified proteins and will accelerate the development of generalizable transport systems, aiding incorporation of non-canonical building blocks to broaden the chemical space of proteins without the need to design for passive membrane permeability.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

However, direct evidence in support of this hypothesis is lacking. Here, we leverage cross-species functional neuroimaging to examine whether variability in brain functional connectivity reflects distinct biological mechanisms. We find that fMRI connectivity alterations in 20 distinct mouse models of autism (n=549 individual mice) can be clustered into two prominent hypo- and hyperconnectivity subtypes. We show that these connectivity profiles are linked to distinct signaling pathways, with hypoconnectivity being associated with synaptic dysfunction, and hyperconnectivity reflecting transcriptional and immune-related alterations. Extending these findings to humans, we identify analogous hypo- and hyperconnectivity subtypes in a large, multicenter resting state fMRI dataset of n=940 autistic and n=1036 neurotypical individuals. Remarkably, hypo- and hyperconnectivity autism subtypes are replicable across independent cohorts (accounting for 25.1% of all autism data), exhibit distinct functional network architecture, are behaviorally dissociable, and recapitulate synaptic and immune mechanisms identified in corresponding mouse subtypes. Our cross-species investigation, thus, decodes the heterogeneity of fMRI connectivity in autism into distinct pathway-specific etiologies, offering a new empirical framework for targeted subtyping of autism.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

To address these obstacles, we present the DASH assembly toolset, which combines features of Golden Gate-based cloning, recombineering, and site-specific recombinase systems. We developed (1) a set of donor vectors based on the GoldenBraid platform, (2) an acceptor vector derived from the plant transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC) vector, pYLTAC17, and (3) a re-engineered recombineering-ready E. coli strain, CZ105, based on SW105. The initial assembly steps are carried out using the donor vectors following standard GoldenBraid assembly procedures. Importantly, existing parts and transcriptional units created using compatible Golden Gate-based systems can be transferred to the DASH donor vectors using standard single-tube restriction/ligation reactions. The cargo DNA from a DASH donor vector is then efficiently transferred in vivo in E. coli into the acceptor vector by the sequential action of a rhamnose-inducible phage-derived PhiC31 integrase and arabinose-inducible yeast-derived Flippase (FLP) recombinase using CZ105. Furthermore, recombineering-based post-assembly modification, including the removal of undesirable scars, is greatly simplified. To demonstrate the utility of the DASH system, a 116 kb DNA construct harboring a 97 kb cargo consisting of 35 transcriptional units was generated. One of the CDSs in the final assembly was replaced through recombineering, and the in planta functionality of the entire construct was tested in both transient and stable transformants.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

TBCK-Encephaloneuronopathy (TBCKE) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by stop-gain variants in the TBCK gene. Clinically, patients show evidence of profound neurodevelopmental delays, but also symptoms of progressive encephalopathy and motor neuron disease. Yet, the physiological role of TBCK protein remains unclear. We report a human neuronal TBCKE model, derived from iPSCs homozygous for the Boricua variant (p.R126X). Using unbiased proteomic analyses of human neurons, we find TBCK interacts with PPP1R21, C12orf4, and Cryzl1, consistent with TBCK being part of the FERRY mRNA transport complex. Loss of TBCK leads to depletion of C12ORF4 protein levels across multiple cell types, suggesting TBCK may also play a role regulating at least some members of the FERRY complex. We find that TBCK preferentially, but not exclusively, localizes to the surface of endolysosomal vesicles and can colocalize with mRNA in lysosomes. Furthermore, TBCK-deficient neurons have reduced mRNA content in the axonal compartment relative to the soma. TBCK-deficient neurons show reduced levels of the lysosomal dynein/dynactin adapter protein JIP4, which functionally leads to TBCK-deficient neurons exhibiting striking lysosomal axonal retrograde trafficking defects. Hence, our work reveals that TBCK can mediate endolysosomal trafficking of mRNA, particularly along lysosomes in human axonal compartments. TBCK-deficiency leads to compartment-specific mRNA and lysosomal trafficking defects in neurons, which likely contribute to the preferential susceptibility to neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

This study used AlphaFold to predict the structures of the D1 protein, the core subunit of photosystem II, across a broad range of photosynthetic organisms. The prediction produced high-confidence structures, and structural alignment analyses highlighted conserved regions across the different D1 groups, which were in line with high pLDDT scoring regions. In contrast, varying pLDDT in the DE loop and terminal regions appear to correlate with different degrees of structural flexibility or disorder. Subsequent structural phylogenetic analysis provided a phylogeny that is in good agreement with previous sequence-based studies. Moreover, the phylogeny supports a parsimonious scenario in which far-red D1 and D1INT evolved from the ancestral form of G4 D1. This study demonstrates the potential of AlphaFold in studies on structural diversity and the evolution of photosynthesis.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

The genetic and molecular details of NC specification are governed by a complex, yet still partially understood gene regulatory network (NC-GRN). In particular, the precise function of microRNAs (miRNA) in this network remains poorly characterized. miRNAs are short non-coding 20-22 nucleotides long RNAs, which control gene expression through post-transcriptional repression. Since miRNA-196a is expressed in the developing neural and NC cells of Xenopus laevis embryos, we here investigated miR-196a function in the NC-GRN, by knocking-down its expression using antisense morpholinos. Depletion of miR-196a revealed major NC and craniofacial phenotypes. These defects were preceded by the perturbed expression of key neural, neural border and NC markers such as sox2/3, zic1/3, pax3, sox10 and snail2. Using RNA sequencing of individual neural border and NC explants, we have identified a signature of genes up- and down-regulated by miR-196a and validate these with rescue experiments using a miRNA mimic. Our study identifies miR-196a as a key actor of early patterning in the dorsal ectoderm, balancing the extent of immature neural plate progenitors with NC and placode specification, while also promoting neuron differentiation within the neural plate.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

How IPH drives plaque instability is unknown. However, its identification and quantification in atherosclerotic plaques is currently performed manually, with high inter-observer variability, limiting its accurate assessment in large cohorts. Leveraging the Athero-Express biobank, an ongoing study comprising a comprehensive dataset of histological, transcriptional, and clinical information from 2,595 carotid endarterectomy patients, we developed an attention-based additive multiple instance learning (MIL) framework to automate the detection and quantification of IPH across whole-slide images of nine distinct histological stains. We demonstrate that routinely available Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining outperformed all other plaque relevant Immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains tested (AUROC = 0.86), underscoring its utility in quantifying IPH. When combining stains through ensemble models, we see that H&E + CD68 (a macrophage marker) as well as H&E + Verhoeff-Van Gieson elastic fibers staining (EVG) leads to a substantial improvement (AUROC = 0.92). Using our model, we could derive IPH area from the MIL-derived patch-level attention scores, enabling not only classification but precise localisation and quantification of IPH area in each plaque, facilitating downstream analyses of its association and cellular composition with clinical outcomes. By doing so, we demonstrate that IPH presence and area are the most significant predictors of both preoperative symptom presentation and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), outperforming manual scoring methods. Automating IPH detection also allowed us to characterise IPH on a molecular level at scale. Pairing IPH measurements with single-cell transcriptomic analyses revealed key molecular pathways involved in IPH, including TNF- signalling, extracellular matrix remodelling and the presence of foam cells. This study represents the largest effort in the cardiovascular field to integrate digital pathology, machine learning, and molecular data to predict and characterize IPH which leads to better understanding how it drives symptoms and MACE. Our model provides a scalable, interpretable, and reproducible method for plaque phenotyping, enabling the derivation of plaque phenotypes for predictive modelling of MACE outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1741471437538

Previous studies have established that bypass of DPCs by the eukaryotic replicative helicase, CMG complex, is critical for DPC repair. We investigated the mechanism of leading-strand DPC bypass by CMG using purified components. Our results reveal that CMG can bypass DPCs in the presence of downstream single-stranded DNA, without the aid of other replisome factors. DPC bypass is a slow process, and its efficiency depends on the size and structure of the protein barrier. DPC bypass does not require CMG to interact with the excluded strand or to unfold the protein adduct, implying that the CMG helicase ring opens to navigate past a DPC. Furthermore, opening of no single MCM interface is essential for bypass, suggesting a flexible ring opening mechanism. Our work highlights the remarkable versatility of the CMG complex in navigating replication challenges, ensuring proper replication fork progression and preserving genome stability.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

Methods: We used weighted data from the YRBS for 2011-2023 (n=110,409). We explored the impact of declining school and student response rates, missing data, and shifts in age distribution in 2021 on reported sexual intercourse. Using statistical decomposition, we estimated the percentage change in this outcome between 2019 and 2021 due to change in the age structure versus changes in reported behavior. Results: From 2011 and 2023, school and student survey response rates declined (school 81% to 40%, student 87% to 71%, and overall, 71% to 35%). Missing data on ever had sex increased over time from 7.0% in 2011 to 29.5% in 2019 and 19.8% in 2023. The age structure in the YRBS national sample was similar from 2011-2019 and in 2023, but substantially younger in 2021. Statistical decomposition estimated that 50% of the change in sexual experience among adolescent women between 2019 and 2021 and 30% of the change for adolescent men was due to a change in the age distribution. Implications: Declining response rates, increased missing data, and changes in the age structure of 2021 YRBS raise serious concerns about the validity of trends in the YRBS. A concerted national effort is needed to build support for the collection of YRBS and other public health surveillance data.","NA","medrxiv",1741471437538

Previous work has shown that grapevine-associated microbiota follow distinct biogeographic patterns, associated with climate and soil properties, and that even neighboring vineyards can harbor distinct microbial communities, but it is unclear whether these differences persist when controlling for variations in farming practices, cultivar, and climate, and whether site-specific microbial profiles change during processing in the winery. Here we investigated the bacterial and fungal microbiota of fruit pre- and post-harvest from two nearby vineyards planted to a single variety, geographically close to one another, and farmed the same way, and then processed in a single winery. These communities subtly changed during processing yet retained distinct site-specific signatures, indicating a partial contribution of the winery environment to the microbiota of grape must and juice pre-fermentation. We also profiled the microbiota of key microbial sources in the winery environment, including fruit flies and processing equipment, demonstrating that the microbiota at these sites reflect contact with plant material, harbor communities distinct from fruit, and appear to partially contribute to the fermentation assemblage, especially via the contribution of fermentative yeasts that are rare or missing in the vineyard environment. These results bolster previous reports of site-specific microbial signatures in winegrowing and make a first estimation of the changes to the grape-associated microbiome during early processing. </SPAN>","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

However, many roles of Muller cells remain largely unknown, particularly for those in the inflamed retina. In this article, we reanalyzed a single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset from Aire-/- mice, which exhibits autoimmune retinal inflammation, specifically focusing on Muller cells and T cells, identifying nine distinct Muller cell subgroups along with five T cell subgroups. Among them, three subgroups of Muller cells are activated Muller cells, representing over 60% Muller cells in the inflamed retina. Using SCassist - an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based workflow assistant for single-cell analysis, we constructed a comparison matrix to quantify the involvement of pathways characterizing the functions of each Muller cell subgroups. The activated Muller cells primarily present a macrophage like phenotype with or without augmentation of the known Muller cell functions. Trajectory analysis further identified two paths, validating the presence of these two phenotypes, governed by Neurod1 and Irf family transcription factors (TFs). We also inferred the interactions between Muller cells and T cells and observed that activated Muller cells do not exhibit extra chemoattraction to Th1 cells compared to other Muller cells but display nearly exclusive expression of immune check-point molecules, primarily targeting Th1 cells. Our findings open new avenues for understanding the specialized mechanisms of retinal pathogenic autoimmunity and identifying candidates to explore potential inhibitory pathways in the inflamed retina.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

We delineated variants that affected both expression and function, affected function independently of expression, and discrepantly affected migration and proliferation. We also used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of activated, ligand-bound P2RY8, providing structural insights into the effects of variants on ligand binding and signal transmission. We applied the deep mutational scanning results to both improve computational variant effect predictions and to characterize the phenotype of germline variants and lymphoma-associated variants. Together, our results demonstrate the power of integrating deep mutational scanning, structure determination, and in silico prediction to advance the understanding of a receptor important in human health.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

In the nematode C. elegans, extended starvation during the first larval stage causes the development of germline tumors and other abnormalities in the adult gonad, limiting reproductive success. Insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) acts through WNT signaling and lipid metabolism to promote starvation-induced gonad abnormalities, but IIS-independent modifiers have not been identified. We show that the tumor suppressors daf-18/PTEN and lin-35/Rb act independently of IIS to suppress starvation-induced abnormalities. We found that lin-35/Rb antagonizes activity of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling homologs ptr-23/PTCH-related, wrt-1/Hh-like, wrt-10/Hh-like, and tra-1/GLI, which promote starvation-induced abnormalities. These Hh-related genes transcriptionally activate several genes associated with innate immunity in adults, which also promote starvation-induced gonad abnormalities. Surprisingly, we found that in addition to causing developmental abnormalities, early-life starvation induces an innate immune response later in life, leading to increased resistance to multiple bacterial pathogens. This work identifies a critical tumor-suppressor function of daf-18/PTEN independent of IIS, and it defines a regulatory network, including lin-35/Rb, Hh-related signaling, and the innate immunity pathway, that affects development of tumors and other developmental abnormalities resulting from early life starvation. By revealing that early-life starvation increases immunity later in life, this work suggests a fitness tradeoff between pathogen resistance and developmental robustness.

AUTHOR SUMMARYEarly life malnutrition can promote adult disease, including the risk of developing cancer. We previously found that the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans develops tumors in well-fed adults following early life starvation, reflecting a breakdown of developmental fidelity. This powerful model system provides an excellent opportunity to identify molecular mechanisms that mediate the effects of early life starvation on development and adult physiology. Reducing insulin-like/IGF signaling during recovery from starvation suppresses tumor formation, but other regulatory pathways have not been identified. Here we show that a pair of important tumor suppressor genes, daf-18/PTEN and lin-35/Rb, function independently of insulin/IGF signaling to suppress starvation-induced abnormalities. lin-35/Rb represses the activity of genes involved in Hedgehog signaling, a cancer-causing pathway, which promote starvation-induced abnormalities. Hedgehog signaling activates an immune response, which, surprisingly, contributes to formation of tumors but renders adult worms resistant to pathogenic bacteria. Adult activation of this immune response by early life starvation suggests an evolutionary fitness tradeoff between pathogen resistance and developmental fidelity.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

Herein, we designed Stereo-seq chips to simultaneously capture the in situ transcriptomes of both the host and JEV, constructing a comprehensive spatiotemporal pathological landscape for Japanese encephalitis (JE). This study reveals the central role of the vascular system in JE pathogenesis, particularly the meninges, which displayed the strongest signal of inflammation and cell death in the JEV-infected brain. The activation of the Ackr1+ endothelial cells, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, the migration of JEV-infected monocytes, secretion of immune factors by the infected cells, and the occurrence of pyroptosis and necroptosis form a positive feedback loop, resulting in an increasing influx of immune cells and tissue damage. JEV infection leads to neurological impairments, which may be attributed to the interaction between viral proteins and host cellular factors such as Stat1, Stat3, Nfkb1, and Sp1. As the vascular system serves as a central receiver and amplifier of inflammatory signals, regulating inflammation within the vascular system is essential in mitigating JE progression.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

While pollinators such as hummingbirds (Trochilidae) have diet breadths that are constrained by trait-matching with flowers, nectar-robbing flowerpiercers are tanagers (Thraupidae) that typically drink nectar from holes they pierce near the flower's base. Consequently, distinct movement patterns for these two bird families would be expected from optimal foraging theory, yet little is known about how tropical nectarivores move in response to fluctuating conditions. We used fine-resolution tracking data from an automated radio telemetry grid to compare movement patterns between hummingbirds and flowerpiercers in high-Andean mountain ecosystems. We obtained an accumulated total of 435,513 location estimates and 452 tracking days from 22 individuals across six different bird species. Our results indicate that hummingbirds exhibit a greater diversity of movement behaviours in comparison to flowerpiercers, with varying space use and recursion patterns that are characteristic of sedentary, commuting/traplining and exploratory strategies, whereas most species of flowerpiercers were classified as central-place foragers. However, daily movement metrics show that there is substantial variation, and hierarchical clustering does not necessarily group together bird families, species, nor even individuals as more similar to each other. Flexibility in daily movement behaviours has seldom been described for neotropical nectarivorous birds in the wild. It emerges as an important trait to adjust behaviour to variable local contexts, and may be adaptive for persistence in challenging mountain ecosystems where weather conditions are harsh and floral resources are seasonal and limited. A better understanding of flexibility in movement behaviour can enhance our predictions about how animals respond to environmental change and anthropogenic pressures.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

Reducing visual experience shortens myelin sheath length and slows the conduction velocity of the optic nerve. However, the mechanism underlying such experience-dependent myelination is unclear. Here, we found that closing both eyes, binocular deprivation (BD), during the juvenile period less affects the optic nerve myelination than monocular deprivation (MD) via GABA signaling. RNA-seq analysis of optic nerves from MD and BD mice revealed that GABAergic signaling is downregulated on the deprived side of MD compared to the intact side and BD. Inhibition of GABAergic signaling during the juvenile period resulted in myelin sheath shortening and excessive oligodendrocyte generation in normal mice, similar to the changes observed in MD mice. Enhancing GABAergic signaling rescued the myelin sheath shortening and excessive oligodendrocyte generation in the optic nerve of MD mice. Furthermore, we identified novel GABAergic neurons located within the optic nerve, whose neurites form belt-like presynaptic structures with the oligodendrocyte lineage cells, suggesting a potential source of the GABAergic inputs into oligodendrocytes. Our results indicate that the myelination of visual pathway is maintained by binocular visual inputs via intra-nerve GABA signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

Reflecting these diverse roles, the DRN is composed of molecularly distinct and topographically organized groups of neurons that target specific regions of the forebrain. Despite these insights, fundamental questions remain regarding how DRN neurons process sensory information, what do DRN communicate to forebrain, and the role of DRN inputs in forebrain computations and animal behavior.To address these questions, we investigated the spatiotemporal activity patterns of DRN neurons, along with DRN axons and their targets in the juvenile zebrafish forebrain. Our findings revealed a remarkable topographic organization of ongoing activity and sensory-motor responses within the DRN. We discovered that a large fraction of DRN neurons are primarily driven by animals locomotor activity. We also observed that an anterior group of DRN neurons, marked by Gad1, exhibited distinct activity patterns during rest, locomotor activity and sensory stimulation. DRN axons broadly innervating the forebrain exhibit topographically organized excitation and inhibition in response to sensory stimulation and motor activity. Notably, we observed significant and rapid covariation between the activity of DRN axons and nearby forebrain neurons. Chemogenetic ablation of the DRN led to a marked reduction in the synchrony and sensory-motor responses across forebrain neurons, accompanied by significant deficits in adaptive behaviors. Collectively, our findings revealed the functional diversity of DRN neurons and their role in transmitting sensory and locomotor signals via topographically organized projections, which can regulate forebrain activity and play a crucial role in modulating animal behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

Immune and inflammatory tissue damage is the main pathogenic mechanism in rheumatoid arthritis, and involves the hyperactivation of both innate and adaptive immune systems. Trained immunity has become well established as an important feature of the innate immune system that allows the host to mount functionally altered immune responses based on their previous history of immune exposures, independently of the classical adaptive immunological memory. However, the role of trained immunity in systemic autoimmune and inflammatory disorders remains poorly understood. In the current work, we demonstrate that emergency myelopoiesis is induced in chronic rheumatoid arthritis in murine models and acts not only to enhance innate immune cell numbers but also to produce functionally altered innate immune cells. Such effects are cell-intrinsic to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and persist independently of the inflammatory disease milieu. Importantly, these trained immunity mechanisms impact not only macrophages but also dendritic cells, which are the major antigen presenting cells that bridge the innate and adaptive immune responses. ""Trained"" dendritic cells show changes in global gene expression profiles, and significantly altered responses to recall immune stimulation and capacity for T cell activation. This study therefore represents the first demonstration of ""dendritic cell trained immunity"" in rheumatoid arthritis.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

Such efforts have primarily been implemented at the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), providing data for large resident populations but hindering the ability to implement targeted interventions or follow-ups. Conversely, building-level wastewater data exhibits increased variability due to rapid daily population dynamics but allows for targeted follow-up interventions or mitigation efforts. Here, we implemented a three-site wastewater sampling strategy on our university-affiliated medical campus from May 2021 to March 2024, comprised of two distinct hospital quadrants and a primarily research laboratory and classroom building. We first addressed several limitations in implementing hospital-level wastewater surveillance by optimizing sampling frequency and laboratory techniques. We subsequently improved our ability to model SARS-CoV-2 case counts using wastewater data by performing sensitivity analyses on viral shedding assumptions and testing the utility of internal normalization factors for population size. Our unique infrastructure allowed us to detect intra-hospital dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and diversity and confirmed that direct sequencing of wastewater was able to capture corresponding clinical viral diversity. In contrast, research building wastewater sampling showed that for most non-residential settings, despite low overall viral loads, a threshold approach can still be used to identify peaks in cases or transmission amongst the general population. Our study expands on current wastewater surveillance practices by examining the utility of and best practices for upstream and particularly hospital settings, enabling the use of non-municipal, medium-scale wastewater testing to inform efforts for reducing the burden of COVID-19.

ImportanceSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater surveillance has been increasingly implemented to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Most wastewater testing across the United States occurs at municipal wastewater treatment plants. Yet, this testing method could also be beneficial at non-municipal and non-residential sites, including hospitals, where wastewater data for SARS-CoV-2 signals and viral diversity could directly impact hospital practices to control its spread. We analyzed both hospital and non-residential research building wastewater over a three-year period to establish optimized methods for collecting and interpreting wastewater data at sites upstream of treatment plants. We found that even within a single hospital building, wastewater testing in different locations showed distinct signatures over time, which corresponded with data from patients hospitalized in those locations. This study provides a framework for the use of wastewater viral surveillance upstream of municipal treatment plants to enable targeted interventions to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","NA","medrxiv",1741471437538

However, recent studies have emphasised local continuity with some individual-level mobility. We generated and analysed 248 historic genomes from Late Roman (3rd and 4th century CE) and Early Medieval (5th-8th century CE) burial sites in southern Germany, comparing them to over 2,500 contemporary and Iron Age genomes in addition to 1,344 modern-day genomes from Germany, Italy and Great-Britain. Despite small inferred Early Medieval period community sizes, genetic diversity exceeded that of modern German cities. In the Altheim graveyard, established in the 5th century by a group of Northern European descent, we inferred a demographic shift in the 6th century with the integration of newcomers with ancestry typical of a nearby Roman military camp, likely as a result of the collapse of Roman state structures. We reconstructed multigenerational pedigrees and, using a novel approach to infer ancestry of unsampled relatives, inferred immediate intermarriage between incoming and local groups, with a distinct tendency for men from former Roman background marrying women of northern descent. Burial proximity correlates strongly with kinship, in some cases spanning six generations. These communities were organized around small family units, exhibited loosely patrilineal or bilateral descent patterns, practiced reproductive monogamy, and avoided close-kin marriages. Such practices reflect broader transformations in family structures that began during the Late Roman period, were transferred to small agrarian societies in the Early Medieval period, and continued to shape European societies. By the 7th century, ongoing admixture had shaped genetic diversity patterns into those resembling Central Europe today.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437538

In 2023, external funding accounted for 21% of total TB expenditures, with the U.S. contributing over 55% of these funds. The withdrawal of U.S. support threatens essential TB services, including diagnostics, treatment, TB-HIV co-infection interventions, and research initiatives critical to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for TB eradication.

MethodsThis study analyses the dependency of 26 high-burden TB countries (HBCs) on U.S. funding and models the potential impact of funding cuts on TB incidence and mortality. Countries were classified into low (0-22%), moderate (23-37%), and high (>37%) dependency groups based on three-year expenditure data. A deterministic compartmental model simulated service disruptions under three recovery scenarios: (1) minimal impact (services recover within three months), (2) moderate impact (recovery within one year), and (3) worst-case scenario (permanent service reduction). Extrapolations were made for all 26 HBCs based on representative countries from each dependency category.

FindingsFunding cuts are projected to result in substantial increases in TB cases and deaths across the three scenarios. In a high-dependency country, cumulative TB cases could rise by 2.1% (CI 1.5 - 2.5), 5.4% (CI4 - 6.5), or 36% (CI 25 - 47), and TB deaths by 2.9%(CI 2.2 - 3.5), 7.8%(CI 5.9 - 9.2), 68%(CI 45 - 86), depending on the severity of service disruptions. Across all 26 HBCs, additional TB cases are estimated at 0.63 million (CI 0.45 - 0.81) (minimal impact), 1.66 million (CI 1.2 - 2.1) (moderate impact), and 10.67 million (CI 7.85 - 13.19) (worst-case). Corresponding TB deaths are projected to increase by 99,800 (CI 65,200-130,000), 268,600 (CI 185,800-337,900), and 2,243,700 (CI 1,570,800-2,807,300), respectively. The findings underscore the catastrophic consequences of the funding cut, particularly in countries highly reliant on U.S. support.

InterpretationThe loss of U.S. funding endangers global TB control, jeopardizing End TB and SDG targets. While some nations may adapt, short-term disruptions will severely impact vulnerable populations. Urgent alternative funding is needed to sustain TB prevention and treatment efforts and mitigate the effects of aid withdrawal.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying small-molecule partitioning remain largely unknown. Here, we first exploit atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of model condensates to elucidate physicochemical rules governing small-molecule partitioning. We find that while hydrophobicity is a major determinant, solubility becomes a stronger regulator of partitioning in more polar condensates. Additionally, more polar condensates exhibit selectivity toward certain compounds, suggesting that condensate-specific therapeutics can be engineered. Building on these insights, we develop minimal models (MAPPS) for efficient prediction of small-molecule partitioning into biologically relevant condensates. We demonstrate that this approach reproduces atomistic partition coefficients in both model systems and condensates composed of the low complexity domain (LCD) of FUS. Applying MAPPS to various LCD-based condensates shows that protein sequence can exert a selective pressure, thereby influencing small-molecule partitioning. Collectively, our findings reveal that partitioning is driven by both small-molecule--protein affinity and the complex interplay between the compounds and the condensate chemical environment.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437539

It is typically stored as a genetic relatedness matrix (GRM), whose elements are pairwise relatedness values between individuals. This relatedness has been defined in various contexts based on pedigree, genotype, phylogeny, coalescent times, and, recently, ancestral recombination graph (ARG). ARG-based GRMs have been found to better capture the structure of a population and improve association studies relative to the genotype GRM. However, calculating GRMs and further operations with them is fundamentally challenging due to inherent quadratic time and space complexity. Here, we first discuss the different definitions of relatedness in a unifying context, making use of the additive model of a quantitative trait to provide a definition of branch relatedness and the corresponding branch GRM. We explore the relationship between branch relatedness and pedigree relatedness through a case study of French-Canadian individuals that have a known pedigree. Through the tree sequence encoding of an ARG, we then derive an efficient algorithm for computing products between the branch GRM and a general vector, without explicitly forming the branch GRM. This algorithm leverages the sparse encoding of genomes with the tree sequence and hence enables large-scale computations with the branch GRM. We demonstrate the power of this algorithm by developing a randomized principal components algorithm for tree sequences that easily scales to millions of genomes. All algorithms are implemented in the open source tskit Python package. Taken together, this work consolidates the different notions of relatedness as branch relatedness and by leveraging the tree sequence encoding of an ARG it provides efficient algorithms that enable computations with the branch GRM that scale to mega-scale genomic datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437539

Small population sizes and the lack of recombination are two such scenarios that reduce the efficiency of selection. Under these conditions, the disconnect between deleterious genetic load and individual fitness due to the masking of recessive deleterious mutations in heterozygous individuals may result in the emergence of pseudo-overdominance, wherein the buildup of haplotypes with complementary sets of deleterious mutations results in apparent heterozygote advantage and an increase in linked neutral diversity. In polyploids, the presence of additional allelic copies magnifies this masking effect and may therefore increase the probability of pseudo-overdominance. Here, we simulate the evolution of small diploid and autotetraploid populations to identify the conditions that support the evolution of pseudo-overdominance. We discover that pseudo-overdominance evolves under a much wider range of parameters in autotetraploids than in diploids with identical population sizes, and that in many parts of parameter space there is an inverse relationship between fitness and recombination rate. These results imply that pseudo-overdominance may be more common than previously thought. We conclude by discussing the current evidence for pseudo-overdominance in species with polyploid histories, as well as its implications in agriculture due to the prevalence of polyploidy in crops.","NA","biorxiv",1741471437539
