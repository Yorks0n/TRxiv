Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321321

Various neurological conditions and neurodegenerative diseases benefit from small molecules capable of BBB penetration (BBBP) to elicit a therapeutic effect. Predicting BBBP often involves in silico assessment of molecular properties such as lipophilicity (logP) and polar surface area (PSA) using the CNS multiparameter optimization (MPO) method. This study curated an open-source dataset to benchmark rigorously machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) models with each other and with MPO for predicting BBBP. Our analysis demonstrated that AI models, especially attentive NNs using stereochemical features, significantly outperform MPO in predicting BBBP. An attentive graph neural network (GNN), we refer to as CANDID-CNS, achieved a 0.23-0.26 higher AUROC score than MPO on full test sets, and a 0.17-0.19 higher score on stereoisomers filtered subsets. Regarding stereoisomers that differ in BBBP, which MPO cannot distinguish, attentive GNNs correctly classify these with AURPC, AUROC, and MCC metrics comparable to or better than those of MPO on less difficult test molecules. These findings suggest that integrating attentive GNN models into pharmaceutical drug discovery processes can substantially improve prediction rates, and thereby reduce the timeline, cost, and increase probability of success of designing brain penetrant therapeutics for the treatment of a wide variety of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

However, the translational potential of spatial transcriptomics is still limited by its high cost, hindering the assembly of large patient cohorts needed for robust biomarker discovery. Here we present Path2Space, a deep learning model trained on spatial transcriptomics data to predict spatial gene expression directly from histopathology slides. Studying breast cancer, the model was first trained on one ST breast cancer patients cohort and further independently tested and validated on two other ST cohorts. Path2Space identifies 4,500 genes whose spatial expression is robustly predicted in all three cohorts, markedly more accurate than existing ST predictors. Second, we show that based on the inferred ST, Path2Space accurately infers cell-type abundances in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Thirdly, Applying Path2Space to the TCGA breast cancer cohort we identify three TME spatially grounded subsets of patients that have markedly different survival rates. Fourth, analyzing two large breast cancer patients cohorts treated with trastuzumab, we show that the heterogeneity of the inferred HER2 levels across the tumor microenvironment is predictive of response, concordant with the bystander hypothesis. Finally, we developed a spatially interpretable model for predicting trastuzumab response directly from the H&E-slides. This model's performance surpasses that of existing response prediction models that use measured bulk multi-omics data. Path2Space is the first approach capable of robustly delineating the tumor microenvironment on an unprecedented scale directly from the tumor slides. It heralds the upcoming development of robust spatially grounded biomarkers of patients survival and treatment that promises to transform precision oncology in both the developed and developing worlds.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Objective: Assess the duration and severity of autonomic dysfunction in adults with Long COVID and evaluate its impact on function and quality of life. Design: A follow-up survey of a subset of participants from a cross-sectional online survey of adults with Long COVID. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction. Participants: 526 adults (ages 20-65) with a history of Long COVID Main measures: The Composite Autonomic Symptom 31 (COMPASS-31) score, the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, the prevalence of new postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and predictors of autonomic dysfunction, including POTS. Key results: 71.9% of Long COVID patients had a COMPASS-31 score >20, suggestive of moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction. The median symptom duration was 36 [30-40] months, reaching up to 3.5 years after SARS-CoV-2 infection. 37.5% of Long COVID patients could no longer work or had to drop out of school due to their Long COVID illness. 40.5% were newly diagnosed with POTS following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: Evidence of persistent moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction was seen in 71.9% of Long COVID patients in our study, with a 36-month median symptom duration, suggesting that enduring autonomic dysfunction is highly prevalent in the Long COVID population. Moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction was significantly correlated with impaired function and capacity, highlighting the need to address POTS and other manifestations of autonomic dysfunction as a key component of Long COVID management.","NA","medrxiv",1729289321322

Notably, STRAIGHT-IN Dual leverages the STRAIGHT-IN platform to allow near-scarless cargo integration, facilitating the recycling of components for subsequent cellular modifications. Using STRAIGHT-IN Dual, we investigated how promoter choice and gene syntax influences transgene silencing, and demonstrate the impact of these design features on forward programming of hiPSCs into neurons. Furthermore, we designed a grazoprevir-inducible synZiFTR system to complement the widely-used tetracyclineinducible system, providing independent, tunable, and temporally controlled expression of both transcription factors and functional reporters. The unprecedented efficiency and speed with which STRAIGHT-IN Dual generates homogenous genetically engineered hiPSC populations represents a major advancement for synthetic biology in stem cell applications and opens opportunities for precision cell engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

We revealed tissue-specific short- and long-lived proteins, strong correlations between interacting protein lifetimes, and distinct impacts of phosphorylation on protein turnover. Notably, we discovered that peroxisomes are regulated by protein turnover across tissues, and that phosphorylation regulates the stability of neurodegeneration-related proteins, such as Tau and -synuclein.

Alongside these introductions, inhabited and agricultural areas are spreading, and correspondingly most animal introductions occur in populated areas. Commensal species which can live alongside humans by making use of specific conditions, structures, or prey, have a significant advantage. Introduced mammal species often use anthropogenic features in their environment and demonstrate a higher tolerance of human disturbance, but their importance remains understudied in ectotherms. The Aesculapian snake (Zamenis longissimus) is an ectotherm which has been introduced beyond the northern extremities of its natural range. To understand their persistence, we radio-tracked snakes daily over two active seasons, including high-frequency tracking of a subset of males. We investigated snake home range size using Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimators (AKDE). Using AKDE-weighted Habitat Selection Functions we identified preferences for habitat features in a mosaic of habitats, and we used Integrated Step Selection Functions to further explore how these features influence movement. We revealed a particular preference for buildings in male snakes, while females preferred woodland. We demonstrate that the success of this ectothermic predator is likely tied to a willingness to use human features of the landscape.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

This heterogeneity highlights limitations in currently applied methodological approaches, which has stagnated our understanding of fundamental skeletal muscle biology in both healthy and myopathic contexts. Here, we developed a novel approach that combines a fluorescence based assay for the biophysical examination of the sarcomeric protein, myosin, coupled with same-myofiber high sensitivity proteome profiling, termed Single Myofiber Protein Function-Omics (SMPFO). Successfully applying this approach to healthy human skeletal muscle tissue, we identify the integrate relationship between myofiber functionality and the underlying proteomic landscape that guides divergent, but physiologically important, behaviour in myofiber sub-types. By applying SMPFO to two forms of human nemaline myopathy (ACTA1 and TNNT1 mutations), we reveal significant reduction in the divergence of myofiber sub-types, across both biophysical and proteomic behaviour.

We previously identified Gmnc as a critical fate determinant for P73+ CRs subtypes from the hem, septum and thalamic eminence. In Gmnc-/- mutants, P73+ CRs are initially produced, cover the telencephalic vesicle but undergo massive apoptosis resulting in their complete depletion at mid-corticogenesis. Here we investigated the consequence of such a CRs depletion on dorsal cortex lamination and hippocampal morphogenesis. We found preplate splitting occurs normally in Gmnc-/- mutants but is followed by defective radial migration arrest in the dorsal cortex, altered cellular organization in the lateral cortex, aberrant hippocampal progenitor proliferation resulting in abnormal CA1 folding and lack of vasculature development in the hippocampal fissure. We then performed conditional Reln deletion in P73+ CRs to evaluate its relative contribution and found that only radial migration defects were recapitulated. We concluded that at mid-corticogenesis, CRs-derived Reln is required for radial migration arrest and additionally identified Reln-independent functions for CRs in the control of hippocampal progenitor proliferation and vessel remodelling.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Host-pathogen co-evolution can cause rapid diversification or loss of pathogen genes encoding host-exposed proteins. The molecular mechanisms that underpin such sequence dynamics remains poorly investigated at the scale of entire pathogen species. Here, we focus on AvrStb6, a major effector of the global wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici, evolving in response to the cognate receptor Stb6, a resistance widely deployed in wheat. We comprehensively captured effector gene evolution by analyzing a global thousand-genome panel using reference-free sequence analyses. We found that AvrStb6 has diversified into 59 protein isoforms with a strong association to the pathogen spreading to new continents. Across Europe, we found the strongest differentiation of the effector consistent with high rates of Stb6 deployment. The AvrStb6 locus showed also a remarkable diversification in transposable element content with specific expansion patterns across the globe. We detected the AvrStb6 gene losses and evidence for transposable element-mediated disruptions. We used genome-wide association mapping data to predict virulence emergence and found marked increases in Europe, followed by spread to subsequently colonized continents. Finally, we genotyped French bread wheat cultivars for Stb6 and monitored resistant cultivar deployment concomitant with AvrStb6 evolution.

The analyses highlight also the need for large-scale pathogen sequencing panels to assess the durability of resistance genes and improve the sustainability of deployment strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

However, the reconstitution of mtDNA deletions responsible for severe mitochondrial myopathies and age-related diseases has not yet been achieved in human cells. Here, we developed a method to engineer specific mtDNA deletions in human cells by co-expressing end-joining (EJ) machinery and targeted endonucleases. As a proof-of-concept, we used mito-EJ and mito-ScaI to generate a panel of clonal cell lines harboring a ~3.5 kb mtDNA deletion with the full spectrum of heteroplasmy. Investigating these isogenic cells revealed a critical threshold of ~75% deleted genomes, beyond which cells exhibited depletion of OXPHOS proteins, severe metabolic disruption, and impaired growth in galactose-containing media. Single-cell multiomic analysis revealed two distinct patterns of nuclear gene deregulation in response to mtDNA deletion accumulation; one triggered at the deletion threshold and another progressively responding to increasing heteroplasmy. In summary, the co-expression of mito-EJ and programable nucleases provides a powerful tool to model disease-associated mtDNA deletions in different cell types. Establishing a panel of cell lines with a large-scale deletion at varying levels of heteroplasmy is a valuable resource for understanding the impact of mtDNA deletions on diseases and guiding the development of potential therapeutic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Here we show through in situ monitoring and ex situ manipulations that methane is rapidly produced by archaea in frequently oxygenated sandy sediments. By combining biogeochemical, metagenomic, and culture-based experiments, we show this activity is driven by aerotolerant methylotrophic methanogens (Methanococcoides spp.) broadly distributed in surface layers of sandy sediments, providing evidence of a hidden process contributing to marine methane emissions.

Monitoring the health of pregnant women and newborns during this period involves systematic prenatal and postpartum examinations, guided by indicators established under the national medical insurance system, collectively termed gestational phenotypes. However, our understanding of the genetic basis of these phenotypes and their intricate relationship with maternal long-term health outcomes remain markedly limited. We conducted comprehensive genetic investigations into 122 gestational phenotypes among 121,579 Chinese pregnancies. These phenotypes included anthropometric metrics, comprehensive blood biomarker measurements, and common gestational complications and outcomes. We identified 3,845 genetic loci, 1,385 of which are novel. Our analyses revealed gestation-specific genetic effects, ranging from proportion 0% to 100% for 23 phenotypes, highlighting genes and pathways predominantly enriched in response to hormones, growth and immune function. Longitudinal trajectory genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses of repeated measures across 24 complete blood cell phenotypes revealed that 17.8% of the genetic variants exhibited significant interactions with gestational timing across five gestational and postpartum periods. Two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses of 220 mid- and old-age phenotypes suggested causal associations between gestational phenotypes and the risk of chronic diseases in later life. These findings provide initial insights into the genetic foundations of human gestational phenotypes and their relationship with long-term health, laying a basis for advanced population health during gestation.","NA","medrxiv",1729289321322

Here, we used machine learning models to explore genotype-phenotype connections for 223 life history traits measured across 1011 genome-sequenced Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Firstly, we used genome-wide association studies to connect genetic variants with the phenotypes. Next, we benchmarked an automated machine learning pipeline that includes preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameters optimization in combination with multiple linear and complex machine learning methods. We determined gradient boosting machines as best performing in 65% of predictions and pangenome as best predictor, suggesting a considerable contribution of the accessory genome in controlling phenotypes. The accuracy broadly varied among the phenotypes (r = 0.2-0.9), consistent with varying levels of complexity, with stress resistance being easier to predict compared to growth across carbon and nitrogen nutrients. While no specific genomic features could be linked to the predictions for most phenotypes, machine learning identifies high-impact variants with established relationships to phenotypes despite being rare in the population. Near-perfect accuracies (r>0.95) were achieved when other phenomics data were used to aid predictions, suggesting shared useful information can be conveyed across phenotypes. Overall, our study underscores the power of machine learning to interpret the functional outcome of genetic variants.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Here, we performed intravital imaging of microglia mitochondria, revealing that microglial processes diverge, with some containing multiple mitochondria while others are completely void. Microglial processes that engage in minute-to-minute surveillance typically do not have mitochondria. Moreover, unlike process surveillance, mitochondrial motility does not change with animal anesthesia. Likewise, the processes that acutely chemoattract to a lesion site or initially engage with a neuron undergoing programmed cell death do not contain mitochondria.

Using genetic mouse models, we showed that FGFR2 supported mutant KRAS-driven transformation of acinar cells by promoting proliferation and MAPK pathway activation. FGFR2 abrogation significantly delayed tumor formation and extended the survival of these mice. Furthermore, we discovered that FGFR2 collaborated with EGFR and dual blockade of these receptor signaling pathways significantly reduced mutant KRAS-induced pre-neoplastic lesion formation.

A nonlinear dynamical model that incorporates the experimentally observed cross-inhibition of amino acid production recapitulates the population cycles. The model shows that the cycles represent internally generated relaxation oscillations, which emerge when fast resource dynamics with positive feedback drive slow changes in strain abundance.

This is however complicated by the highly repetitive nature of these sequences in genomes, requiring the deployment of several problem-specific tools as well as the curation of appropriate genome annotations. This pipeline aims to make the analysis of TE sequences and their expression more generally accessible. Results: The TE-Seq pipeline conducts an end-to-end analysis of RNA sequencing data, examining both genes and TEs. It implements the most current computational methods tailor-made for TEs, and produces a comprehensive analysis of TE expression at both the level of the individual element and at the TE clade level. Furthermore, if supplied with long-read DNA sequencing data, it is able to assess TE expression from non-reference (polymorphic) loci. As a demonstration, we analyzed proliferating, early senescent, and late senescent lung fibroblast RNA-Seq data, and created a custom reference genome and annotations for this cell strain using Nanopore sequencing data. We found that several retrotransposable element (RTE) clades were upregulated in senescence, which included non-reference, intact, and potentially active elements. Availability and implementation: TE-Seq is made available as a Snakemake pipeline which can be obtained at https://github.com/maxfieldk/TE-Seq.

Here, we describe Jyvaskylavirus, the first giant virus isolated from Finland. This clade B marseillevirus was found in Acanthamoeba castellanii from a composting soil sample in Jyvaskyla, Central Finland. Its genome shares similarities with other marseilleviruses, including conserved Nucleocytoviricota genes, histone-like genes, and three unique ORFans. Helium ion microscopy and electron microscopy of infected cells unraveled stages of the Jyvaskylavirus lifecycle, such as single virions attached to the cell membrane, likely triggering endocytosis, and virus-rich vesicle formation within the cytoplasm. We also reconstructed the Jyvaskylavirus particle to 6.3 [A] resolution using cryo-EM. The ~2,500 [A] diameter virion displays structural similarities to other Marseilleviridae giant viruses. The capsid comprises of 9,240 copies of the major capsid protein ORF184, which possesses a double jellyroll fold arranged in trimers forming pseudo-hexameric capsomers. Below the capsid shell, the internal membrane vesicle encloses the genome. Through cross-structural and -sequence comparisons with other Marseilleviridae using AI-based software in model building and prediction, we elucidated ORF142 as the penton protein, which plugs the twelve vertices of the capsid. Five additional ORFs were identified, with models predicted and fitted into densities that either cap the capsomers externally or stabilize them internally. The isolation of Jyvaskylavirus, along with other virus-like particles, not only suggests that these viruses may be widespread in the boreal environment but also provide insights extendable to other marseilleviruses, addressing the previously lacking structural data on minor capsid proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Though useful, these membrane mimetics do not fully replicate the physical properties of native cellular membranes associated with large assemblies of lipids. We investigated the conformational equilibria of the human A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR) in phospholipid vesicles using 19F solid-state magic angle spinning NMR (SSNMR). By applying an optimized sample preparation workflow and experimental conditions, we were able to obtain 19F-SSNMR spectra for both antagonist- and agonist-bound complexes with sensitivity and line widths closely comparable to those achieved using solution NMR. This facilitated a direct comparison of the A2AAR conformational equilibria across detergent micelle, lipid nanodisc, and lipid vesicle preparations. While antagonist-bound A2AAR showed a similar conformational equilibria across all membrane and membrane mimetic systems, the conformational equilibria of agonist-bound A2AAR exhibited differences among different environments.

We observed consistent findings in an independent sample from our Biobank and among East Asians in the UK Biobank and the All of Us Project. The identified genetic risks accounted for up to 9.1% of the disease burden variance in Taiwan. Our approach of characterizing the phenome-wide genomic landscape, developing population-specific risk prediction models, assessing their performance, and identifying the genetic impact on health, serves as a model for similar studies in other diverse study populations.","NA","medrxiv",1729289321322

We performed a gene-based rare variant association study of 721,941 individuals and identified 116 novel BMI-associated genes with consistent effects across ancestries, including 50 risk-conferring and 66 protective genes against obesity. Protective genes such as DCUN1D3 and NEUROD6 had effect sizes comparable to high-risk genes such as MC4R and BSN, and nearly twice that of known protective genes such as GPR75, which, along with five other genes, showed strong European bias. Notably, 82 of the 116 genes showed functional relevance to obesity including adiposity, energy homeostasis, and glucose metabolism. While polygenic risks or an obesogenic lifestyle amplified the effect of 15 genes on BMI, including the combination of low physical activity and MACROD1, 23 genes including VIRMA, AQP3, and PML retained protective effects even at high polygenic scores. Our findings provide further insights into the genetic basis of obesity that is conserved across ancestries and their interactions with obesogenic factors.","NA","medrxiv",1729289321322

Despite extensive research, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 replication remain unclear. To address this, we developed a single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) assay to directly visualize and analyse in vitro RNA synthesis by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We purified the minimal replication complex, comprising nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8, and combined it with fluorescently labelled RNA substrates, enabling real-time monitoring of RNA primer elongation at the single-molecule level. This platform allowed us to investigate the mechanisms of action of key inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication. In particular, our data provides evidence for remdesivir's mechanism of action, which involves polymerase stalling and subsequent chain termination dependent on the concentration of competing nucleotide triphosphates. Our study demonstrates the power of smFRET to provide dynamic insights into SARS-CoV-2 replication, offering a valuable tool for antiviral screening and mechanistic studies of viral RdRp activity.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

For example, in uniaxially stretched tissue most divisions orient along the stretch axis. This mechanosensitive division orientation can be achieved by distinct mechanisms involving a direct response to force or an indirect response to force via cell shape changes. Cells also generally align divisions along their long axis of interphase shape. Since stretching a tissue elongates cells, uncoupling whether divisions orient in response to force or to cell shape remains challenging. Here, we utilised the Xenopus laevis embryonic animal cap tissue, to which a reproducible external stretch can be applied, to understand mechanosensitive division orientation. We focused on nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), which is key to spindle orientation. We show that NuMA is dynamically localised to the cell cortex earlier during mitosis in uniaxially stretched tissues. This temporal cortical recruitment of NuMA coincides with the onset and subsequent stretch-induced amplification of spindle oscillations. Additionally, we show that knockdown of NuMA reduces spindle oscillations and disrupts division orientation according to stretch and cell shape. We also show that divisions dynamically align with cell shape under tissue stretch and that this involves a direct response to force via NuMA localisation, rather than an indirect response to force via cell shape changes. Overall, using live tissue imaging, mathematical modelling, and tissue mechanics our results indicate that NuMA fine tunes spindle dynamics and ensures the accurate alignment of divisions with cell shape and anisotropic tension.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Thus, drug discovery and repurposing are essential to enhance treatment efficacy and safety.

MethodsWe obtained summary statistics for protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) of 2,004 plasma proteins and 1,443 brain proteins, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MS susceptibility with 14,802 cases and 26,703 controls, and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for 8,000 genes in peripheral blood and 16,704 genes in brain tissue. Our integrative analysis included a proteome-wide association study to identify MS-associated proteins, followed by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) to determine causal associations. We used the HEIDI test and Bayesian colocalization analysis to distinguish pleiotropy from linkage. Proteins passing SMR, HEIDI, and colocalization analyses were considered potential drug targets. We further conducted pathway annotations, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, and examined mRNA levels of these targets.

ResultsWe identified hundreds of MS-associated proteins in plasma and brain, confirming the causal roles of 18 proteins (nine in plasma and nine in brain). Among these, we found 78 annotated pathways and 16 existing non-MS drugs targeting six proteins. We also discovered intricate PPIs among seven potential drug targets and 19 existing MS drug targets, as well as PPIs of four targets across plasma and brain. Combining expression data, we identified two targets adhering to the central dogma of molecular biology.

It is used to treat multiple sclerosis. However, the mechanistic understanding of the effect of this highly effective therapy on B cells and plasma cells in the central nervous system compartment is limited.

ObjectivesThe CLADRIPLAS study examined the effect of cladribine on peripheral and intrathecal B and plasma cell biology in people with MS.

MethodsThirty-eight people with progressive MS ineligible for- or rejecting-treatment with licenced therapies were recruited and supplied a baseline lumbar puncture. Those exhibiting gadolinium-enhancing or new/enlarging T2 magnetic resonance imaging lesions and/or elevated neurofilament levels were offered subcutaneous cladribine (Litak(R)). Seven people were eligible; one person died before treatment, and only five completed the first year of treatment. Twenty-two ineligible people were willing to provide a repeat lumbar puncture twelve months later.

ResultsThe CLADRIPLAS study found no evidence of a difference in the odds of a positive cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal band (cOCB) result between the cladribine-treated and untreated group. This is probably explained by microarray and in vitro studies, which demonstrated that plasmablasts and notably long-lived plasma cells are relatively resistant to the cytotoxic effect of cladribine compared to memory B cells at physiological concentrations. This was consistent with the loss of intracellular deoxycytidine kinase during antibody-secreting cell differentiation.

DiscussionCLADRIPLAS indicates that cOCB are not rapidly eliminated in most people with MS. This may be explained by the relative lack of direct cytotoxic action of cladribine on long-lived plasma cells.","NA","medrxiv",1729289321322

Our analysis revealed that responders exhibited higher baseline JAK-STAT activity, while non-responders had increased baseline NF-kB pathway activation. Longitudinal comparisons showed that disease progression in non-responders was associated with increased abundance and enhanced activation of macrophages and fibroblasts.

Evolution has woven the LC into wide-ranging neural circuits that influence functions as broad as autonomic systems, the stress response, nociception, sleep, and high-level cognition among others. Given this conservation, there is a strong possibility that LC activity is inherently similar across species, and furthermore that age, sex, and brain state influence LC activity similarly across species. The degree to which LC activity is homogenous across these factors, however, has never been assessed due to the small sample size of individual studies. Here, we pool data from 20 laboratories (1,855 neurons) and show diversity across both intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as species, age, sex and brain state. We use a negative binomial regression model to compare activity from male monkeys, and rats and mice of both sexes that were recorded across brain states from brain slices ex vivo or under different anesthetics or during wakefulness in vivo. LC activity differed due to complex interactions of species, sex, and brain state. The LC became more active during aging, independent of sex. Finally, in contrast to the foundational principle that all species express two distinct LC firing modes (""tonic"" or ""phasic""), we discovered great diversity within spontaneous LC firing patterns. Different factors were associated with higher incidence of some firing modes. We conclude that the activity of the evolutionarily-ancient LC is not conserved. Inherent differences due to age and species-sex-brain state interactions have implications for understanding the role of LC in species-specific naturalistic behavior, as well as in psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease, immunology, and metabolic disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Ongoing debates agree on the pivotal role of a symbiosis between an alpha-proteobacterium and an Asgard archaeon.

To address these questions, we employed advanced phylogenomic approaches and comprehensive datasets spanning the known diversity of cellular life and viruses. Our analysis provided an updated reconstruction of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) proteome, in which we traced the phylogenetic origin of each protein family. We found compelling evidence for multiple waves of horizontal gene transfer from diverse bacterial and viral donors, with some likely preceding the mitochondrial endosymbiosis. We inferred the proteomes of the potential major donors and their functional contributions to LECA. Our findings underscore the contribution of horizontal gene transfers in shaping the proteomes of pre-LECA ancestors and hint to a facilitating role of Nucleocytoviricota viruses. Altogether, our results suggest ancient eukaryotes originated within complex microbial ecosystems through a succession of symbiotic interactions that left a footprint of horizontally transferred genes.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

In this study, we measured substrate utilization and cell signaling in different muscle fiber types during exercise and investigated a possible link between these variables. Methods: Five subjects performed a single leg cycling exercise in the evening (day 1) with the purpose of reducing glycogen stores. The following morning (day 2), they performed two-legged cycling at ~70% of VO2peak for 1h. Muscle biopsies were taken from both legs pre- and post-exercise for enzymatic analyses of glycogen, metabolite concentrations using LC-MS/MS-based quantification, and protein signaling using Western blot in pools of type I or type II fibers. Results: Glycogen content was 60-65% lower for both fiber types (P<0.01) in the leg that exercised on day 1 (low leg) compared to the other leg with normal level of glycogen (normal leg) before the cycling exercise on day 2. Glycogen utilization during exercise was significantly less in both fiber types in the low compared to the normal leg (P<0.05). In the low leg, there was a 14- and 6-fold increase in long-chain fatty acids conjugated to carnitine in type I and type II fibers, respectively, post-exercise. This increase was 3-4 times larger than in the normal leg (P<0.05). Post-exercise, mTORSer2448 phosphorylation was increased in both fiber types in the normal leg (P<0.05) but remained unchanged in both fiber types in the low leg together with an increase in eEF2Thr56 phosphorylation in type I fibers (P<0.01). Exercise induced a reduction in the autophagy marker LC3B-II in both fiber types and legs, but the post-exercise level was higher in both fiber types in the low leg (P<0.05). Accordingly, the LC3B-II/I ratio decreased only in the normal leg (75% for type I and 87% for type II, P<0.01). Conclusions: Starting an endurance exercise session with low glycogen availability leads to profound changes in substrate utilization in both type I and type II fibers. This may reduce the mTORC1 signaling response, primarily in type I muscle fibers, and attenuate the normally observed reduction in autophagy.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Here, we longitudinally tracked B cells recognizing WT spike in two individuals of mRNA vaccine, from convalescence of breakthrough infection to acute phase of reinfection. Comprehensive characterization of 632 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from those B cells reveals that mAbs cloned after reinfection have dramatically enhanced neutralizing breadth and potency, including 11 mAbs that potently neutralize all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants from WT to KP.3. Among the 11 mAbs, 5 mAbs are classified into public clonotypes encoded by IGHV3-53 or IGHV3-66, whereas the rest belong to a rarely reported clonotype encoded by IGHV3-74. Notably, IGHV3-74 mAbs can neutralize SARS-CoV-1 with a minimum IC50 of 0.055 g/ml.

In plants, cell to cell mobility of transcription factors has emerged as a key paradigm. For the shoot apical meristem of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana it has been described that the translocation of the WUSCHEL homeodomain transcription factor from niche cells to stem cells is essential for their maintenance. Here we systematically investigate the function of diverse WUS alleles and leverage multispectral live cell imaging coupled to computational analysis and mechanistic mathematical modelling to show that WUSCHEL protein mobility is the result of balance between active transport and retention in niche cells and likely independent of the stem cell signal CLAVATA3. Importantly, we show that diffusion across cell layers of the meristem is not symmetrical, suggesting that there is unexpected complexity in cellular connections.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Yet, shape has been largely overlooked in state transitions studies. Here, we combine morphometric analysis with theoretical modeling and molecular perturbations to interrogate cell shape dynamics during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Using stochastic inference, we extract the morphogenetic landscape underlying EMT. We show that within this landscape, EMT-associated cell spreading reflects a transition between shape attractors. Strikingly, we observe a peak in cell shape noise strength concomitant with spreading, and show that higher shape noise accelerates transitions between shape attractors. Our analysis framework will be widely applicable to quantitative cell shape investigations in physiology and disease. Together, our results identify a key role for cellular stochasticity as a regulator of shape change rates, and highlight that shape dynamics yield rich phenotypic information that enhance our understanding of cellular states.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Investigations of the consequences of violating these assumptions so far have focused on individual perturbations operating in isolation. Here, we analyze widely used estimators of genetic architectural parameters, including LD-score regression and both population-based and within-family GWAS, across a broad array of perturbations to classical assumptions, such as multivariate assortative mating and vertical transmission (parental effects on offspring phenotypes not mediated by genetic inheritance). We find that widely-used statistical approaches are unreliable across a broad range of perturbations, and that structural sources of confounding often operate synergistically to distort conclusions. For example, mild multivariate assortative mating and vertical transmission together can dramatically inflate heritability estimates and GWAS false positive rates. Further, GWAS will become progressively more polluted by off-target associations as sample sizes increase. Given these challenges, we introduce xftsim, a forward time simulation library capable of modeling a wide range of genetic architectures, mating regimes, and transmission dynamics, to facilitate the systematic comparison of existing approaches and the development of robust methods. Together, our findings illustrate the importance of comprehensive sensitivity analysis and present a valuable tool for future research.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

In Bacteroidetes TamA is replaced by TamL, a TamA-like lipoprotein with a lipid modification at its N-terminus that likely anchors it to the outer membrane. This structural difference suggests that TamL may have a distinct function compared to TamA. However, the role of TAM in bacterial phyla other than Proteobacteria remains unexplored. Our study aimed to elucidate the functional importance of TamL in Flavobacterium johnsoniae, an environmental Bacteroidetes. Unlike its homologues in Proteobacteria, we found that TamL and TamB are essential in F. johnsoniae. Through genetic, phenotypic, proteomic, and lipidomic analyses, we discovered that TamL depletion severely compromises outer membrane integrity, as evidenced by reduced cell viability, altered cell shape, increased susceptibility to membrane-disrupting agents, and elevated levels of outer membrane lipoproteins. Notably, we did not observe any impact on outer membrane lipid composition. Via pull-down protein assays, we confirmed that TamL interacts with TamB in F. johnsoniae, likely forming the TAM complex. Furthermore, our in silico analysis revealed that the presence of TamL and TamB monocistronic genes is a shared genetic feature among Bacteroidetes members, including the human pathogen Capnocytophaga canimorsus where we also confirmed the essentiality of the TamL and TamB homologs.

The emergence of new cases in non-endemic areas highlights the importance of early pathogen detection in vectors and reservoirs to generate effective control strategies and establish preventive policies. The objective of this study was to design and validate a detection system of T. cruzi based on specific DNA cleavage and collateral activation using the CRISPR/LbCas12a system, targeting the genes Cytochrome B (Cytb), 18S ribosomal subunit (SR18s), and histone (H2A). This system was validated for their uses in both vectors and reservoirs of the parasite. The first step was to conduct a bioinformatic analysis of the target genes and design RNA guides for each cleavage site and primers to amplify the target region through PCR. Subsequently, we sequenced the amplified DNA target and validated the detection system using T. cruzi DNA extracted from naturally infected Rhodnius pallescens in the metropolitan area of Bucaramanga, Colombia. After standardizing the method, we tested the CRISPR/Cas system with Silvio X10/4 laboratory strain of T. cruzi and scaled up to blood samples of naturally infected Didelphis marsupialis. As a result, we observed the DNA cleavage employing the CRISPR/Cas system with Cytb guide with a sensitivity of up to 0.0475 ng/uL of provided DNA. Sequencing of the Cytb gene showed no mutations in the cleavage site. However, point mutations and indels were found in SR18S and H2A, avoiding the formation of the CRISPR/LbCas12 complex. Furthermore, we introduce the design of a fluorescent detection prototype with CRISPR/LbCas12a called Tropical Diseases Detector (TropD-Detector). This device operates with an excitation wavelength of 480 nm emitted by an LED and a high-pass light filter with a cutoff wavelength of 500 nm. We detected positive samples using any photographic camera system. The TropD-Detector provides a visual, viable, and sensitive method for detecting T. cruzi in both vectors and reservoirs from endemic areas.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

To sustain this complex system, dolphins rely on a rich vocal repertoire: clicks exclusively used for echolocation, burst-pulse sounds associated with emotions during social interactions, and whistles, including signature whistles that serve as individual-specific identifiers ( names).

How dolphins maintain their complex social structure based only on a limited repertoire of sounds remains elusive. Previous studies suggest that contextual information can be transferred by the modulation of the whistles.

Here, we investigated the whistle variability using a comprehensive computational approach, and studied the structure of the interactions between the whistle variants. Using a unique large dataset, acquired in a natural environment, we observed that signature whistles exhibit variations in their frequency contours. Unsupervised clustering revealed that signature whistles could be classified into sub-categories (signature whistle variants). The existence of these categories, and their independence on the emitter dolphin, indicate that these variations are not random. Analysis of pairwise interactions between sub-categories revealed a clustered structure similar to that of their social hierarchy. Network analysis of this structure showed that whistle sub-categories had different functional roles: some acted as hubs, others as bridges, and certain were used for turn-taking between the main whistle categories. We also found that the dolphins emit signature whistles of their deceased mothers, a phenomenon only observed in human language.

Overall, these findings suggest that dolphins modulate signature whistles to transmit additional information beyond individual identity, and that they engage in ""dialogue-like"" acoustic interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic marked a historic shift, as it led to the sharing of unprecedented fine-scale mobility data. This abundancy of data illuminated the geographical variability in transmission patterns and underscored the importance of the use of mobility data for public health questions. Little attention has been devoted however to (i) the definition of the mobility process that is relevant to the epidemic spread, and (ii) the mobility data resolution that is needed to describe the invasion dynamics. We take advantage of a real-world dataset, gathered from mobile phone users in Senegal to define three epidemiological couplings between locations, based on different characterizations of the mobility process, and at varying resolution levels. They are based respectively on: (i) the total number of displacements between any two municipalities on two consecutive calls (Displacement-based D); (ii) the number of calls made by residents in each location (Location-based L); (iii) the most visited location of residents during daytime (Most visited location-based C). To assess the impact of the different coupling definitions on the epidemic diffusion, we use them to inform mobility in a spatial epidemic model. We found that preserving any displacement on the observed trajectories from mobile phone data does not capture the epidemiological link between different locations, for infections where daily mobility is important (e.g. airborne or direct contact diseases). Most importantly, we found that at the country scale, places in which individuals spend most of their time including workplaces, schools or particular point of interests like restaurants or theater and are the dominant driver of disease diffusion. In fact, tracking in detail individual activities beyond home and all visited locations during the day does not add epidemiological important information. Novel paradigms for the release of mobile phone data to researchers can therefore be envisioned that strengthen privacy and confidentiality, while at the same time providing enough details - specifically aggregated home-visited locations coupling - to inform predictive epidemic models.","NA","medrxiv",1729289321322

It comprises thousands of microtubules (MTs) that build a scaffold around the distal half of the nucleus. The manchette distributes proteins and vesicles during spermiogenesis in a process called intra-manchette transport (IMT). The current hypothesis is that IMT shares many similarities with intra-flagellar transport (IFT) and utilizes both MTs and filamentous actin (F-actin). However, IMT is still poorly understood as direct visualization of IMT complexes is missing, and the presence of F-actin has not been experimentally shown. Here, we use proteomics and cryogenic-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to identify and visualize IMT components. We find that F-actin is an integral part of the manchette with two different spatial organizations, namely bundles and single filaments, providing tracks for transport as well as having structural and mechanical roles. We further uncover that IMT on MTs is mediated by two distinct transport machineries: dynein mediated transport of soluble cargo and dynein independent transport for vesicles. Our results provide new insights into the manchette's function as a transport scaffold, highlighting its significance for the polarization of spermatids during spermiogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

NMDARs exist as multiple subtypes that differ in their subunit composition, distribution and signaling properties, with GluN1/GluN2A (GluN2A diheteromers), GluN1/GluN2B (GluN2B diheteromers) and GluN1/2A/2B (GluN2A/2B triheteromers) receptors prevailing. Studying these subtypes separately has proved difficult due to the limited specificity of available pharmacological and genetic approaches. Here, we designed a photoswitchable tool (Opto2B) enabling specific and reversible modulation of GluN2B diheteromers (while other receptor subtypes remain unaffected). Using Opto2B, we were able to establish the differential contribution of GluN2B diheteromers relative to GluN2A-receptors (GluN2A diheteromers and GluN2A/2B triheteromers) to synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR pools. In young postnatal CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells, extrasynaptic NMDARs are exclusively composed of GluN2B diheteromers, whereas GluN2A subunits already populate synaptic sites. In adult CA1 cells, GluN2A-receptors predominate at both sites, with no preferential contribution of GluN2B diheteromers to extrasynaptic currents.

When effector cells attempt to suppress the tumour, the cancer cells can respond in kind by evolving methods of escape or inhibition. Knowledge of this coevolutionary system and the selection taking place within it can help us understand tumour-immune dynamics both during tumorigenesis but also when treatments such as immunotherapies are applied. Here, we present an individual-based branching process model of mutation accumulation, where random mutations arising in cancer cells trigger corresponding specialised immune responses. Different from previous research, we explicitly model interactions between cancer and effector cells, while incorporating stochastic effects, which are especially important for the expansion and extinction of small populations. We find that the parameters governing interactions between the cancer and effector cells induce different outcomes of tumour progress, such as suppression and evasion. While it is hard to measure the cancer-immune dynamics directly in patients, genetic information of the cancer may indicate the presence of such interactions. Our model demonstrates signatures of selection in sequencing-derived summary statistics, such as the single-cell mutational burden. Thus, bulk and single-cell sequencing of a tumour may give information about the coevolutionary dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

IgA deficiency is common in humans but is difficult to study due to its complex aetiology and comorbidities4-8. Using genetically and environmentally controlled mice, here we show that IgA-deficient animals have increased susceptibility to endogenous colorectal tumours. Cellular and molecular analyses revealed that, in the absence of IgA, colonic epithelial cells induce antibacterial factors and accelerate cell cycling in response to the microbiota. Oral treatment with IgA was sufficient to both reduce steady-state proliferation and protect mice from tumours, but this function was due to antibody structure rather than binding specificity. In both organoid and monolayer culture systems, IgA directly suppressed epithelial growth. Co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and a targeted CRISPR screen identified DMBT1 as an IgA-binding epithelial surface protein required for IgA-mediated suppression of proliferation. Together, IgA and DMBT1 regulate Notch signalling and tune the normal cycling of absorptive colonocyte progenitors. In mice, deleting the transmembrane and cytoplasmic signalling portions of DMBT1 or blocking Notch signalling was sufficient to reverse both the increased proliferation and tumour susceptibility of IgA knockouts. These experiments establish a homeostatic function for IgA in tempering physiological epithelial responses to microbiota to maintain mucosal health.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Cis-regulatory alterations and tandem triplication of AhHMA4 result in substantially elevated transcript levels compared to the closely related non-tolerant non-hyperaccumulator Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we identify cis-regulatory Metal Hyperaccumulation Elements (MHEs) necessary for AhHMA4 promoter activity, employing sequence comparisons and motif elicitation analyses combined with progressive deletions and site-directed mutagenesis of promoter-reporter constructs. We report that the promoters of all AhHMA4 gene copies share a distal MHE1 (consensus TGTAAC), and a proximal pair of MHE2s identical or highly similar to the Evening Element (AAAATATCT). Evening elements are known binding sites of Arabidopsis CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1), a phytochrome-regulated transcription factor in the core circadian clock. We show that the promoter of each AhHMA4 gene copy, but not of AtHMA4, mediates enhanced transcript levels of the reporter and their diel rhythmicity. These functional characteristics are CCA1-dependent and recapitulated by a synthetic reporter construct placing the MHE2 pair into the AtHMA4-promoter sequence context, according to the example of the AhHMA4-1 promoter. Consistent with our observations in transgenic reporter lines, AhHMA4 transcript levels follow a diel rhythm in wild-type A. halleri plants.

Alternative pathways (APs) have been designed to relocate the decarboxylating step or even fix additional carbon. To improve the success of transferring those engineered APs from model species to crops we must understand how they will interact with metabolism and how the plant physiology affects their performance. Here we used multiple mathematical modelling techniques to analyse and compare existing AP designs. We show that carbon-fixing APs are the most promising candidates to replace native photorespiration in major crop species. Our results demonstrate the different metabolic routes that APs employ to increase yield and which plant physiology can profit most from them.

However, the function and full genomic context of these paralogs remains uncharacterised. Here we present a highly contiguous long-read assembly of R. commune WAI453. Using this assembly, we show that the duplication of the NIP2 and NLP gene families is distributed throughout the genome and pre-dates the speciation of R. commune from its sister species. Some NIP2 paralogs have subsequently been lost or are absent in the sister species. The diversity of these paralogs was examined from R. commune global populations and their expression was analysed during in planta and in vitro growth to analyse the importance of these genes during infection. The majority of NIP2 and NLP paralogs in WAI453 genome were significantly upregulated during plant infection suggesting that the NIP2 and NLP genes harbour virulence roles. An attempt to further characterise function of NIP2.1 by infiltrating purified protein into barley leaves did not induce necrosis questioning its previously reported role as an inducer of host cell death. Together these results suggest that the NIP2 effector family does play a role during infection of barley, however the exact function of NIP2, like many effectors, remains uncharacterised.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Although the role of IAA and its transport in algae remains unclear, PIN-driven auxin export is probably an ancient and conserved trait within Streptophytes. Among streptophyte algae, Chara represents a genus with a considerable degree of complexity in body arrangement. This study investigates the auxin response and characterizes homologs of land plant PIN auxin efflux carriers in Chara braunii. Through regeneration experiments, we observed that IAA significantly promotes elongation of thallus and side branch development upon thallus tip decapitation, indicating an effect on morphogenesis. We show that IAA is actively uptaken and metabolized by thallus cells and that this process is influenced by N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA). To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we cloned and sequenced the most expressed Chara braunii PINs, CbPINa and CbPINc. Using epitope-specific antibodies, we showed their presence in the plasma membrane (PM) of vegetative internodal cells and generative antheridial cells. Functional tests in tobacco BY-2 cells, supported by in silico docking of IAA and NPA to CbPINa and CbPINc, showed that PM-localized CbPINa interferes with auxin transport in contrast to ER-localized CbPINc. Finally, our phosphoproteome analysis indicated that IAA rapidly induces specific phosphorylation events, including RAF-like kinase phosphorylation, highlighting a potential role for IAA in fast signaling processes in Chara braunii. Altogether, we provide new insights into IAA role in Chara braunii morphogenesis and suggest that while the canonical auxin transport mechanism may not be conserved, auxin still may likely play a role in rapid signaling pathways in this close relative of land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Most transcriptome analyses to date have focused on leaf-derived galls. To better understand gall formation mechanisms, we investigated stem-derived galls induced by the weevil Smicronyx madaranus on the parasitic plant Cuscuta campestris at gene expression, cellular, and physiological levels. RNA-seq across four developmental stages identified differentially expressed genes and associated gene ontology terms. Consistent with histological observations, genes related to cell division and the cell cycle were upregulated early but decreased as the gall matured. Similar to leaf-derived galls, we found high expression of PLETHORA and meristem-related homeobox genes in early gall development, suggesting that stem cell induction and maintenance are involved in various gall types. Like leaf-derived galls, the expression of genes related to floral organ development increased through the gall development. However, their expression patterns were dramatically different: downstream genes in the flowering pathway were highly expressed at the initial gall stage, whereas upstream genes were highly expressed later. This suggests that the weevil might activate the flowering pathway at unconventional stages, potentially rerouting the typical flowering cascade to influence gall development. Unlike the decrease in photosynthesis-related genes in leaf-derived galls, we observed an increase in these genes in galls formed on the stem of the holoparasitic plant. Shading experiments confirmed that photosynthesis is crucial for both gall growth and the weevil. This study highlights how gall-inducers can co-opt host resources and genetic pathways, offering new insights into the complexity of plant-insect interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

To date the majority of research has been focused on either individual hotspots or on relatively limited sets of hotspots in a small set of genomes, typically from a single species. A global understanding of hotspot diversity and dynamics still lacking. To address this gap, we developed iLund4u, an algorithm for the systematic annotation of hotspots across millions of sequences.

By analysing 873K phage genomes and 696K plasmid sequences we identified 13.7K hotspots and 171K diverse protein families encoded there as cargo. Furthermore, iLund4u allows for protein search and proteome annotation functions versus a precomputed iLund4u database. In the protein search mode iLund4u identifies all hotspots that encode homologues of a query protein.

The role of DDX41 in hematopoiesis and how its germline and somatic mutations contribute to MNs remain unclear. Here we show that DDX41 is essential for erythropoiesis but dispensable for the development of other hematopoietic lineages. Using stage-specific Cre models for erythropoiesis, we reveal that Ddx41 knockout in early erythropoiesis is embryonically lethal, while knockout in late-stage terminal erythropoiesis allows mice to survive with normal blood counts. DDX41 deficiency induces a significant upregulation of G-quadruplexes (G4), noncanonical DNA structures that tend to accumulate in the early stages of erythroid precursors. We show that DDX41 co-localizes with G4 on the erythroid genome. DDX41 directly binds to and dissolves G4, which is significantly compromised in MN-associated DDX41 mutants. Accumulation of G4 by DDX41 deficiency induces erythroid genome instability, defects in ribosomal biogenesis, and upregulation of p53. However, p53 deficiency does not rescue the embryonic death of Ddx41 hematopoietic-specific knockout mice. In parallel, genome instability also activates the cGas-Sting pathway, which is detrimental to survival since cGas-deficient and hematopoietic-specific Ddx41 knockout mice are viable without detectable hematologic phenotypes, although these mice continue to show erythroid ribosomal defects and upregulation of p53. These findings are further supported by data from a DDX41 mutated MN patient and human iPSC-derived bone marrow organoids. Our study establishes DDX41 as a G4 dissolver, essential for erythroid genome stability and suppressing the cGAS-STING pathway.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

This interest has rapidly extended to clinical work, with many reports investigating aperiodic activity from patients from a broad range of clinical disorders. This work typically seeks to evaluate aperiodic activity as a putative biomarker relating to diagnosis or treatment response, and/or as a potential marker of underlying physiological activity. There is thus far no clear consensus on if and how aperiodic neural activity relates to clinical disorders, nor on the best practices for how to study it in clinical research. To address this, this systematic literature review, following PRISMA guidelines, examines reports of aperiodic activity in electrophysiological recordings with human patients with psychiatric and/or neurological disorders, finding 143 reports across 35 distinct disorders. Reports within and across disorders are summarized to evaluate current findings and examine what can be learned as pertains to the analysis, interpretations, and overall utility of aperiodic neural activity in clinical investigations. Aperiodic activity is commonly reported to relate to clinical diagnoses, with 31 of 35 disorders reporting a significant effect in diagnostic and/or treatment related studies. However, there is variation in the consistency of results across disorders, with the heterogeneity of patient groups, disease etiologies, and treatment status arising as common themes across different disorders. Overall, the current variability of results, potentially confounding covariates, and limitations in current understanding of aperiodic activity suggests further work is needed before aperiodic activity can be established as a potential biomarker and/or marker of underlying pathological physiology. Finally, a series of recommendations are proposed, based on the findings, limitations, and key discussion topics of the current literature to assist with guiding productive future work on the clinical utility of studying aperiodic neural activity.

Two primary mechanisms of cell elimination have been identified in cell competition studies: contact-dependent cell death and mechanical compression-driven apoptosis. While both occur in tissues, their combined impact on population dynamics is unclear. Here we develop a cell-based computational model to study competition between two cell types with differing physical properties. The model integrates cellular mechanics with cell-cycle dynamics, contact-induced apoptosis, and cell extrusion via mechanical stress. Using this model, we explored how differences in physical traits between cell types influence competitive interactions. Our findings show that differences in cell compressibility alone can drive mechanical competition, with stiffer cells outcompeting softer ones in otherwise identical populations. Surprisingly, mutations that reduce cell stiffness, combined with decreased contact inhibition of proliferation, can create a ""soft"" super-competitive mutant. We demonstrate that changes in apoptosis sensitivity, cell adhesion, and cell size significantly affect growth potential and susceptibility to apoptosis. Furthermore, mutant cell colonies require a critical colony size, dependent on cell compressibility, to overtake the surrounding wild-type tissue. For colonies below the critical size, the elimination process is stochastic, driven by a protrusive finger-like instability in the interface between two cells that promote invasion of the supercompetitors.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Evaluation against established tools across diverse datasets demonstrated that, integrated within the FragPipe computational platform, MSFragger-DDA+ significantly increases identification sensitivity while maintaining stringent false discovery rate (FDR) control.

Antibiotics are known gut microbiota disruptors, but their long-term consequences on taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome remain underexplored.

MO_SCPLOWETHODSC_SCPLOWWe investigated associations between register-based oral antibiotic use over 8 years and gut microbiota composition assessed with fecal shotgun metagenomics in 15,131 adults from the Swedish population-based studies SCAPIS, MOS, and SIMPLER. We applied multivariable regression models with the number of prescriptions in three pre-specified periods before fecal sampling (<1 year, 1-4, 4-8 years) as the main exposures and adjusted for sociodemographics, lifestyle, and comorbidities. Secondary analyses included participants with only one antibiotic course or none.

RO_SCPLOWESULTSC_SCPLOWAntibiotic use <1 year before fecal sampling was associated with the greatest reduction in gut microbiota species diversity; however, antibiotic use 1-4 years and 4-8 years earlier was also associated with decreased diversity. Clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and flucloxacillin accounted for most of the associations between antibiotic use and the abundance of individual species across all periods. Use of these three antibiotics 4-8 years earlier was associated with altered abundance of 10-14% of the species studied; use of penicillin V, extended-spectrum penicillins, and nitrofurantoin were associated with altered abundance of only a few species. Similar results were found when comparing one antibiotic course 4-8 years before sampling vs. none in the past 8 years.

CONCLUSIONCommonly prescribed antibiotics like clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and the narrow-spectrum flucloxacillin appear to have long-lasting consequences for the gut microbiota.","NA","medrxiv",1729289321322

The evaluation of different approaches to feature selection is hampered by the fact that, as we show here, the performance of feature selection methods varies greatly with the task being performed. For routine cell type identification, even randomly chosen features can perform well, but for cell type differences that are subtle, both number of features and selection strategy can matter strongly. Here we present a simple feature selection method grounded in an analytical model that, without resorting to arbitrary thresholds or user-defined parameters, allows for interpretable delineation of both how many and which features to choose, facilitating identification of biologically meaningful rare cell types. We compare this method to default methods in scanpy and Seurat, as well as SCTransform, showing how greater accuracy can often be achieved with surprisingly few, well-chosen features.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

A better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms could help future development of adjunctive therapies, yet limitations in current experimental models have hindered our knowledge of the disease. We developed a 3D blood-brain barrier model with enhanced barrier properties using primary brain endothelial cells, astrocytes and pericytes. Exposure to parasite egress products increased microvascular permeability, likely due to transcriptional downregulation of junctional and vascular development genes in endothelial cells. In addition, it increased the expression of ferroptosis markers, antigen presentation and type I interferon genes across all BBB cell types. Incubation with cytoadherent schizont-stage P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes induced a similar, but highly localized transcriptional shift, along with inter-endothelial gaps at sites of parasite egress, significantly increasing permeability. These findings provide key insights into the parasite-mediated mechanisms driving brain microvascular pathogenesis in cerebral malaria.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

To achieve these for diploid and even polyploid genomes, the contemporary approach involves a combination of two long-read sequencing technologies: high-accuracy long reads, e.g. Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi or Oxford Nanopore (ONT)  Duplex reads, and ultra-long ONT  Simplex reads. Using two different technologies increases the cost and the required amount of genomic DNA. Here, we show that comparable results are possible using error correction of ultra-long ONT Simplex reads and then assembling them using state-of-the-art de novo assembly methods. To achieve this, we have developed the deep learning-based HERRO framework, which corrects ONT Simplex reads while carefully preserving differences in related genomic sequences. Taking into account informative positions that differentiate the haplotypes or genomic repeat copies, HERRO achieves an increase of read accuracy of up to 100-fold for diploid human genomes. By combining HERRO with Verkko assembler, we achieve high contiguity on several human genomes by reconstructing many chromosomes telomere-to-telomere, including chromosomes X and Y. HERRO supports both R9.4.1 and R10.4.1 ONT Simplex reads and generalizes well to other species.

However, most of the ligands described to date lack intra-G4 selectivity, severely limiting their potential for uncovering the biological function of individual G4s across the genome. To overcome these limitations, we developed ATENA (Approach to Target Exact Nucleic Acid alternative structures). ATENA relies on the chemical modification of established G4-ligands to enable their conjugation onto a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein (dCas9) using HaloTag, allowing for the targeting of individual G4s in living cells. We have systematically screened the length of the PEG-linkers connecting the G4-ligands to the HaloTag and sgRNA sequences to attain optimal G4 engagement both in vitro and in cells. Using optimized conditions, we leveraged ATENA to demonstrate how the selective targeting of the well-studied G4 in the promoter of the oncogene c-MYC suppresses its transcription exclusively from the P1 promoter. We also show that positioning ligands in the proximity of regulatory elements suppresses c-MYC transcription in a G4-independent manner, highlighting the importance of appropriate design to measure genuine G4-mediated transcriptional changes. We also demonstrate that selective targeting of a G4 in the PVT1 promoter can either stimulate or repress its transcription depending on the type of G4-ligand used, indicating that functional responses associated with G4-stabilization can highly depend on the type of ligand used. We further harnessed ATENA to study transcriptional perturbation associated with cell-specific G4s, revealing that the functional responses associated with these structures are tightly linked with the expression levels of the targeted gene. Our study provides critical insights into G4-based therapeutic design, offering an innovative platform to investigate G4 biology with high precision.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Recent work using single-cell transcriptomic approaches to create molecular definitions of cell types in the form of cell atlases has provided the necessary data for such an endeavor. Here, we present the Universal Cell Embedding (UCE) foundation model. UCE was trained on a corpus of cell atlas data from human and other species in a completely self-supervised way without any data annotations. UCE offers a unified biological latent space that can represent any cell, regardless of tissue or species. This universal cell embedding captures important biological variation despite the presence of experimental noise across diverse datasets. An important aspect of UCEs universality is that any new cell from any organism can be mapped to this embedding space with no additional data labeling, model training or fine-tuning. We applied UCE to create the Integrated Mega-scale Atlas, embedding 36 million cells, with more than 1,000 uniquely named cell types, from hundreds of experiments, dozens of tissues and eight species. We uncovered new insights about the organization of cell types and tissues within this universal cell embedding space, and leveraged it to infer function of newly discovered cell types. UCEs embedding space exhibits emergent behavior, uncovering new biology that it was never explicitly trained for, such as identifying developmental lineages and embedding data from novel species not included in the training set. Overall, by enabling a universal representation for every cell state and type, UCE provides a valuable tool for analysis, annotation and hypothesis generation as the scale and diversity of single cell datasets continues to grow.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321322

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321323

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","10.1186/s40168-024-01916-8","biorxiv",1729289321323

Fluorescent HaloTag ligands employed in sequential labeling led to the discovery of distinct protein variants for histones, cohesins, and MCM complexes. Nonetheless, an efficient biochemical approach to separate the distinct protein variants to study their biological functions is missing. Principally being a gap in technology, the HaloTag toolbox lacks affinity ligands displaying good cell permeability and efficient affinity capture. Here, we describe the design, synthesis, and validation of a new cell-permeable Biotin-HaloTag ligand, which allows rapid labeling of Halo-tagged proteins in live cells and their efficient separation using streptavidin pull-down. Our work outlines how to use the herein-developed affinity ligand in sequential labeling to biochemically separate distinct protein variants and study their biological properties. The approach holds immense potential for addressing fundamental questions concerning essential cellular processes, including genome duplication and chromatin maintenance.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321323

Yet, no efficient mechanisms for their removal have been identified. Here we report bioaccumulation of PFAS by several gut bacterial species over a wide range of concentrations from nanomolar up to 500 M. For bioaccumulating Bacteroides uniformis, a highly prevalent species, we estimate intracellular PFAS concentration in the mM range - above that of most native metabolites. Despite this high bioaccumulation, B. uniformis cells could grow appreciably up to 250 M perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure. Escherichia coli, which accumulated PFAS to a much lesser extent, substantially increased PFAS bioaccumulation when lacking TolC efflux pump indicating trans-membrane transport in PFAS bioaccumulation. Electron microscopy and cryogenic Focused Ion Beam-Secondary Ion Mass-spectrometry revealed distinct morphological changes and intracellular localisation of PFNA aggregates. Bioaccumulation of PFAS and transmembrane transport is also evident in proteomics, metabolomics, thermal proteome profiling, and mutations following adaptive laboratory evolution. In an in vivo context, mice colonized with human gut bacteria showed, compared to germ-free controls or those colonized with low-bioaccumulating bacteria, higher PFNA levels in excreted feces. As the gut microbiota is a critical interface between exposure and human body, our results have implications for understanding and utilizing microbial contribution to PFAS clearance.","NA","biorxiv",1729289321323
