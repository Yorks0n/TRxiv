While highly processed food like packaged products, processed meat, and sweetened soft drinks have been increasingly associated with unhealthy diet, information on the degree of processing characterizing an item in a store is not straight forward to obtain, limiting the ability of individuals to make informed choices. Here we introduce GroceryDB, a database with over 50,000 food items sold by Walmart, Target, and Wholefoods, unveiling how big data can be harnessed to empower consumers and policymakers with systematic access to the degree of processing of the foods they select, and the potential alternatives in the surrounding food environment. The extensive data gathered on ingredient lists and nutrition facts enables a large-scale analysis of ingredient patterns and degrees of processing, categorized by store, food category, and price range. Our findings reveal that the degree of food processing varies significantly across different food categories and grocery stores. Furthermore, this data allows us to quantify the individual contribution of over 1,000 ingredients to ultra-processing. GroceryDB and the associated http://TrueFood.Tech/ website make this information accessible, guiding consumers toward less processed food choices while assisting policymakers in reforming the food supply.","NA","medrxiv",1737237978994

The activity of individual L1 promoters is surprisingly divergent and correlates with an active epigenetic state. Efficient on-target CRISPRi silencing of L1s revealed nearly a hundred co-opted L1-derived chimeric transcripts and L1 silencing resulted in changes in neural differentiation programs and reduced cerebral organoid size.

Even though many proteins of the kinetochore are highly conserved, centromeres are among the fastest evolving regions within a genome, showing extensive variation even on short evolutionary timescales. Here, we sought to understand how new types of centromeres emerge and reach fixation by mapping centromere evolution across 138 budding yeast species and over 2,500 natural strain isolates. We show that new centromeres spread progressively via drift and subsequent selection, and that the kinetochore interface, which is evolving slowly in relative terms, determines which new centromere variants are tolerated. Together, our findings provide insight into the evolutionary constraints and trajectories shaping centromere evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

Whether and how frequently that resistance occurred before the introduction is harder to determine, as isolates could not have been tested for resistance before an antibiotic was discovered. Historical collections, like the British National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC), stretching back to 1885, provide a window into this history. Here we match 1,817 sequenced high-quality genomes from the NCTC collection to their respective year of isolation to study resistance genes before and concurrent with the age of antibiotics. Concordant with previous work, we find resistance genes in both pathogens and environmental samples before the age of antibiotics. While generally rare before the introduction of an antibiotic, we find an associated increase in frequency with antibiotic introduction. Finally, we observe a trend of resistance elements becoming both increasingly mobile and nested within multiple mobile elements as time goes on. More broadly, our findings suggest that likely-functional antibiotic resistance genes were circulating in clinically relevant isolates before the age of antibiotics, but human usage is associated with increasing both their overall prevalence and mobility.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

Here, we use a comprehensive and environmentally balanced collection of metagenomes to survey the defence landscape across complex microbial communities. We also assess the association between the viral community and the prevalence of defence systems. We identify strong environmental effects in predicting overall defence abundance, with animal-host-associated environments and hot environments harbouring more defences overall. We also find a positive correlation between the density and diversity of viruses in the community and the abundance of defence systems. This study provides insights into the ecological factors that influence the composition and distribution of bacterial defence systems in complex microbial environments and outlines future directions for the study of defence system ecology.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

The identification of new agents with differentiated pharmacokinetic and drug resistance profiles will increase therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients and bolster pandemic preparedness generally. Starting with a lead-like dihydrouracil chemotype from a large-library docking campaign, we improved MPro inhibition >1,000 fold by engaging additional subsites in the MPro active site, most notably by employing a latent propargyl electrophile to engage the catalytic Cys145. Advanced leads from this series, including AVI 4516 and AVI 4773 show pan-coronavirus antiviral activity in cells, very low clearance in mice, and for AVI 4773 a rapid reduction in viral titers more than a million fold after just three doses, more rapidly and effectively than the approved drugs, nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir. Both AVI 4516 and AVI 4773 are well distributed in mouse tissues, including brain, where concentrations ten or fifteen-thousand times the EC90, respectively, are observed eight hours after an oral dose. As exemplar of the series, AVI 4516 shows minimal inhibition of major CYP isoforms and human cysteine and serine proteases, likely due to its latent electrophilic warhead. AVI 4516 also exhibits synergy in cellular infection models in combination with the RdRp inhibitor molnupiravir, while related analogs strongly inhibit nirmatrelvir-resistant MPro mutant virus in cells. The in vivo and antiviral properties of this new chemotype are differentiated from existing clinical and pre-clinical MPro inhibitors, and will advance new therapeutic development against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other coronaviruses.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

In this study, we modeled the hierarchical and modular network organization by connecting multiple organoids and tested if the connection enhances the external stimuli-induced network refinement. We cultured networks of one, two, or three organoids on high-density microelectrode arrays, applied repetitive stimulation at two input locations from the microelectrodes, and monitored emergence of output signals that can decode the stimulus locations with machine learning algorithms. After two weeks of daily stimulation, networks of three organoids showed significantly higher stimulus decoding capability compared to the simpler one- or two-organoid networks. Long-term stimulation induced pronounced changes in the three-organoid network's response patterns, spontaneous activity, and inter- and intra-organoid functional connectivity. These findings underscore the importance of hierarchical network organization, e.g. creating distinct subnetworks with specialized roles, for stimuli-induced formation of circuits with robust input-output functionality.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty.

ObservationsWe aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted (1 death averted per 5,400 vaccine doses administered). Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (1 life-year saved per 900 vaccine doses administered). Sensitivity range was 7.4-23.6 million life-years. Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit.

Conclusions and relevanceBased on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still clearly demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1737237978994

While the effects of plant domestication at the genetic and phenotypic levels are well-documented, its impact on plant microbiome remains less understood. Root microbiomes play crucial roles in nutrient acquisition, pathogen defense, and biotic stress tolerance, yet the influence of domestication on their diversity and assembly is still debated. Two primary hypotheses have been proposed: 1) the reduction in microbial diversity resulting from the domestication process, and 2) the diminished ability of host plants to control their microbiomes. To evaluate these hypotheses, we conducted a meta-analysis of multiple crops, comparing the root microbiomes of domesticated plants and their wild relatives. Our results indicate that the effects of domestication are species-specific and context-dependent, with most domesticated plants exhibiting increased microbial diversity and more structured communities, while others show no significant change. Overall, this study provides evidence that plant domestication does not lead to a uniform reduction in microbial diversity or a consistently diminished ability of plants to influence their microbiomes. Based on these findings, we discuss new perspectives and the need for future studies incorporating native soils and host genetic variation in such experiments, analyzing not only diversity but also microbiome function, and considering how root morphology might affect microbiome recruitment. Finally, we highlight the need for research on the potential adaptive or maladaptive consequences that introgression between wild and domesticated plants could have from a microbiome perspective.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

The OT-I mouse TCR is widely used to study anti-gen discrimination utilising many pMHCs, including foreign and self antigens. Previous studies sug-gested that OT-I T cells achieve near-perfect discrimination between higher and lower affinity antigens. Moreover, these 3D affinities measured in solution did not correlate with the 2D membrane affinities, suggesting a complex relationship between 3D and 2D affinities. In contrast, other TCRs have shown imperfect antigen discrimination and strong correlations between 3D and 2D affinities. To resolve these discrepancies, we extended a protocol for measuring ultra-low TCR/pMHC affinities to accurately de-termine the 3D affinities of the OT-I TCR binding 19 pMHC complexes. These revised 3D affinities now strongly correlate with the 2D affinities, and accurately predict functional responses. Importantly, we now find that the OT-I TCR exhibits enhanced yet imperfect antigen discrimination, similar to other TCRs, allowing it to detect abnormally high levels of low-affinity self-antigens. Finally, we show that discrimination is highest with low-affinity pMHC ligands, a finding predicted by the kinetic-proofreading model of antigen discrimination. This work underscores the ability of T cells to effectively gauge prox-ies for 3D affinity within the 2D cell-cell interface, with significant implications for the mechanisms underlying antigen discrimination.

Lay abstractT cells protect the body from infection by distinguishing between foreign and self molecules. They do this using a specialized receptor called the T cell receptor (TCR), which senses differences in how strongly it binds to foreign versus self molecules. Scientists have used a mouse TCR called OT-I to understand this process, concluding that OT-I T cells exhibit near perfect discrimination between foreign and self antigens based on a sharp affinity threshold. However, conflicting results from experiments on other TCRs hinted at a more complicated picture. In this study, we used an improved method to accurately measure OT-I TCR binding affinity to 19 peptides, including foreign and self antigens. In contrast to previous results and like other TCRs, we found that OT-I T cells display enhanced but im-perfect discrimination, enabling them to be activated by high levels of self antigen. The new data also revealed that the ability of T cells to discriminate antigens is particularly high at low affinities. These findings reconcile apparent discrepancies between the OT-I TCR and other TCRs, and have implications for understanding diseases where T cells often respond to self antigen, such as autoimmunity and cancer.

In mice, reducing dietary levels of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) recapitulates many of the benefits of a low protein diet; BCAA-restricted diets extend lifespan, reduce frailty, and improve metabolic health, while BCAA supplementation shortens lifespan, promotes obesity, and impairs glycemic control. Recently, high protein diets have been shown to promote cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging implicated in many age-related diseases, in the liver of mice. Here, we test the hypothesis that the effects of high protein diets on metabolic health and on cell senescence are mediated by BCAAs. We find that reducing dietary levels of BCAAs protects male and female mice from the negative metabolic consequences of both normal and high protein diets. Further, we identify tissue-specific effects of BCAAs on cellular senescence, with restriction of all three BCAAs - but not individual BCAAs - protecting from hepatic cellular senescence while potentiating cell senescence in white adipose tissue. We find that the effects of BCAAs on hepatic cellular senescence are cell-autonomous, with lower levels of BCAAs protecting cultured cells from antimycin-A induced senescence. Our results demonstrate a direct effect of a specific dietary component on a hallmark of aging and suggest that cellular senescence may be highly susceptible to dietary interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

The T. cruzi life cycle includes transitions between epimastigote, metacyclic trypomastigote, amastigote, and blood trypomastigote stages, each marked by distinct morphological and molecular adaptations to different hosts and environments. Unlike other trypanosomatids, T. cruzi does not employ antigenic variation but instead relies on a diverse array of cell-surface-associated proteins encoded by large multi-copy gene families (multigene families), essential for infectivity and immune evasion. This study analyzes cell-specific transcriptomes using single-cell RNA sequencing of amastigote and trypomastigote cells to characterize stage-specific surface protein expression during mammalian infection. Through clustering and identification of cell-specific markers, we assigned cells to distinct parasite developmental forms. Analysis of individual cells revealed that surface protein-coding genes, especially members of the trans-sialidase TcS superfamily (TcS), are expressed with greater heterogeneity than single-copy genes. Additionally, no recurrent combinations of TcS genes were observed between individual cells in the population. Our findings thus reveal transcriptomic heterogeneity within trypomastigote populations where each cell displays unique TcS expression profiles. Focusing on the diversity of surface protein expression, this research aims to deepen our understanding of T. cruzi cellular biology and infection strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

Upregulated intestinal proteolysis and PAR2-signaling are implicated in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). To identify potential bacterial regulators of PAR2 activity, we developed a functional assay for PAR2 processing and used it to screen conditioned media from a library of diverse gut commensal microbes. We found that multiple bacteria secrete proteases that cleave host PAR2. Using chemoproteomic profiling with a covalent irreversible inhibitor, we identified a previously uncharacterized Bacteroides fragilis serine protease Bfp1, and showed that it cleaves and activates PAR2 in multicellular and murine models. PAR2 cleavage by Bfp1 disrupts the intestinal barrier, sensitizes nociceptors, and triggers colonic inflammation and abdominal pain. Collectively, our findings uncover Bfp1-mediated PAR2-processing as a new axis of host-commensal-interaction in the gut that has the potential to be targeted for therapeutic intervention in IBD or IBS.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

We call this assay 3-Prime Adenosine-Retaining Aminoacyl-tRNA Isolation (PARTI). It relies on high-resolution mass spectrometry identification of the acyl-adenosine species released upon RNase A cleavage of isolated cellular tRNA. Here we develop the PARTI workflow and apply it to understand three recent observations related to the cellular incorporation of non-- amino acid monomers into protein: (1) the origins of the apparent selectivity of translation with respect to {beta}2-hydroxy acid enantiomers; (2) the activity of PylRS variants for benzyl derivatives of malonic acid; and (3) the apparent inability of N-Me amino acids to function as ribosome substrates in living cells. Using the PARTI assay, we also provide direct evidence for the cellular production of 2,3-diacylated tRNA in certain cases. The ease and simplicity of the PARTI workflow should benefit ongoing efforts to study and improve the cellular incorporation of non--amino acid monomers into proteins.

Phosphorylated tau accumulates in the LC and results in inflammation, synaptic loss, and eventually cell death in other brain regions as the disease progresses. Loss of LC neurons and noradrenergic innervation is thought to contribute to the symptoms of cognitive decline later in disease. While loss and degeneration of LC neurons has been well studied, less is known about changes in LC physiology at advanced stages of tau pathology that precedes neurodegeneration. In this study, we investigated the ex vivo electrophysiological properties of LC neurons in male and female mice from the P301S mouse model of tauopathy at 9 months of age, a time-point when significant tau accumulation, cell death, and cognitive impairments are observed. We found a reduction in excitatory inputs and changes in excitatory post-synaptic current kinetics in male and female P301S. There was also a decrease in spontaneous discharge of LC neurons and an increase in AP threshold in P301S mice of both sexes. Finally, we observed a decrease in excitability and increase in rheobase current in P301S mice. Despite the decrease in LC activity in slice, we did not identify differences in total tissue norepinephrine (NE) or NE metabolites in prefrontal cortex or hippocampus. Together these findings demonstrate reductions in the activity and excitability of LC neurons at late stages of tau accumulation. However, compensatory mechanisms may maintain normal NE levels in LC projection regions in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

Agonists which bind and stimulate multiple receptors have shown particular promise. However, off target effects, including nausea and diarrhoea, remain a complication of using these agents, and modified versions with optimized pharmacological profiles and/or biased signaling at the cognate receptors are increasingly sought. Here, we describe the synthesis and properties of a molecule which binds to both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors (GLP-1R and GIPR) to enhance insulin secretion. HISHS-2001 shows increased affinity at the GLP-1R, as well as a tendency towards reduced internalization and recycling at this receptor versus FDA-approved dual GLP-1R/GIPR agonist tirzepatide. HISHS-2001 also displayed significantly greater bias towards cAMP generation versus {beta}-arrestin 2 recruitment compared to tirzepatide. In contrast, Gs recruitment was lower versus tirzepatide at the GLP-1R, but higher at the GIPR. Administered to obese hyperglycaemic db/db mice, HISHS-2001 increased circulating insulin whilst lowering body weight and HbA1c with similar efficacy to tirzepatide at substantially lower doses. Thus, HISHS-2001 represents a novel dual receptor agonist with an improved pharmacological profile.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

Here, we study the long-term outcomes of hybridization, using a model that allows us to tune several properties of the genetic variation, including the strength and architecture of heterosis, thereby unifying the classical theories. Results suggest that long-term outcomes depend mainly on the variance in epistasis, which determines the ruggedness of the fitness landscape, but without affecting the heterosis. Together, results suggest that the study of heterosis may tell us relatively little about the long-term outcomes of hybridization, and that hybridization might bring benefits more often than has been assumed.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

While reading intervention improved reading skills and increased VWFA size, disparities persisted, suggesting that VWFA abnormalities are an enduring trait of dyslexia.

Memory B cells (MBCs), pivotal to adaptive immunity, generate high-affinity antibodies upon antigen re-encounter. While single-cell high-throughput sequencing has revolutionized antibody repertoire studies, it has critical limitations: the inability to simultaneously determine antigen-binding specificities and immunoglobulin gene sequences, and high resource demands that limit accessibility in low-resource settings. Here, we present a cost-effective single-cell culture (SCC) platform enabling comprehensive analysis of human MBC repertoires, including epitope-specific responses, cross-reactivity studies, and mAb isolation. Using SARS-CoV-2 convalescent and vaccinated donor samples, we optimized MBC SCCs with NB21 feeder cells, R848, and IL-2 stimulation, achieving high cloning efficiency and a 30-fold enrichment of antigen-specific MBCs compared to bulk cultures. Among 592 isolated mAbs, 52.7% exhibited specificity to the Wuhan strain Spike protein, with 27.9% targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD), 15.4% the N-terminal domain (NTD), and 56.7% other regions, likely the S2 domain. Comparative analysis revealed distinct cross-reactivity patterns: 40.5% of all anti-Spike mAbs recognized all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants (Wuhan, Beta, Delta, Gamma and Omicron BA.2), while 29.6% showed recognition of only four variants, the majority not including Omicron BA.2; 56 single strain reactive mAbs (14.9%) were also identified. Notably, all screening and neutralization assays were performed directly with culture supernatants, eliminating the need for large-scale sequencing and transfection. Desired clones were selected for recombinant mAb production. The SCC platform also enabled unbiased immunoglobulin repertoire profiling, revealing convergent V-region rearrangements, including public V3-30 and V3-53/V3-66 antibodies consistent with prior SARS-CoV-2 studies. Two public RBD-targeting clones with broad neutralization potential were validated in pseudovirus neutralization assays. This streamlined platform delivers simultaneous antigen-specific mAb isolation, V-region sequencing, and functional studies within seven days, empowering researchers in low-resource settings to address global health inequities and enhance preparedness for future pandemics.","NA","medrxiv",1737237978994

This study reveals that LTA binds to multiple proteins involved in cell wall processes and preserves cell wall integrity by regulating one of the LTA-binding proteins, ScaH. ScaH is a peptidoglycan hydrolase predicted to have N-acetylglucosaminidase and amidase/peptidase activities. LTA inhibits ScaH's enzymatic activities by direct binding and represses scaH transcription by an unknown mechanism. During early growth, LTA is highly expressed and sequesters ScaH at the cell membrane, preventing ScaH activity in the cell wall. However, LTA expression decreases during the late growth phase, leading to ScaH translocation into the cell wall. This reduction in LTA coincides with increased wall teichoic acid (WTA) expression and cleavage of the LTA synthase LtaS. In the LTA-null mutant, ScaH inactivation restored peptidoglycan crosslinking, osmoresistance, and beta-lactam resistance both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that LTA protects the cell wall by suppressing ScaH expression and activity while sequestering it during active growth. Additionally, the reciprocal expression patterns of LTA and WTA indicate an interconnected regulation of teichoic acids in S. aureus, with their roles likely depending on the growth phase.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

Here, we present SFCalculator, a differentiable pipeline that generates crystallographic observables from atomistic molecular structures with bulk solvent correction, bridging crystallographic data and neural network-based molecular modeling. We validate SFCalculator against conventional methods and demonstrate its utility by establishing three important proof-of-concept applications. First, SFCalculator enables accurate placement of molecular models relative to crystal lattices (known as phasing). Second, SFCalculator enables the search of the latent space of generative models for conformations that fit crystallographic data and are, therefore, also implicitly constrained by the information encoded by the model. Finally, SFCalculator enables the use of crystallographic data during training of generative models, enabling these models to generate an ensemble of conformations consistent with crystallographic data.

Microbial community composition has been shown to impact disease progression in these models. Despite this, the maturation of the early-life murine microbiome has not been well-characterized. We address this gap by characterizing the assembly of the bacterial microbiota of C57BL/6 and BALB/c litters from birth to adulthood across multiple independent litters.

ResultsThe fecal microbiome of young pups is simple, dominated by only a few pioneering bacterial taxa. These taxa are present at low levels in the microbiota of multiple maternal body sites, precluding a clear identification of maternal source. The pup microbiota begins diversifying after fourteen days, coinciding with the beginning of coprophagy and the consumption of solid foods. Pup stool bacterial community composition and diversity are not significantly different from dams from day 21 onwards. Short-read shotgun sequencing-based metagenomic profiling of young pups enabled the assembly of metagenome-assembled genomes for strain-level analysis of these pioneer Ligilactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Proteus species.

ConclusionsAssembly of the murine microbiome occurs over the first weeks of postnatal life and is largely complete by day 21.

While a large variety of anti- phage defense mechanisms has been characterized, how expression of these systems is distributed across individual cells and how their combined activities translate into protection from phages has not been studied. Using bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing, we profiled the transcriptomes of [~]50,000 cells from cultures of a human pathobiont, Bacteroides fragilis, infected with a lytic bacteriophage. We quantified the asynchronous progression of phage infection in single bacterial cells and reconstructed the infection timeline, characterizing both host and phage transcriptomic changes as infection unfolded. We discovered a subpopulation of bacteria that remained uninfected and determined the heterogeneously expressed host factors associated with protection. Each cells vulnerability to phage infection was defined by combinatorial phase-variable expression of multiple genetic loci, including capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis pathways, restriction-modification systems (RM), and a previously uncharacterized operon likely encoding fimbrial genes. By acting together, these heterogeneously expressed phase-variable systems and anti-phage defense mechanisms create a phenotypic landscape where distinct protective combinations enable the survival and re-growth of bacteria expressing these phenotypes without acquiring additional mutations. The emerging model of complementary action of multiple protective mechanisms heterogeneously expressed across an isogenic bacterial population showcases the potent role of phase variation and stochasticity in bacterial anti-phage defenses.

One Sentence SummaryCombinatorial phenotypic states with differential vulnerability to phage infection across a Bacteroides fragilis population enable a small number of super-resistant bacterial cells to evade the phage without the need for acquiring mutations.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

Studies of lysine demethylase PHF2 have reported its critical role in lipid metabolism in pathological processes, although there are no data regarding its role during MuSC fate transition. Here we show that PHF2 controls lipid droplet homeostasis in MuSCs during regenerative myogenesis, by promoting the contact between lipid droplets and mitochondria. Consistently, in absence of PHF2, myocytes accumulate lipid droplets, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired regeneration. Interestingly, such phenotype is rescued by AMPKa2-PHF2 phospho-mimetic mutant expression.

Previous fMRI studies delineated focal domain-general, or multiple-demand (MD), PFC areas that co-activate during diverse cognitively demanding tasks. While there is some evidence for category-selective (face and scene) patches, in human and non-human primate PFC, these have not been systematically assessed. Recent precision fMRI studies have also revealed sensory-biased PFC patches adjacent to MD regions. To investigate if this topographic arrangement extends to other domains, we analysed two independent fMRI datasets (n=449 and n=37) utilizing the high-resolution multimodal MRI approaches of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Both datasets included cognitive control tasks and stimuli spanning different categories: faces, places, tools and body parts. Contrasting each stimulus category against the remaining ones revealed focal interdigitated patches of activity located adjacent to core MD regions. The results were robust, replicating across different executive tasks, experimental designs (block and event-related) and at the single subject level.

LDAK-PBAT tests pathways for significance using a heritability-based framework that controls for both the contributions of genes not in the pathway and of inter-genic SNPs.

LDAK-PBAT is computationally efficient, requiring only GWAS summary statistics and a reference panel, and when applied to human traits, can test 1000s of pathways within minutes. When assessed using simulated phenotypes, we find that LDAK-PBAT is well calibrated and has high sensitivity and specificity, outperforming both MAGMA and hypergeometric testing (F1 score of 0.734, versus 0.636 and 0.570, respectively).

When used to test 6,000 pathways for each of 37 traits (obtained from the UK Biobank, Millions Veterans Program and psychiatric genomics consortium; sample sizes ranging from 17,014 to 1,114,458), LDAK-PBAT identified 4,861 significant pathways (P < 0.05/6000), which is substantially more than found by MAGMA (97) and hypergeometric testing (522).

LDAK-PBAT emerges as a powerful tool for advancing genetic research, offering advanced insights into complex diseases. Its precise estimation of pathway enrichment and heritability, along with superior performance in detecting significant pathways. LDAK-PBAT holds significant promise for uncovering the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases and driving forward the development of personalized medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1737237978994

Melbournevirus encodes a distinct H2B-H2A histone doublet variant in addition to the canonical H4-H3 and H2B-H2A doublets. This viral histone variant has a truncated H2B portion and its amino acid sequence deviates from that of the main viral H2B-H2A throughout the entire coding region. It is less abundant than the main H2B-H2A doublet, is essential for melbournevirus fitness, and is conserved in all Marseilleviridae. The cryo-EM structure of a nucleosome-like particle reconstituted with this H2B-H2A variant and viral H4-H3 reveals that only 90 base pairs of DNA are stably bound, significantly less than in eukaryotic nucleosomes and viral nucleosomes made with the main fused viral histone doublets. The reduced ability to bind DNA can be attributed to structural differences between variant and main H2B-H2A. Variant melbournevirus nucleosomes are less stable, possibly aiding rapid genome unpacking to initiate gene expression.

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1737237978994

Metabolic dependencies that protect PDAC cells from detrimental oxidative stress in a nutrient-restricted niche represent as tumor-specific targets. While the role of mitochondria in supporting energy production and biosynthetic requirements of cells has been well investigated, their contribution to maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis when PDAC cells are exposed to nutrient limitation is unknown. Our results demonstrate that cytosolic transport of citrate via SLC25A1 confers a survival advantage to PDAC cells by protecting them from ferroptosis, a well-established, iron-dependent cell death mechanism, under nutrient-limited conditions. Employing selective SLC25A1 inhibitor or targeting mitochondrial OXPHOS dramatically reduced GPX4 expression and PDAC cell viability. Rescuing GPX4 expression with the products of both ACLY and ACO1-dependent pathways uncovered their critical role in conferring survival advantage under metabolic stress. Importantly, exogenous expression of GPX4 restored compromised redox and metabolic discordance resulting from the lack of SLC25A1 activity, indicating the requirement of citrate-induced GPX4 expression to support mitochondrial health and function. As observed with cultured cells under nutrient limitation, SLC25A1 function was revealed to be indispensable in pancreatic tumor microenvironment, and the reduced growth due to the lack of SLC25A1 activity was rescued with antioxidant NAC. Lastly, SLC25A1 suppression was accompanied by elevated glutamine metabolism, and combination therapy with pharmacologic inhibitors of SLC25A1 and glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 dramatically suppressed tumor growth, highlighting this combinatorial approach as a potential therapeutic strategy in PDAC.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

Imaging and microrheology in human disease-related model identify structural keratin cages surrounding pigment organelles to stiffen their microenvironment and maintain their 3D position. Optimum pigment spatialization is required for DNA photoprotection and rely on the interplay between intermediate filaments and microtubules bridged by plectin cytolinkers.

Their genomes evolve from genetically diverse germlines in complex and dynamic environments, including exposure to potential carcinogens. This heterogeneity of humans, our environmental exposures, and subsequent tumours makes it challenging to understand the extent to which cancer evolution is predictable. Addressing this limitation, we re-ran early tumour evolution hundreds of times in diverse, inbred mouse strains, capturing genetic variation comparable to and beyond that found in human populations. The sex, environment, and carcinogenic exposures were all controlled and tumours comprehensively profiled with whole genome and transcriptome sequencing. Within a strain, there was a high degree of consistency in the mutational landscape, a limited range of driver mutations, and all strains converged on the acquisition of a MAPK activating mutation with similar transcriptional disruption of that pathway. Despite these similarities in the phenotypic state of tumours, different strains took markedly divergent paths to reach that state. This included pronounced biases in the precise driver mutations, the strain specific occurrence of whole genome duplication, and differences in subclonal selection that reflected both cancer susceptibility and tumour growth rate. These results show that interactions between the germline genome and the environment are highly deterministic for the trajectory of tumour genome evolution, and even modest genetic divergence can substantially alter selection pressures during cancer development, influencing both cancer risk and the biology of the tumour that develops.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

While tissue patterning has been viewed as the transition from initially identical un-patterned cells to an arrangement of different cell types, recent evidence suggests that initial heterogeneities between cells modulate tissue-scale pattern formation. Yet, how such heterogeneities arise and, thereafter, regulate cell type emergence in a population of cells is poorly understood. Using in vivo and in vitro mouse regenerative systems, we identify a critical tissue density that is required to induce heterogeneous inactivation of the mechanosensor YAP1. Experimental and biophysical approaches demonstrate that YAP1 cell-to-cell heterogeneity pre-patterns the first cell fate decision, via both chromatin remodelling and a supracellular feedback between FOXA1 and Delta-Notch signalling. This feedback motif induces cell fate bistability endowing memory to the system and the maintenance of patterns during homeostasis. These findings reveal a generalisable framework in which transient cell-to-cell heterogeneity, regulated by tissue-scale properties, serves as a critical control parameter for the emergence of cell fate and stable patterning during regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

Typically, double-strand DNA phages possess genomes around 50 kilobase pairs (kbp) in size, although the largest known genome surpasses 735 kbp. This raises intriguing questions about the potential maximum size of phage genomes. In this study, we present the first phage genome over 800 kbp, named BF3, which was reconstructed from oil reservoir production water. BF3 encodes 1,164 protein-coding genes (code 11) and 46 tRNA genes, and is classified within the Caudoviricetes, though its bacterial host remains unidentified. We utilized ColabFold to predict the structures of 744 protein-coding genes with high confidence, finding that 395 and 591 of these genes corresponded with known structures in the Protein Data Bank and the Big Fantastic Virus Database (BFVD), respectively. Notably, 153 of BF3s predicted structures exhibited no similarity to those catalogued in the BFVD, which is currently the most extensive viral protein structure database. This study not only expands our understanding of phage genome capacities but also underscores the need for specialized analytical tools and pipelines to investigate exceptionally large phages.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

Male-killing is a convergently evolved trait, with microbes evolving diverse male-killing mechanisms across host species with widely divergent sex determination pathways. A common evolutionary response to MK presence is the spread of suppressor mutations that restore male survival. In this study, we demonstrate evolution of a novel male-killing mechanism that is insensitive to an existing male-killing suppressor. Hypolimnas bolina butterflies from Yogyakarta, Indonesia, showed extreme female biased population sex ratio associated with high prevalence of a male-killing Wolbachia. This strain, wBol1Y, shared a very recent common ancestor with the previously characterized  suppressed male-killing strain in the species, wBol1, but retained its male-killing ability in the presence of the male-killing suppressor. The genome of wBol1Y differed from the suppressed wBol1 in carrying an additional prophage that included strong candidate genes for male-killing. In vitro and in vivo data demonstrated that wBol1Y feminized splicing and expression of lepidopteran sex determination pathway genes, and that the gene Hb-oscar - present on wBol1Ys unique prophage insert - was sufficient to disrupt the male sex determination pathway. Our study demonstrates the diversity of male-killing mechanisms is a product both of interaction with varying insect sex determination systems and evolution of male-killing within a host species. Our data indicate male-killer and host may be involved in escalating arms races, where spread male-killing suppression drives evolution of additional systems that reestablish male killing by the symbiont.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

We evaluated if dynamic features of tau-PET with [18F]PI-2620 allow assessment of A/T/N in individual patients using a single imaging session. Cortical tissue clearance (K2a) of [18F]PI-2620 was validated as a surrogate of the {beta}-amyloid status against {beta}-amyloid-PET and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A{beta}42/40 ratio, demonstrating remarkable positive (91.5%) and negative (95.1%) predictive values at an AUC of 0.99 (P<0.0001). K2a outperformed cortical tau burden as a surrogate for {beta}-amyloid status in 47 participants with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD (3/4-repeat(R)-tauopathy) and 82 {beta}-amyloid-negative patients with primary 4R-tauopathies. Perfusion-like [18F]PI-2620 images (R1) were validated as a surrogate marker for neuronal injury, exhibiting strong quantitative and visual correlations with FDG-PET and early-phase {beta}-amyloid-PET, as well as with volumetric MRI and CSF total tau levels.

Here, we reveal that SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 potently inhibits translation in bat cells from Rhinolophus lepidus, belonging to the same genus as known sarbecovirus reservoirs hosts. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 bound to the Rhinolophus lepidus 40S ribosome and show that it blocks the mRNA entry channel via targeting a highly conserved site among mammals. Accordingly, we found that nsp1 blocked protein translation in mammalian cell lines from several species, underscoring its broadly inhibitory activity and conserved role in numerous SARS-CoV-2 hosts. Our findings illuminate the arms race between coronaviruses and mammalian host immunity (including bats), providing a foundation for understanding the determinants of viral maintenance in bat hosts and spillovers.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

We found that TCR signals suppressed characteristic features of IL-15-induced CD8+ T-cell activation, including increased NKG2D expression and upregulation of genes related to NK cytotoxicity and IFN response. Moreover, ionomycin suppressed IL-15-induced bystander activation and NK-like cytotoxicity, indicating that Ca2+-calcineurin signaling is responsible for TCR-mediated suppression of IL-15-induced bystander activation. In detail, NFATc1 suppressed IL-15- induced bystander activation via binding to AP-1 that is necessary for the IL-15-induced upregulation of NK cytotoxicity-related genes. Consistent with these results, calcineurin inhibitors enhanced IL-15-induced NKG2D expression in the presence of TCR signals. Additionally, we defined genes upregulated by IL-15 and downregulated by concurrent TCR signals as an IL-15-induced bystander activation gene set, and found that this gene signature was upregulated in bystander CD8+ T cells from patients with hepatitis A virus infection. This study paves the way for further investigation of bystander CD8+ T-cell activation in various pathological conditions, and its regulation.

Antibodies often originate in the lymph node (LN), specifically at the extrafollicular border of B cell follicles, where T and B lymphocytes physically interact to drive B cell maturation into antibody-secreting plasmablasts. In vitro models of this process are sorely needed to predict aspects of the human immune response. Microphysiological systems (MPSs) offer the opportunity to approximate the lymphoid environment, but so far have focused primarily on memory recall responses to antigens previously encountered by donor cells. To date, no 3D culture system has replicated the engagement between T cells and B cells (T--B interaction) that leads to antibody production when starting with naive cells. Here, we developed a LN-MPS to model early T--B interactions at the extrafollicular border built from primary, naive human lymphocytes encapsulated within a collagen-based 3D matrix. Within the MPS, naive T cells exhibited CCL21-dependent chemotaxis and chemokinesis as predicted. Naive T and B cells were successfully skewed on chip to an early T follicular helper (pre-Tfh) and activated state, respectively, and co-culture of the latter cells led to CD38+ plasmablast cells and T cell dependent production of IgM. These responses required differentiation of the T cells into pre-Tfhs, physical cell-cell contact, and were sensitive to the ratio at which pre-Tfh and activated B cells were seeded on-chip. Dependence on T cell engagement was greatest at a 1:5 T:B ratio, while cell proliferation and CD38+ signal was greatest at a 1:1 T:B ratio. Furthermore, plasmablast formation was established starting from naive T and B cells on-chip. We envision that this MPS model of primary lymphocyte physiology will enable new mechanistic analyses of human humoral immunity in vitro.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

ObjectiveTo examine long-term associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiovascular and kidney disease (CVD, KD) in the general population, with emphasis on age and vaccination status at the time of infection, mild infection, and SARS-CoV-2 variant.

DesignRegister-based cohort study.

SettingDenmark

ParticipantsAll Danish residents with [&ge;]1 PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, March 2020-December 2022.

ExposurePositive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Main OutcomesHazard ratios for 15 CVD outcomes and six KD outcomes, comparing persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and persons who only ever tested negative for infection.

ResultsThe cohort for CVD analyses included 4,508,489 persons without pre-existing CVD (median follow-up 25.2 months/person, interquartile range [IQR] 21.7-27.5 months); 2,698,261 persons (59.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period. The cohort for the KD analyses included 5,150,480 persons without pre-existing KD (median follow-up 25.1 months, IQR 21.7-27.4 months), 2,983,233 (57.9%) of whom tested positive for infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with slight increases in the risks of pulmonary embolism, venous embolism/thrombosis, arrhythmias, chronic renal failure, unspecified renal failure, and other/unspecified KD up to a year after infection; infection was not associated with the other disease groups tested. The strongest associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and CVD and KD were observed among unvaccinated persons and persons infected with earlier (pre-omicron) variants.

Conclusions and RelevanceWe found little evidence that infection with SARS-CoV-2 was associated with increased long-term risks of CVD or KD in the general population. Increased CVD risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared limited to three outcomes (pulmonary embolism, venous embolism/thrombosis, arrhythmias) and the potential increases in risk were small. Our KD results also suggested that any persistent risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were minimal; however, these findings need to be confirmed in other populations. Most importantly, in a largely vaccinated population, long-term CVD and KD risks differed little for omicron-infected and uninfected persons.

KEY POINTS

QuestionDoes SARS-CoV-2 infection increase the long-term risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or kidney disease (KD) in a general population cohort with predominantly mild infection?

FindingsIn a cohort study of >4.5 million persons that compared SARS-CoV-2 test-positive and test-negative persons, relative risks were slightly increased for 6 of 21 CVD and KD outcomes up to 1 year after infection. Among vaccinated individuals and omicron-infected persons, existing associations diminished dramatically.

MeaningIn the general population, long-term increases in CKD and KD risks associated with infection were small, limited to a few outcomes, and attenuated with vaccination and the omicron variant.","NA","medrxiv",1737237978994

Previous studies using RIF-RNAi and overexpression lines in Fragaria x ananassa and CRISPR knock-out lines in F. vesca have established the role of RIF in controlling ABA biosynthesis and signaling, cell wall remodeling, and secondary metabolism.

In this study, we deciphered FaRIFs transcriptional regulatory network by combining ChIP-seq-based identification of its direct targets with an analysis of FaRIF-RNAi transcriptome data. These analyses revealed FaRIFs direct role in multiple aspects of strawberry fruit ripening, including the regulation of ripening-related transcription factors, phytohormone content and signaling, primary and secondary metabolism, and cell wall degradation. Additionally, using the TurboID-based proximity labeling approach, we have identified FaRIF interactors, including proteins involved in mRNA and protein homeostasis, as well as several NAC transcription factors. Among these, FaNAC034 was found to synergistically enhance FaRIFs transcriptional activity.

This integrative analysis, combining transcriptome analysis, in vivo ChIP-seq, and proximity labeling, broadens our knowledge of FaRIF-mediated transcriptional networks and interaction partners, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying strawberry fruit ripening regulation by this transcription factor.","NA","biorxiv",1737237978994

While, licensed vaccines for protection of avian or mammalian species are not yet available, a few candidate vaccines are being trialled. Here, we report on the experimental vaccination of chickens and captive wild birds using a propagation-defective vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), in which the essential envelope glycoprotein (G) protein gene was replaced by a modified hemagglutinin gene derived from a clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 isolated in 2022 in the animal park of Bern, Switzerland. VSV{Delta}G(H5mb) was produced on helper cells providing the VSV G protein in trans. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens that were immunized twice via the intramuscular route with adjuvant-free VSV{Delta}G(H5mb) replicon particles induced high levels of virus-neutralizing serum antibodies and were fully protected against lethal infection by H5N1 HPAIV (clade 2.3.4.4b). Notably, immunized animals did not shed challenge virus from the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that herd immunity can be achieved. The same vaccine was used to immunize a total of 317 captive wild birds at Bern Animal Park and Zoo Basel, representing 24 different species. No vaccine-associated side effects were observed. Birds without previous contact to H5Nx viruses produced high to very high H5-specific neutralizing antibody titers following the second immunization, while birds showing H5-specific antibodies prior to vaccination, already developed high neutralising antibody titers after a single immunization. One year after vaccination, most animals still showed significant neutralizing antibody titers, indicating that VSV{Delta}G(H5mb) is able to induce a long-lasting protective immune response.

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1737237978994

Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1737237978994
