A central process is the breaking of symmetry to form spatial patterns from initially uniform conditions. Among the various mechanisms proposed, directed cell migration - driven by chemotaxis, durotaxis, differential adhesion or other processes - offers a compelling strategy to organize tissues rapidly and robustly. Here, we unify these concepts into a general mathematical framework and show that it can produce diverse spatial patterns across one-, two-, and three-dimensional domains. Using numerical simulations and stability theory, we characterize the emergence, geometry, and formation speed of these patterns. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of morphogenesis beyond the traditional chemical or mechanical patterning paradigms and offer a quantitative foundation to guide pattern formation in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424552

Yet, how sap feeders affect floral attractiveness to pollinators remains poorly understood, despite the critical role of this tripartite interaction in natural and agricultural ecosystems. These intricate interactions may be further enriched by pronounced sexual dimorphisms in dioecious species. In this study, we examined how infestation by the oligophagous aphid Brachycaudus lychnidis affects sex-specific interactions among the dioecious plant Silene latifolia and its specialist moth pollinator Hadena bicruris. We exposed male and female plants to aphid herbivory and evaluated its effects on floral traits (visual cues, floral scent, and nectar chemistry) and pollinator behaviour. Contrary to sexual selection theory, female plants were not less attractive than males under control conditions. Instead, our results suggest that females exhibit plasticity in floral trait expression depending on pollination success. Moreover, both sexes produced a diverse array of potentially bioactive nectar metabolites, with females showing higher abundances of many compounds that may influence female pollinator behaviour. Aphid infestation altered floral traits differently between sexes, with stronger declines in female floral attractiveness, suggesting sex-specific defence strategies and possible involvement of indirect defences in stabilizing this specialized plant-pollinator-herbivore system.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424552

Considering the recent history of Coronavirus zoonotic events, causing serious human health problems, the generation of vaccines with a broad scope of protection and the potential to cut / reduce the transmission remains in the spotlight. The current global pandemic preparedness initiatives have promoted also the preclinical evaluation of a new group of Coronavirus vaccines. In the present work a nasal vaccine candidate based on two highly conserved Sarbecovirus proteins, S2 and nucleocapsid (N), is evaluated in two different mice strains. The vaccine preparation, containing a CpG ODN as adjuvant, was able to generate high antibody titers against both antigens, in sera and bronchoalveolar lavages. This antibody response results cross-reactive to S2 from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and to N from SARS-CoV-1. However, a very low neutralizing capacity was found in the sera of the immunized mice when a pseudoviral system assay was used. On the other hand, the vaccine preparation induces, at systemic compartment, IFN {gamma} secretion, and a marked IgG2a response, specific against both proteins; a profile consistent with the development of a Th1 pattern. Although further evaluations should be done, including protection assays, the demonstrated cross-reactivity level and mucosal response constitutes promising features of this vaccine candidate.","[{""name"":""MOST “National key R&amp;D program of China&#34;"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2021YFE0192200;""},{""name"":""“Hunan Provincial Base for Scientific and Technological Innovation Cooperation&#34;"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2019CB1012;""},{""name"":""“The Science and Technology Innovation Program of Hunan Province&#34;"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2020RC5035;""},{""name"":""“Hunan Provincial Innovative Construction Program&#34;"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2020WK2031;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424552

While the disease is currently under control, the emergence of new coronavirus variants with pandemic potential underscores the need for more universal coronavirus vaccines. This study evaluates the immunogenicity in non-human primates of two broad-spectrum nasal vaccine candidates called PanCoV. The vaccine preparations are based on highly conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2, specifically the nucleocapsid (N) and the S2 subunit from Spike protein, which include several relevant T-cell epitopes and have the potential to form virus-like particles. PanCoV1 candidate contains the N protein, while the PanCoV2 comprises a chimeric protein containing the C-terminal domain of N protein fused to a fragment of S2 subunit. Both vaccine candidates also include the receptor-binding domain (RBD) from Spike protein and the ODN-39M as CpG adjuvant. The results demonstrate that both nasal vaccine candidates can boost the anti-RBD immune response and induce anti-N immunity, this systemic response shows cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and H-CoV antigens. In addition, a neutralizing response against SARS-CoV-2 that persisted for almost three months after the last dose was induced. A mucosal-specific and cross-reactive IgA response was also observed, mainly in monkeys vaccinated with PanCoV2. Furthermore, the specific IFN{gamma}-secreting response observed in the vaccinated groups peripheral blood mononuclear cells highlights the ability of these candidates to stimulate cellular immunity with a Th1 bias. PanCoV vaccines emerge as promising candidates for use as a booster alternative, with the potential to amplify and broaden the scope of the immune response against coronaviruses.","[{""name"":""This work was supported by MOST “National key R&D program of China (2021YFE0192200)”, “PNCT CITMA, Cuba”, “Hunan Provincial Base for Scientific and Technological Innovation Cooperation (2019CB1012)”, "",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424552

SARS-CoV-2 (a Sarbecovirus and member of the Betacoronavirus genus responsible for the pandemic) virus was first detected in Wuhan, China in late 2019. Effective mRNA vaccines based on the viral Spike protein were designed from the earliest isolates and available by December of 2020. SARS-CoV-2 has continued to evolve in the human population, accruing neutralizing antibody resistance mutations that have necessitated updating the vaccine periodically to better match contemporary variants. Neutralizing antibody cross-reactivity is generally very limited among the diverse members of the betacoronavirus genus that are of clinical importance in people. Here, we present an alternative vaccine strategy based on eliciting T-cell responses targeting four highly conserved regions shared across the betacoronavirus proteomes. We hypothesized that cross-reactive responses to these regions could temper disease severity. Focusing immune responses on highly conserved epitopes could be beneficial as SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, or if a novel betacoronavirus should enter the human population. Vaccination with these highly conserved regions induced robust T-cell responses in mice and rhesus macaques. Vaccinated hamsters were significantly protected against weight loss and lung inflammation after challenge with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. After a SARS-CoV-2 Delta challenge in rhesus macaques, 3 out of 4 animals in the control group had infectious virus in their bronchoalveolar lavage samples, while the 4 animals in the vaccinated group did not.","[{""name"":""Bisciotti Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Lya and Harrison Latta Fund for the Advancement of Pathology"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""COVID-19 Preclinical Discovery Awards"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424552

While resistance to chemicals that target neuronal ion channels is well-appreciated3,4, dissecting toxin resistance mechanisms is hampered by its complex genetic basis. Here, we investigated how Drosophila sechellia has evolved resistance to octanoic acid (OA), a historically-important paradigm of adaptation to a natural toxin5,6. OA is an abundant component of Morinda citrifolia noni fruit - the exclusive niche of D. sechellia - and is toxic to many other insects, including its close relatives Drosophila simulans and Drosophila melanogaster5,6. We experimentally evolved D. simulans populations with increased OA resistance, identifying hundreds of loci displaying signatures of selection. Cross-referencing of these loci with the results of a genome-wide, CRISPR knockout screen for OA tolerance genes in D. melanogaster S2R+ cells highlighted two proteins of interest: Kraken, a putative detoxification enzyme of the serine hydrolase family expressed most strongly in the digestive and renal systems7,8, and Alkbh7, a ubiquitously-expressed, mitochondrial-localised protein, whose mammalian orthologue functions in fatty acid metabolism9,10. In D. sechellia, kraken and Alkbh7 display both signs of selection and elevated expression, mirrored by their higher transcription in artificially-evolved, OA-resistant D. simulans. In D. melanogaster, loss-of-function of kraken, but not Alkbh7, led to increased susceptibility to OA; conversely, overexpression of Alkbh7, but not kraken, increased OA resistance. Importantly, mutation of these genes in D. sechellia demonstrated a contribution of these proteins to the natural resistance of this species, identifying the first specific loci underlying this multigenic trait. Our results suggest an adaptive role of these genes in shaping OA resistance both under laboratory selection and during D. sechellias evolutionary history. More generally, this work emphasises the experimental power of drosophilids to dissect multilayered molecular mechanisms of toxin resistance, with applications in the development of novel insecticides.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

In parallel, we made diphtheria toxin-mediated cell type ablation compatible with human cells, thereby enabling in-depth interrogation of the sequence of events during depletion and reappearance of stem cells. Following LGR5+ stem cell depletion, most of the remaining epithelial cells entered a regenerative state characterized by fetal-like expression programs. Strikingly, this regenerative response was already initiated before stem cell loss, indicative of active communication between functional stem cells and progeny during homeostasis. We identified inactivation of retinoid X receptor (RXR) as a crucial trigger to initiate the regenerative response in colonocytes, with human colon stem cells being the producer of the RXR stimulus retinoic acid. Thus, stem cell-derived retinoic acid actively suppresses the regenerative state in colonocytes, explaining how surviving cells sense stem cell loss.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""803608;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour l’Education et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

Molecular dynamics simulations identified a hinge-driven motion in AK2 upon AIFM1 binding, which was accurately reflected in distograms from AF2.3 and AF3, though not in their predicted structures.

We in total identified at least 5,518 independent HTTs, mostly involving Tc1/Mariner DNA transposons. While the majority of HTTs occur between closely related taxa, irrespective of their lifestyles, HTTs were particularly common in Mucoromycotina, Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes, and Leotiomycetes. Importantly, species lacking fungal-specific defense mechanisms against transposons and those with gene-sparse and repeat-rich genomic compartments are involved in significantly higher number of HTTs, unveiling ecological and genomic factors shaping HTTs.

It has been shown that plant U-box ubiquitin E3 ligases, PUB30 and PUB31, act as key attenuators of the ERECTA signaling pathway. However, the molecular link between ubiquitination and function of ERECTA remains unclear.

We further identify the specific ubiquitination sites within the juxtamembrane and kinase domains of ERECTA. Importantly, the site-directed mutagenesis of these K63-linked ubiquitination sites overly inhibited stomatal development, indicating that the ubiquitination-deficient ERECTA is hyperactive. The ubiquitination-deficient ERECTA stably accumulates at the plasma membrane and fails to internalize upon EPF2 application.

In particular, the extent to which broad host range is enabled by genetic variation versus transcriptional plasticity is unclear. To investigate how variation and plasticity contribute to generalism, we studied the generalist necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea that infects more than 1,500 plant species. Using a cross-infection matrix of 72 B. cinerea isolates infected on 57 plant genotypes distributed across 15 eudicot species, we identified general and host-dependent fungal components of lesion formation. Transcriptome profiling at 48 hours post-inoculation revealed two distinct pathogen gene modules: (1) a set of general lesion-associated genes enriched in primary metabolism, showing similar expression across hosts but varied among isolates; and (2) a set of high-entropy, host specific-inducible genes, organized into distinct co-regulated modules that respond dynamically to specific host cues. Both gene sets were genomically dispersed, lacking structural clustering, and were under different levels of selective constraints. Our results demonstrate that B. cinerea employs a modular transcriptional strategy that integrates a core metabolic program along with a plastic, host-responsive regulatory network to achieve broad host colonization. This study presents the most comprehensive cross-species co-transcriptomic dataset to date for any fungal phytopathogen, highlighting transcriptional plasticity as a key mechanism underlying generalism in plant-fungal interactions. Moreover, the identification of conserved fungal gene targets across diverse hosts offers a foundation for developing broad-spectrum resistance strategies in multiple crops.","[{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IOS2020754;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

It is thus critical to better understand their immune system and mechanisms of antiviral immunity. Despite an increasing number of studies, much is still unknown about the molecular mechanisms that govern bat-virus interactions, especially given the large diversity of bat species. Dicer is a conserved ribonuclease with multiple activities that can modulate antiviral immunity, including the detection of viral RNA as part of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, the maturation of micro RNAs, and the direct inhibition of innate immunity in mouse and human cells. In view of these complex activities of Dicer, we tested its antiviral activity in Myotis myotis nasal epithelial cells. Surprisingly, we did not see strong evidence of RNAi in these cells, but instead saw a proviral effect of Dicer for two alphaviruses, Sindbis and Semliki forest virus. We also observed a striking relocalization of Dicer to cytoplasmic foci upon infection with these viruses, which did not occur in the several human cell lines we tested. These foci contained dsRNA and viral plus strand RNA, suggesting that they are sites of viral replication. Finally, we found that factors specific to M. myotis cells are needed for Dicer relocalization. Overall, we propose that Dicer can play different roles in different bat species and/or cell types, and is being repurposed by alphaviruses to promote viral replication.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-10-IDEX-0002;ANR-20-SFRI-0012;IMCBio ANR-17-EURE-0023;ANR-21-CE35-0018-01;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SPF202209015746;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

Understanding spatial factors may have implications for urban rewilding, as its success will depend on local tolerance of wildlife and may potentially increase human-wildlife interactions, such as bin-raiding and public wildlife feeding. We examined how urbanisation, geographic region, and public wildlife feeding influence reported bin-raiding, public attitudes, and the use of control measures towards the worlds most urbanised terrestrial carnivore, the red fox, Vulpes vulpes. Online survey data were obtained from 1,275 participants in the United Kingdom. Fox bin-raiding was associated with increased levels of public wildlife feeding, more negative attitudes towards foxes, and greater use of professional and do-it-yourself pest control measures. However, the role of urbanisation and geographic differences varied among these relationships. Specifically, urbanisation and geographic region significantly predicted reports of fox bin-raiding, with urban residents - particularly those living in London - more likely to report such behaviour. Urbanisation influenced peoples use of professional pest control of foxes within their area, and geographic region influenced the use of do-it-yourself control measures. Neither urbanisation nor geographic region significantly predicted public attitudes towards foxes. Together, these findings highlight the complex interactions between spatial context, human attitudes and behaviour, and animal ecology, underscoring the importance of nuanced, context-specific strategies to support human-wildlife coexistence and urban rewilding initiatives.

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

These interactions can support the persistence of resistant cells even in the absence of treatment, undermining standard aggressive therapies and motivating drug holiday-based approaches that leverage ecological dynamics. A key challenge in implementing such strategies is efficiently identifying interaction between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subpopulations. Evolutionary game theory provides a framework for characterizing these interactions. We investigate whether spatial patterns in single time-point images of cell populations can reveal the underlying game theoretic interactions between sensitive and resistant cells. To achieve this goal, we develop an agent-based model in which cell reproduction is governed by local game-theoretic interactions. We compute a suite of spatial statistics on single time-point images from the agent-based model under a range of games being played between cells. We quantify the informativeness of each spatial statistic and demonstrate that a simple machine learning model can classify the type of game being played. Our findings suggest that spatial structure contains sufficient information to infer ecological interactions. This work represents a step toward clinically viable tools for identifying cell-cell interactions in tumors, supporting the development of ecologically informed cancer therapies.

Author summaryDrug resistance is a major challenge in cancer treatment, often leading to relapse despite initially successful therapy. While mutations are a key driver, ecological interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells also play a critical role. These interactions are complex and dynamic, and few molecular biomarkers exist, making them difficult to study and account for in treatment planning. We use evolutionary game theory, a framework for quantifying interactions between cells, to investigate whether it is possible to infer these interactions using just a single time-point image of the cells. We develop an agent-based model where cells reproduce based on local interactions and quantify the resulting patterns in how cells are distributed across space using a suite of spatial statistics. We find that specific interaction types produce distinct spatial patterns that are evident in these metrics, and we train a simple machine learning model to classify the interaction type based on the metrics. Our results suggest that spatial data alone can offer valuable insights into tumor dynamics, potentially enabling more informed and adaptable cancer treatments based on eco-evolutionary principles.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U01CA280829;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.

Most current methods fall at one of two extremes: either opaque deep learning models that obscure biological meaning, or simplified frameworks that treat genes as isolated units. As such, these approaches overlook a crucial insight: gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cellular states can be harnessed to model perturbation responses. Here we present CIPHER (Covariance Inference for Perturbation and High-dimensional Expression Response), a conceptual framework leveraging linear response theory from statistical physics to predict transcriptome-wide perturbation outcomes using gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cells. We validated CIPHER on synthetic regulatory networks before applying it to 11 large-scale single-cell perturbation datasets covering 4,234 perturbations and over 1.36M cells. CIPHER robustly recapitulated genome-wide responses to single and double perturbations by exploiting baseline gene covariance structure. Importantly, eliminating gene-gene covariances, while retaining gene-intrinsic variances, reduced model performance by 11-fold, demonstrating the rich information stored within baseline fluctuation structures. Moreover, gene-gene correlations transferred successfully across independent experiments of the same cell type, revealing stereotypic fluctuation structures. Furthermore, CIPHER outperformed conventional differential expression metrics in identifying true perturbations while providing uncertainty-aware effect size estimates through Bayesian inference. Finally, most genome-wide responses propagated through the covariance matrix along approximately three independent and global gene modules. CIPHER underscores the importance of theoretically-grounded models in capturing complex biological responses, highlighting fundamental design principles encoded in cellular fluctuation patterns.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DMS-2235451;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MPTMPS-00005320;""},{""name"":""NUCATS T32, Northwestern University"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ryan Fellowship, Northwestern University"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""CSB postdoc fellowship, Northwestern University"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""IVADO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Canada First Research Excellence Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM147400;""},{""name"":""Pew-Stewart Scholars Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Awards at the Scientific Interface"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

In this study, we fit a family of two-population models to in-vitro data from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), tracking drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells under varying environmental conditions. The dataset, originally presented by Kaznatcheev et al., includes conditions with and without the drug Alectinib and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We compare combinations of growth models (logistic, Gompertz, von Bertalanffy) and drug efficacy terms (Norton-Simon, linear, ratio-dependent) to identify which best explains the observed dynamics. Our models incorporate density dependence, frequency-dependent competition, and drug response, enabling mechanistic interpretation of tumor cell interactions. The logistic model with ratio-dependent drug efficacy best fits monoculture data. Using growth parameters from monocultures, we infer inter-type competition coefficients in co-cultures. We find that growth rate and carrying capacity are stable across CAF conditions, while competition and drug efficacy parameters shift, altering interaction dynamics. Notably, CAFs promote coexistence between resistant and sensitive cells, whereas Alectinib induces competitive exclusion. Our results underscore the need to evaluate both model fit and biological plausibility to guide therapeutic modeling of cancer.

Author summaryHow cancer cells grow, compete, and respond to treatment depends not only on the drug, but also on their ecological context, including interactions with other cells and components of the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we explore how different mathematical models capture the behavior of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells under various conditions. We focus on two cell populations: one sensitive to treatment, and one resistant. Using in-vitro data, we compare growth models and drug response types to identify which model best explains the observed population dynamics. We also investigate how different factors, such as the drug Alectinib and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), change the way cancer cells interact. Our game-theoretic approach allows us to quantify how these external conditions affect competition between cell types, revealing when resistant and sensitive cells can coexist. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of tumor ecology and may support the development of adaptive cancer therapies that anticipate evolutionary responses to treatment.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B “Meiosis”;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

This serendipitous deployment yielded the first visual documentation of a multi-trophic predator and scavenger guild interacting at a filovirus reservoir site. Over a five month period (February 16th - June 5th 2025) across 304 trap nights, we recorded at least 14 different vertebrate species, including leopards, primates, raptors, and small carnivores, engaging in bat predation, scavenging on bat remains, guano foraging, or cave exploration across 261 temporally and spatially independent events (>1 hour apart). These instances were structured, repeated and the species continuously made contact with the bats or entered their roosting space. Camera traps also recorded an estimated 400 human individuals visiting the cave -- including school groups, tourists, and local trainees -- the majority with no personal protective equipment. The shallow, accessible structure of Python Cave appears to collapse the typical spatial buffers between reservoir species and both predators and humans.

The mechanism by which ectopic gene activation occurs through these gain-of-function enhancer mutations remains poorly understood. Using the ZRS, a benchmark disease-associated enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), as a model, we demonstrate that poised (i.e., accessible but inactive) chromatin sensitizes Shh to aberrant activation in anterior limb bud, leading to polydactyly. In the anterior limb cells of wild-type mice, Shh is inactive, but the ZRS is accessible and marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. We demonstrate that this poising signature explains how over 20 independent rare variants within the ZRS cause Shh misexpression in the same anterior limb bud cell population, resulting in similar limb malformations, despite affecting binding sites for different activators and repressors. Disabling pioneer transcription factor binding to the ZRS suppresses its poised state in anterior cells, prevents aberrant activation of the ZRS by rare variants, and fully rescues limb malformations in variant knock-in mice. A thorough examination of other disease-associated enhancers with pathogenic gain-of-function variants revealed that they are all poised in tissues with ectopic activity. We use this poising signature to predict and validate in vivo ectopic forebrain activity of previously uncharacterized autism-associated non-coding variants. Our findings suggest that spatial enhancer poising, likely a byproduct of development, creates a susceptibility to non-coding mutations and offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the burden of disease-associated non-coding variants.","[{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD115268;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2. These structural predictions were based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database, together with corresponding protein sequences obtained from UniProt. We then assessed the predicted interaction structures through various confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we performed a limited evaluation against experimentally determined human protein complex structures not included in the Boltz-2 training regimen, which indicated prediction accuracy consistent with AlphaFold3. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, while highlighting both strengths and limitations. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","[{""name"":""Levy-Longenbaugh Donor-Advised Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DBI-2321666;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bj3aw27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0019749;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM157729;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

Further analyses revealed that male-specific regulatory regions evolved faster than female-specific ones in both supporting and pre-meiotic germ cells. However, female meiotic germ cells show even higher rates of molecular evolution and exhibit a permissive chromatin state that facilitates the birth of new genes, thus resembling their adult spermatogenic counterparts. Finally, we traced both conserved and species-specific gene expression trajectories across the three mammals, uncovering candidate genes for disorders of sex development that are typically central to cell-type-specific regulatory networks.

Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone. Because differentially prioritized variants are driven by Borzoi predictions, we leverage attribution techniques to characterize sequence features underlying fine mapping and generate mechanistic hypotheses for GWAS associations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription. Together, these findings redefine H3K4me3 as a post-transcriptional histone mark, revealing an unexpected layer of epigenetic regulation with broad implications for gene expression control.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

To study the neural bases of gravity sensing, we imaged by volume electron microscopy (vEM) the aboral organ of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi. We reconstructed 972 cells, including syncytial neurons that form a nerve net. The syncytial neurons synapse on the balancer cells and also form reciprocal connection with the bridge cells that span the statocyst. High-speed imaging revealed that balancer cilia beat and arrest in a coordinated manner but with differences between the sagittal and tentacular planes of the animal, reflecting nerve-net organisation. Our results suggest a coordinating rather than sensory-motor function for the nerve net and inform our understanding of the diversity of nervous-system organisation across animals.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101020792;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

With the increasing accuracy and accessibility of de novo protein design, faster and cheaper experimental screening methods would democratize and accelerate the identification of high-affinity binders. Here we present Cell-Free Two-Hybrid (CF2H), a rapid and sensitive method for detecting high-affinity protein-protein interactions (PPI) that does not require cloning, protein purification nor high-end laboratory equipment. CF2H uses a dimerization-activated DNA binding domain (DBD) fused to prey and bait proteins to trigger transcription upon protein-protein interaction. We demonstrate that CF2H enables the detection of interactions between various types of target and binder proteins such as single-domain antibodies, DARPins and de novo designed binders. We benchmark CF2H as a screening platform by validating previously reported binders for Mdm2 and discover high-affinity binders targeting the checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1 in less than 24 hours. Finally, we show that CF2H can be used to characterize small-molecules modulators of PPI and detect protein biomarkers, opening the door for a new class of cell-free biosensors.","[{""name"":""Inserm"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02vjkv261"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""965018;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

In unicellular bacteria, the ParMRC DNA partitioning apparatus is well known for forming actin-like filaments that push low copy number plasmids to opposite cell poles. In multicellular cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the presence of a chromosomally encoded ParMR system suggests it may play an analogous role in chromosome segregation. However, we show here that it instead constitutes a novel cytoskeletal system - termed CorMR - whose loss does not impair DNA segregation but leads to severe morphological defects, revealing a role in maintaining cell shape. Using live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that CorM forms dynamically instable filaments. These filaments are recruited to the membrane by CorR, which has acquired a conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that CorM forms antiparallel double-stranded filaments, in contrast to the polar, parallel filament pair seen in ParM. Furthermore, CorMR filaments are excluded from the cell poles and division plane by MinC, via a long N-terminal extension also specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Comparative genomics suggests that cyanobacterial multicellularity co-evolved with the chromosomal relocation of ParMR genes, acquisition of the amphipathic helix in CorR, and functional extension of MinC, supporting an evolutionary link among these features. Our findings uncover a striking repurposing of ancestral biochemical systems, expanding the known roles of ParMR and Min systems beyond plasmid segregation and division site selection to include regulation of cell shape.

ImportanceThe ParMRC system is a well-characterized machinery for the segregation of low-copy-number plasmids to the cell poles and, until now, was primarily described to be encoded on plasmids. We found that during the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, a chromosome-encoded ParMR system has undergone extensive evolutionary and functional repurposing, resulting in a previously undescribed bacterial cytoskeletal system that controls cell shape. We also found that this new cytoskeleton, called CorMR, is under the control of the MinCDE system, which has evolved to not only antagonize Z-ring formation, but also to regulate CorM polymerization. Such interplay between different cytoskeletal systems highlights an intricate regulatory mechanism linking cell division and morphology. As this repurposing of existing cytoskeletal system coincided with the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, it may have played a key role for the evolution of cyanobacteria with distinct cell shapes. Overall, our discovery highlights the plasticity of bacterial polymeric systems and gives insight into the evolution of cellular and multicellular complexity.","[{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Grant Agreement No.101034413;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ActinID, 101076260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

How these cancer-specific methylation changes are established in the decades before cancer, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we use a unique collection of longitudinal blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia to sensitively track the dynamics of DNA methylation changes at high temporal resolution. We identify thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that exhibit altered patterns of methylation up to 10 years before acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) diagnosis. Most of these DMRs are strongly associated with expanding clones carrying somatic driver mutations. We identify a subset of  epigenetic driver DMRs characterised by recurrent CpG alterations that are highly shared across pre-AML cases. These are likely to reflect early epigenetic reprogramming associated with AML development. We also reveal large numbers of stochastic  passenger CpGs whose differential methylation results from hitch-hiking with clonal expansions driven by somatically acquired genetic events. These passenger CpGs can be exploited for lineage tracing to discover clonal expansions driven by missing driver mutations. Our findings show widespread changes in methylation patterns during the early stages of cancer development which could be utilised for risk prediction and therapeutic intervention.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

Accurate perturbation response models could drastically accelerate drug discovery by reducing the space of interventions that need to be tested in the wet lab. However, recent studies have shown that FM-based models often struggle to outperform simpler baselines for perturbation response prediction. A key obstacle is the lack of understanding of the components driving performance in FM-based perturbation response models. In this work, we conduct the first systematic pan-modal study of perturbation embeddings, with an emphasis on those derived from biological FMs. We benchmark their predictive accuracy, analyze patterns in their predictions, and identify the most successful representation learning strategies. Our findings offer insights into what FMs are learning and provide practical guidance for improving perturbation response modeling.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

Viruses can inhibit nucleotide immune signaling by producing proteins that sequester or cleave the immune signals. Here we analyzed evolutionarily unrelated signal-sequestering viral proteins, finding that they share structural and biophysical traits in their genetic organization, ternary structures and binding pocket properties. Based on these traits we developed a structure-guided computational pipeline that can sift through large phage genome databases to unbiasedly predict phage proteins that manipulate bacterial immune signaling. Numerous previously uncharacterized proteins, grouped into three families, were verified to inhibit the bacterial Thoeris and CBASS signaling systems. Proteins of the Sequestin and Lockin families bind and sequester the TIR-produced signaling molecules 3'cADPR and His-ADPR, while proteins of the Acb5 family cleave and inactivate 3'3'-cGAMP and related molecules. X-ray crystallography and structural modeling, combined with mutational analyses, explain the structural basis for sequestration or cleavage of the immune signals. Thousands of these signal-manipulating proteins were detected in phage protein databases, with some instances present in well-studied model phages such as T2, T4 and T6. Our study explains how phages commonly evade bacterial immune signaling, and offers a structure-guided analytical approach for discovery of viral immune-manipulating proteins in any database of choice.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753913424553

In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the initiation of actin assembly has remained a mystery. Here we show that S. cerevisiae Ldb17, the homolog of Dip1, functions as an on-switch for endocytic actin assembly. Unexpectedly, the regulation of Ldb17 is more complicated than that of constitutively active Dip1. Ldb17 is controlled by a coat protein, Sla1, via separate recruitment and activation steps. This regulation was likely lost in the S. pombe lineage and this simplification may be related to other changes in actin assembly between these species.

Despite uniform ETI perception, we find striking divergence between transcriptional outputs: a core set of defense genes is broadly induced, while distinct cell types activate specialized immune modules. We infer that downstream immune execution is shaped not only by immune receptor activation, but also by cell identity and its associated transcriptional regulatory context, including local transcription factor availability and chromatin accessibility. We further demonstrate that transcriptional regulators preferentially induced in epidermal cells are required to restrict invasion by non-adapted pathogens. Their absence permits pathogen entry into deeper tissues despite intact recognition, revealing a spatial division of immune functions.
