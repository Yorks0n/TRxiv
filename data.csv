In this study, we used SARS-CoV-2 as a model system to explore whether the intrahost diversity of viral infections could provide clues on the relative fitness of single amino acid variants (SAVs). To do so, we analysed ~15 million complete genomes and nearly ~8000 sequencing libraries generated from SARS-CoV-2 infections, which were collected at various timepoints during the COVID-19 pandemic. Across timepoints, we found that many successful SAVs were detected in the intrahost diversity of samples collected prior, with a median of 6-40 months between the initial collection dates of samples and the highest frequency seen for these SAVs. Additionally, we found that the co-occurrence of intrahost SAVs significantly captures genetic linkage patterns observed at the interhost level (Pearson's r=0.28-0.45, all p<0.0001). Further, we show that machine learning models can learn highly generalisable intrahost, physiochemical and phenotypic patterns to forecast the future fitness of intrahost SAVs (r2=0.48-0.63). Most of these models performed significantly better when considering genetic linkage (r2=0.53-0.68). Overall, our results document the evolutionary forces shaping the fitness of mutations, which may offer potential to forecast the emergence of future variants and ultimately inform the design of vaccine targets.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

ObjectiveAssess the duration and severity of autonomic dysfunction in adults with Long COVID and evaluate its impact on function and quality of life.

DesignA follow-up survey of a subset of participants from a cross-sectional online survey of adults with Long COVID. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction.

Participants526 adults (ages 20-65) with a history of Long COVID

Main measuresThe Composite Autonomic Symptom 31 (COMPASS-31) score, the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, the prevalence of new postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and predictors of autonomic dysfunction, including POTS

Key results71.9% of Long COVID patients had a COMPASS-31 score >20, suggestive of moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction. The median symptom duration was 36 [30-40] months, reaching up to 3.5 years after SARS-CoV-2 infection. 37.5% of Long COVID patients could no longer work or had to drop out of school due to their Long COVID illness. 40.5% were newly diagnosed with POTS following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ConclusionsEvidence of persistent moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction was seen in 71.9% of Long COVID patients in our study, with a 36-month median symptom duration, suggesting that enduring autonomic dysfunction is highly prevalent in the Long COVID population. Moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction was significantly correlated with impaired function and capacity, highlighting the need to address POTS and other manifestations of autonomic dysfunction as a key component of Long COVID management.","NA","medrxiv",1729462126293

However, the temporal dynamics of these networks remain poorly understood. Here, we present Zebrahub-Multiome, a comprehensive, time-resolved atlas of zebrafish embryogenesis, integrating single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) and gene expression (scRNA-seq) from over 94,000 cells sampled across six key developmental stages (10 to 24 hours post-fertilization). Our analysis reveals early-stage GRNs shared across multiple lineages, followed by the emergence of lineage-specific regulatory programs during later stages. We also observe a shift in transcription factor (TF) influence from broad, multi-lineage roles in early development to more specialized, cell-type-specific functions as development progresses. Using in silico genetic perturbations, we highlight the dynamic role of TFs in driving cell fate decisions, emphasizing the gradual specialization of regulatory circuits. All data and analyses are made accessible through an interactive web portal, enabling users to explore zebrafish gene regulatory dynamics across time and cell types. This resource provides a foundation for hypothesis generation and deeper insights into vertebrate development.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

CRISPRi screens in iPSC-derived neurons and glia have already been successful in relating gene function to neurological related phenotypes; however, loss of dCas9-KRAB expression after differentiation has been observed by many labs and has limited applicability for post-differentiation gene perturbations. This loss of expression is largely ascribed to transgene silencing after differentiation. Here, we investigated the expression levels of different CRISPR enzymes in iPSC and Ngn2-derived neurons using piggybac delivery. We found that the commonly used dCas9-KRAB (using the KOX1 domain) displayed dramatic reduction in protein expression levels following neuronal differentiation, yet surprisingly, nCas9 constructs retained comparable protein expression between iPSCs and neurons. We further found that CRISPR constructs, primarily relying on the SV40 Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), fail to efficiently localize to the nuclei of neurons, despite having robust nuclear levels in iPSCs, leading to KRAB-specific cytoplasmic degradation. By adding a neuronal-specific NLS, we were able to correct neuronal nuclear localization and protein expression, confirming the contribution of mislocalization to the instability of dCas9-KRAB in neurons. As the lack of nuclear localization can have a profound impact on editing and gene perturbation efficiency, we suggest further investigation across both cultured and in-vivo postmitotic cell models.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Additionally, there is growing interest in animal social traditions, which appear crucial for social interaction and group cohesion. We have previously documented such a tradition, in which chimpanzees copied inserting blades of grass in their ears from one persistent inventor4. Now, over a decade later, we have observed an unrelated group of chimpanzees where 5/8 individuals began wearing grass in their ears and 6/8 from their rectums. As of 2024, one newly introduced chimpanzee has adopted the grass-in-ear behavior. Given that the behaviors were not observed in seven other groups in the same sanctuary (N=148), we conclude that social learning of arbitrary behavior occurred and discuss our findings considering the larger scope of animal culture.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Notably, archaeal tissues undergo a coenocytic stage followed by a tubulin-independent cellularization, orchestrated by active membrane tension at a critical cell size. Past cellularization, tissues are organized into two cell types - apical and basal scutoids - with junction elasticity akin to animal tissues, with actin and protein glycosylation as fiducial polarity markers.

Sema4ab is expressed by macrophages and gene ablation doubles the rate of regenerative neurogenesis. Disruption of the sema4ab receptor plxnb1a/b, expressed by spinal progenitor cells, also moderately increases regenerative neurogenesis. In addition, single cell transcriptomics reveals altered interactions between macrophages and multiple additional cell types after sema4ab disruption. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are down-regulated and fibroblasts upregulate expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine tgfb3. Inhibition of tgfb3 abolishes effects of sema4ab disruption on regenerative neurogenesis. This highlights sema4ab as a direct and indirect inhibitor of regenerative neurogenesis and as a potential therapeutic target in non-regenerating mammals.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

For example, YfmR was recently identified as a protein that prevents ribosome stalling at proline-containing sequences in the absence of EF-P. Here, we show that the YebC-family protein YebC2 (formerly YeeI) functions as a translation factor in B. subtilis that resolves ribosome stalling at polyprolines. We demonstrate that YebC2, EF-P and YfmR act independently to support cellular fitness. Moreover, we show that YebC2 interacts directly with the 70S ribosome, supporting a direct role for YebC2 in translation. Finally, we assess the evolutionary relationship between YebC2 and other characterized YebC family proteins, and present evidence that transcription and translation factors within the YebC family have evolved separately. Altogether our work identifies YebC2 as a translation factor that resolves ribosome stalling and provides crucial insight into the relationship between YebC2, EF-P, and YfmR, three factors that prevent ribosome stalling at prolines.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Path2Space identifies 4,500 genes whose spatial expression is robustly predicted in all three cohorts, markedly more accurate than existing ST predictors. Second, we show that based on the inferred ST, Path2Space accurately infers cell-type abundances in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Thirdly, Applying Path2Space to the TCGA breast cancer cohort we identify three TME spatially grounded subsets of patients that have markedly different survival rates. Fourth, analyzing two large breast cancer patients cohorts treated with trastuzumab, we show that the heterogeneity of the inferred HER2 levels across the tumor microenvironment is predictive of response, concordant with the bystander hypothesis. Finally, we developed a spatially interpretable model for predicting trastuzumab response directly from the H&E-slides. This model's performance surpasses that of existing response prediction models that use measured bulk multi-omics data. Path2Space is the first approach capable of robustly delineating the tumor microenvironment on an unprecedented scale directly from the tumor slides. It heralds the upcoming development of robust spatially grounded biomarkers of patients survival and treatment that promises to transform precision oncology in both the developed and developing worlds.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

However, the molecular determinants and functional impact of this additional system of inheritance are poorly characterized. Through comprehensive analyses of severe DNA methylation loss over TEs in an experimental population and in >700 natural strains of Arabidopsis thaliana, we uncovered hundreds of TE epivariants in nature, most of which can be inherited independently of DNA sequence changes and thus are true epialleles. Furthermore, natural epivariants are enriched near genes and we uncovered a novel role for the Paf1 complex as a major facilitator of their prevalence. Conversely, related TE copies limit epiallelic variation, by producing the small RNAs that guide DNA methylation in trans. Crucially, natural epivariants mainly affect stress-responsive genes, making them unique targets for selection. Our findings therefore demonstrate that TEs are important mediators of transgenerational epigenetic variation in nature, with singular properties for plant adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Yet, despite its essential role, the technology remains bound by the inherent limitations of quadrupole filters, which throw away up to 99% of the useful ion signal and caps the speed at which fragmentation data can be generated. These deficiencies often force compromises in data depth and accuracy, hindering breakthroughs that tie genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics together. A new technology is poised to break through these performance barriers, unlocking unprecedented capabilities in precision, sensitivity and throughput. This step-change in how mass spectrometry fragmentation analysis is performed will reshape the future of scientific discovery, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. The solution is high resolution ion mobility (HRIM), which offers a means to quickly and efficiently isolate ions prior to fragmentation and detection by a high resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) while also resolving challenging isomeric and isobaric compounds that lead to chimeric MS/MS spectra. HRIM isolates ions in time as a result of a high speed separation rather than acting as a filter that discards ion signal like the pervasive quadrupole mass analyzer, allowing higher sensitivity analysis to be achieved. Also, since HRIM eliminates the need to hop or sweep electronics control parameters, as is the case with a quadrupole, fragmentation spectral generation can occur at a much faster rate, upwards of 500 Hz. This whitepaper describes an IM/MS methodology first contemplated over twenty years ago and today being positioned as the fastest method for high resolution fragmentation analysis. Revisiting this concept using the latest generation ion mobility technology based on structures for lossless ion manipulation (SLIM), which is the only HRIM technology that delivers similar resolution and range of analysis as a quadrupole, realizes the full potential of this approach to deliver benefits in both speed and sensitivity for high performance MS/MS measurements. This new way of achieving ion fragmentation in complex samples is set to revolutionize the mass spectrometry space, starting in the growing field of proteomics where all researchers are seeking faster methods to achieve more comprehensive proteomic coverage. Due to the advantages of HRIM physics, we predict this will set the bar for high throughput -omics within the coming years and will eventually be as ubiquitous as the quadrupole is today.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Regardless of ethnoracial definition, the performance of the pretrained models in these samples was exceptionally high; the relative mean absolute error for each regional brain morphometry measure was less than 10% across all the distinct ethnoracial groups.

To proceed unhindered, pol {delta} holoenzymes must bypass lesions without stalling. This entails dNMP incorporation opposite the lesion (insertion) and the 5' template nucleotide (extension). Historically, it was viewed that high-fidelity pol holoenzymes stall upon encountering lesions, activating DNA damage tolerance pathways that are ultimately responsible for lesion bypass. Our recent study of 4 prominent lesions revealed that human pol {delta} holoenzymes support insertion and/or bypass for multiple lesions and the extents of these activities depends on the lesion and pol {delta} proofreading. In the present study, we expand these analyses to other prominent lesions. Collectively, analyses of 10 lesions from both studies reveal that the insertion and bypass efficiencies of pol {delta} holoenzymes each span a complete range (0 to 100%). Consequently, the fates of pol {delta} holoenzymes upon encountering lesions are quite diverse. Furthermore, pol {delta} proofreading promoted holoenzyme progression at 7 of the 10 lesions and did not deter progression at any. Altogether, the results significantly alter our understanding of the replicative capacity of high fidelity pol holoenzymes and their functional role(s) in lesion bypass.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

We previously showed that LCFA degradation impedes oxidative protein folding in the Escherichia coli envelope, an issue that arises due to the insufficiency of ubiquinone, a lipid-soluble electron carrier in the electron transport chain (ETC). To maintain redox homeostasis, E. coli activates the CpxAR two-component system; however, the nature of feedback imparted by this envelope stress response (ESR) remained unknown. Here, we show that contrary to the well-recognized remedial mode of Cpx restoring envelope integrity by upregulating protein quality control factors, in LCFA-grown cells, it uses a preventive measure to maintain homeostasis. Cpx increases ubiquinone availability for oxidative protein folding by suppressing LCFA metabolism and directly increasing ubiquinone levels. Further, rather than using its conventional mode of imparting regulation via CpxR working as a transcriptional regulator, during LCFA metabolism, Cpx mainly uses its non-coding arm to counteract envelope redox stress. The Cpx-regulated small RNA CpxQ represses fad genes involved in LCFA transport and {beta}-oxidation, downregulates components of glyoxylate shunt, gluconeogenesis, and ETC, and increases ubiquinone content. Corroborating with its role in repressing LCFA metabolism and maintaining redox homeostasis, CpxQ overexpression impairs growth of E. coli in LCFAs and CpxQ deletion renders LCFA-grown E. coli hypersensitive to a thiol agent. Our foremost work studying the interconnection between LCFA metabolism, redox stress, and ESR in E. coli provides a rationale for investigating similar networks in other LCFA-utilizing bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Despite their potential, lupin crops are frequently devastated by Colletotrichum lupini, a member of the top ten fungal pathogenic genera in the world. In our previous study, we identified LluR1, the first C. lupini resistance gene, in a wild Lupinus luteus accession. Further research was necessary to unravel the defense mechanisms involved. Histological analysis revealed a hypersensitive response against C. lupini, while transcriptome analysis highlighted a complex network of differentially expressed genes, including TIR-NBS-LRR proteins, hypersensitive response, and phenylpropanoid pathways. SNPs were identified that distinguish the protein sequences underlying immunity. These findings, along with orthology in other lupin species, offer valuable insights for developing breeding strategies to enhance C. lupini resistance in lupins, with significant potential impacts on food, feed, and human nutrition.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Pausing also contributes to the formation of nucleosome-free regions with the help of chromatin remodellers. However, if these nucleosome-free regions engage with transcription factors to stimulate the transcription potential of paused promoters is not known. In this study, we demonstrate that ligand-induced estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) binding is stabilized at Pol II-paused sites. This stabilization results from an increased dwell time of ERalpha on chromatin, as revealed by single molecule tracking (SMT) experiments. Notably, short chromatin-associated RNAs generated by the paused Pol II contribute to enhancing ERalpha binding at paused promoters. We also observe that pausing increases histone H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) levels, which primes paused promoters for robust transcriptional activation upon release. Collectively, these findings suggest that paused Pol II plays a central role in enhancing transcription factor binding through an RNA-dependent mechanism. This, in turn, results in a more vigorous transcriptional response following pausing release, thus contributing to the fine-tuning of ERalpha-mediated gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

However, the mechanisms of evolving antimicrobial resistance in such polymicrobial environments are poorly understood. We previously reported that magnesium depletion caused by the fungus Candida albicans can enable Pseudomonas aeruginosa to acquire significant resistance to colistin, a last-resort antibiotic targeting bacterial membrane. Here, we dissect the genetic and biochemical basis of this increased colistin resistance. We show that P. aeruginosa cells can acquire colistin resistance using three distinct evolutionary trajectories involving mutations in genes involved in lipid A biosynthesis, lipid A modifications that are dependent on low Mg2+, and a putative Mg2+ transporter, PA4824. These mutations confer colistin resistance by altering acyl chains, hydroxylation, and aminoarabinose modification of lipid A moieties on the bacterial outer membrane. In all cases, enhanced colistin resistance initially depends on the low Mg2+-responsive PhoPQ pathway, which potentiates the evolution of resistance mutations and lipid A modifications that do not occur without Mg2+ depletion. However, the PhoPQ pathway is not required to maintain high colistin resistance in all cases. In most cases, the genetic and biochemical changes associated with these novel forms of colistin resistance also impair bacterial membrane integrity, leading to fitness costs. Our findings provide molecular insights into how nutritional competition drives a novel antibiotic resistance mechanism and its ensuing fitness tradeoffs.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

This study demonstrates that inattentional blindness to sensory information undermines successful navigation in Egyptian fruit bats, Rousettus aegyptiacus, a species that has access to vision and echolocation to traverse natural environments. Bats flew over repeated trials to a perch at a fixed location in the light, allowing them to navigate using both vision and echolocation. The experiment was then repeated in the dark to exclude the bats use of vision. The perch was subsequently displaced by either 15 or 30 cm in one of six different directions (up, down, left, right, front, back). Echolocation behavior was recorded using a 25-channel microphone array, while flight paths were tracked using 13 motion capture cameras. The directional aim of echolocation clicks served as a metric for the bats spatial attention to locations in their environment. In the light, bats modified their flight paths to successfully land on a perch that was moved 15 cm but surprisingly, often failed to land on it when displaced by 30 cm. In the dark, bats often failed to land on the perch after it was moved by only 15 cm. Landing failures suggest that learned spatial priors invoked inattentional blindness to changes in the environment, which interfered with successful navigation. In both the light and dark, when bats failed to land on the perch at its new location, they directed their attention toward the original perch position. Performance differences in the light and dark suggest that the bats attentional spotlight may be narrower when it relies on echolocation than vision. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first evidence of inattentional blindness in a flying echolocating animal, demonstrating that spatial priors can dominate sensory processing during navigation.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

The demonstration that the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) already contained the mitochondrion, an endosymbiotic organelle derived from an alphaproteobacterium, and the discovery of Asgard archaea, the closest archaeal relatives of eukaryotes inform and constrain evolutionary scenarios of eukaryogenesis. We undertook a comprehensive analysis of the origins of the core eukaryotic genes tracing to the LECA within a rigorous statistical framework centered around evolutionary hypotheses testing using constrained phylogenetic trees. The results reveal dominant contributions of Asgard archaea to the origin of most of the conserved eukaryotic functional systems and pathways. A limited contribution from Alphaproteobacteria was identified, primarily relating to the energy transformation systems and Fe-S cluster biogenesis, whereas ancestry from other bacterial phyla was scattered across the eukaryotic functional landscape, without consistent trends. These findings suggest a model of eukaryogenesis in which key features of eukaryotic cell organization evolved in the Asgard ancestor, followed by the capture of the Alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont, and augmented by numerous but sporadic horizontal acquisition of genes from other bacteria both before and after endosymbiosis.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Accordingly, studies of perceptual decision-making have historically relied on tasks with fixed choice-response mappings, in which choice and motor response are inextricably linked. Although several studies have since dissociated choice and response, they have typically involved dynamic switching of the choice-response mapping on a trial-by-trial basis. Thus, it remains unclear if abstract choice representations arise specifically when choice-response relationships change dynamically, or if they reflect a more general property of the decision-making process. Here, we show that in the human brain, choices are represented abstractly, even when the association between choice and motor response remains stable over time. We measured neural activity in humans using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while participants performed a motion discrimination task. Importantly, the associations between perceptual choice and motor response were balanced across experimental conditions and remained stable over many trials. We found neural information about the participants' perceptual choice, independent of both the motor response and the visual stimulus. This abstract choice information increased during the stimulus period and peaked after the response had been made. Furthermore, choice and response information showed distinct cortical distributions, with strongest choice information in frontoparietal regions. Our results suggest that abstract choice representations are not restricted to action-independent contexts or those with dynamic choice-response associations and may therefore reflect a general role in perceptual decision-making.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

The specificity of deadenylation can be mediated through RNA adaptors - RNA-binding proteins that tether substrate mRNAs to Ccr4-Not in a regulated and context-specific manner. Interaction with Ccr4-Not is mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) within the RNA adaptors. Due to the difficulty in studying large IDR-containing complexes, the determinants of specificity and their regulation remain unclear. Here we use structural biology and biochemical reconstitution to show that dispersed segments within IDRs of RNA adaptors bind to several distinct binding sites on Ccr4-Not through multivalent interactions. We further demonstrate that binding can be modulated by phosphorylation, altering the consequent deadenylation rate in a continuously tunable manner. This mechanism is broadly applicable in evolutionarily divergent IDRs from multiple RNA adaptors including fission yeast Puf3, and human Pumilio/PUM1 and Tristetraprolin/TTP. Together, our work suggests that multivalent interactions and phosphorylation represent conserved strategies for regulating gene expression. Thus, in response to cellular cues, mRNA decay can be regulated by a graded mechanism, rather than a bistable on/off switch, rationalizing how post-transcriptional gene expression is fine-tuned.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Commonly used antiseizure medications (ASMs) for SCN8A-related disorders, caused by gain-of-function variants, are sodium channel blockers. The use of such ASMs is often not enough to gain satisfactory seizure control. In this retrospective study, the effect of cenobamate was assessed in patients with SCN8A-DEE. Methods: Across multiple centers and through a collaboration with the patient advocacy organization International SCN8A Alliance, patients with SCN8A-DEE treated with cenobamate for at least 3 months were identified. Data were obtained once from patients' caregivers or treating physicians through a RedCap survey. The functional effects of the included patients' SCN8A variants were determined by functional tests published in the literature or functionally classified by prediction tools. Results: Twelve patients (2-25 years, 8 females) with presumed gain-of-function SCN8A variants were treated with cenobamate for a mean period of 8.6 months (range 3-27 months). Countable motor seizures were reduced in 12/12 (100%) patients. Seven experienced a seizure reduction above 75% of which two patients achieved seizure freedom. A 25-50% and 50-75% decrease was observed in three and two patients, respectively. An increase in seizure-free days/patient was also reported. Rescue medication was decreased in 83% of patients, and non-seizure-related improvements (increased alertness, better sleep, improved muscle tone) were observed in 58%. Adverse effects were reported by 33%; half resolved spontaneously or by the reduction of concomitant ASMs. Significance: Our data suggest, that cenobamate is a promising and safe treatment for SCN8A-DEE, even during early infancy. As a possible precision approach to treatment, cenobamate effectively reduced seizure burden and ameliorated non-seizure-related symptoms. Similar results may be achieved in cohorts of patients with gain-of-function variants encoding other sodium channels","NA","medrxiv",1729462126293

Here, we performed intravital imaging of microglia mitochondria, revealing that microglial processes diverge, with some containing multiple mitochondria while others are completely void. Microglial processes that engage in minute-to-minute surveillance typically do not have mitochondria. Moreover, unlike process surveillance, mitochondrial motility does not change with animal anesthesia. Likewise, the processes that acutely chemoattract to a lesion site or initially engage with a neuron undergoing programmed cell death do not contain mitochondria. Rather, microglia mitochondria have a delayed arrival into the responding cell processes. Thus, there is subcellular heterogeneity of mitochondrial partitioning and asymmetry between mitochondrial localization and cell process motility or acute damage responses.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Conversely, inhibiting CRHPVN neurons during stress reverses stress-induced memory deficits while slightly increasing the amount of sleep. We found that both stress and stimulation of CRHPVN neurons activate neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), and that their projections to the LH are critical for mediating stress-induced memory deficits and sleep disruptions.

Using 131 fully-sequenced Lactuca sativa genotypes, we analyzed their leaf-associated bacterial communities via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.

Further analysis of 10 specific leaf morphological traits showed that heart formation, head height, and venation types significantly shaped bacterial richness and evenness, mainly acting on non-hub members.

A comparison of these five GENFI and 29 literature cases to the patterns observed in a large number of sporadic cases revealed critical differences in presentation. Conclusions: Both parts of our study suggest that true SD/svPPA is unlikely to have an autosomal dominant genetic aetiology and that, while mutation carriers may resemble SD/svPPA in some respects, they may not meet current clinical diagnostic criteria for this condition.","NA","medrxiv",1729462126293

For PV, this mechanism exploits the host secretory autophagy pathway. Virions are selectively incorporated into autophagosomes, double-membrane vesicles that travel to the plasma membrane, fuse, and release single-membrane vesicles containing virions. Loading of cellular cargo into autophagosomes relies on direct or indirect interactions with microtubule-associated protein 1B-light chain 3 (LC3) that are mediated by motifs referred to as LC3-interaction regions (LIRs). We have identified a PV mutant with a severe defect in non-lytic spread. An F-to-Y substitution in a putative LIR of the nonstructural protein 3CD prevented virion incorporation into LC3-positive autophagosomes and virion trafficking to the plasma membrane for release. Using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy to monitor PV-induced autophagosome biogenesis, for the first time, we show that virus-induced autophagic signals yield normal autophagosomes, even in the absence of virions. The F-to-Y derivative of PV 3CD was unable to support normal autophagosome biogenesis. Together, these studies make a compelling case for a direct role of a viral nonstructural protein in the formation and loading of the vesicular carriers used for non-lytic spread that may depend on the proper structure, accessibility, and/or dynamics of its LIR. The studies of PV 3CD protein reported here will hopefully provoke a more deliberate look at the presence and function of LIR motifs in viral proteins of viruses known to use autophagy as the basis for non-lytic spread.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

A major factor responsible for such seamless assembly are the preferential interactions between the constituent macromolecules, either associative or segregative, that can drive de-mixing to produce co-existing phases, and thus provide a dynamic intracellular compartmentalization. But how these two types of interactions, occurring simultaneously within the cytoplasmic space, influence each other is still largely unknown. This makes understanding and applying the molecular interactions that interfere with each other in such crowded environments crucial when engineering increasingly complex synthetic cells. Here, we show that the interplay between segregative and associative phase separation within cell-mimicking vesicles can lead to rich dynamics between them. Using on-chip microfluidic systems, we encapsulate the associative and segregative components in cell-sized containers and trigger their phase separations to create hierarchical structures that act as molecular recruiters, membrane targeting agents, and initiators of condensation. The obtained multiphase architecture provides an isolated microenvironment for condensates, restricting their molecular communication as well as diffusive motion, and leading to budding-like behaviour at the lipid membrane. In conclusion, we propose segregative phase separation as a universal condensate regulation strategy in managing molecular distribution, condensate location, as well as membrane interaction. We believe our approach will facilitate controlling the behaviour of membraneless organelles within synthetic cells.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

A nonlinear dynamical model that incorporates the experimentally observed cross-inhibition of amino acid production recapitulates the population cycles. The model shows that the cycles represent internally generated relaxation oscillations, which emerge when fast resource dynamics with positive feedback drive slow changes in strain abundance.

We purified the minimal replication complex, comprising nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8, and combined it with fluorescently labelled RNA substrates, enabling real-time monitoring of RNA primer elongation at the single-molecule level. This platform allowed us to investigate the mechanisms of action of key inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication. In particular, our data provides evidence for remdesivir's mechanism of action, which involves polymerase stalling and subsequent chain termination dependent on the concentration of competing nucleotide triphosphates.

Recent advancements in deep learning algorithms have enabled researchers to utilize various features to predict protein functions. Traditionally, these algorithms treat proteins as independent functional units or consider interactions only at the protein level. However, prokaryotes often preserve specific genomic neighborhoods over evolutionary time, providing valuable context for predicting protein functions. This context can arise from genes near the gene of interest or synteny regions, where the conserved order of genes on chromosomes results from common ancestry. Results: We developed a transformer-based model to pre-train representations of proteins based on their genomic context, and use this model for predicting protein functions. Our results show that context-based protein representations capture context-specific functional semantics and can effectively predict protein functions. We use our model to investigate the influence of phylogenetic distance and homology on the performance of context-dependent function prediction, and find that synteny affects the prediction performance substantially, except for some functions where the function is determined by the genomic context. Our experiments allow us to gain insights into the factors affecting the performance and applicability of context-based function prediction methods across diverse prokaryotic genomes and meta-genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Firstly, we used genome-wide association studies to connect genetic variants with the phenotypes. Next, we benchmarked an automated machine learning pipeline that includes preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameters optimization in combination with multiple linear and complex machine learning methods. We determined gradient boosting machines as best performing in 65% of predictions and pangenome as best predictor, suggesting a considerable contribution of the accessory genome in controlling phenotypes. The accuracy broadly varied among the phenotypes (r = 0.2-0.9), consistent with varying levels of complexity, with stress resistance being easier to predict compared to growth across carbon and nitrogen nutrients. While no specific genomic features could be linked to the predictions for most phenotypes, machine learning identifies high-impact variants with established relationships to phenotypes despite being rare in the population.

While cell-intrinsic mechanisms underlying CD8 T cell exhaustion have been extensively studied, the impact of the metabolic environment in which exhausted CD8 T cells (Tex) operate remains less clear. Using untargeted metabolomics and the murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection model we investigated systemic metabolite changes early and late following acute versus chronic viral infections. We identified distinct short-term and persistent metabolite shifts, with the most significant differences occurring transiently during the acute phase of the sustained infection. This included nutrient changes that were independent of viral loads and partially associated with CD8 T cell-induced anorexia and lipolysis. One remarkable observation was the elevation of medium- and long-chain fatty acid (FA) and acylcarnitines during the early phase after chronic infection. During this time, virus-specific CD8 T cells from chronically infected mice exhibited increased lipid accumulation and uptake compared to their counterparts from acute infection, particularly stem-like Tex (TexSTEM), a subset that generates effector-like TexINT which directly limit viral replication. Notably, only TexSTEM increased oxidative metabolism and ATP production upon FA exposure. Consistently, short-term reintroduction of FA during late chronic infection exclusively improved TexSTEM mitochondrial fitness, percentages and numbers. This treatment, however, also reduced TexINT, resulting in compromised viral control. Our study offers a valuable resource for investigating the role of specific metabolites in regulating immune responses during acute and chronic viral infections and highlights the potential of long-chain FA to influence TexSTEM and viral control during a protracted infection.

SignificanceThis study examines systemic metabolite changes during acute and chronic viral infections. Notably, we identified an early, transient nutrient shift in chronic infection, marked by an increase in medium- and long-chain fatty acid related species. Concomitantly, a virus-specific stem-like T cell population, essential for maintaining other T cells, displayed high lipid avidity and was capable of metabolizing exogenous fatty acids. Administering fatty acids late in chronic infection, when endogenous lipid levels had normalized, expanded this stem-like T cell population and enhanced their mitochondrial fitness. These findings highlight the potential role of fatty acids in regulating stem-like T cells in chronic settings and offer a valuable resource for studying other metabolic signatures in both acute and persistent infections.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Some repetitive sequences such as REPINs are mobile within the genome but inherited only vertically from mother to daughter across bacterial genomes. Selfish elements in contrast are mobile within the genome but also travel horizontally from genome to genome. Yet, no matter the nature of the association between the repetitive elements and the host, it is difficult to study the evolutionary dynamics of repetitive sequences across genomes. If it is unclear whether two sequences in two different genomes are in orthologous positions, it is difficult to infer parameters like the replication rate, horizontal transfer rate and rate of loss. Here we present a tool to facilitate these analyses called REPORTH. REPORTH determines whether repetitive sequences in different but closely related bacterial genomes occur in orthologous genomic positions. Whether a position is orthologous or not depends on the orthology of flanking sequences. Flanking sequences are deemed orthologous if they are bidirectional best hits. All repetitive sequences that are found in orthologous positions across different genomes are grouped together. Analyses of these groups can be used to study the evolutionary dynamics of selfish repetitive elements such as insertion sequences, but also for mutualistic repetitive elements such as REPINs.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

We show that under realistic conditions the likelihood in the admixture model is typically flat in some direction around a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) (q, p). In particular, the maximum likelihood estimator is non-unique and there is a complete spectrum of possible estimates. Common inference tools typically identify only a few points within this spectrum. We provide an algorithm which computes the set of equally likely (q, p), when starting from (q, p). It is analytic for K=2 ancestral populations and numeric for K>2. We apply our algorithm to data from the 1000 genomes project, and show that inter-European estimators of q can come with a large set of equally likely possibilities. In general, markers with large allele frequency differences between populations in combination with individuals with concentrated admixture proportions lead to small areas with a flat likelihood. Our findings imply that care must be taken when interpreting results from STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE if populations are not separated well enough.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Classical analyses to estimate functional connectivity (i.e., filtering electrophysiological signals in canonical frequency bands and using connectivity metrics) assume that these reflect oscillatory networks. However, this approach conflates non-oscillatory, aperiodic neural activity with oscillations; raising the possibility that these functional networks may reflect aperiodic rather than oscillatory activity. Here, we provide the first study quantifying, in two different human electroencephalography (EEG) databases, the contribution of aperiodic activity on reconstructed oscillatory functional networks in resting state. We found that more than 99% of delta, theta, and gamma functional networks, more than 90% of beta functional networks and between 23 and 55% of alpha functional networks were actually driven by aperiodic activity. While there is no universal consensus on how to identify and quantify neural oscillations, our results demonstrate that oscillatory functional networks are drastically sparser than commonly assumed. These findings suggest that most functional connectivity studies focusing on resting state actually reflect aperiodic networks instead of oscillations-based networks. We highly recommend that oscillatory network analyses first check the presence of aperiodicity-unbiased neural oscillations before estimating their statistical coupling to strengthen the robustness, interpretability, and reproducibility of functional connectivity studies.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

However, the reconstitution of mtDNA deletions responsible for severe mitochondrial myopathies and age-related diseases has not yet been achieved in human cells. Here, we developed a method to engineer specific mtDNA deletions in human cells by co-expressing end-joining (EJ) machinery and targeted endonucleases. As a proof-of-concept, we used mito-EJ and mito-ScaI to generate a panel of clonal cell lines harboring a ~3.5 kb mtDNA deletion with the full spectrum of heteroplasmy. Investigating these isogenic cells revealed a critical threshold of ~75% deleted genomes, beyond which cells exhibited depletion of OXPHOS proteins, severe metabolic disruption, and impaired growth in galactose-containing media. Single-cell multiomic analysis revealed two distinct patterns of nuclear gene deregulation in response to mtDNA deletion accumulation; one triggered at the deletion threshold and another progressively responding to increasing heteroplasmy. In summary, the co-expression of mito-EJ and programable nucleases provides a powerful tool to model disease-associated mtDNA deletions in different cell types. Establishing a panel of cell lines with a large-scale deletion at varying levels of heteroplasmy is a valuable resource for understanding the impact of mtDNA deletions on diseases and guiding the development of potential therapeutic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Evolution has woven the LC into wide-ranging neural circuits that influence functions as broad as autonomic systems, the stress response, nociception, sleep, and high-level cognition among others. Given this conservation, there is a strong possibility that LC activity is inherently similar across species, and furthermore that age, sex, and brain state influence LC activity similarly across species. The degree to which LC activity is homogenous across these factors, however, has never been assessed due to the small sample size of individual studies. Here, we pool data from 20 laboratories (1,855 neurons) and show diversity across both intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as species, age, sex and brain state. We use a negative binomial regression model to compare activity from male monkeys, and rats and mice of both sexes that were recorded across brain states from brain slices ex vivo or under different anesthetics or during wakefulness in vivo. LC activity differed due to complex interactions of species, sex, and brain state. The LC became more active during aging, independent of sex. Finally, in contrast to the foundational principle that all species express two distinct LC firing modes (""tonic"" or ""phasic""), we discovered great diversity within spontaneous LC firing patterns. Different factors were associated with higher incidence of some firing modes. We conclude that the activity of the evolutionarily-ancient LC is not conserved. Inherent differences due to age and species-sex-brain state interactions have implications for understanding the role of LC in species-specific naturalistic behavior, as well as in psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease, immunology, and metabolic disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Using two different technologies increases the cost and the required amount of genomic DNA. Here, we show that comparable results are possible using error correction of ultra-long ONT Simplex reads and then assembling them using state-of-the-art de novo assembly methods. To achieve this, we have developed the deep learning-based HERRO framework, which corrects ONT Simplex reads while carefully preserving differences in related genomic sequences. Taking into account informative positions that differentiate the haplotypes or genomic repeat copies, HERRO achieves an increase of read accuracy of up to 100-fold for diploid human genomes. By combining HERRO with Verkko assembler, we achieve high contiguity on several human genomes by reconstructing many chromosomes telomere-to-telomere, including chromosomes X and Y. HERRO supports both R9.4.1 and R10.4.1 ONT Simplex reads and generalizes well to other species.

For example, in uniaxially stretched tissue most divisions orient along the stretch axis. This mechanosensitive division orientation can be achieved by distinct mechanisms involving a direct response to force or an indirect response to force via cell shape changes. Cells also generally align divisions along their long axis of interphase shape. Since stretching a tissue elongates cells, uncoupling whether divisions orient in response to force or to cell shape remains challenging. Here, we utilised the Xenopus laevis embryonic animal cap tissue, to which a reproducible external stretch can be applied, to understand mechanosensitive division orientation. We focused on nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), which is key to spindle orientation. We show that NuMA is dynamically localised to the cell cortex earlier during mitosis in uniaxially stretched tissues. This temporal cortical recruitment of NuMA coincides with the onset and subsequent stretch-induced amplification of spindle oscillations. Additionally, we show that knockdown of NuMA reduces spindle oscillations and disrupts division orientation according to stretch and cell shape. We also show that divisions dynamically align with cell shape under tissue stretch and that this involves a direct response to force via NuMA localisation, rather than an indirect response to force via cell shape changes. Overall, using live tissue imaging, mathematical modelling, and tissue mechanics our results indicate that NuMA fine tunes spindle dynamics and ensures the accurate alignment of divisions with cell shape and anisotropic tension.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Investigations of the consequences of violating these assumptions so far have focused on individual perturbations operating in isolation. Here, we analyze widely used estimators of genetic architectural parameters, including LD-score regression and both population-based and within-family GWAS, across a broad array of perturbations to classical assumptions, such as multivariate assortative mating and vertical transmission (parental effects on offspring phenotypes not mediated by genetic inheritance). We find that widely-used statistical approaches are unreliable across a broad range of perturbations, and that structural sources of confounding often operate synergistically to distort conclusions. For example, mild multivariate assortative mating and vertical transmission together can dramatically inflate heritability estimates and GWAS false positive rates. Further, GWAS will become progressively more polluted by off-target associations as sample sizes increase. Given these challenges, we introduce xftsim, a forward time simulation library capable of modeling a wide range of genetic architectures, mating regimes, and transmission dynamics, to facilitate the systematic comparison of existing approaches and the development of robust methods. Together, our findings illustrate the importance of comprehensive sensitivity analysis and present a valuable tool for future research.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Here, we describe Jyvaskylavirus, the first giant virus isolated from Finland. This clade B marseillevirus was found in Acanthamoeba castellanii from a composting soil sample in Jyvaskyla, Central Finland. Its genome shares similarities with other marseilleviruses, including conserved Nucleocytoviricota genes, histone-like genes, and three unique ORFans. Helium ion microscopy and electron microscopy of infected cells unraveled stages of the Jyvaskylavirus lifecycle, such as single virions attached to the cell membrane, likely triggering endocytosis, and virus-rich vesicle formation within the cytoplasm. We also reconstructed the Jyvaskylavirus particle to 6.3 [A] resolution using cryo-EM. The ~2,500 [A] diameter virion displays structural similarities to other Marseilleviridae giant viruses. The capsid comprises of 9,240 copies of the major capsid protein ORF184, which possesses a double jellyroll fold arranged in trimers forming pseudo-hexameric capsomers. Below the capsid shell, the internal membrane vesicle encloses the genome. Through cross-structural and -sequence comparisons with other Marseilleviridae using AI-based software in model building and prediction, we elucidated ORF142 as the penton protein, which plugs the twelve vertices of the capsid. Five additional ORFs were identified, with models predicted and fitted into densities that either cap the capsomers externally or stabilize them internally. The isolation of Jyvaskylavirus, along with other virus-like particles, not only suggests that these viruses may be widespread in the boreal environment but also provide insights extendable to other marseilleviruses, addressing the previously lacking structural data on minor capsid proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

It comprises thousands of microtubules (MTs) that build a scaffold around the distal half of the nucleus. The manchette distributes proteins and vesicles during spermiogenesis in a process called intra-manchette transport (IMT). The current hypothesis is that IMT shares many similarities with intra-flagellar transport (IFT) and utilizes both MTs and filamentous actin (F-actin). However, IMT is still poorly understood as direct visualization of IMT complexes is missing, and the presence of F-actin has not been experimentally shown. Here, we use proteomics and cryogenic-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to identify and visualize IMT components. We find that F-actin is an integral part of the manchette with two different spatial organizations, namely bundles and single filaments, providing tracks for transport as well as having structural and mechanical roles. We further uncover that IMT on MTs is mediated by two distinct transport machineries: dynein mediated transport of soluble cargo and dynein independent transport for vesicles. Our results provide new insights into the manchette's function as a transport scaffold, highlighting its significance for the polarization of spermatids during spermiogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

However, most studies of GPCR-lipid interactions have been carried out in mixed micelles or lipid nanodiscs. Though useful, these membrane mimetics do not fully replicate the physical properties of native cellular membranes associated with large assemblies of lipids. We investigated the conformational equilibria of the human A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR) in phospholipid vesicles using 19F solid-state magic angle spinning NMR (SSNMR). By applying an optimized sample preparation workflow and experimental conditions, we were able to obtain 19F-SSNMR spectra for both antagonist- and agonist-bound complexes with sensitivity and line widths closely comparable to those achieved using solution NMR. This facilitated a direct comparison of the A2AAR conformational equilibria across detergent micelle, lipid nanodisc, and lipid vesicle preparations. While antagonist-bound A2AAR showed a similar conformational equilibria across all membrane and membrane mimetic systems, the conformational equilibria of agonist-bound A2AAR exhibited differences among different environments. This suggests that the conformational equilibria of GPCRs may be influenced not only by specific receptor-lipid interactions but also by the membrane properties found in larger lipid assemblies.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126293

Our developmental analyses reveal a hierarchical molecular program in which cell class-distinguishing features emerge first, followed by subclass- and type-related characteristics, with distinct developmental paces among cell populations. Environmental contribution was assessed in vivo, using genetically modified mice models in which position or innervation are altered, and in vitro using two-dimensional cultures.

We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark.

MethodsA cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza.

ResultsAmong 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80).

ConclusionCOVID-19 represented a greater disease burden than influenza, with more hospitalisations and deaths, and more severe disease primarily among non-vaccinated and comorbid patients.

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126294

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","10.1186/s40168-024-01916-8","biorxiv",1729462126294

Fluorescent HaloTag ligands employed in sequential labeling led to the discovery of distinct protein variants for histones, cohesins, and MCM complexes. Nonetheless, an efficient biochemical approach to separate the distinct protein variants to study their biological functions is missing. Principally being a gap in technology, the HaloTag toolbox lacks affinity ligands displaying good cell permeability and efficient affinity capture. Here, we describe the design, synthesis, and validation of a new cell-permeable Biotin-HaloTag ligand, which allows rapid labeling of Halo-tagged proteins in live cells and their efficient separation using streptavidin pull-down. Our work outlines how to use the herein-developed affinity ligand in sequential labeling to biochemically separate distinct protein variants and study their biological properties. The approach holds immense potential for addressing fundamental questions concerning essential cellular processes, including genome duplication and chromatin maintenance.","NA","biorxiv",1729462126294
