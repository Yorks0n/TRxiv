ObjectiveThe primary objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the global prevalence of long COVID and its subtypes and symptoms in individuals with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, while the secondary objective is to assess risk factors for long COVID in the same population.

Data SourcesStudies on long COVID published from July 5, 2021, to May 29, 2024, searched from PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were used for this systematic review. Supplemental updates to the original search period were made.

Study SelectionThere were four inclusion criteria: (1) human study population with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis; (2) appropriate index diagnosis date; (3) outcome must include either prevalence, risk factors, duration, or symptoms of long COVID; and (4) follow-up time of at least two months after the index date. The exclusion criteria were: (1) non-human study population; (1) case studies or reviews; (2) studies with imaging, molecular, and/or cellular testing as primary results; (3) studies with specific populations such as healthcare workers, residents of nursing homes, and/or those living in long-term care facilities; and (4) studies that did not meet the sample size threshold needed to estimate overall prevalence with margin of error of 0.05.

Data Extraction and SynthesisTwo screeners independently performed screenings and data extraction, and decision conflicts were collectively resolved. The data were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis framework with a DerSimonian-Laird inverse variance weighted estimator.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary estimand (target population parameter of interest) was the prevalence of long COVID and its subtypes among individuals with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, and the secondary estimand was effect sizes corresponding to ten common risk factors of long COVID in the same population.

ResultsA total of 442 studies were included in this mega-systematic review, and 429 were meta-analyzed for various endpoints, avoiding duplicate estimates from the same study. Of the 442 studies, 17.9% of the studies have a high risk of bias. Heterogeneity is evident among meta-analyzed studies, where the I2 statistic is nearly 100% in studies that estimate overall prevalence. Global estimated pooled prevalence of long COVID was 36% among COVID-19 positive individuals (95% confidence interval [CI] 33%-40%) estimated from 144 studies. Geographical variation was observed in the estimated pooled prevalence of long COVID: Asia at 35% (95% CI 25%-46%), Europe at 39% (95% CI 31%-48%), North America at 30% (95% CI 24%-38%), and South America at 51% (95% CI 35%-66%). Stratifying by follow-up duration, the estimated pooled prevalence for individuals with longer follow-up periods of 1 to 2 years (47% [95% CI 37%-57%]) compared to those with follow-up times of less than 1 year (35% [95% CI 31%-39%]) had overlapping CI and were therefore not statistically distinguishable. Top five most prevalent long COVID subtypes among COVID-19 positive cases were respiratory at 20% (95% CI 14%-28%) estimated from 31 studies, general fatigue at 20% (95% CI 18%-23%) estimated from 121 studies, psychological at 18% (95% CI 11%-28%) estimated from 10 studies, neurological at 16% (95% CI 8%-30%) estimated from 23 studies, and dermatological at 12% (95% CI 8%-17%) estimated from 10 studies. The most common symptom based on estimated prevalence was memory problems estimated at 11% (95% CI 7%-19%) meta-analyzed from 12 studies. The three strongest risk factors for long COVID were being unvaccinated for COVID-19, pre-existing comorbidity, and female sex. Individuals with any of these risk factors had higher odds of having long COVID with pooled estimated odds ratios of 2.34 (95% CI 1.49-3.67) meta-analyzed from 6 studies, 1.59 (95% CI 1.28-1.97) from 13 studies, and 1.55 (95% CI 1.25-1.92) from 22 studies, respectively.

Conclusions and RelevanceThis study shows long COVID is globally prevalent in the COVID-19 positive population with highly varying estimates. The prevalence of long COVID persists over extended follow-up, with a high burden of symptoms 1 to 2 years post-infection. Our findings highlight long COVID and its subtypes as a continuing health challenge worldwide. The heterogeneity of the estimates across populations and geographical regions argues for the need for carefully designed follow-up with representative studies across the world.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the prevalence and patterns of long COVID and its subtypes, and what are the risk factors of long COVID?

ResultsMeta-analysis of 429 studies published from 2021-2024 estimated a pooled global long COVID prevalence of 36% in COVID-19 positive individuals. Variations in geographical regions showed that South America had the highest pooled prevalence of 51% (95% CI: 35%-66%), and the prevalence does not seem to diminish with extended follow-up (less than 1 year: 35%, 95% CI: 31%-39% vs. 1 to 2 years: 47%, 95% CI: 37%-57%). The estimated pooled prevalence of eight major long COVID subtypes in COVID-19 positive individuals were 20% (respiratory), 20% (general fatigue), 18% (psychological), 16% (neurological), 12% (dermatological), 10% (cardiovascular), 9% (musculoskeletal) and 5% (gastrointestinal).

MeaningQuantitative evidence shows a persistent prevalence of long COVID globally, with a significant burden of symptoms 1 to 2 years post-infection, underscoring the need for having accurate and standardized diagnostic tests and biomarkers for long COVID, a better understanding of the physiology of the condition, its treatment, and its potential effect on healthcare needs and workforce participation. The heterogeneity and wide range of the prevalence estimates call for representative samples in well-designed follow-up studies of long COVID across the world.","NA","medrxiv",1736374092742

ME/CFS symptoms can range from mild to severe, and include immune system effects alongside incapacitating fatigue and post-exertional disease exacerbation. In this study, we examined immunological profiles of people living with ME/CFS by flow cytometry, focusing on cytotoxic cells, to determine whether people with mild/moderate (n= 43) or severe ME/CFS (n=53) expressed different immunological markers. We found that people with mild/moderate ME/CFS had increased expression of cytotoxic effector molecules alongside enhanced proportions of early-immunosenescence cells, determined by the CD28-CD57- phenotype. In contrast, people with severe ME/CFS had higher proportions of activated circulating lymphocytes, determined by CD69+ and CD38+ expression, and expressed more pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN{gamma}, TNF and IL-17, following stimulation in vitro. These changes were consistent across different cell types including CD8+ T cells, mucosal associated invariant T cells and Natural Killer cells, indicating generalised altered cytotoxic responses across the innate and adaptive immune system . These immunological differences likely reflect different disease pathogenesis mechanisms occurring in the two clinical groups, and opening up opportunities for the development of prognostic markers and stratified treatments.","NA","medrxiv",1736374092742

The epidemic remains uncontrolled, with spillbacks into poultry, wild birds and other mammals including humans. Here, we present molecular and virological evidence that the cattle B3.13 genotype H5N1 viruses rapidly accumulated adaptations in polymerase genes that enabled better replication in bovine cells, as well as cells of other mammalian species including humans and pigs. We find evidence of several mammalian adaptations gained early in the evolution of these viruses in cattle including PB2 M631L, which is found in all cattle sequences, and PA K497R, which is found in the majority. Structurally, PB2 M631L maps to the polymerase-ANP32 interface, an essential host factor for viral genome replication. We show this mutation adapts the virus to co-opt bovine ANP32 proteins and thereby enhances virus replication in bovine and primary human airway cells. Importantly, we show that ongoing evolution during 2024 in the PB2 gene, including a convergently arising D740N substitution, further increases polymerase activity in a range of mammalian cells. Thus, the continued circulation of H5N1 in dairy cattle allows virus adaption improving replicative ability in cattle and increasing zoonotic spillover risk.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092742

Yet, deciphering their molecular language - that is, understanding how protein sequences and structures encode and determine biological functions - remains a cornerstone challenge in modern biology. Here, we introduce Evola, an 80 billion frontier protein-language generative model designed to decode the molecular language of proteins. By integrating information from protein sequences, structures, and user queries, Evola generates precise and contextually nuanced insights into protein function. A key innovation of Evola lies in its training on an unprecedented AI-generated dataset: 546 million protein question-answer pairs and 150 billion word tokens, designed to reflect the immense complexity and functional diversity of proteins. Post-pretraining, Evola integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to refine the model based on preference signals and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for external knowledge incorporation, improving response quality and relevance. To evaluate its performance, we propose a novel framework, Instructional Response Space (IRS), demonstrating that Evola delivers expert-level insights, advancing research in proteomics and functional genomics while shedding light on the molecular logic encoded in proteins.

Here, we extend a new class of biosensors for receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity, the pYtag system, to visualize endogenous RTK activity in Drosophila. We build biosensors for three Drosophila RTKs that function across developmental stages and tissues. By characterizing Torso::pYtag during terminal patterning in the early embryo, we find that Torso activity differs from downstream ERK activity in two surprising ways: Torso activity is narrowly restricted to the poles but produces a broader gradient of ERK, and Torso activity decreases over developmental time while ERK activity is sustained. This decrease in Torso activity is driven by ERK pathway-dependent negative feedback. Our results suggest an updated model of terminal patterning where a narrow domain of Torso activity, tuned in amplitude by negative feedback, locally activates signaling effectors which diffuse through the syncytial embryo to form the ERK gradient. Altogether, this work highlights the usefulness of pYtags for investigating receptor-level regulation of developmental patterning.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092742

It is debated whether M1 actively participates in generating the activity pattern or it only passively reflects patterned inputs. Furthermore, it is unclear whether this learned activity pattern causally drives the learned movement. We addressed these issues using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging combined with holographic optogenetic stimulation of specific ensembles of M1 L2/3 neurons in mice engaged in a skilled lever-press task. We briefly and synchronously stimulated ~20 neurons whose activity onset in voluntary trials precedes movement onsets. This stimulation, despite lacking temporal patterns, induced movements that resembled the learned movement, while producing spatiotemporal activity patterns in other M1 neurons not directly stimulated that resembled the activity during the voluntary learned movement. Trial-by-trial variability of optogenetically triggered population activity in the non-target neurons correlated with the variability in the induced movements. These trial-by-trial variabilities were predicted by the initial state of M1 population activity immediately preceding the optogenetic stimulation. Stimulation of the neurons whose activity followed voluntary movement onsets failed to induce the learned movement. Thus, the learned activity pattern in M1 L2/3 can be generated when the M1 network is prepared at the optimal initial state and receives precise triggering inputs, supporting the active role of M1 in learned activity generation. The resulting activity pattern then causally drives the learned movement.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092742

Recently, recurrent de novo variants in the U4 RNA, transcribed from the RNU4-2 gene, and in at least two other RNU genes were discovered to cause neurodevelopmental disorder. We detected inherited and de novo heterozygous variants in RNU4-2 (n.18_19insA and n.56T>C) and in four out of the five RNU6 paralogues (n.55_56insG and n.56_57insG) in 135 individuals from 62 families with non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a rare form of hereditary blindness. We show that these variants are recurrent among RP families and invariably cluster in close proximity within the three-way junction (between stem-I, the 5 stem-loop and stem-II) of the U4/U6 duplex, affecting its natural conformation. Interestingly, this region binds to numerous splicing factors of the tri-snRNP complex including PRPF3, PRPF8 and PRPF31, previously associated with RP as well. The U4 and U6 variants identified seem to affect snRNP biogenesis, namely the U4/U6 di-snRNP, which is an assembly intermediate of the tri-snRNP. Based on the number of positive cases observed, deleterious variants in RNU4-2 and in RNU6 paralogues could be a significant cause of isolated or dominant RP, accounting for up to 1.2% of all undiagnosed RP cases. This study highlights the role of non-coding genes in rare Mendelian disorders and uncovers pleiotropy in RNU4-2, where different variants underlie neurodevelopmental disorder and RP.","NA","medrxiv",1736374092742

When the reward location changed on a trial-by-trial basis, inducing expected uncertainty, a greater proportion of place cells followed along, and the reward and the track end became anchors of a warped spatial metric. When the reward location then unexpectedly moved, the fraction of reward place cells that followed was greater when starting from a state of expected, compared to low, uncertainty.

Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) are a major class of plant Ca2+ channels, with 20 homologs in Arabidopsis. These tetrameric plasma membrane (PM) proteins are activated by diverse stimuli, such as phytohormones, extracellular damage and cell wall integrity signals. Here, we identify a novel class of plant-specific proteins, Armadillo Repeat Only (ARO), as essential regulators of possibly all plant CNGC channels. Abrogation of functional sporophytic AROs results in a phenotypic pattern reminiscent of CNGC dysfunction, including defects in root gravitropism, root hair growth and morphology, stomatal movement, and responses to extracellular ATP and the phytohormone auxin. aro2/3/4 mutants are fully resistant to the toxic effects caused by overexpression of CNGCs. AROs colocalize and physically interact with multiple CNGCs and modulate CNGC-dependent currents in Xenopus oocytes.

While mechanisms preventing oxidative damage to membrane phospholipids are established, the vulnerability of LD neutral lipids to peroxidation and protective mechanisms are unknown. Here, we identify LD-localized Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1 (FSP1) as a critical regulator that prevents neutral lipid peroxidation by recycling coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) to its lipophilic antioxidant form. Lipidomics reveal that FSP1 loss leads to the accumulation of oxidized triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters, and biochemical reconstitution of FSP1 with CoQ10 and NADH suppresses triacylglycerol peroxidation in vitro. Notably, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich triacylglycerols enhance cancer cell sensitivity to FSP1 loss and inducing PUFA-rich LDs triggers triacylglycerol peroxidation and LD-initiated ferroptosis when FSP1 activity is impaired. These findings uncover the first LD lipid quality control pathway, wherein LD-localized FSP1 maintains neutral lipid integrity to prevent the buildup of oxidized lipids and induction of ferroptosis.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092742

Here we introduce a comprehensive database of 3.6 billion tandem repeat allele sequences from over one thousand individuals using HiFi long-read sequencing. We show that the previously identified pathogenic loci are among the most variable tandem repeat loci in the genome, when incorporating nucleotide resolution sequence content to measure the longest pure motif segment. More broadly, we introduce a novel measure, ""tandem repeat constraint"", that assists in distinguishing potentially pathogenic from benign loci. Our approach of measuring variation as ""the length of the longest pure segment"" successfully prioritizes pathogenic repeats within their previously published linkage regions. We also present evidence for two novel pathogenic repeat expansion candidates. In summary, this analysis significantly clarifies the potential for short tandem repeat pathogenicity at over 1.7 million tandem repeat loci and will aid the identification of disease-causing repeat expansions.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092742

Current methods for quantifying bacterial biomass in stool, such as flow cytometry, qPCR, or spike-ins (i.e., adding cells or DNA from an organism not normally found in a sample), can be labor-intensive, costly, and confounded by factors like water content, DNA extraction efficiency, PCR inhibitors, and other technical challenges that add bias and noise. We propose a simple, cost-effective approach that circumvents some of these technical challenges: directly estimating bacterial biomass from metagenomes using bacterial-to-host (B:H) read ratios. We compare B:H ratios to the standard methods outlined above, demonstrating that B:H ratios are useful proxies for bacterial biomass in stool and possibly in other host-associated substrates. We show how B:H ratios can be used to track antibiotic treatment response and recovery in both mice and humans, which showed 403-fold and 45-fold reductions in bacterial biomass during antibiotic treatment, respectively. Our results indicate that host and bacterial metagenomic DNA fractions in human stool fluctuate longitudinally around a stable mean in healthy individuals, and the average host read fraction varies across healthy individuals by < 9 fold. B:H ratios offer a convenient alternative to other absolute biomass quantification methods, without the need for additional measurements, experimental design considerations, or machine learning algorithms, enabling retrospective absolute biomass estimates from existing stool metagenomic data.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092742

Methodological uncertainties currently limit the interpretability of non-invasive, extracranial traveling wave data, sparking debates about their cortical origin. Studies using EEG or MEG typically report waves that cover large portions of the sensor array which are often interpreted as reflecting long range cortical waves. Meanwhile, invasive, intracranial recordings in humans and animals routinely find both local, mesoscopic waves and large scale, macroscopic waves in cortex. Whether the global sensor-array waves found with EEG/MEG necessarily correspond to macroscopic cortical waves or whether they are merely projections of local dynamics remains unclear. In this study, we made use of the well-established retinotopic organization of early visual cortex to generate traveling waves with known properties in human participants (N=19, m/f) via targeted visual stimulation, while simultaneously recording MEG and EEG. The inducer stimuli were designed to elicit waves whose traveling direction in mesoscopic retinotopic visual areas depends on stimulus direction, while leaving macroscopic activation patterns along the visual hierarchy largely unchanged. We observed that the preferred direction of traveling waves across the sensor array was influenced by that of the visual stimulus, but only at the stimulation frequency. Comparison between single-trial and trial-averaged responses further showed considerable temporal variation in traveling wave patterns across trials. Our results highlight that under tight experimental control, non-invasive, extracranial recordings can recover mesoscopic traveling wave activity, thus making them viable tools for the investigation of spatially constrained wave dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092742

Furthermore, by combining the CLiB assay with next-generation sequencing, allowing the analysis of more than 10,000 clones in parallel, we identified novel variants with enhanced binding to phosphatidylinositol phosphates and uncovered a common structural feature: a positively charged pocket necessary for binding, formed by the three loop regions.

Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are mosquito-borne diseases of major human concern. Differential diagnosis is complicated in children and adolescents by their overlapping clinical features (signs, symptoms, and complete blood count results). Few studies have directly compared the three diseases. We assessed clinical features of cases aged 2-17 years experiencing these diseases. Methods. We characterized 1,405 dengue, 517 chikungunya, and 522 Zika pediatric cases occurring from January 2006 through December 2023 in a Nicaraguan cohort study. Clinical records and laboratory results across the first 10 days of illness were examined from a primary care health center. All cases were laboratory-confirmed. Data were analyzed with generalized additive models, generalized mixed models, and machine learning models. Findings. The prevalence of many clinical features exhibited by dengue, chikungunya, and Zika cases differed substantially overall, by age, and by day of illness. Dengue cases were differentiated most by abdominal pain, leukopenia, nausea/vomiting, and basophilia; chikungunya cases were differentiated most by arthralgia and the absence of leukopenia and papular rash; and Zika cases were differentiated most by rash and lack of fever and lymphocytopenia. Dengue and chikungunya cases exhibited similar temperature dynamics during acute illness, and their temperatures were higher than Zika cases. Sixty-two laboratory-confirmed afebrile dengue cases, which would not be captured by any widely used international case definition, presented very similarly to afebrile Zika cases, though some exhibited warning signs of disease severity. The presence of arthralgia, the presence of basophilia, and the absence of fever were the most important model-based predictors of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika, respectively. Interpretations. These findings substantially update our understanding of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in children while identifying various clinical features that could improve differential diagnoses. The occurrence of afebrile dengue warrants reconsideration of current case definitions. Funding.

However, continued surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines is important to ensure the safety of newly formulated vaccines. This study evaluated the association between vaccination with 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccines and multiple health outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older in the United States.

MethodsThe study used health plan data from the Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) claims database and extended from September 2023 to April 2024. We monitored the uptake of 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax), and where case counts were available, we used a self-controlled case series design to assess the association between vaccination and prespecified health outcomes. We used conditional Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs), attributable risks (ARs) and corresponding 99% confidence intervals (CIs). Analyses were adjusted for outcome seasonality, event-dependent observation time for outcomes with high case fatality rates, and outcome misclassification where feasible.

ResultsApproximately 7.6 million Medicare FFS beneficiaries received a 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccination. There was an even distribution of people who received Pfizer-BioNTech (3,689,356; 48.80%) or Moderna (3,841,245; 50.80%) vaccinations and very few who received Novavax (30,171; 0.40%). There was a statistically significant elevation in anaphylaxis risk associated with 2023-2024 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in the seasonality-adjusted analysis (IRR: [99% CI: 1.07, 15.30]) that was no longer statistically significant after accounting for potential outcome misclassification (IRR: 3.90 [99% CI: 0.49, 30.90]). Anaphylaxis cases attributable to 2023-2024 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination were rare (AR per 100,000 doses: 0.09 [99% CI: -0.08, 0.25]). No other statistically significant elevations in risk were observed.

ConclusionThere were no new safety signals identified following 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccinations among U.S. Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. A potential, but rare, elevation in anaphylaxis incidence rates following 2023-2024 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination was observed.

In plants, centromeres are loaded with CENH3-variant nucleosomes, which direct kinetochore formation and spindle microtubule interaction. Plant centromeres are frequently composed of megabase-scale satellite repeat arrays, or retrotransposon nests. In monocentric genomes, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, extended regions of pericentromeric heterochromatin surround the CENH3-occupied satellite arrays. A zone of suppressed meiotic crossover recombination contains the centromere and extends into the pericentromeres. Here, we explore how Arabidopsis natural genetic variation influences centromere-proximal crossover frequency, and segregation distortion through meiosis, when homologous centromeres are structurally heterozygous.

ResultsWe used fluorescent crossover reporters to survey the effect of natural variation on centromere-proximal recombination in twelve F1 hybrids, capturing Arabidopsis Eurasian and relict diversity. The majority of F1 hybrids showed either elevated or suppressed centromere-proximal crossovers (49 of 60), relative to inbreds. We relate hybrid crossover frequencies to patterns of centromeric structural variation, and in a subset of accessions, to epigenetic patterns of CENH3 loading and DNA methylation. The fluorescent reporters also allow segregation distortion through meiosis to be compared between inbred and hybrid strains. We observed a minority of hybrids (18 of 60) with distorted segregation through meiosis compared to inbreds, with and without simultaneous change to centromere-proximal crossover frequency.

ConclusionsWe reveal a complex relationship between centromere structural variation, epigenetic state, crossover recombination, and segregation distortion. We propose a model for how Arabidopsis centromere structural heterozygosity may cause segregation distortion during female meiosis.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092742

Using high-throughput dilution-to-extinction cultivation, we isolated and genome sequenced five new and diverse SAR116 isolates from the northern Gulf of Mexico. Here we present a comparative physiological analysis of these SAR116 isolates, along with a pangenomic investigation of the SAR116 clade using a combination of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs, n=258), single-amplified genomes (SAGs, n=84), previously existing (n=2), and new isolate genomes (n=5), totaling 349 SAR116 genomes. Phylogenomic investigation supported the division of SAR116 into three distinct subclades, each with additional structure totalling 15 monophyletic groups. Our SAR116 isolates belonged to three groups within subclade I representing distinct genera with different morphologies and varied phenotypic responses to salinity and temperature. Overall, SAR116 genomes encoded differences in vitamin and amino acid synthesis, trace metal transport, and osmolyte synthesis and transport. They also had genetic potential for diverse sulfur oxidation metabolisms, placing SAR116 at the confluence of the organic and inorganic sulfur pools. SAR116 subclades showed distinct patterns in habitat preferences across open ocean, coastal, and estuarine environments, and three of our isolates represented the most abundant coastal and estuarine subclade. This investigation provides the most comprehensive exploration of SAR116 to date anchored by new culture genomes and physiology.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092742

However, as single-cell FMs begin to train on increasingly large corpora, significant privacy and ethical concerns arise. Moreover, unlike text data, single-cell data is unordered and exhibits a unique tabular structure that most existing single-cell FMs overlook. In this study, we propose Tabula, a privacy-preserving and tabular-structure aware FM designed with federated learning (FL) and tabular modeling. Tabula combines the advantages of FMs and FL, enabling collaborative model training across multiple clients without compromising data privacy. In contrast to earlier single-cell FMs--which treat single-cell data like natural language (viewing cells as ""words"" defined by genes)--Tabula introduces a novel pretraining strategy that explicitly models the tabular structure of single-cell data. Extensive experimental results show that Tabula outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various downstream tasks (including cell type annotation, gene imputation, gene perturbation, multi-batch integration, and multi-omics integration) while requiring only half the data for pretraining and preserving data privacy. Furthermore, Tabula accurately reveals pairwise and even combinatorial regulatory logic across diverse biological systems, including hematopoiesis, pancreatic endogenesis, neurogenesis, and cardiogenesis. Thus, Tabula provides a new foundation model that explicitly incorporates the tabular nature of single-cell data alongside FL, paving the way for creating a ""virtual cell"" for human health under critical privacy preservation.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092742

We show that the interplay between pbla and pConj influences their co-occurrence and the spread of pbla in the gonococcal population. We demonstrate that pbla was acquired by the gonococcus on at least two occasions from Haemophilus ducreyi, and describe the subsequent evolutionary pathways taken by the three major pbla variants. Changes that mitigate fitness costs of pbla and the emergence of TEM beta-lactamases which confer increased resistance have contributed to the success of pbla. In particular, TEM-135, which has arisen in certain pbla variants, increases resistance to beta-lactams and only requires one amino acid change to become an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). The evolution of pbla underscores the threat of plasmid-mediated resistance to current therapeutic and preventive strategies against gonococcal infection. Given the close relationship between pbla and pConj, widespread use of Doxy-PEP is likely to promote spread of pConj and pbla, and emergence of plasmid-mediated ESBL in the gonococcus, with dire public health consequences.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092742

Here we establish Phage-Assisted Non-Continuous Selection of Protein Binders (PANCS-binders), an in vivo selection platform that links the life cycle of M13 phage to target protein binding though customized proximity-dependent split RNA polymerase biosensors, allowing for complete and comprehensive high-throughput screening of billion-plus member protein variant libraries with high signal-to-noise.

These selections yielded large, high-quality datasets and hundreds of novel binders, which we showed can be affinity matured or directly used in mammalian cells to inhibit or degrade targets.

Lsr2 is a nucleoid-associated protein that interacts with DNA in vivo and regulates many genes. Purified Lsr2 forms nucleoprotein filaments with DNA molecules leading to highly compacted DNA conformations. However, the physical mechanism underlying Lsr2-mediated DNA compaction, resulting in gene regulation, remains elusive. We employed a combination of biochemical assay, single-molecule imaging, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the governing principles of Lsr2-mediated DNA compaction. We show that, while Lsr2 alone undergoes phase separation, addition of DNA substantially lowers the required concentration for its phase separation. Strikingly, our single-molecule and simulation data establish that Lsr2 forms condensates with long stretches of AT-rich DNA, providing strong evidence for sequence-dependent co-condensation. This observation is contrary to the classical view of sequence-dependent binding of individual protein molecules to DNA, our findings rather suggest that protein-DNA co-condensates 'sense' the average binding energy landscape.

Together with slow oscillations (SOs), they are thought to play a mechanistic role in the consolidation of learned information. The quantity and spatial distribution of spindles has been linked to brain activity during learning before sleep and to memory performance after sleep. If spindles are drawn to cortical areas excited through pre-sleep learning tasks, this begs the question whether the spatial distribution of spindles is flexible, and whether their regional expression can also be manipulated with experimental brain stimulation. We used excitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to stimulate the left and right motor cortex in a repeated-measures experimental design. After stimulation, we recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep to test how local stimulation modulated the regional expression of sleep spindles. Indeed, we show that excitatory tDCS of local cortical sites before sleep biases the expression of spindles to the excited locations during subsequent sleep. No effects of localised tDCS excitation were seen for SOs. These results demonstrate that the spatial topography of sleep spindles is neither hard-wired nor random, with spindles being flexibly directed to exogenously excited cortical circuits.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092742

We found that signal correlations predict future noise correlations, suggesting that stimulus-induced co-activation leads to increased effective connectivity between neuron pairs. Moreover, simple linear network models were able to account for the observed temporal dependencies between signal and noise correlations, but only if both Hebbian-like plasticity and stochastic changes of either inputs or recurrent synapses contribute to representational drift.

Machine learning-based protein engineering provides a powerful solution to efficiently generate Cas protein variants tailored to recognize specific PAMs. Here, we present Protein2PAM, an evolution-informed deep learning model trained on a dataset of over 45,000 CRISPR-Cas PAMs. Protein2PAM rapidly and accurately predicts PAM specificity directly from Cas proteins across Type I, II, and V CRISPR-Cas systems. Using in silico deep mutational scanning, we demonstrate that the model can identify residues critical for PAM recognition in Cas9 without utilizing structural information. As a proof of concept for protein engineering, we employ Protein2PAM to computationally evolve Nme1Cas9, generating variants with broadened PAM recognition and up to a 50-fold increase in PAM cleavage rates compared to the wild-type under in vitro conditions. This work represents the first successful application of machine learning to achieve customization of Cas enzymes for alternate PAM recognition, paving the way for personalized genome editing.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092742

However, due to the non-linear relationship between disease liability and disease prevalence, risk variants have more severe phenotypic consequences in high-risk polygenic backgrounds. Consequently, selecting individuals with appropriate polygenic backgrounds may improve variant characterization experiments, as disease-relevant phenotypes may be masked or revealed in different genomic contexts. Simultaneously, selection has limited power to eliminate risk variants because they have minimal impact in low polygenic risk backgrounds, yet is more powerful with higher polygenicity because more individuals achieve genetic and phenotypic extremes. This dependence on polygenic background means that selection acting on an allele should be modeled as a distribution that differs across populations, time, environments, and individuals rather than as a single value. Overall, considering polygenic backgrounds will be critical when investigating the origins of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

TFs and Mediator contain intrinsically-disordered regions (IDRs) and form phase-separated condensates, but how IDRs control RNAPII function remains poorly understood. Using purified PIC factors, we developed a Real-time In-vitro Fluorescence Transcription assay (RIFT) for second-by-second visualization of RNAPII transcription at hundreds of promoters simultaneously. We show rapid RNAPII activation is IDR-dependent, without condensate formation. For example, the MED1-IDR can functionally replace a native TF, activating RNAPII with similar (not identical) kinetics; however, MED1-IDR squelches transcription as a condensate, but activates as a single-protein. TFs and Mediator cooperatively activate RNAPII bursting and re-initiation and surprisingly, Mediator can drive TF-promoter recruitment, without TF-DNA binding. Collectively, RIFT addressed questions largely intractable with cell-based methods, yielding mechanistic insights about IDRs, condensates, enhancer-promoter communication, and RNAPII bursting that complement live-cell imaging data.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

Recent work has implicated three brain areas in posterior cerebral cortex - the place memory areas (PMAs) that are anterior to the three visual scene perception areas (SPAs) - in this function. However, PMAs' relationship to the broader cortical hierarchy remains unclear due to limited group-level characterization. Here, we examined the PMA and SPA locations across three fMRI datasets (44 participants, 29 female). SPAs were identified using a standard visual localizer where participants viewed scenes versus faces. PMAs were identified by contrasting activity when participants recalled personally familiar places versus familiar faces (Datasets 1-2) or places versus multiple categories (familiar faces, bodies, and objects, and famous faces; Dataset 3). Across datasets, the PMAs were located anterior to the SPAs on the ventral and lateral cortical surfaces. The anterior displacement between PMAs and SPAs was highly reproducible. Compared to public atlases, the PMAs fell at the boundary between externally-oriented networks (dorsal attention) and internally-oriented networks (default mode). Additionally, while SPAs overlapped with retinotopic maps, the PMAs were consistently located anterior to mapped visual cortex. These results establish the anatomical position of the PMAs at inflection points along the cortical hierarchy between unimodal sensory and transmodal, apical regions, which informs broader theories of how the brain integrates perception and memory for scenes. We have released probabilistic parcels of these regions to facilitate future research into their roles in spatial cognition.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

We find that different CAR/antigen sizes, which are generated by different CAR architectures and different target antigens, require a different CD2/CD58 size to optimise sensitivity. This extracellular size-matching improves antigen engagement and co-localisation of CAR/antigen and CD2/CD58 complexes. We also find that size-matching controls co-inhibition of CARs by PD-1/PD-L1.

This was echoed in Prof. Rita Conti's September 17, 2024, Senate Finance Committee testimony. Methods: To test the IRA's impacts on early-stage investments targeting therapeutics for the Medicare-aged population, a longitudinal dataset of commercially sponsored clinical trials by companies with a market valuation < $2 billion was obtained from the BioMedTracker database from January 1, 2018, to May 6, 2024. These trials were filtered to match early-stage investments to lead assets undergoing clinical development. Results: From 161 lead assets with 897 investments, we find the aggregated total into large molecules in 2024 was 10 times larger than that for small molecules, which underwent a 70% decline after passage of the IRA. Individual investments made into small molecules decline by minus one-half as exposure to the Medicare-aged population increases after the passage of the IRA (p < 0.0018). Testing large molecule investments by their exposure to Medicare post IRA's passage is statistically inconclusive. Research Conclusions: This study presents evidence of a decline in the development of new therapies targeting the Medicare-aged population since the passage of the IRA. If these impacts were due to the economic downturn post-pandemic, we would observe statistically similar results in both large and small molecules. However, the results by molecule type diverge. Investors perceive large molecules to be of a lower investment risk relative to small molecules after IRA's passage.","NA","medrxiv",1736374092743

Cardiovascular involvement is frequently reported in LC, often accompanied by a spectrum of related symptoms. Dysregulated lipid profiles and elevated atherogenic indices have been implicated in LC, yet no comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis has specifically addressed these biomarkers.

ObjectiveThis study aims to systematically evaluate atherogenic indices and lipid-related biomarkers in individuals with LC compared to healthy controls.

MethodsA systematic search was conducted in databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, SCOPUS, and SciFinder from September to November 2024. Eligible studies reported lipid biomarker data for LC patients and controls, yielding 44 studies encompassing 8,114 participants (3,353 LC patients and 4,761 controls).

ResultsLC patients exhibited significant elevations in Castelli Risk Indexes 1 (standardized mean difference, SMD = 0.199; 95% confidence intervals, CI: 0.087-0.312) and 2 (SMD = 0.202; 95% CI: 0.087-0.318). Atherogenic ratios, including triglyceride (TG)/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (SMD = 0.294; 95% CI: 0.155-0.433), (TG + low-density lipoprotein, LDL + very low-density lipoprotein, VLDL)/(HDL + apolipoprotein, ApoA) (SMD = 0.264; 95% CI: 0.145-0.383), and ApoB/ApoA (SMD = 0.515; 95% CI: 0.233-0.796), were also significantly elevated. Additionally, LC patients demonstrated increased levels of LDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and ApoB, alongside reduced HDL and ApoA levels. Results were free from publication bias.

ConclusionLC is associated with a pro-atherogenic lipid profile, marked by increased atherogenic components and decreased protective lipid biomarkers. These findings highlight a potential heightened risk for cardiovascular complications in LC patients, warranting further clinical and mechanistic investigations.","NA","medrxiv",1736374092743

Of the associated RNA-guided Cas effector nucleases, Cas12a2 stands out as the only known example exhibiting RNA-triggered collateral cleavage of three distinct substrates: single-stranded (ss)RNA, ssDNA, and double-stranded (ds)DNA. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of collateral cleavage, including which of these activities dominates during the Cas12a2-mediated immune response. Here, we show that Cas12a2 cleaves collateral DNA substrates over RNA substrates, even when RNA substrates are more abundant. This preference relies on a positive cooperativity mechanism that requires the four ""aromatic clamp"" residues that stabilize unwound and distorted dsDNA in the RuvC nuclease active site. Leveraging the cleavage preference for collateral DNA, we demonstrate that RNA-activated Cas12a2 can cleave a ssDNA probe in the presence of high concentrations of non-target RNA, while the RNA-targeting Cas13a cannot. This work thus reveals how Cas12a2 decides amongst different collateral cleavage substrates, with immediate implications for understanding Cas12a2-based immunity, improving molecular diagnostics, and laying a mechnastic foundation for future Cas12a2-based technologies.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

After predicting their interaction using an in-silico model, we verified the direct interaction between ANGPTL3 and PCSK9 through co-immunoprecipitation. The ANGPTL3-PCSK9 complex persisted under fasting conditions and dissociated under feeding conditions. Treatment with human LDLs was sufficient to simulate the feeding response. Then, we observed that the overexpression of PCSK9 enhances the uptake of LDLs that are not further metabolized, while the overexpression of ANGPTL3 enhances LDL turnover. The overexpression of both proteins restored LDL uptake and degradation, which became comparable to those of control cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate the existence of an ANGPTL3-PCSK9 complex, which coordinately contributes to the regulation of intracellular lipid homeostasis, aiming to prevent cellular metabolic overload.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

A critical aspect of this defence relies on regulatory mechanisms that control the activation of immune responses, ensuring these are efficient yet do not compromise overall plant performance. Many pathogens secrete proteins called effectors to manipulate plant cellular functions, suppressing plant immunity and promoting infection. Here, we show that the bacterial effector RipAV, secreted by the soil-borne bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, hijacks a major immune signalling hub to suppress immune responses. RipAV targets members of the plant-specific ubiquitin ligase (PUB) family and calcium-dependent protein kinase 28 (CPK28), which has been shown to phosphorylate a set of PUBs to enhance their activity and regulate the stability of the key immune regulator BIK1. RipAV association enhances the CPK28-mediated phosphorylation of PUBs, inducing the proteasome-mediated degradation of BIK1 and the suppression of immunity. Importantly, we found that RipAV is required for maintaining a low accumulation of BIK1 during a R. solanacearum infection. These findings provide new insights into the sophisticated strategies employed by pathogens to subvert plant immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

This process is known as higher-order conditioning and can be measured using sensory preconditioning tasks in rodents. This behavioral paradigm requires the repeated and simultaneous presentation of two low-salience stimuli, such as a light and a tone, followed by a devaluation phase where one stimulus is paired with an unconditioned stimulus, such as a mild footshock. The outcome is a conditioned response (i.e. freezing response) to both the conditioned stimulus (direct learning) and the non-conditioned stimulus (mediated learning). In our study, we set up a successful light-tone sensory preconditioning task in male and female mice. Sex differences were seen on the number of conditioning sessions required to acquire mediated learning and in the behavioral responses observed in certain control experimental groups. We used in vivo calcium imaging to characterize the activity of hippocampal neurons in the dorsal and ventral subregions of the hippocampus when associations between low-salience stimuli and reinforcers occur. Finally, we combined our sensory preconditioning task with chemogenetic approaches to assess the role of these two hippocampal subregions in mediated learning.

Most carbon fixation in these systems is thought to be driven by plant and microbial photosynthesis, whereas chemosynthetic processes are assumed to play a minor role. However, these ecosystems often contain anoxic environments ideal for chemosynthetic microbes such as acetogens. Here, we show that acetogens are abundant and active mediators of carbon sequestration in tidal wetland soils by pairing gene- and genome-resolved metagenomic analysis with isolation and analysis of gas-fermenting acetogens in bioreactors. Metagenomic profiling revealed that diverse microbes can mediate carbon fixation, primarily through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle and Wood-Ljungdahl pathways. These include various bacteria and archaea capable of reductive acetogenesis. On this basis, we grew bacterial enrichment cultures from tidal wetland soils using the gases hydrogen and CO2 as the sole energy and carbon sources. Bioreactor analysis revealed that these enrichments are dominated by clostridial acetogens that grow rapidly by converting CO2 into acetate and other products. Collectively, these results reveal Blue Carbon ecosystems harbour communities that can exclusively subsist by using CO2 as their sole electron acceptor and for carbon fixation, thereby providing evidence of a novel carbon sink pathway within these ecosystems beyond the known mechanisms of photosynthetic carbon fixation and soil sequestration. Additionally, the discovery and isolation of these chemosynthetic communities provide opportunities for developing further mechanisms of CO2 removal through industrial gas fermentation.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

In the post-synthetic steps specific to ergosterol biosynthesis, we find that successive modifications act to oscillate ordering capacity, settling on a level that supports phase separation while retaining fluidity of the resulting domains. Simulations carried out with each intermediate showed how conformers in the sterols alkyl tail are capable of modulating long-range ordering of phospholipids, which could underlie changes in phase behavior.

Here, we develop a systematic approach to discover CES drivers as hotspots of human de novo mutation.

The fusion process is driven by a large-scale conformational change in F, switching irreversibly from the metastable prefusion state to the stable postfusion conformation. Previous research has identified six distinct antigenic sites in RSV-F, termed sites O, I, II, III, IV, and V. Of these, only antigenic site I is fully specific to the postfusion conformation of F. A monoclonal antibody 131-2a that specifically targets postfusion F has been widely used as a research tool to probe for postfusion F and to define antigenic site I in serological studies, yet its sequence and precise epitope have remained unknown. Here we use mass spectrometry-based de novo sequencing of 131-2a to reverse engineer a recombinant product and study the epitope to define antigenic site I with molecular detail, revealing the structural basis for the antibodys specificity towards postfusion RSV-F.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

Here, we address this question using a multi-omic approach that integrates super-resolution imaging and metabolic analyses to profile macrophages from a mouse model of mitochondrial disease arising from a heteroplasmic mutation (m.5019A>G) in the mitochondrial tRNA for alanine7. These m.5019A>G macrophages exhibit defects in respiratory chain complexes and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) due to decreased intra-mitochondrial translation. To adapt to this metabolic stress, mitochondrial fusion, reductive glutamine metabolism, and aerobic glycolysis are all increased. Upon inflammatory activation, type I interferon (IFN-I) release is enhanced, while the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxylipins are restrained in m.5019A>G macrophages. Finally, an in vivo endotoxemia model using m.5019A>G mice reveal elevated IFN-I levels and sickness behaviour.

However, most underlying gene discovery efforts have focused on individuals of European ancestry, limiting insights into genetic risks across diverse populations. To help address this, the Genomics of Autism in Latin American Ancestries Consortium (GALA) was formed, presenting here the largest sequencing study of ASD in Latin American individuals (n>15,000). We identified 35 genome-wide significant (FDR < 0.05) ASD risk genes, with substantial overlap with findings from European cohorts, and highly constrained genes showing consistent signal across populations. The results provide support for emerging (e.g., MARK2, YWHAG, PACS1, RERE, SPEN, GSE1, GLS, TNPO3, ANKRD17) and established ASD genes, and for the utility of genetic testing approaches for deleterious variants in diverse populations, while also demonstrating the ongoing need for more inclusive genetic research and testing. We conclude that the biology of ASD is universal and not impacted to any detectable degree by ancestry.

Previous studies have demonstrated that one dose of psilocybin leads to persisting neural and behavioral changes. The durability of psilocybins effects suggests that there are likely alterations of gene expression at the transcriptional level. In this study, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the dorsal medial frontal cortex of male and female mice. Samples were collected at 1, 2, 4, 24, or 72 hours after psilocybin or ketamine administration and from control animals. At baseline, major excitatory and GABAergic cell types selectively express particular serotonin receptor transcripts. The psilocybin-evoked differentially expressed genes in excitatory neurons were involved in synaptic plasticity, which were distinct from genes enriched in GABAergic neurons that contribute to mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism. The effect of psilocybin on gene expression was time-dependent, including an early phase at 1-2 hours followed by a late phase at 72 hours of transcriptional response after administration. Ketamine administration produced transcriptional changes that show a high degree of correlation to those induced by psilocybin. Collectively, the results reveal that psilocybin produces time-dependent and cell-type specific changes in gene expression in the medial frontal cortex, which may underpin the drugs long-term effects on neural circuits and behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

We evaluated the performance of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) guided by prompt instructions and chain of thought (CoT) for this task.

MethodsFrom consecutive transthoracic echocardiographies performed in our center, we utilized 200 random reports from 2019 for prompt optimization and 1000 from 2023 for evaluation. Five instruction-tuned LLMs (Qwen2.0-72B, Llama3.0-70B, Mixtral8-46.7B, Llama3.0-8B, and Phi3.0-3.8B) were guided by prompt instructions with and without CoT to classify prosthetic valve presence and VHD severity. Performance was evaluated using classification metrics against expert-labeled ground truth. Mean Squared Error (MSE) was also calculated for predicted severitys deviation from actual severity.

ResultsWith CoT prompting, Llama3.0-70B and Qwen2.0 achieved the highest performance (accuracy: 99.1% and 98.9% for VHD severity; 100% and 99.9% for prosthetic valve; MSE: 0.02 and 0.05, respectively). Smaller models showed lower accuracy for VHD severity (54.1-85.9%) but maintained high accuracy for prosthetic valve detection (>96%). CoT reasoning yielded higher accuracy for larger models while increasing processing time from 2-25 to 67-154 seconds per report. Based of CoT reasonings, the wrong predictions were mainly due to model outputs being influenced by irrelevant information in the text or failure to follow the prompt instructions.

ConclusionsOur study demonstrates the near-perfect performance of open-source LLMs for automated echocardiography report interpretation with purpose of registry formation and disease surveillance. While larger models achieved exceptional accuracy through prompt optimization, practical implementation requires balancing performance with computational efficiency.","NA","medrxiv",1736374092743

Here, we isolate the effect of electrostatics on the activity of a thermophilic PETase by rationally redesigning its surface charge, while preserving its thermodynamic properties. The enzyme variant, SfInv, shows orders of magnitude improvements in binding affinity and in activity towards untreated plastic films, with inverted morphological preference. When combined, the wildtype enzyme and SfInv act synergistically, revealing an entirely new mechanism for cooperative activities driven by complimentary electrostatic interactions at the PET surface. These findings highlight unexplored avenues in improving PETase function through the control of morphological preference or introduction of protein cooperativity by exploiting protein electrostatics.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

How changes in level of gene expression across the cerebral cortex influence cognitive ability remains unknown. Here, we tackle this by leveraging genomic deletions and duplications - copy number variants (CNVs) that fully encompass one or more genes expressed in the human cortex - which lead to large effects on gene-expression levels. We assigned genes to 180 regions of the human cerebral cortex based on their preferential expression across the cortex computed using data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. We aggregated CNVs in cortical regions, and ran a burden association analysis to compute the mean effect size of genes on general cognitive ability for each of the 180 regions. When affected by CNVs, most of the regional gene-sets were associated with lower cognitive ability. The spatial patterns of effect sizes across the cortex were correlated negatively between deletions and duplications. The largest effect sizes for deletions and duplications were observed for gene-sets with high expression in sensorimotor and association regions, respectively. These two opposing patterns of effect sizes were not influenced by intolerance to loss of function, demonstrating orthogonality to dosage-sensitivity scores. The same mirror patterns were also observed after stratifying genes based on cell types and developmental epochs markers. These results suggest that the effect size of gene dosage on cognitive ability follows a cortical gradient. The same brain region and corresponding gene-set may show different effects on cognition depending on whether variants increase or decrease transcription. The latter has major implications for the association of brain networks with phenotypes","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

In our pre-clinical model, sub-chronic stress exacerbated subsequently induced inflammatory pain and accelerated the development of comorbid anxiety. DNA methylation analysis of spinal cord tissue after stress exposure revealed hypomethylation in the Fkbp5 promoter site for the canonical FKBP51 transcript and other stress-related genes. However, most epigenetic changes in key regulatory regions did not correlate with changes in gene expression assessed by RNA sequencing, suggesting that stress exposure had remodeled the epigenome without altering gene activity and primed genes for hyper-responsiveness to future challenges. FKBP51 inhibition during stress exposure reduced the exacerbation of inflammatory pain by stress and reversed several stress-induced DNA methylation changes in promoter regions of genes associated with stress and nociception, including Rtn4, Cdk5 and Nrxn1, but not Fkbp5. These results indicate that sub-chronic stress leads to the hypomethylation of Fkbp5 and increased susceptibility to chronic pain driven by FKBP51, but reversing Fkbp5 hypomethylation is not necessary to prevent chronic pain vulnerability, which is likely driven by complex epigenetic regulation of multiple stress-regulated genes.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

In this study, we generated monoclonal antibodies from immunised cattle, primarily because of their ability to produce antibodies with ultra-long heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDRH3) domains. Such antibodies have been shown to have potent and cross-reactive neutralisation phenotypes in other virus infections. Following extended immunisation with different forms of spike protein and using single B-cell sorting and phage display techniques, we isolated 33 mAbs, including 10 with ultra-long CDRH3s (>50 amino acids). Of these, mAbs P7 and 99 exhibited remarkable neutralisation breadth and potency. Notably, mAb P7, which possessed an ultra-long CDRH3, neutralised all tested variants, including SARS-CoV-1, with IC50 values ranging from 0.01 {micro}g/mL to 1.06 {micro}g/mL. This antibody was also cross-reactive against a panel of RBDs from diverse sarbecovirus species. Structural studies revealed that mAb 99 targets a region of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein that overlaps with the ACE2 binding site. Although the structure of the P7 Fab-RBD complex was not resolvable, data suggest P7 induces trimer dissociation by binding to an occluded RBD epitope, likely mediated by the extended CDRH3 structure. Syrian hamster challenge experiments, using several VOCs, showed that mAbs P7 and 99 significantly reduced lung viral load. These findings highlight the potential of bovine-derived, especially those possessing ultra-long CDRH3s, as effective therapeutics against current and future sarbecovirus threats.

Furthermore, the evolution of this type of regeneration is enigmatic since it does not occur naturally. Here, we show that aggregate regeneration in Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus proceeds through several, consistent stages that include the formation of an epidermal layer, followed by migration, proliferation, and differentiation of adult pluripotent stem cells, known as i-cells. Migration of i-cells is controlled by sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed, surprisingly, that the newly regenerated individual derives nearly exclusively from i-cell progeny rather than from recycled somatic cells, as seen in other hydrozoans. Given the similarity of this phenomenon to embryogenesis, we propose that the ability of Hydractinia cell aggregates to regenerate is a side effect of the animal's i-cell-mediated development.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

However, few biocontainment strategies can support the longer-term microbial survival that may be desired in a target environment without repeated human intervention. Here, we introduce the concept of an orthogonal obligate commensalism for the autonomous creation of environments that are permissive for survival of a biocontained microbe. We engineer one microbe to produce a non-standard amino acid (nsAA), and we engineer synthetic auxotrophy in a second microbe via reliance on this nsAA for growth. We show that this obligate commensalism is highly effective, with the survival of our commensal organism during co-culture dependent on the presence of our producer strain. We also show that this commensalism is orthogonal to a small microbial consortium isolated from maize roots, with survival of the synthetic auxotroph conditional upon the presence of the nsAA-producing strain in the consortium. Overall, our study demonstrates a transition from a chemical to a biological dependence for biocontained organisms that could lay the groundwork for biocontained synthetic ecologies.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

While we have substantial knowledge of the molecular parts and rules of cytoskeletal assembly, we know less about how structures are remodeled, for example to interconvert centrioles from the ciliary base to the centrosome. To study this in an evolutionary context we use the chytrid fungus, Rhizoclosmatium globosum, a member of the zoosporic fungi which have centrioles and cilia, lost in other fungal lineages. Chytrids undergo reorganization of their microtubule cytoskeleton as they cycle from zoospore to multinucleated coenocyte. We use comparative bioinformatics, RNA sequencing, and expansion microscopy to map the microtubule cytoskeleton over the chytrid lifecycle. We find that when zoospores encyst, cilia are retracted into the cytoplasm and degraded, and centrioles detach but are protected from degradation. A shortened proximal centriole then forms the mitotic centrosome and ultimately elongates to form cilia at the end of the mitotic cycles, driven by a conserved transcriptional program. Thus, structural remodeling of the chytrid centriole is coupled temporally to ciliated stages rather than mitotic cycles, which may serve as a mechanism to tune microtubule organization to meet the needs of different lifecycle stages.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

The ability to orient towards sounds is a key component of social interactions, yet auditory spatial attention remains relatively understudied in ASD, despite some prior research indicating differences in this domain. Here, we investigate the neural signatures associated with passive auditory spatial attention in children with ASD (n = 21, ages 6-17) relative to age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children (n = 31), using source-localized magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants listened passively, while watching a silenced movie, to non-social auditory stimuli designed to either remain lateralized to one hemifield (""stay"" trials), or to change in location from one side to the contralateral hemifield (""jump"" trials). Linear mixed effect modeling showed decreased cortical activation in the auditory cortex in the ASD group in response to jump trials, relative to the TD group. Additionally, functional connectivity analyses showed increased alpha-band functional connectivity in the ASD group between auditory cortex seeds and frontoparietal regions known to be recruited during auditory spatial attention. Right prefrontal alpha-band connectivity estimates were associated with worse behaviorally assessed auditory processing scores and increased ASD symptomatology. Our results align with the hypothesis that auditory spatial attention generally, and specifically orientation to sounds even when experienced passively, differs in ASD individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

The best designed Kemp eliminase exhibits >140 mutations from any natural protein, high stability (>85 {degrees}C) and unprecedented catalytic efficiency (12,700 M-1s-1), surpassing previous computational designs by two orders of magnitude. We find that mutations both inside and outside the active site contribute synergistically to the high observed activity and stability. Mutation of an aromatic residue used in all prior Kemp eliminase designs increases efficiency to >105 M-1s-1. Our approach addresses critical limitations in design methodology, generating stable, high-efficiency, new-to-nature enzymes in complex folds and enables testing hypotheses on the fundamentals of biocatalysis through a limited experimental effort.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

An open question is how experience interacts with innate constraints to enable functional specialization. We investigate this question by comparing vOTC function across sighted and congenitally blind adults. In sighted adults, a region in lateral vOTC called the fusiform face area (FFA) responds preferentially to faces, whereas distinct left-lateralized portions of vOTC respond to written language 1,2,5-12. In blind people, lateral vOTC responds to face touching, braille and speech, but their functional co-localization has not been tested 13-16. The same group of congenitally blind adults (n=20) touched faces and spatial layouts (Experiment 1) and performed a reading (braille) and spoken language task (Experiment 2). Sighted adults performed analogous tasks in the visual modality (n=28). Using within subject analyses, we replicate the separation of faces and written language in sighted adults: written language responses are found only in left vOTC and within that hemisphere they are separate from faces. By contrast, left and right vOTC responds to language in people born blind and in the left hemisphere face and language responses overlap. These findings suggest that visual experience contributes to segregating responses to face and language in vOTC. Co-localization of face and language responses suggests an innate predisposition for communication-relevant processing in lateral vOTC.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

However, the impact of having a COVID-19 diagnosis on this trend is not known.

MethodsUsing longitudinal data from January 2019 to June 2023 collected by the US National Institute for Healths National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), children (age 2-18 years) with positive COVID-19 test results (n=11,474, 53% male, mean [SD] age 5.57 [{+/-}3.29] years, 54% white, mean [SD] 5.2 [{+/-}2.9] BMI observations per participants) were matched with COVID-19 negative children with identical demographic characteristics and similar observation window. We compared BMI percentile trajectories between the COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative cohorts, with further evaluation performed on COVID-19 positive patients stratified by hospitalization status.

ResultsCOVID-19 positive patients had a greater increase in %BMIp95 than COVID-19 negative patients (average increase of 2.34 ({+/-}7.73) compared to 1.46 ({+/-}6.09), p<0.0005). COVID-19 positive patients gained more weight after their diagnosis of COVID-19 than before. Non-hospitalized children gained more weight than hospitalized children (average increase in %BMIp95 of 2.38 ({+/-}7.65)) compared to 1.87 ({+/-}8.54)). Mixed effect regression analyses demonstrated that these associations remained even after adjusting for time, demographics, and baseline %BMIp95.

ConclusionsHaving a COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with more rapid weight gain, especially after diagnosis and early in the pandemic. Future research should explore the reasons for this association and the implications for future health emergencies.

Modification of pre-existing ligands with fragments that can alter the protein surface can lead to the creation of novel compounds ( targeted glues) able to induce neo-interactions between the target and an E3 ligase, resulting in targeted protein degradation. By screening a library of potential BRD9 targeted glue compounds, we have discovered a potent and selective, reversibly covalent BRD9 degrader, AMPTX-1. Co-immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry experiments demonstrated that cell treatment with AMPTX-1 induces selective recruitment of BRD9 to the E3 ligase DCAF16. Degradation is dependent on the engagement of the surface Cys58 of DCAF16 and formation of a covalent adduct to DCAF16 is facilitated by the ternary complex formation with BRD9. BRD9 degradation is achieved in vivo after oral dosing, demonstrating that covalent recruitment of DCAF16 is a viable strategy for targeted protein degradation and can be achieved with drug-like, orally bioavailable compounds with promising in vivo activity.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

However, it remains largely unclear how plants regulate their resistance to restrict bacterial infection in response to humidity. Here, we demonstrate that abscisic acid (ABA)-catabolizing ABA 8-hydroxylase, encoded by CYP707A3, plays a critical role in this resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Elevated humidity induces CYP707A3 expression, which is essential for reducing ABA levels and promoting stomatal opening, thereby limiting bacterial water-soaking and infection following leaf invasion. High humidity also increases cytosolic Ca2+ levels via the Ca2+ channels CNGC2 and CNGC4, with partial involvement from CNGC9, activating the calmodulin-binding transcription activator CAMTA3 to drive CYP707A3 induction. However, Pst DC3000 counteracts this defense response using type III secretion effectors, particularly AvrPtoB, facilitating water-soaking. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the competition between plants and bacteria for leaf water under elevated humidity.","NA","biorxiv",1736374092743

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1736374092743
