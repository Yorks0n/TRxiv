We investigated whether a diverse refugee committee could utilize participatory methods to identify health priorities and a research agenda to address them.

MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study with focus groups of current and former refugees, asylum claimants and evacuees from a specialized refugee clinic over a year. We collected sociodemographic data using standardized instruments, then utilized a four-step nominal group technique process (idea generation, recording, discussion, and voting) to identify and rank participants health and research priorities. Participants ranked their top five priorities across three time periods: Pre-migration/early arrival (0-3 months), post-migration (3 months-2 years), and long-term health (>2 years). Participants created overarching priorities and corroborated findings via a member checking step.

FindingsTwenty-three participants (median age 35 years) attended one or more of five focus groups. Twenty-one completed sociodemographic surveys: 16/21 (76%) were women, representing 8 countries of origin. Participants identified ""more family physicians"" and ""improving health system navigation"" (11/60 votes each) as top health and research priorities respectively across all resettlement periods. Participants also prioritized pre-departure healthcare system orientation and improved post-arrival and long-term mental health services. Twelve participants completed the member checking process, affirming the results with minor clarifications.

InterpretationThis proof-of-concept study illustrates how refugees can use a rigorous consensus process without external influence to prioritize their healthcare needs, direct a health research agenda to address those needs, and co-produce research. These low-cost participatory methods should be replicated elsewhere.

However, the systemic identification of these alleles has been challenging due to their scarcity in the general population. Here, we discovered and characterized rare coding alleles contributing to genetic dyslipidemia, a principal risk for coronary artery disease, among over a million individuals combining three large contemporary genetic datasets (Million Veteran Program, n = 634,535, UK Biobank, n = 431,178, and All Of Us Research Program, n = 92,304) totaling 1,158,017 multi-ancestral individuals. Unlike previous rare variant studies in lipids, this study included 238,243 individuals (20.6%) from non-European-like populations. Testing 2,997,401 rare coding variants from diverse backgrounds, we identified 800 exome-wide significant associations across 209 genes including 176 predicted loss of function and 624 missense variants. Among these exome-wide associations, 130 associations were driven by non-European-like populations. Associated alleles are highly enriched in functional variant classes, showed significant additive and recessive associations, exhibited similar effects across populations, and resolved pathogenicity for variants enriched in African or South-Asian populations. Furthermore, we identified 5 lipid-related genes associated with coronary artery disease (RORC, CFAP65, GTF2E2, PLCB3, and ZNF117). Among them, RORC is a potentially novel therapeutic target through the down regulation of LDLC by its silencing. This study provides resources and insights for understanding causal mechanisms, quantifying the expressivity of rare coding alleles, and identifying novel drug targets across diverse populations.","NA","medrxiv",1726783717450

Whether axolotls display epigenetic hallmarks of ageing remains unknown. Here, we probe the axolotl DNA methylome throughout lifespan and present its first epigenetic clocks. Both at tissue-specific or pan-tissue levels, the clocks are biphasic, capable of predicting age during early life but not for the rest of its lifespan. We show that axolotls exhibit evolutionarily conserved features of epigenetic ageing during early life, yet their methylome is remarkably stable across lifespan, including at Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) target sites, suggesting that this species deviates from known patterns of epigenetic ageing. Lastly, we uncover structure-specific rejuvenation events upon regeneration. This study provides molecular insights into negligible senescence and furthers our understanding of the interplay between regeneration and ageing.","NA","biorxiv",1726783717450

Here we draw on drug checking results from around the United States to report a rapid shift in the illicit drug supply with important implications for public health. Bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl) sebacate, or ""BTMPS"" is a hindered amine light stabilizer with various industrial applications. Animal studies indicate multiple kinds of adverse health effects.

MethodsDrug samples collected by community-based drug checking programs in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, along with drug residue samples from other jurisdictions in California, Delaware, Maryland, and Washington, were submitted to the National Institute on Standards and Technology. Samples were qualitatively tested with Direct Analysis in Real Time mass spectrometry, with reflex to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) for confirmatory testing. Quantitation - percent by mass - was performed using LCMS. At both sites where drug samples were collected, participants were asked to respond to a survey that included questions about what the substance was sold as and any unexpected effects.

ResultsBetween June 1, 2024 and August 31, 2024, a total of 178 samples sold as fentanyl were tested. Of these, 43 (24%) contained BTMPS, with the proportion per month rising from 0% in June to more than a third in August. An additional 23 residue samples from sites doing residue testing contained BTMPS. Fentanyl samples with BTMPS also contained many other compounds, including local anesthetics and alpha-2 agonists. Average fentanyl purity was significantly lower in samples with BTMPS compared to samples without.

ConclusionsThe introduction of an industrial chemical to the illicit drug supply at this speed and scale is unprecedented and concerning. Further research is urgently needed to determine why it is present in the fentanyl supply and characterize effects on human health.","NA","medrxiv",1726783717450

Lesions damaging these neural pathways result in weakness of key muscles causing dysarthria and dysphagia, leading to profound social isolation and risk of aspiration and suffocation. Here we show that Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the motor thalamus improved speech and swallowing functions in two participants with dysarthria and dysphagia. First, we proved that DBS increased excitation of the face motor cortex, augmenting motor evoked potentials, and range and speed of motion of orofacial articulators in n=10 volunteers with intact neural pathways. Then, we demonstrated that this potentiation led to immediate improvement in swallowing functions in a patient with moderate dysphagia and profound dysarthria as a consequence of a traumatic brain lesion. In this subject and in another with mild dysarthria, we showed that DBS immediately ameliorated impairments of respiratory, phonatory, resonatory, and articulatory control thus resulting in a clinically significant improvement in speech intelligibility. Our data provide first-in-human evidence that DBS can be used to treat dysphagia and dysarthria in people with cerebral lesions.","NA","medrxiv",1726783717450

Ultimately, the brain also must adopt appropriate choice behavior using reliability of these models. Here, we combined multiple experimental and computational approaches to quantify concurrent learning in monkeys performing tasks with different levels of uncertainty about the model of the environment. By comparing behavior in control monkeys and monkeys with bilateral lesions to the amygdala or ventral striatum, we found evidence for dynamic, competitive interaction between stimulus-based and action-based learning, and for a distinct role of the amygdala. Specifically, we demonstrate that the amygdala adjusts the initial balance between the two learning systems, thereby altering the interaction between arbitration and learning that shapes the time course of both learning and choice behaviors. This novel role of the amygdala can account for existing contradictory observations and provides testable predictions for future studies into circuit-level mechanisms of flexible learning and choice under uncertainty.","NA","biorxiv",1726783717450

MethodsThis study included all rheumatology RCTs published from 2009 to 2023. The gender of authors was determined using forenames and countries of affiliation via the gender API service. The percentage of women in RCT publications and its association with potential factors was assessed using generalized estimating equations, considering women gender as the main binary outcome and the RCTs continent, international collaboration status, industrial funding, intervention type, sample size, journal adherence to ICMJE recommendations, impact factor, publication year, authors non-academic affiliation, and author position as covariates.

ResultsAmong the 1,092 RCTs authored by 10,794 persons, women accounted for 34.1% of authors. Woman authorship was more frequent in African-based RCTs compared to North America, when the author had a non-academic affiliation and when the last author was a woman (1.83 [1.46, 2.29], +6.1 percentage points - pp). Woman authorship was less frequent in Asian and European-based RCTs, industry-funded RCTs (OR 0.64 [0.56-0.73]; -10.3pp). Women were less often in the last (0.63 [0.54-0.74]; -10.2 pp) and second to last author position (0.73 [0.62-0.85]; -7.3pp). There were no difference looking at international status or year of publication.

ConclusionThe overall presence of women authors was 34.1%. The stagnant year-over-year representation of women in RCTs, and the lower likelihood of a woman having a position as senior author, underscores the need for more effective strategies to bridge the gender gap. RCTs with a woman last author were more likely to have a woman first author, suggesting a potential role-model effect.","NA","medrxiv",1726783717450

Yet the mechanisms that allow host regulation of intracellular symbionts, a pre-requisite for stable endosymbiosis and subsequent organelle evolution, are largely unknown. Here, we describe an immune-like glycan-sensing/processing network, partly assembled through horizontal gene-transfers (HGTs), that enables Paramecium bursaria to control its green algal endosymbionts. Using phylogenetics, RNA-interference (RNAi), and metabolite exposure experiments, we show that P. bursaria regulates endosymbiont destruction using glycan-sensing/processing - a system that includes a eukaryotic-wide chitin-binding chitinase-like protein (CLP) localized to the host phago-lysosome. RNAi of CLP alters expression of eight host glycan-processing genes, including two prokaryote-derived HGTs, during endosymbiont destruction. Furthermore, glycan-sensing/processing dynamically regulates endosymbiont number in P. bursaria, plasticity crucial to maximize host fitness across ecological conditions. CLP is homologous to a human phagocyte-associated innate immune factor, revealing how immune functions can be alternatively adapted and expanded, partly through HGT, enabling endosymbiotic control.

As COVID-19 remains a threat, it is imperative to improve current forecasting approaches by incorporating reliable data and alternative forecasting targets to better inform decision-makers.

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a viable method to track COVID-19 transmission, offering a more reliable metric than reported cases for forecasting critical outcomes like hospitalizations. Recognizing the natural alignment of wastewater systems with city structures, ideal for leveraging WBE data, this study introduces a multi-city, wastewater-based forecasting model to categorically predict COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Using hospitalization and COVID-19 wastewater data for six US cities, accompanied by other epidemiological variables, we develop a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to generate two categorization types. The Hospitalization Capacity Risk Categorization (HCR) predicts the burden on the healthcare system based on the number of available hospital beds in a city. The Hospitalization Rate Trend (HRT) Categorization predicts the trajectory of this burden based on the growth rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Using these categorical thresholds, we create probabilistic forecasts to retrospectively predict the risk and trend category of six cities over a 20-month period for 1, 2, and 3 week forecasting windows.

We also propose a new methodology to measure forecasting model performance at change points, or time periods where sudden changes in outbreak dynamics occurred. We also explore the influence of wastewater as a predictor for hospitalizations, showing its inclusion positively impacts the models performance. With this categorical forecasting study, we are able to predict hospital capacity risk and disease trends in a novel and useful way, giving city decision-makers a new tool to predict COVID-19 hospitalizations.","NA","medrxiv",1726783717450

A significant contributor to this resurgence could be drug resistance, particularly the emergence of partial resistance to artemisinin (ArtR) in Ethiopia and other regions of Eastern Africa. This situation highlights the necessity for genomic surveillance to monitor relevant drug resistance markers. This study reports sentinel site-based genomic surveillance results for P. falciparum antimalarial drug resistance mutations. From 2019 to 2022, dried blood spots (DBS) were collected from febrile outpatients [&ge;]1 year of age with microscopically confirmed falciparum malaria at 12 sentinel sites across 5 regions. Molecular inversion probe (MIP) sequencing targeted mutations associated with artemisinin and partner drug resistance, including k13, mdr1, crt, dhfr, and dhps genes, along with genome-wide markers to assess the complexity of infection (COI) and parasite relatedness. A total of 1,199 falciparum-positive patients were assessed, with a median age of 20 years (IQR: 14-30) and including 463 (38.6%) females. The WHO-validated K13 R622I mutation had a high but regionally variable prevalence (15.7%, range 0-58.8%). The validated K13 A675V mutation was detected for the first time in Ethiopia in the Gambella Region (4.5%), as well as P441L and P574L mutations were detected at low frequencies in Southern and Oromia Regions, respectively. Several partner drug resistance markers were identified, with mutations in MDR1(184F), DHPS, DHFR, and CRT nearly fixed across the country. Most samples (87.2%) were monogenic infections (COI=1) and showed high genetic relatedness, particularly within the health facilities. Principal component analysis revealed regional clustering of parasites, particularly in Gambella. The prevalence of K13 R622I across the country and the presence of multiple additional ArtR markers emphasizes the urgent need for rigorous monitoring of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) efficacy to detect partner drug resistance and ACT failure early and its impact on malaria resurgence in Ethiopia.","NA","medrxiv",1726783717450

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been playing an important role by noninvasively assessing structural and functional muscular changes. This exploratory study investigated the potential of dynamic MRI during neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to detect differences between healthy controls (HCs) and patients with metabolic and myotonic myopathies. The study included 14 HCs and 10 patients with confirmed muscular diseases. All individuals were scanned with 3T MRI with a protocol that included a multi-echo gradient echo sequence for fat fraction quantification, multi-echo spin-echo for water T2 relaxation time calculation, and 3D phase contrast sequences during NMES. The strain tensor, buildup and release rates were calculated from velocity datasets. Results showed that strain and strain buildup rate were reduced in the soleus muscle of patients compared to HCs, suggesting these parameters could serve as biomarkers of muscle dysfunction. Notably, there were no significant differences in fat fraction or water T2 measurements between patients and HCs, indicating that the observed changes reflect alterations in muscle contractile properties that are not reflected by structural changes. The findings provide preliminary evidence that dynamic muscle MRI during NMES can detect abnormalities in muscle contraction in patients with myotonia and metabolic myopathies, warranting further research with larger, more homogeneous patient cohorts.","NA","medrxiv",1726783717450

Like many other peripheral membrane proteins, MinDE exhibit preferential binding and macro-scale pattern formation at Ld domains, which leads to altered oscillation mode selection in phase-separated membrane compartments (GUVs). Moreover, incorporating bacterial division proteins within phase-separated GUVs leads to blebbing-like membrane deformations followed by the reorganization of Lo domains aligning at the neck region of the bleb, which agrees well with the domain rearrangement in bacterial membranes immediately preceding the radial constriction process. Overall, the presented in vitro model system showcases a basic framework to better comprehend the cellular division mechanism in consideration of complex cellular lipid environments.","NA","biorxiv",1726783717450

Menopausal hot flashes typically persist for years. For a sizeable minority of women, hot flashes are severe and substantially impairing. It is worthwhile to further investigate the genetic underpinnings of hot flashes.

MethodWe conducted the largest trans-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) of hot flashes available to date (N=149,560). We used self-assessment of hot flashes in the Nurses Health Study, Nurses Health Study II, Womens Health Initiative, and Queensland Institute of Medical Research samples (total n=42,489). In one sample (UK Biobank, n=107,071) direct assessment of hot flashes was not available, so menopausal hormone therapy was used as a proxy variable. We estimated the heritability of hot flashes and genetic correlations with psychiatric phenotypes using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSR).

ResultsIn component analyses and our trans-ancestry meta-analysis, the top locus was on chromosome 4 in the neurokinin 3 receptor gene (TACR3, position 104,556,732, trans-ancestry p=7.2x10-41). A second novel locus was identified (LINC02428, p=3.5x10-8). Gene results implicated TACR3, GRID1, NUDT4, and PHF21B. Using the hot flash GWAS meta-analysis (n=42,489; i.e., no proxy variable), SNP heritability was estimated: h2liab=.08 (h2SNP=.04, se=.02). Genetic correlations were statistically significant between hot flashes and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD, rg=0.25, p=0.01), schizophrenia (rg=0.17, p=0.02), and depression (rg=0.21, p=0.01).

DiscussionThese genomic findings are consistent with independent, robust basic science research which led to a novel treatment for hot flashes, namely, neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists. This new class of hot flash drugs blocks the receptor (neurokinin 3 receptor) coded for by the top locus for hot flashes (TACR3). This GWAS of hot flashes provides an uncommonly clear example of how GWAS findings can point to potent treatment targets for complex brain phenotypes. We also found that the proxy variable (menopausal hormone therapy) pointed to the same target (TACR3), and that exclusively intronic and intergenic variants signaled this target.","NA","medrxiv",1726783717450

However, the reliability and validity of the research derived from these records depends on the completeness and resolution of the codelists used to identify marginalised populations.

AimThe aim of this project was to develop comprehensive codelists for identifying ethnic minorities, people with learning disabilities (LD), people with severe mental illness (SMI) and people who are transgender.

Design and settingThis study was a codelist development project, conducted using primary care data from the United Kingdom.

MethodGroups of interest were defined a priori. Relevant clinical codes were identified by searching Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) publications, codelist repositories and the CPRD code browser. Relevant codelists were downloaded and merged according to marginalised group. Duplicates were removed and remaining codes reviewed by two general practitioners. Comprehensiveness was assessed in a representative CPRD population of 10,966,759 people, by comparing the frequencies of individuals identified when using the curated codelists, compared to commonly used alternatives.

ResultsA total of 52 codelists were identified. 1,420 unique codes were selected after removal of duplicates and GP review. Compared with comparator codelists, an additional 48,017 (76.6%), 52,953 (68.9%) and 508 (36.9%) people with a LD, SMI or transgender code were identified. The frequencies identified for ethnicity were consistent with expectations for the UK population.

ConclusionThe codelists curated through this project will improve inequalities research by improving standards of identifying marginalised groups in primary care data.

HOW THIS FITS INO_LIThe reliability and validity of primary care data for inequalities research depends on the comprehensiveness of the codes used to identify people from marginalised groups.
C_LIO_LIThis study set out to develop comprehensive codelists for the identification of four key groups, known to experience health inequalities.
C_LIO_LIWe developed comprehensive codelists for identifying ethnic minorities, learning disabilities, severe mental illness and people who are transgender, using a systematic approach.
C_LIO_LIThe codelists were validated by two general practitioners, assessed in a representative sample, and can now be used in primary care practice and research, both nationally and internationally.

Limited research exists on the impact of School Distress on the parents/carers supporting these CYP. Using a case-control, concurrent embedded mixed-method design, we explored this lived experience. 947 parents of CYP with School Distress completed a bespoke online questionnaire, alongside two control parent groups (n=149, n=25) and one professional group (n=19).

Findings revealed a devastating impact on the mental health of parents, with parents displaying significantly heightened daily anxiety and significantly lower mood during, but not before, their childrens school attendance difficulties. In addition, parents with children experiencing School Distress reported significantly more negative emotion states and significantly fewer positive emotion states. Parents also reported overwhelmingly negative treatment from professionals, including being disbelieved or blamed for their childrens difficulties, threatened with fines and court action, and disempowered by the actions of professionals surrounding their child. Significant, deleterious impacts were also evident across all aspects of their lives, including their careers, finances, and other children. Perhaps unsurprisingly, half of these parents reported developing a new mental health condition since their childs difficulties began, with the experience itself rated as the second most threatening potential life event, superseded only by the death of a first-degree relative (including a child or spouse). On the other hand, professionals working with CYP with School Distress did not experience these deleterious mental health or wider life consequences. Despite understanding how threatening the experience is for parents, they were often quick to blame parents for their childrens difficulties. Professionals, like parents, expressed frustration with the lack of help available for these CYP and their families.

This study highlights a bleak, adversarial, and lonely picture for parents of CYP struggling to attend school. More specifically, the findings depict a system rife with parental blame; a system that appears to isolate parents through hostile, threatening, and punitive actions. A wider lack of societal understanding of the experience of School Distress further compounds this dearth of support for parents, placing parental mental health in further peril.","NA","medrxiv",1726783717450

Two concentric cylinders of actively dividing stem cells are the main drivers of radial thickening during secondary growth, each producing distinct vascular cell types towards the inside and the outside. While the molecular mechanisms underlying their initiation have been well studied, it remains unclear how these stem cell layers determine which cell type is generated. Here, we demonstrate that the cross-talk between the ERECTA (ER) receptor pathway and auxin signalling controls the amount and choice of output tissue in these two stem cell regions. Mechanistically, we show that the ER pathway phosphorylates the transcription factor ANTEGUMENTA, thereby modulating bilateral stem cell activity and favouring the differentiation of only one type of cell. Our results thus show that the phosphorylation status of ANT regulates root girth and biomass accumulation by influencing bilateral stem cell production. This highlights the critical role of post-translational modifications in plant growth and development.","NA","biorxiv",1726783717450

These molecular networks (or interactomes) are formed progressively, each interaction influencing the next one. Accordingly, a same protein can lead to the formation of different interactomes depending on its first associated cofactor. Therefore, capturing PPIs of specific dimeric protein complexes is key for understanding the molecular rules underlying the diverse cell- and/or subcellular-functions of a bait protein of interest. Here, we introduce an innovative method called Bi-nano-ID that is based on bicolor bimolecular fluorescence complementation and the specific binding of a nanobody fused to a proximity-dependent biotinylating enzyme to tackle this issue. Bi-nano-ID was used to capture endogenous interactomes of the cytoplasmic TAZ/14-3-3e and nuclear TAZ/TEAD2 complexes, which are major downstream effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway. Among the different specific interactions, we revealed the role of a particular family of protease inhibitors for stabilizing and promoting the proliferative activity of TAZ/14-3-3e complexes in mesenchymal stem cells. Overall, our work establishes a novel sensitive method for capturing and visualizing specific interactions of binary bait protein complexes in human living cells.","NA","biorxiv",1726783717450

Fruit flies harbour an innate immune system of which the most populous blood cell (haemocyte) type bears striking homology to the vertebrate macrophage. The importance of these cells has been demonstrated previously, where immune and developmental phenotypes have been observed upon haemocyte ablation using pro-apoptotic transgenes driven by the Hml promoter. Here we show that, as well as ablating Hml-positive cells in vivo using the pro-apoptotic transgene bax, we can also increase Hml-positive cell numbers using a constitutively-active form of ras. However, in adults, compared to larvae, total blood cell numbers were not significantly affected by experimental expansion or ablation. This therefore implies the existence of feedback mechanisms which regulate the number of haemocytes. No effect on lifespan was observed from driving ras and bax in Hml-positive cells using a conditional genetic system (Hml-GeneSwitch). Using a constitutive driver system, we did observe differences in lifespan, however we attribute this to differences in genetic background that could have led to spurious conclusions. Additionally, no effect of either transgene was observed upon infection with two different bacterial species, although a striking pupal lethality phenotype was observed upon expansion of Hml-positive cells in the context of a self-encapsulation mutant genetic background. The latter confirms that the change in Hml-positive cell number does result in a phenotype. The lack of adult phenotypes could be due to the strength of our experimental manipulation or due to compensation via feedback mechanisms that operate to maintain total blood cell numbers. Our study demonstrates the importance of a conditional approach to modulate haemocyte cell numbers in vivo which allows for more precise study of innate immune system function. This approach could be especially fruitful to uncover the mechanisms that regulate total blood cell numbers across development and ageing.","NA","biorxiv",1726783717450

We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear.

Our findings reveal that, under normal conditions, hippocampal neurons exhibit varying degrees of stability in their spatial memory coding. However, microstrokes disrupted this functional network architecture, leading to cognitive impairments. Notably, the preservation of stable coding place cells, along with the stability, precision, and persistence of the hippocampal network, was strongly predictive of cognitive outcomes.

Low vaccine uptake reduces the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns and threatens global public health. Understanding why adolescents are hesitant to accept new vaccines is therefore crucial to support the development of novel vaccine uptake interventions. Prior reviews have included far fewer citations, excluded qualitative data, studies after 2022 and have not mapped adolescent Covid-19 vaccine behaviour onto psychological models. This systematic review investigates psychological factors influencing attitudes and intentions toward and uptake of Covid-19 vaccines in adolescents aged 10 to 19 years globally. Next, we mapped results onto the COM-B framework to inform future interventions. Our search identified 25,354 citations, and included 77 in this review. The quality of studies was mixed, predominantly cross-sectional in design. According to our review, key influences on adolescent Covid-19 vaccine behaviour were: i) Reflective motivation (safety concerns, perceived susceptibility to/severity of Covid-19, perceived vaccine effectiveness, ii) Social opportunity (social norms, autonomy and prosocial attitudes), iii) Psychological capability (attitude and knowledge about vaccines). To improve vaccine uptake, interventions should help adolescents critically weigh vaccine pros and cons and consider external influences on their decisions. IMPLICATIONS AND CONTRIBUTION Our review provides new insights into psychological factors influencing adolescent Covid-19 vaccine behaviour, and maps factors to the COM-B model of behaviour change. To improve vaccine uptake, future vaccine interventions should support adolescents to think critically about the pros and cons of vaccines and consider external influences on their decisions.","NA","medrxiv",1726783717450

However, both blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI and vascular space occupancy data (VASO) have certain limitations, such as bias towards larger cortical veins in BOLD fMRI and high specific absorption rate in VASO. This study aims to explore the feasibility of whole-brain laminar functional quantitative susceptibility mapping (fQSM) compared to laminar BOLD fMRI and VASO at ultra-high field. Data were acquired using 3D EPI techniques. Complex data were denoised with NORDIC and susceptibility maps were computed using 3D path-based unwrapping, the variable-kernel sophisticated harmonic artifact reduction as well as the streaking artifact reduction for QSM algorithms. To assess layer-specific activation, twenty layers were segmented in the somatosensory and motor cortices, obtained from a finger tapping paradigm, and further averaged into six anatomical cortical layers. The magnitude of signal change and z-scores were compared across layers for each technique. fQSM showed the largest activation-dependent mean susceptibility decrease in Layers II/III in M1 and Layers I/ II in S1 with up to -1.3 ppb while BOLD fMRI showed the strongest mean signal increase in Layer I. Our data suggest that fQSM demonstrates less bias towards activation in superficial layers compared to BOLD fMRI. Moreover, activation-based susceptibility change was comparable to VASO data. Studying whole-brain, layer-dependent activation with submillimeter fQSM is feasible, and reduces bias towards venous drainage effects on the cortical surface compared to BOLD fMRI, thereby enabling better localization of laminar activation.","NA","biorxiv",1726783717450

Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1726783717450

Harm reduction programs have emerged as a crucial public health strategy to mitigate these risks. The N[e]wo-Y[o]tina Friendship Centre (NYFC) offers harm reduction programs that provide a safe injection site and clean supplies to reduce substance use-associated harm. Researchers have not extensively studied the effectiveness and user experience of this program. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of harm reduction programs in mitigating adverse effects of drug use, such as disease transmission and overdose. This in-depth study looked at what program users went through in the NYFC harm reduction program. This was done by looking at the program environment, unexpected outcomes, reasons for seeking services, and obstacles to access. The study used a phenomenological approach, utilising semi-structured interviews with 13 participants and analysing interview data using thematic analysis2 through NVivo. The motivations for seeking services were safety, access to clean supplies, and a non-judgmental environment. Findings revealed that users valued a safe and welcoming atmosphere fostered by friendly, supportive, and non-judgmental staff. The program's positive outcomes included reduced harm, access to resources, and emotional support. Nevertheless, limited operating hours, stigma, small space, and a lack of awareness were identified as barriers to access. The study recommends improving accessibility, enhancing support systems, and addressing unanticipated outcomes like drug use enablement to optimise the program's effectiveness. This study provides valuable insights into user experience within the NYFC program. The findings inform program improvements, enhance service delivery, and contribute to a broader understanding of harm reduction strategies for addressing the opioid crisis. It emphasises the importance of user-centred approaches in developing and implementing effective harm reduction programs.","NA","medrxiv",1726783717450

In early 2020 most countries implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 NPIs disrupted the transmission of RSV on a global scale, and many locations did not experience widespread re-circulation until late 2020 or 2021. Here, we use a mechanistic transmission model informed by cellphone mobility data to determine which aspects of population behavior had the greatest influence on post-pandemic RSV rebound in Seattle, Washington.

MethodsWe used aggregated mobile device location data to characterize within-city mixing, visitor in-flows, and foot traffic to points of interest in Seattle. We fit an age-structured epidemiological model to data on weekly RSV hospitalizations, allowing for reductions in transmission due to declines in mobility during the pandemic. We compared model fits to observed data to assess which mobility behaviors best capture RSV dynamics during the first two post-pandemic waves in Seattle.

ResultsIn Seattle, COVID-19 NPIs perturbed RSV seasonality from 2020 to 2022. Seattle experienced a small out-of-season outbreak in Summer 2021 and an atypically large and early wave in Fall 2022. RSV transmission models incorporating mobility network connectivity (measured as the average shortest path length between Seattle neighborhoods) or the inflow of visitors from outside of Seattle best captured the timing and magnitude of the first two post-pandemic waves. Models including foot traffic to schools or child daycares or within-neighborhood movement produced poor fits to observed data.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that case importations from other regions and local spread between neighborhoods had the greatest influence on the timing of RSV reemergence in Seattle. These findings contribute to the understanding of behavioral factors underlying RSV epidemic spread and can inform the timing of preventative measures, such as the administration of immunoprophylaxis.","NA","medrxiv",1726783717450

The frequency and pace of these major genome structural changes are unknown, and it remains unclear whether or how they impact long-term genome evolution. Here, we compare whole chromosomal sequences of 3,631 genomes from 2,291 species spanning all major animal clades and show that animal karyotypes evolve primarily via karyotype contraction, associated with increased rates of chromosomal fusion-with-mixing and dispersion that largely obey chromosomal algebra1, or karyotype expansion, which breaks up ancestral linkage groups and forms new chromosomal elements via non-algebraic changes. We show that chromosomal changes can be associated with major extinction events. Using a multi-scale encoding of pan-animal genome homology and a manifold representation of genomic changes, we find that genome evolution is not only driven by changes at the chromosomal level, but that subchromosomal mixing and irreversibility define clade-specific evolution. Using this  evolutionary genome topology approach, we calculate extrema of irreversible genomic configurations and identify species that occupy intermediate manifold positions, providing evidence for distinct macro-evolutionary trajectories. We propose that investigation of mixed state accumulation around important gene loci (such as Hox) will be crucial in capturing and further study of clade-specific regulatory innovations.","NA","biorxiv",1726783717450

The unique insights from a genome-level perspective have revealed a striking pattern of conserved macrosynteny within chromosomes across huge evolutionary distances in animals, yet progress in many lineages has been hampered by the absence of genome-level data. Here, we show that the tectonics of genome evolution in clitellates, a clade composed of most freshwater and all terrestrial species of the phylum Annelida, is characterised by extensive genome-wide scrambling that resulted in a massive loss of macrosynteny between marine annelids and clitellates, to the point that ancient bilaterian linkage groups (ie, groups of genes inherited as a block in most bilaterian phyla) are fully disrupted. These massive rearrangements included the formation of putative neocentromeres with newly-acquired transposable elements, and preceded a further period of genome-wide reshaping events including whole-genome duplications and massive macrosyntenic reshuffling between clitellate lineages, potentially triggered by the loss of genes involved in genome stability or homeostasis of cell division. Notably, while these rearrangements broke short-range interactions observed between genes in marine annelids (including Hox), they were reformed as long-range interactions in clitellates. These genomic rearrangements gave rise to new genetic elements that may have facilitated the adaptation to freshwater and terrestrial environments in clitellates. Our findings provide evidence of a massive genomic reshaping through genome-wide chromosome scrambling in clitellates consistent with the punctuated equilibrium model, which sharply contrasts with the highly conserved chromosomal architecture observed in most animal taxa. Our study thus suggests that the genomic landscape of this animal lineage resulted from a rare burst of genomic changes that ended a long period of stability that persists across large evolutionary distances.","NA","biorxiv",1726783717450

In line with the age-related neural dedifferentiation hypothesis, we predicted that middle-aged adults show less distinct cortical representations of phonemes and acoustic-phonetic features relative to younger adults. In addition to an extensive audiological, auditory electrophysiological, and speech perceptual test battery, we measured electroencephalographic responses time-locked to phoneme instances (phoneme-related potential; PRP) in naturalistic, continuous speech and trained neural network classifiers to predict phonemes from these responses. Consistent with age-related neural dedifferentiation, phoneme predictions were less accurate, more uncertain, and involved a broader network for middle-aged adults compared with younger adults. Representational similarity analysis revealed that the featural relationship between phonemes was less robust in middle-age. Electrophysiological and behavioral measures revealed signatures of cochlear neural degeneration (CND) and speech perceptual deficits in middle-aged adults relative to younger adults. Consistent with prior work in animal models, signatures of CND were associated with greater cortical dedifferentiation, explaining nearly a third of the variance in PRP prediction accuracy together with measures of acoustic neural processing. Notably, even after controlling for CND signatures and acoustic processing abilities, age-group differences in PRP prediction accuracy remained. Overall, our results reveal ""fuzzier"" phonemic representations, suggesting that age-related cortical neural dedifferentiation can occur even in middle-age and may underlie speech perceptual challenges, despite a normal audiogram.","NA","biorxiv",1726783717450

We aimed to examine if a diverse set of biomarkers in the REHAB-HF trial would predict improvement in physical function following a 12-week tailored physical therapy rehabilitation intervention compared to attention control.

MethodsThe study population consisted of participants [&ge;]60 years of age who were hospitalized with acute HF and randomized to a subsequent multidomain outpatient physical rehabilitation intervention vs. attention control with outcomes of 12-week functional change including the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and six-minute walk distance (6MWD). Blood was collected prior to randomization and at 12-weeks for cardiac, renal, and inflammatory biomarkers. Linear trends across progressively higher biomarker values versus improvement in functional outcomes based on treatment assignment were evaluated. Classification and regression trees (CART) were created to estimate optimal biomarker levels associated with differential improvement in the two functional outcomes.

ResultsA total of 242 of 349 participants (69%) had baseline biomarkers measured. In an adjusted regression model, higher baseline cardiac troponin (cTn) I and T were associated with greater gains in SPPB and 6MWD respectively with the rehabilitation intervention (P=0.04 and 0.03 for interaction) versus attention control. In the CART analysis of the physical rehabilitation and attention control participants, those with baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) [&ge;]9.9 mg/L and hs-cTnT [&ge;]36 ng/L receiving the rehabilitation intervention had a 129 m (95% CI 78-180m) greater 12-week 6MWD increase vs attention control. In contrast, for participants with CRP<9.9 mg/L there was no significant incremental 6MWD difference (30m, 95% CI -0.5m, 60.2m). For SPPB, a CRP [&ge;]9.9 mg/L and creatinine [&ge;]1.4 mg/dL optimally identified a differential improvement with the rehabilitation intervention versus attention control. The biomarkers (except for creatinine) decreased by 12 weeks post hospitalization but with no differences based on treatment assignment.

ConclusionHigher baseline levels of biomarkers of inflammation, cardiac injury, and renal dysfunction identified older adults after a HF hospitalization with the greatest differential improvement in physical function with a rehabilitation intervention. Biomarkers may help clinicians predict the benefits of this treatment.

In this updated systematic review, we evaluate new evidence since our 2019 systematic review on the effect of outdoor air pollution exposure on childhood and adolescent brain structure and function as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

MethodsUsing PubMed and Web of Science, we conducted an updated literature search and systematic review of articles published through March 2024, using key terms for air pollution and functional and/or structural MRI. Two raters independently screened all articles using Covidence and implemented the risk of bias instrument for systematic reviews informing the World Health Organization Global Air Quality Guidelines.

ResultsWe identified 222 relevant papers, and 14 new studies met our inclusion criteria. Including six studies from our 2019 review, the 20 publications to date include study populations from the United States, Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom. Studies investigated exposure periods spanning pregnancy through early adolescence, and estimated air pollutant exposure levels via personal monitoring, geospatial residential estimates, or school courtyard monitors. Brain MRI occurred when children were on average 6-14.7 years old; however, one study assessed newborns. Several MRI modalities were leveraged, including structural morphology, diffusion tensor imaging, restriction spectrum imaging, arterial spin labeling, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as resting-state and task-based functional MRI. Air pollutants were associated with widespread brain differences, although the magnitude and direction of findings are largely inconsistent, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions.

ConclusionPrenatal and childhood exposure to outdoor air pollution is associated with structural and functional brain variations. Compared to our initial 2019 review, publications doubled--an increase that testifies to the importance of this public health issue. Further research is needed to clarify the effects of developmental timing, along with the downstream implications of outdoor air pollution exposure on childrens cognitive and mental health.

This study aimed to estimate the extent to which genetic pathways that are direct (via child genotype) and indirect (e.g., via parental phenotype) explain the well-established association between parent and child emotional problems. We leveraged data from seven European cohort studies with a combined population of Ntrios=15,475. Polygenic scores were calculated for parental and offspring neuroticism, as it represents a dispositional trait underlying emotional problems. Emotional problems in offspring were measured using validated scales across various developmental stages from early childhood to adulthood. We used neuroticism polygenic scores within a structural equation modelling framework to distinguish between direct genetic pathways from parental genotype to offspring outcome (acting through offspring genotype), and indirect genetic pathways (acting through parental phenotype and associated environment). Standard errors for direct genetic, indirect genetic and total effects were bootstrapped and meta-analyses pooled effect estimates at three developmental stages (childhood: 3-4 years, adolescence: 11-13 years, adulthood: 18+ years). We found evidence suggesting an indirect genetic pathway between mothers and child emotional problems during early childhood (pooled estimate, mean difference in standardised child emotional problems score per 1SD increase in maternal PGS for neuroticism=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07). This association attenuated over child development, while direct genetic pathways strengthened. High attrition rates, measurement error and low variance explained by polygenic scores may have altered precision of the estimates, influencing the interpretation of the results. However, we provide the first multi-cohort study to provide evidence for an indirect genetic pathway from maternal neuroticism to early child emotional problems. This suggests that there are likely processes other than direct genetic pathways involved in the intergenerational transmission of emotional problems, highlighting the importance of timely support to prevent and reduce emotional issues in mothers as a preventative strategy for emotional difficulties.","NA","medrxiv",1726783717450

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1726783717450

The fossil, known on the basis of two specimens, has been historically assigned to seamoths (Pegasidae), then to oarfish and relatives (Lampriformes). We describe its enigmatic skeletal anatomy in detail, and provide a new genus name. ""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1726783717450

To date, the cnidarian Turritopsis dohrnii is the only known species capable of undergoing reverse development after the onset of sexual reproduction. Here, we demonstrate that the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi is capable of reversal from mature lobate to early cydippid when fed following a period of stress. Our findings illuminate central aspects of ctenophore development, ecology, and evolution, and show the high potential of M. leidyi as a new model system to study reverse development and rejuvenation. Besides shedding light on the plasticity of developmental programs, our results raise fundamental questions about early animal development, body plans and life cycles.","NA","biorxiv",1726783717450

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1726783717450

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1726783717450
