Previous studies highlighted neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption. Here, we identify distinct biomarkers and dysregulated pathways, with a focus on cardiovascular and neurovascular involvement.

MethodsWe analyzed public RNA-sequencing data (GEO: GSE251849) comparing long COVID-19 patients with brain fog, long COVID-19 patients without cognitive symptoms, convalescent patients, and healthy controls. Differential gene expression, principal component analysis, and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DESeq2, KEGG, GO, and Enrichr tools.

ResultsOur analysis revealed a distinct gene expression profile in patients with brain fog, identifying exclusive biomarkers such as NRCAM, GRIN2C, NOS2, and EDNRB. Pathway analysis revealed significant dysregulation in cardiovascular, calcium signaling, and relaxin signaling pathways, suggesting novel biological mechanisms that contribute to cognitive impairment. These findings expand beyond neuroinflammation and highlight potential cardiovascular involvement in long COVID-related cognitive dysfunction.

ConclusionOur study reveals novel transcriptomic signatures that highlight cardiovascular and neurovascular dysregulation, providing promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Future research should validate these findings and investigate therapeutic interventions addressing these unique pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586963

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1749852586963

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1749852586963

CRISPR-Cas systems are known to be important regulators of these host-MGE interactions, but a global understanding of CRISPR-Cas diversity, activity, and roles across Earth's biomes is still lacking. Here, we use an optimized computational approach to search short-read data and collect ~800 million CRISPR spacers across ~450,000 public metagenomes. Comparing spacers across samples and taxa revealed a high population diversity for CRISPR loci overall, with typically only a small subset of spacers detected as prevalent and conserved within a microbial population. From this extensive CRISPR spacer dataset, we identified 1.18 billion hits between 41 million spacers and 2.5 million viruses and plasmids. Prevalent and conserved spacers were over-represented in these MGE-matching spacers, and CRISPR spacers frequently matched multiple MGEs, consistent with a positive selection pressure associated with MGE targeting. Focusing on the role of CRISPR as anti-phage defense, we observed surprising cases of viruses targeted by microbes not expected to be viable hosts. These were more frequent for viruses encoding a diversification mechanism (DGR) for their host attachment proteins, and associated with a reduced rate of escape mutations. This suggests that broad spacer targeting may derive from the recurring entry of a virus genome into a non-host microbial cell, leading to some viruses being targeted by taxonomically diverse microbes well outside of their actual host range. Taken together, this petabase-scale exploration of CRISPR arrays in nature outlines the extensive diversity of CRISPR array loci across microbiomes. It highlights several key genomic and ecological parameters driving the activity of CRISPR arrays that are likely influencing strain-level diversification and selection processes within microbial populations.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586963

Here we uncover an unprecedented mechanism of RNA-guided gene activation involving the coordinated action of {sigma}E factor in complex with nuclease-dead Cas12f (dCas12f). We screened a large set of genetically-linked dCas12f and {sigma}E homologs in E. coli using RIP-seq and ChIP-seq experiments, revealing systems that exhibited robust guide RNA enrichment and DNA target binding with a minimal 5'-G target-adjacent motif (TAM). Recruitment of {sigma}E was dependent on dCas12f and guide RNA (gRNA), suggesting direct protein-protein interactions, and co-expression experiments demonstrated that the dCas12f-gRNA-{sigma}E ternary complex was competent for programmable recruitment of the RNAP holoenzyme. Remarkably, dCas12f-RNA-{sigma}E complexes drove potent gene expression in the absence of any requisite promoter motifs, with de novo transcription start sites defined exclusively by the relative distance from the dCas12f-mediated R-loop.

While high-resolution structures of the vault shell are available, the architecture and symmetry of the cap at either end of the vault has remained unresolved. Here we present a 2.25 [A] cryo-EM structure of the vault cap, revealing an unexpected 13-fold symmetric arrangement that contrasts with the 39-fold symmetry of the vault body, with each repeating module of the cap formed by an asymmetric homotrimer of adjacent subunits, in which two C-termini remain in the vault interior, and one projects into the cytosol. The center of the cap features an unusual architecture reminiscent of the Stomatin, Flotillin and HflK/C (SPFH) superfamily, consisting of two concentric beta barrels surrounded by an interwoven two-layer stack of alpha-helices, with the innermost barrel forming a 15 [A] aperture connecting the interior of the vault with the cytosol. The vault cap features a positively charged exterior and a negatively charged interior surface, with implications for binding partner recruitment and putative binding of the vault particle to microtubules and lipid rafts. These findings uncover a new facet of vault particle architecture, and have implications for engineering and design of modified vault particles for therapeutic delivery, as well as providing new opportunities for interrogating the functional roles of the vault particle in biological systems.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586963

Common wisdom holds that G should respond to drift only as a scaled reduction. In contrast, I find that drift causes drastic and predictable shifts in the orientation of G by driving genetic correlations to their extremes. Biologically, this is a consequence of linkage build-up introduced by drift. I compare these theoretical results to empirical observations based on experiments conducted by Phillips et. al. (2001). Additionally, to derive the model of G-matrix evolution, I developed a novel synthetic framework for modelling ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations carrying multivariate traits. By striking a balance between genetic detail and analytical tractability, and by minimizing requisite technical background, this framework is optimized for deriving new models across a wide range of topics in population biology. Foundations of the framework are formalized by the theory of measure-valued processes, but application of the framework only requires multivariate calculus, and heuristics are presented in the main text for making additional calculations involving stochastic processes. Collectively, this work establishes a powerful framework enabling efficient formal analysis of integrated population processes across evolution and ecology, and its potential for making new discoveries is illustrated by novel findings on fundamental aspects of G-matrix evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586963

Studies of neural circuit evolution often focus on a few elements within a network. However, addressing fundamental questions in evolutionary neuroscience, such as whether some elements are more evolvable than others, requires a more global and unbiased approach. Here, we used synapse-level comparative connectomics to examine how an entire olfactory circuit evolves. We compared the full antennal lobe connectome of the larvae of two closely related Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. erecta, which differ in their ecological niches and odour-driven behaviours. We found that evolutionary change is unevenly distributed across the network. Some features, including neuron types, neuron numbers and interneuron-to-interneuron connectivity, are highly conserved. These conserved elements delineate a core circuit blueprint presumably required for fundamental olfactory processing. Superimposed on this scaffold, we find rewiring changes that mirror each species ecologies, including a systematic shift in the excitation-to-inhibition balance in the feedforward pathways. We further show that some neurons have changed more than others, and that even within individual neurons some synaptic elements remain conserved while others display major species-specific changes, suggesting evolutionary hot-spots within the circuit. Our findings reveal constrained and adaptable elements within olfactory networks, and establish a framework for identifying general principles in the evolution of neural circuits underlying behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586963

X-ray crystallography revealed two key arginine residues within the Siglec-10 binding site that interact with the carboxyl group of sialic acid, a canonical R119 and a non-canonical R127, suggesting potential dual contributions to ligand engagement. Saturation Transfer Difference (STD)-NMR confirmed that R119 is essential for binding to sialoglycans, while R127 appears dispensable in interactions with glycans in solution. However, cell-based binding assays using primary human T cells and engineered monocytic lines demonstrated that both arginines (R119 and R127) are critical for cellular recognition, highlighting a more complex mechanism of interaction with the glycocalyx.

It has been shown that in type II-A systems selection of PAM-proximal prespacers is mediated by the effector nuclease Cas9, which forms a 'supercomplex' with the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and the Csn2 protein.

Growth suppression by ppGpp is implicated in the formation of persister cells, which survive antibiotic challenge only to regrow once the drug is removed. However, there is also evidence that low levels of ppGpp contribute to resistance to certain cell wall-active antibiotics in actively growing cells. To characterize ppGpp's contribution to antibiotic resistance, we measured MICs of a panel of {beta}-lactams in actively growing Escherichia coli cells overexpressing a ppGpp synthase (relA*). Cells engineered to modestly overproduce ppGpp exhibited up to 64-fold increases in resistance to PBP2-targeting {beta}-lactams only, with mecillinam the most dramatically affected. Resistance required the transcription factor DksA and the class A penicillin binding protein (PBP) PBP1B. PBP1B variants defective for transpeptidase activity, glycosyltransferase activity, or both were incapable of mediating resistance, suggesting the full enzymatic activity of PBP1B is required for resistance. Transcriptomics revealed that ppGpp overproduction leads to increased expression of lpoB, which encodes an activator of PBP1B. LpoB was required for mecillinam resistance, with an lpoB deletion mutant exhibiting a loss of ppGpp-dependent resistance.

The core challenge lies in balancing quality and scalability. Manual curation delivers high quality, reliable annotations but is time-intensive and non-scalable; automated approaches, including those based on natural language processing, can scale but often fall short in accuracy and completeness. This tradeoff is particularly severe in public datasets, where metadata is frequently distributed across multiple sources for a single dataset. A notable example includes multi-omics datasets available on GEO and similar public repositories, which are often accompanied by associated publications. These supplementary sources can be leveraged to substantially enhance metadata quality, thereby supporting downstream applications such as classifier model development or the identification of biologically relevant cohorts, etc.

We present a first-in-class multi-agent AI system that bridges the gap, achieving both high quality and scalability in metadata curation. Built on large-language models (LLMs), our system orchestrates a set of specialized agents that collaboratively extract, normalize, and infer critical metadata fields such as tissue, disease, cell line, sampling site, demographics, and experimental context from GEO entries, associated publications. A central orchestrator agent delegates tasks such as data retrieval, document parsing, ontology mapping, and context inference to expert sub-agents, enabling scalable, end-to-end automation.

Applied to GEO data sets, a notoriously difficult metadata domain, our system achieves a 93% recall on average across 23 key fields (all original terms, normalized terms, and corresponding ontology ids) that include information about disease, tissue, treatment, donor-related information, outperforming existing automated baselines and approaches expert level quality. We also present a system that can easily scale to curate hundreds of metadata fields of interest with similar precision. This work demonstrates that an LLM-based multi-agent architecture can overcome traditional trade-offs in metadata curation, enabling both precision and scale, and offers a promising path forward for curating large public biomedical repositories for downstream AI applications.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586963

We describe a novel mechanism whereby JIP4 regulates lysosomal cystine storage by controlling the abundance of cystinosin (CTNS), the transporter responsible for lysosomal cystine efflux. To this end, JIP4, previously characterized as a motor adaptor and kinase signaling scaffold, suppresses TMEM55B-dependent ubiquitylation of CTNS. Loss of JIP4 reduces CTNS protein levels, leading to lysosomal cystine accumulation and lysosomal storage defects that phenocopy loss of CTNS in both human cells and the renal proximal tubules of JIP4 knockout mice. These phenotypes mirror cystinosis, the lysosomal storage disease caused by CTNS loss-of-function. Our findings thus reveal a fundamental process that controls the efflux of lysosomal cystine and has relevance to understanding human disease arising from JIP4 mutations.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586963

Mathematical models of spreading have been developed leading to several established methods of inferring whether information spreads via social or individual learning. Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) has emerged as a leading frequentist framework for inferring and quantifying social transmission, particularly in non-human animal populations. NBDA has been extended several times to account for multiple diffusions, multiple networks, individual-level variables, and complex transmission functions. Bayesian implementations of NBDA were introduced in two prior studies. However, there is not yet a user-friendly package to implement a Bayesian NBDA, and the approach has seen limited usage by other researchers. Here, we present a unified framework for performing Bayesian analysis of social transmission using NBDA-type models, implemented in the widely used Stan programming language. We provide a user-friendly R package ""STbayes"" (ST: social transmission) for other researchers to easily use this framework. STbayes accepts user-formatted data, but can also import data directly from the existing NBDA R package. Based on the data users provide, STbayes automatically generates multi-network, multi-diffusion models that allow for individual covariates that may influence transmission, as well as individual-level varying (random) effects for any parameter. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that this model can accurately differentiate the relative contribution of individual and social learning in the spread of information through networked populations. We illustrate how incorporating upstream uncertainty about the relationships between individuals in the social group can improve model fit. We show that our framework can be used to infer complex transmission rules and describe a new parameterization of frequency-dependent transmission that is more numerically stable than prior parameterizations. Finally, we introduce support for dynamic transmission weights and a ""high-resolution"" data mode, which allows users to make use of fine-scale data collected by contemporary automated tracking methods. These extensions increase the set of contexts that this type of model may be used for.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586963

Among these, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and extracellular targeted protein degradation (eTPD) specifically depend on efficient lysosomal trafficking for activity. However, many tumor antigens exhibit poor internalization, limiting ADC effectiveness. To address this, we developed low-density lipoprotein receptor-targeting chimeras (LIPTACs), leveraging the constitutive endocytic and recycling activity of the LDLR to enhance lysosomal delivery. LIPTACs enable efficient and selective degradation of diverse extracellular membrane proteins. Additionally, by coupling LIPTACs with cytotoxic payloads to generate degrader-drug conjugates, we can achieve superior intracellular delivery and enhanced cytotoxicity compared to conventional ADCs. The dual modality addresses key challenges of inadequate internalization in conventional ADCs and cytotoxic potency for current eTPD strategies. Our findings demonstrate that LDLR-mediated trafficking can enhance eTPD and ADCs, providing a hybrid blueprint for developing next-generation antibody therapeutics with broader utility and improved efficacy in cancer treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586963

Search queries may vary in size from short gene sequences to multiple whole genomes that are too large to fit in computer memory. In microbial genomics, a routine search application involving both large queries and large collections is the removal of contaminating host genome sequences from microbial (meta)genomes. Where the host is human, sensitive classification and excision of host sequences is usually necessary to protect host genetic information. Precise classification is also critical in order to retain microbial sequences and permit accurate microbial genomic analysis. While human pangenomes have been shown to increase sensitivity of human sequence classification, existing bioinformatic host depletion approaches have either limited precision when used with metagenomes or large computing resource requirements. Results: We present Deacon, an efficient and versatile sequence filter for raw sequence files and streams. We demonstrate its leading accuracy for the task of host depletion, using less computing resource than existing approaches. By querying a human pangenome index for minimizers contained in each input sequence, Deacon is able to accurately classify and discard diverse human sequences from long reads at over 250Mbp/s with a commodity laptop. We present validation of classification sensitivity, specificity and speed with simulated short and long reads for diverse catalogues of human, bacterial and viral genomes alongside existing methods. Beyond host depletion, Deacon is well suited to common sequence search and filtering applications, particularly those involving large queries. Capable of indexing a human genome in under 30s, Deacon is equipped to rapidly compose custom minimizer indexes using set operations, facilitating efficient search and filtering of massive sequence datasets using gigabase queries. Availability and implementation: Deacon is implemented as an MIT-licensed command line tool written in Rust and packaged with Bioconda.

Inspired by in silico antimicrobial activity prediction, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of Av2 in vitro. Furthermore, its role in V. dahliae virulence was assessed through microbiota sequencing of inoculated plants, microbial co-cultivation assays, and inoculations in a gnotobiotic plant cultivation system. We show that Av2 inhibits bacterial growth, and acts as a virulence factor during host colonization. Microbiota sequencing revealed involvement of Av2 in suppression of Pseudomonas spp. recruitment upon plant inoculation with V. dahliae, suggesting that Av2 suppresses the cry for help. We show that several Pseudomonas spp. are antagonistic to V. dahliae and sensitive to Av2 treatment.

However, there is a population of TB patients who require longer treatment durations. Prospectively identifying those who require shorter versus longer treatment durations would support evaluation and implementation of optimized regimens. Methods We analysed data from the RIFASHORT TB treatment-shortening non-inferiority trial to define a TB phenotype classification. The RIFASHORT trial primary outcome was reanalysed using the protocol-defined non-inferiority criterion of eight percentage points, stratifying by those classified as having limited or extensive disease. Results Xpert MTB/RIF(R) semiquantitative bacterial burden in combination with TB disease involvement grading on chest X-ray achieved the strongest differentiation between relapse and non-relapse. The extensive disease TB phenotype (high semiquantitative bacterial burden and extensive TB disease on X-ray) accounted for one quarter of the RIFASHORT trial population and more than half of all post-treatment TB relapses (13/23). For the limited TB disease phenotype (<high semiquantitative bacterial burden or no extensive TB disease on X-ray), the experimental 4-month 1200mg rifampicin-containing regimen met the protocol-defined non-inferiority criterion in both modified-intention-to-treat (adjusted risk difference: -1.3% (95% confidence interval: -6.7% to 4.0%)) and per protocol analyses (1.7% (95% CI: -3.8% to 7.1%)). Conclusion A four-month treatment duration, with a widely available, tolerable, rifampicin-based TB treatment regimen, was non-inferior to the standard of care for three-quarters of people with TB in the RIFASHORT trial. This finding justifies definitive evaluation of disease-stratified rifampicin-based TB treatment in a phase III randomised trial.","NA","medrxiv",1749852586964

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer a promising approach for both treatment and prevention. Here, we describe the discovery and characterization of 4F11, a highly potent and broadly neutralizing mAb with demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy against HMPV. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we defined a unique mechanism of binding HMPV employed by 4F11, which distinguishes it from previously characterized RSV and HMPV mAbs. 4F11 targets an epitope located at the apex of the prefusion F protein (site O) with a 1:1 stoichiometry, distinct from the 3:1 stoichiometry observed with other HMPV site O antibodies. Unlike other site O antibodies, which penetrate the glycan shield between Asn57 and Asn172, 4F11 binds vertically and directly interacts with the Asn172 glycan, representing a unique glycan-dependent mode of recognition. In vitro, 4F11 displayed high potency and broad neutralization across diverse HMPV strains. It also showed a low propensity for resistance development, with only a single escape mutation (K179E) identified, a mutation not found in any published HMPV sequence to date.

Here, we introduce spatial ISOform sequencing (Spl-ISO-Seq), which reveals exons and polyadenylation sites from long reads with near-single-cell resolution. Spl-ISO-Seq selects long cDNAs and doubles to triples read lengths compared to standard preparations. Adding a highly specific software tool (Spl-ISOquant) and comparing human post-mortem pre-puberty samples of the visual cortex (8-11 years) to post-puberty samples (16-19 years), we find that cortical layers harbor stronger splicing and poly(A)-site regulation than the adjacent white matter, with enrichment of multiple protein-domain types. For oligodendrocytes however, developmental splicing changes are stronger in white matter. Among cortical layers, layer 4 has the most developmental changes in alternative-exon inclusion in excitatory neurons and in poly(A) sites. We also find many repeat elements, especially ERV1 long terminal repeats downstream of developmentally-regulated layer 4 exons. Overall, alternative splicing changes are linked to synapses - specifically at the post-synapse. Age-linked splicing changes in layers 1-3 and 4 are associated with autism spectrum disorder but not with schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimers disease. These results root developmental splicing changes during puberty and the resulting protein changes in specific layers and cell types. More generally, our new technologies enable new observations for any complex tissue.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586964

However, the mechanism by which LAMV is attenuated is not well understood, contributing to the increased vaccine hesitancy that has caused a worldwide resurgence of measles. Here, we provide a molecular model of attenuation that implicates increased host innate immune responses and increased LAMV susceptibility to those responses. Our study leverages both in vitro and in vivo models of infection to find that acute induction of innate immunity in immune cells is the critical determinant of LAMV attenuation. We show that LAMV, in contrast to pathogenic wild type measles virus (MeV), causes a strong IFN response in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which restricts viral replication and spread in a post-entry manner. LAMV can enter, transcribe viral mRNA and translate viral proteins in immune cells, but is not able to form infectious particles and spread from cell to cell. Specifically, we find that mutations conserved across LAMV strains in the P/V/C and H genes are responsible for the induction of IFN and the restriction of infectious virus production. In PBMC cultures and in rhesus macaques, LAMV infection also results in the acute induction of proinflammatory cytokines that likely play a role in the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Overall, our study provides a virological and immunological framework for LAMV attenuation which can be leveraged in repurposing the LAMV backbone and in future vaccine design.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586964

To explore the role of CD4+ T cells in vaccine-dependent tumor rejection, we constructed an mRNA lipoplex vaccine encoding a single MHCII-restricted neoantigen. The vaccine elicited Tfh and Th1 cell responses while decreasing Tregs, leading to rejection of established tumors in mice. IL-21 and IFN-{gamma}, crucial for Tfh and Th1 function respectively, contributed to anti-tumor activity. B cells and neoantigen-specific antibodies were also shown to participate in vaccine efficacy. Additionally, conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) were essential for eliciting vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells, and both cDC1s and CD4+ T cells were required to enhance endogenous CD8+ responses, which were crucial for tumor control. Our results suggest that immunizing against MHCII neoantigens alone is sufficient to orchestrate a potent and cooperative immune response against cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586964

However, the nature of these computations remains unclear. Current models disagree on two fundamental questions: what stopping-rule is applied to post-choice evidence sampling and to what degree do choice and confidence reports rely on shared versus distinct evidence accumulation processes? These models have proven difficult to dissociate because they often make similar behavioural predictions. Therefore, we used a neurally-informed modelling approach to jointly model initial choices and subsequent confidence reports while leveraging the additional constraints offered by human electrophysiological signatures of evidence accumulation. Participants made self-paced confidence reports after indicating perceptual choices on a random dot motion task, with stimulus presentation continuing during the interval between these responses. Model comparison showed that boundary-based stopping rules provided superior fits to the behavioural data than time-based stopping rules, as the latter could not account for relationships between confidence and confidence-RT. The behavioural fits were inconclusive when comparing models with a single evidence accumulation process dictating choices and confidence reports compared to models invoking a distinct post-choice process. However, the single-process model markedly outperformed the other models in terms of its ability to recapitulate the observed neural evidence accumulation patterns associated with choice confidence. Our study thus demonstrates that choice behaviour, subjective confidence, and associated neural decision signals can be jointly explained by a model invoking a single process of evidence accumulation with separate boundaries for the initial choice and subsequent confidence reports.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586964

Furthermore, asparagine depletion at specific time points during CD4+ T cell differentiation reduces cytokine production in multiple CD4+ T cell subsets. In an adoptive transfer model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), myelin oligodendrocyte-specific pathogenic T helper 17 cells differentiated under Asn-deficient conditions exhibited reduced encephalitogenic potential and attenuated EAE severity. In a model of EAE induced by active immunization, therapeutic depletion of extracellular Asn significantly reduced disease severity.

However, to characterize of the pleiotropic, molecular and population genetic bounds of uncovered loci, investigations are conducted, that remain conceptually and practically separated. Also in the best case, such investigations proceed by one locus at a time. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient and reproducible Snakemake pipeline for executing haplotype-based association analysis on GWAS-identified genetic loci, which is especially helpful in samples enriched with molecular omics data. Haplomics takes as input the genetic coordinates of each locus along with all available clinical and molecular phenotypes, the necessary covariates, and VCF genotype files, to reconstruct haplotypes and test them for associations with the phenotypes. The reconstructed haplotypes, the annotation of included variants, and association results are graphically displayed in an HTML report. We tested Haplomics in population-based study sample encompassing 391 traits, including 72 clinical markers, 171 serum metabolites, 148 plasma protein concentrations, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) imputed genotypes. We estimated WES-based haplotypes at 11 kidney function genetic loci from a GWAS and conducted association analyses throughout, identifying 19 significant associations after multiple testing correction. Haplomics is a scalable, easy-to-use and fast haplotype reconstruction and association pipeline that makes it possible to jointly conduct molecular and population-genetic characterization of multiple GWAS loci in unified analysis framework.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients.

It has been used for centuries as a natural defence against bacteria and fungi. However, we do not fully understand how well it works against viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we investigated the effect of allicin on the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain of the spike protein in human primary splenic fibroblasts. These cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding RBD-S protein fused to a superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), a bright, stable marker. When cells were treated with 50M allicin, either 30 min before or 6 h after transfection, a pronounced drop in fluorescence was observed, indicating reduced spike protein expression. Interestingly, the cell morphology, growth, and behavior remained normal, indicating that allicin could minimize spike protein levels without being toxic to the cells. These results open the door to the use of allicin as a gentle, natural antiviral agent and raise critical questions regarding the regulation of protein expression after transcription. Further research is required to understand these effects better.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586964

Previous work has revealed a sweep-stick code in rat wS1 by using a novel whisker velocity-white noise stimulus. Sticks refer to high velocity single whisker bumps, while sweeps correspond to large multiwhisker displacements with extended temporal profiles. We hypothesized that barrel cortex neurons inherit  stick responses from the VPM and  sweep responses from the POm. Here we test this hypothesis by studying the coding strategy of both thalamic nuclei and wS1 in mice. We found a stratified wS1 representation of both sweep and stick functional classes, whereas VPM and POm contained mainly stick encoding neurons. Cortical layer 4  stick responses are a delayed version from VPM, while layer 5b  sweep responses come from POm. Notably, layer 5a  sweep responses result from a temporal integration of  stick information from VPM and POm.

Here we propose a new method, pleiotropic heritability with bias correction (PHBC), to estimate pleiotropic heritability (h2pleio), defined as the liability-scale genetic variance of a target disease that is shared with a specific set of auxiliary diseases. We estimate h2pleio from GWAS summary statistics by estimating the proportion of variance explained from an estimated genetic correlation matrix and employing a Monte-Carlo bias correction procedure to account for sampling noise in genetic correlation estimates. Simulations showed that PHBC produces approximately unbiased estimates of pleiotropic heritability. The average ratio of pleiotropic heritability vs. total SNP-heritability (h2pleio / h2) across 15 diseases from the UK Biobank (spanning 7 disease categories) was 34% (s.e. 7%). Several diseases were dominated by pleiotropic heritability, including depression (71%) and type 2 diabetes (65%). Pleiotropic heritability was broadly distributed across disease categories, with h2pleio / h2 decreasing only slightly when removing all auxiliary diseases in the target disease category (avg = 31% (s.e. 7%)) and only moderately when further removing one other (most informative) category whose removal had the greatest impact (avg = 20% (s.e. 3%)). Average h2pleio / h2 increased to 44% (s.e. 9%) when adding 16 UK Biobank auxiliary quantitative traits, and 50% (s.e. 5%) when further adding 30 non-UK Biobank auxiliary diseases. On average, h2pleio / h2 was 2.4x larger than the proportion of liability-scale total phenotypic variance explained by the same set of auxiliary diseases, implying higher pleiotropy for genetic effects than the effects of non-genetic exposures. In conclusion, we determined that roughly half of common disease heritability is pleiotropic with diseases from a broad range of disease categories, emphasizing the need for a multi-disease approach to personalized medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1749852586964

Active surveillance for bacterial colonization is effective at preventing infection but is resource-intensive and limited to high-risk units and a subset of high-risk pathogens. Colonization pressure (CP) for common pathogens has been associated with hospital acquired infection and can be calculated in real-time using data in the electronic health record. We aimed to assess the impact of CP on nosocomial acquisition for a range of drug susceptible and drug resistant pathogens, across an entire hospital system.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective matched cohort study of all inpatients admitted to a large regional integrated healthcare system between May 2015 and July 2024 who stayed in one room during the 30 day observation period. Cases had target organisms detected in any clinical or surveillance culture taken between 3 and 30 days after admission into their first room. Controls were matched on demographics, length of stay, prior surgery and 14 classes of antibiotic exposure. Our outcome was nosocomial acquisition of 11 common pathogens spread across enteric, skin and environmental niches. We applied conditional logistic regression and XGBoost to model nosocomial acquisition using as covariates the Elixhauser comorbidity index and CP, defined as the time-weighted prevalence of an organism in ward co-occupants over the previous 6 months. CP was calculated for 9 organism sets, including the Enterobacterales, ESBL Enterobacterales, vancomycin susceptible and resistant Enterococcus spp, C. difficile, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and drug susceptible and drug resistant (DR) P. aeruginosa (PsA).

FindingsOur pooled cohort included 14,923 cases matched to 28,480 controls. Hospital acquisition occurred four times more frequently for drug susceptible versus drug resistant organisms. Baseline characteristics were well matched between cases and controls. The strongest positive associations were between CPC. difficile and nosocomial acquisition of C. difficile (+32.5%, 95% CI +21.9% to +44.0%), CPESBL and ESBL K. pneumoniae (+29.4%, 95% CI +11.3% to +50.6%), and CPPsA-DR with drug resistant P. aeruginosa (+28.6%, 95% CI +14.0% to +45.0%). Among the skin flora, CPMSSA was associated with a +12.1% (95% CI +9.9% to +14.4%) increase in the odds of nosocomial acquisition of MSSA, CPMRSA was associated with a +6.7% (95% CI +1.3% to +12.5%) increase in the odds of MRSA. Negative associations were observed between organisms inhabiting different niches, including CPMSSA and ESBL K. pneumoniae (-7.9%, 95% CI -15.1% to -0.2%), and CPPsA-DR and vancomycin susceptible E. faecalis (-10.0%, 95% CI -15.6% to -4.0%).

InterpretationA hospitalized patients odds of nosocomially acquiring a potential pathogen is associated with its prevalence among that patients ward co-occupants, regardless of the organisms drug resistance profile. Further research is necessary to understand the role of passive surveillance of CP for preventing infection.

TrAEL-seq is a robust method for profiling DNA replication genome-wide that works in unsynchronised cells and does not require treatment with drugs or nucleotide analogues. Here, we provide an updated method for TrAEL-seq including multiplexing of up to 6 samples that dramatically improves sample quality and throughput, and we validate TrAEL-seq in multiple mammalian cell lines. The updated protocol is straightforward and robust yet provides excellent resolution comparable to OK-seq in mammalian cell samples. High resolution replication profiles can be obtained across large panels of samples and in dynamic systems, for example during the progressive onset of oncogene induced senescence. In addition to mapping zones where replication initiates and terminates, TrAEL-seq is sensitive to replication fork speed, revealing effects of both transcription and proximity to replication Initiation Zones on fork progression. Although forks move more slowly through transcribed regions, this does not have a significant impact on the broader dynamics of replication fork progression, which is dominated by rapid fork movement in long replication regions (>1Mb). Short and long replication regions are not intrinsically different, and instead replication forks accelerate across the first ~1 Mb of travel such that forks progress faster in the middle of regions lying between widely spaced Initiation Zones. We propose that this is a natural consequence of fewer replication forks being active later in S phase when these distal regions are replicated and there being less competition for replication factors.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586964

Dynamic modeling using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a powerful framework for understanding and predicting microbiome behaviors. However, developing reliable ODE models is severely hampered by their nonlinear nature and the presence of significant challenges, particularly critical issues related to identifiability. Here, we address the identification problem in dynamic microbial community models by proposing an integrated methodology to tackle key challenges. Focusing on nonlinear ODE-based models, we examine four critical pitfalls: identifiability issues (structural and practical), unstable dynamics (potentially leading to numerical blow-up), underfitting (convergence to suboptimal solutions), and overfitting (fitting noise rather than signal). These pitfalls yield unreliable parameter estimates, unrealistic model behavior, and poor generalization. Our study presents a comprehensive workflow incorporating structural and practical identifiability analysis, robust global optimization for calibration, stability checks, and rigorous predictive power assessment. The methodologys effectiveness and versatility in mitigating these pitfalls are demonstrated through case studies of increasing complexity, paving the way for more reliable and mechanistically insightful models of microbial communities.

The emergence of these increasingly large-scale connectomic datasets have intensified the need for efficient and accurate neuronal cell type identification. Traditional approaches rely on labor-intensive analyses of molecular, anatomical, and physiological features. As a step toward fully automated neuronal cell type classification, we present NTAC (Neuronal Type Assignment from Connectivity) -- a method for grouping neurons into cell types based solely on synaptic connectivity. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that synaptic connectivity is key to determining neuronal cell types (Seung 2012), and our results provide the strongest evidence to date supporting its validity. NTAC comes in two flavors: a semi-supervised variant that requires some of the neurons to be labeled, and an unsupervised variant that requires no labels at all. The first can be naturally formalized as a learning problem on graphs: given labels for a subset of neurons, use connectivity to label the rest. We present a simple and fast algorithm that achieves over 95% accuracy on the fly's visual system starting with just 2% of neurons labeled, within minutes on a standard PC. In contrast, morphology based parallel achieves lower accuracy even on smaller datasets and with significantly more labels. Formalizing the problem as a fully unsupervised learning task is more challenging. To address this, we introduce a novel computational problem, approximate equitable partitioning, and design an efficient heuristic for it, using the semi-supervised algorithm as a subroutine. Remarkably, the unsupervised method achieves ~70% accuracy on the fly's visual system, drastically outperforming its morphology based parallel and providing concrete evidence that synaptic connectivity alone can reveal cell types. Both variants of NTAC are evaluated on multiple state of the art connectomes including optic lobes, central brain and nerve cord of adult fruit flies.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586964

These sensory processing differences suggest the potential for using patterned auditory stimulation to modulate neural activity and mitigate symptoms. While impairments in higher cognitive functions are a hallmark of autism, they remain underexplored in rodent models compared to basic sensory-motor deficits. In this study, we investigated higher cognitive function in the valproic acid (VPA) rodent model of autism and evaluated whether auditory entrainment could ameliorate associated impairments. Pregnant dams received an intraperitoneal injection of VPA on embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), and offspring were subsequently tested on a delayed non-match to place (DNMP) task to assess working memory . Following 40Hz sensory entrainment, VPA-exposed animals showed significantly impaired performance and altered trial-by-trial learning dynamics, indicating deficits in working memory-based decision making. More importantly, auditory stimulation led to increased gamma-frequency oscillations and enhanced power in other bands (theta, beta) across brain regions, as assessed by LFP recordings in freely moving animals. These neural effects were sustained even after stimulation ended, indicating robust and lasting modulation of brain dynamics. This provides strong evidence for the therapeutic potential of sensory entrainment in reversing autism-related cognitive deficits","NA","biorxiv",1749852586964

Although dietary tryptophan is associated with various health benefits, excessive intake can result in adverse physiological effects. The specific tryptophan-derived metabolites responsible for such toxicity, however, remain incompletely characterized. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying tryptophan-induced toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We observe that tryptophan concentrations of 1 mM or higher are highly toxic to C. elegans, blocking egg hatching. Notably, supplementation with various sugars alleviates this toxicity. Genetic analyses reveal that host tryptophan metabolism is dispensable for the observed effects. Instead, bacterial metabolism, particularly the conversion of tryptophan to indole, is essential for mediating toxicity. Bacterial strains deficient in indole production abolished tryptophan-induced toxicity, and all sugars that conferred protection also suppressed bacterial indole synthesis. These findings demonstrate that tryptophan toxicity in C. elegans is primarily mediated by microbial metabolism and underscore the pivotal role of host-microbiota interactions in shaping the physiological consequences of dietary amino acid intake.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586964

Based on the number of formants, two different coda quality categories have been described: a-codas and i-codas. In the present paper, we demonstrate that sperm whale codas not only resemble human vowels acoustically, but also pattern like them across several dimensions. First, traditional count- and timing-based coda types interact with coda ""vowel"" quality (a vs. i). Second, a-codas are generally longer than i-codas. Third, the duration of i-codas has a bimodal distribution, showing a contrast between short i-codas and long[i] -codas. Fourth, the baseline coda length differs across whales. And fifth, edge clicks mismatching their coda often match an adjacent coda, a phenomenon that resembles human coarticulation. All five properties have close parallels in the phonetics and phonology of human languages. Sperm whale coda vocalizations thus represent one of the closest parallels to human phonology of any known animal communication system.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSperm whales communicate using series of clicks known as codas. The codas acoustically resemble human vowels. In addition, they pattern in ways similar to human sound systems. For example, different coda types are correlated with particular click qualities, and their durations are intentionally controlled. This shows that sperm whale vocalizations are highly complex and likely constitute one of the most sophisticated communication systems in the animal kingdom. By studying it, we may be able to gain a broader understanding of animal intelligence and social behaviors, determine the impact of human activities on whale habitat, develop strategies to protect whales from threats such as noise pollution and ship traffic, and advance legislation which facilitates that protection.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586964

Changes in genome size are often attributed to variable amounts of repetitive sequences, including transposable elements. However, it remains poorly understood how such changes were accommodated while maintaining other genomic components. Elasmobranchs, including sharks, rays, and skates, exhibit high among-species variation of genome size and high within-species variation of chromosome length, offering a unique study system to address the question. In this study, we present the first whole genome sequences of the whitebelly skate with remarkably small genome size among elasmobranchs (2.2 Gb), and the red stingray. These chromosome-scale assemblies enabled the assessment of genomic compositions including centromeres and non-coding elements, which revealed notable profiles of tRNA loci and unbiased intragenomic distribution of transposons in elasmobranch genomes. Comparative analyses across these species revealed a shared genomic architecture characterized by correlations of intergenic and intronic sequence lengths with chromosome sizes, with repetitive element accumulation in elongated regions. We analyzed tandemly duplicated genes with high copy number variability. This genome-wide survey revealed the tendency for more frequent tandem gene duplications along with genome size expansion. We document the batoid HoxC cluster in the red stingray genome, which has undergone extensive repetitive element invasion and co-localizes with the HoxB cluster on a sex chromosome.

Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1) and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells. Despite B-cell depletion, PRL-associated neuroinflammation, driven by myeloid activation and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, persisted. Serum and CSF proteomic networks showed PRL-pertinent signatures, including networks unaffected by B-cell depletion.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial (n=70 clinicians) to evaluate the value of employing a custom GPT system designed to engage collaboratively with clinicians on diagnostic reasoning challenges. The collaborative design began with independent diagnostic assessments from both the clinician and the AI. These were then combined in an AI-generated synthesis that integrated the two perspectives, highlighting points of agreement and disagreement and offering commentary on each. We evaluated two workflow variants: one where the AI provided an initial opinion (AI-first), and another where it followed the clinicians assessment (AI-second).

Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake.

Traditional models suggest that {beta}arr activation requires displacement of its autoinhibitory C-tail by a phosphorylated GPCR C-terminus; however, this paradigm fails to explain how minimally phosphorylated GPCRs still complex with {beta}arrs. Using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer imaging and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we observe basal dynamics in which the {beta}arr1 C-tail spontaneously releases from the N-domain, transiently adopting an active conformation that can facilitate binding of the phosphorylated GPCR C-terminus. We further demonstrate the importance of an intermediate state of {beta}arr1 arising from spontaneous C-tail release stabilized by the membrane phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2. Both PI(4,5)P2 and mutations in the proximal or middle regions of the C-tail shift {beta}arr1 towards a partially released state, revealing an allosteric connection that informs a refined model for {beta}arr activation.

We used simultaneous EEG and respiratory recordings over a full night of sleep collected from N = 23 healthy participants to unravel the nested dynamics of respiration phase-locked excitability states across the wake-sleep cycle. We demonstrate a prominent phase shift in the coupling of aperiodic brain activity to respiratory rhythms as participants were transitioning from wakefulness to sleep.

We captured multiple conformational and compositional states, including the DNA-bound dCas12f-{sigma}E-RNAP holoenzyme complex, revealing how RNA-guided DNA binding leads to {sigma}E-RNAP recruitment and nascent mRNA synthesis at a precisely defined distance downstream of the R-loop. Rather than following the classical paradigm of {sigma}E-dependent promoter recognition, these studies show that recognition of the -35 element is largely supplanted by CRISPR-Cas targeting, while the melted -10 element is stabilized through unusual stacking interactions rather than insertion into the typical recognition pocket. Collectively, this work provides high-resolution insights into an unexpected mechanism of RNA-guided transcription, expanding our understanding of bacterial gene regulation and opening new avenues for programmable transcriptional control.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586964

Here, we demonstrate that SALL4, a transcription factor strongly expressed in cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) and associated with syndromes featuring craniofacial anomalies, plays a critical role in this early regulatory process. Using a SALL4-haploinsufficient human iPSC model that recapitulates clinical haploinsufficiency, we show that the SALL4A isoform directly interacts with the BAF complex subunit DPF2 through its zinc-finger-3 domain. This interaction enables SALL4-mediated recruitment of BAF to CNCC-specific enhancers during early neural plate stages. Without functional SALL4, BAF fails to load at chromatin, leaving CNCC enhancers inaccessible despite normal neuroectodermal progression. Consequently, cells cannot undergo proper CNCC induction and specification due to persistent enhancer repression. Our findings reveal SALL4 as an essential regulator of BAF-dependent enhancer activation during early neural crest development, providing molecular insights into SALL4-associated craniofacial anomalies.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586964

The factors controlling this process are largely unknown. Here, we used arrayed CRISPR-mediated gene activation and ablation to discover new pSyn129 modulators. Using quadruple-guide RNAs (qgRNAs) and Cas9, or an inactive Cas9 version fused to a synthetic transactivator, we ablated 2304 and activated 2428 human genes related to mitochondrial, trafficking and motility function in HEK293 cells. After exposure of cells to -Syn fibrils, pSyn129 signals were recorded by high-throughput fluorescent microscopy and aggregates were identified by image analysis. We found that pSyn129 was increased by activating the mitochondrial protein OXR1, which decreased ATP levels and altered the mitochondrial membrane potential. Instead, pSyn129 was reduced by ablation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein EMC4, which enhanced ER-driven autophagic flux and lysosomal clearance. OXR1 activation preferentially modulated cellular reactions to fibrils derived from multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients, whereas EMC4 ablation broadly reduced pSyn129 across diverse -Syn polymorphs. These findings were confirmed in human iPSC-derived cortical and dopaminergic neurons, where OXR1 preferentially promoted somatic aggregation and EMC4 reduced both somatic and neuritic aggregates.

The dominant yeast Hanseniaspora uvarum varied dramatically in abundance (4.3-97.5%) and exhibited significant local adaptation and maladaptation patterns across orchard-variety combinations. Critically, H. uvarum local adaptation strongly predicted community composition: locally adapted populations achieved higher abundance while suppressing competitors.

However, the role of condensates in driving disease etiology remains poorly understood. Here, we identify myeloid leukemia factor 2 (MLF2) as a disease-agnostic biomarker for phase transitions, including stress granules and nuclear condensates associated with dystonia. Exploiting fluorophore-derivatized MLF2 constructs, we developed a high-content platform and computational pipeline to screen modulators of NE condensates across chemical and genetic space. We identified RNF26 and ZNF335 as protective factors that prevent the buildup of nuclear condensates sequestering K48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins. Chemical screening identified four FDA-approved drugs that potently modulate condensates by resolving polyubiquitinated cargo and MLF2 accumulation. Our exploratory integrated chemical-genetics approach suggests that modulation of zinc, and potentially autophagy and oxidative stress, is critical for condensate modulation and nuclear proteostasis, offering potential therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders. Application of our platform to a genome-wide CRISPR KO screen identified strong enrichment of candidate genes linked to primary microcephaly and related neurodevelopmental disorders. Two hypomorphic microcephaly-associated alleles of ZNF335 failed to rescue nuclear condensate accumulation in ZNF335 KO cells, suggesting that aberrant condensates and impaired nuclear proteostasis may contribute to the pathogenesis of microcephaly.

Cyclic peptides offer greater stability and potential oral delivery, but their de novo design with computational methods as agonists is unproven. Here, we used the EvoBind AI platform to design cyclic peptide agonists for GCGR from sequence alone, without any structural templates or prior binding site information. EvoBind consistently identified the receptors activation surface, producing peptides that also activated GLP1R. Of three synthesised peptides, two showed potent dual activation of GCGR and GLP1R in cAMP assays, while all three activate GLP1R, with the 18-residue design achieving EC50 values of 32 nM (GLP1R) and 542 nM (GCGR), rivalling natural hormones. The designed sequences show no similarity to known agonists, and structural modelling indicates that they adopt novel binding modes compatible with active-state stabilisation. This is made possible by EvoBinds purely sequence-based, template-free approach, which enables the discovery of alternative solutions that are inaccessible to structure-guided methods. This study presents the first successful blind de novo design of a cyclic peptide agonist for a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), using only the receptor sequence as input. The findings highlight EvoBinds capacity to go beyond static binding, offering a generalisable strategy for therapeutic discovery through target-agnostic, sequence-driven peptide design.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586964

Each sense organ is composed of two glial cells, called the sheath and socket, and one or more neurons. A major challenge in studying their development has been the lack of methods to directly observe these structures in the embryo. Here, we mine a recently published high-resolution ultrastructural dataset of a comma-stage embryo that provides an untapped resource for visualizing early developmental events. From this dataset we reconstructed all head sense organs (two amphid (AM), four cephalic (CEP), six inner labial (IL), four outer labial quadrant (OLQ), and two outer labial lateral (OLL)). Symmetric sense organs were at different stages of morphogenesis, allowing us to infer developmental steps by which they form. First, we found that the sheath glial cell begins wrapping its partner neurons at the distal tip of the dendrites where it self-fuses into a seamless tube and then ""zippers"" down the dendrite. In many cases, sheath glia wrap the progenitors of partner neurons prior to their terminal division. After sheath wrapping has begun, the socket glia wraps the sheath glia circumferentially before presumably elongating to form the mature sheath-socket channel. We also observed transient interactions not found in the mature animal, such as amphid sheath glia wrapping the AUA neuron, that may reflect ancestral relationships. This study demonstrates the value of large public EM datasets that can be mined for new insights, and sheds light on how neurons and glia undergo coordinated morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586964

BMP-dependent patterning of the secondary body axis is ancestral for Bilateria and possibly also for the bilaterian sister clade Cnidaria. However, the variety of levels of centralization of the nervous systems in Bilateria - from diffuse to fully centralized - as well as the lack of centralization of the nervous system in Cnidaria, suggest that BMP signaling cannot be perceived as a universally ""anti-neural"" signal. Here we use transgenic reporter lines in the anthozoan cnidarian Nematostella to show that BMP signaling is active in distinct neuronal populations. Moreover, attenuation of BMP signaling followed by RNA-Seq shows that BMP signaling is a positive regulator of many neuronal genes, including the top-tier neural progenitor marker soxB(2). Further, we analyze BMP signaling activity in the true jellyfish Aurelia and box jellyfish Tripedalia proving that BMP signaling in the diffuse cnidarian nervous system is not an anthozoan but an ancestral cnidarian feature, shared by anthozoans and medusozoans. Finally, we show that the highly centralized ventral nervous system of the non-model spiralian, the chaetognath Spadella, forms out of paired BMP signaling-positive domains on the lateral sides of the embryo. Together, our data suggest that one of the ancestral roles of BMP signaling was in promoting neurogenesis.

In mammals, the menthol receptor, TRPM8, is activated by temperatures below [~]26{degrees}C and is essential for the perception of cold or chemical cooling agents 4-6. A fascinating, yet still unachieved goal is to elucidate structural mechanisms whereby TRPM8 or other thermosensitive channels are gated by changes in ambient temperature. Recent studies using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have attempted to address this challenging question but are limited by difficulties in visualizing temperature-evoked conformational substates or assessing the energetic landscape governing gating transitions 7,8. Here, we close this gap by using cryo-EM to visualize TRPM8 channels in cellular membranes, where bona fide menthol- and cold-evoked open states are captured. We identify a novel  semi-swapped architecture in which interdigitation of channel subunits is substantially rearranged following repositioning of the S6 transmembrane helix and elements of the pore region. By combining this structural analysis with thermodynamic measurements using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we are able to pinpoint the pore and TRP helices as key regions undergoing stimulus-evoked conformational dynamics that drive channel gating. Structural mechanisms associated with activation are validated by comparison of human TRPM8 with the menthol-sensitive, but relatively cold-insensitive avian orthologue. We propose a free energy landscape to explain channel gating by cold or cooling agents.","NA","biorxiv",1749852586964

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1749852586964
