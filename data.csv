Many recent studies have quantified their adverse events with a focus on gastrointestinal adverse events. However, no large epidemiologic study has investigated the risk of hair loss with these medications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone. The adjusted hazard ratio for hair loss for all patients using semaglutide, for men, and for women compared to bupropion-naltrexone were 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.86-2.69), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.05-14.49), and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.17-3.72) respectively. Our results demonstrate an increased risk of hair loss with semaglutide in women. Future studies are required to ascertain the association between semaglutide and hair loss.","NA","medrxiv",1743977373948

While previous studies have focused on characterizing PASC and identifying its subphenotypes in children and adolescents following an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, the risks of PASC with Omicron-variant reinfections remain unclear. Using a real-world data approach, this study investigates the risks of PASC following reinfections during the Omicron phase in the pediatric population.

OBJECTIVETo investigate the risks of PASC diagnosis and 24 PASC symptoms and conditions after reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 during Omicron period in the pediatric population.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 40 childrens hospitals and health institutions in U.S. between January 2022 and October 2023.

EXPOSURESA second SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) or antigen tests, or a diagnose of COVID-19, occurring at least 60 days after the initial infection, compared to the initial infection.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESPASC was identified using two approaches: (1) the ICD-10- CM diagnosis code U09.9 and (2) a symptom-based definition including 24 physician-identified symptoms and conditions. Absolute risks of incident PASC were reported, and relative risks (RRs) were calculated by comparing the second infection episode with the first infection episode groups using a modified Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through exact matching and propensity scoring matching.

RESULTSA total of 465,717 individuals under 21 years old (mean [SD] age 8.17 [6.58] years; 52% male) were included. Compared to the first infection, a second infection was associated with significantly increased risk of an overall PASC diagnosis (RR, 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-2.59), and with many specific conditions including: myocarditis (RR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.46-8.86); changes in taste and smell (RR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.41-5.67); thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism (RR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.71-3.04); heart disease (RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.69 to 2.28); acute kidney injury (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.38 to 2.61); fluid and electrolyte (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.62 to 2.20); generalized pain (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.48 to 1.95); arrhythmias (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.45-1.74); abnormal liver enzyme (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.96); fatigue and malaise (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.64); musculoskeletal pain (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.37 to 1.54); abdominal pain (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.34 to 1.50); postural orthostatic tachycardia syndromes (POTS)/dysautonomia (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.51); cognitive functions (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.50); and respiratory signs and symptoms (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.33). The risks were consistent across various organ systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEChildren and adolescents face significantly higher risk of various PASC outcomes after reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest a cumulative risk of PASC and highlight the urgent need for targeted prevention strategies to reduce reinfections, which includes an increased emphasis on initial or re-vaccination of children.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDo children and adolescents face an increased risk of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) following reinfection during the Omicron era?

FindingsDuring the post-acute phase, children and adolescents with reinfection are at statistically significant increased risk of incident PASC outcomes, including an overall PASC diagnosis and 24 most commonly complaints/symptoms/diagnoses associated with PASC. The risks remained consistent across different demographic and clinical subgroups.

MeaningThese findings underscore the significant long-term health risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in children and adolescents. Public health strategies should prioritize reinfection prevention, including enhanced vaccination efforts, to mitigate the burden of PASC in the pediatric population.","NA","medrxiv",1743977373948

Systematic review identified thirty-eight studies that suffered from one particular and serious form of bias called miscategorisation bias, whereby study participants who have been vaccinated are categorised as unvaccinated up to and until some arbitrarily defined time after vaccination occurred. Simulation demonstrates that this miscategorisation bias artificially boosts vaccine efficacy and infection rates even when a vaccine has zero or negative efficacy. Furthermore, simulation demonstrates that repeated boosters, given every few months, are needed to maintain this misleading impression of efficacy. Given this, any claims of Covid-19 vaccine efficacy based on these studies are likely to be a statistical illusion or are exaggerated.","NA","medrxiv",1743977373948

The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of PASC remains elusive, largely due to the lack of suitable animal models that replicate key clinical and pathological features, especially in survivors of acute infection. Here, we employed the Omicron BA.1-infected AC70 hACE2 Tg mice to explore the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our findings in the AC70/BA.1 model demonstrated that surviving mice developed lasting neurological sequelae of COVID-19, making it a promising platform for studying the pathogenesis of neuro- or long-COVID. Histopathological examinations revealed a transient pulmonary inflammatory response that correlated with the levels of live virus, whereas neuroinflammation within the brains persisted and progressed beyond the acute phase, without a clear linkage to direct virus effects. We showed that the severity of neurological sequelae directly correlated with the degree of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption, alterations in tight junctions (TJs) and fibrinogen extravasation into the brain parenchyma. Additionally, BA.1-infected mice elicited a sustained systemic prothrombotic state, with dysregulated coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways in an organ-specific manner, as evidenced by distinct pattern of intracellular fibrin(ogen) depositions, elevated d-dimers, and tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) expression in the lungs and brains. We also found a positive correlation between progressive neuroinflammation and t-PA expression, which was closely co-localized with Iba-1-positive cells, indicating that activated microglia may serve as an additional source of t-PA in the CNS. Lastly, we showed that BA.1 variant triggered prolonged anti-Annexin A2 (ANXA2) autoantibody production. ANXA2 is essential for the neurovascular system, coordinating multiply dynamic processes within the endothelium, including cell surface fibrinolysis and TJ assembly. Our analysis revealed that impaired TJ structures coexisted with diminished ANXA2 levels around the brain vessels, suggesting its involvement in BBB dysfunction and neuroinflammation.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

Although RNAi is no longer a major mechanism of repeat control in mammals, AGO2 has retained cleavage competence and is able to efficiently cut RNAs with extensive complementarity to a bound guide. The regulatory roles this activity plays in mammals however remains poorly understood. Here we show that mice carrying two catalytically inactive Ago2 alleles have extensive developmental abnormalities including systemic vascular defects that are characterized by enlarged and leaky vessels and stem from endothelial cell dysfunction. Endothelial cell defects are caused by failure to repress Rtl1, a paternally-imprinted domesticated retrotransposon, whose cleavage in wild-type animals is triggered by miRNAs of the maternally-imprinted miR-433~127 cluster. Our data pinpoint an essential mRNA cleavage target of AGO2 and suggest that the repurposing of a TE-Argonaute regulatory interaction contributes to the retention of AGO catalytic competence in mammals.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

However, the mechanism of ribosome recruitment to mRNA start sites strikingly differs between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The eukaryotic small (40S) ribosomal subunit binds 5' end caps and scans for the start codon while the bacterial small (30S) subunit directly binds to the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) motif close to the initiation site. Pioneer studies have shown rare 30S loading events further upstream within 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs), at ribosome standby sites (1-3). Together with the frequent occurrence of long bacterial mRNA 5'UTRs and degenerated SD sequences, this indicates that the 30S subunit might bind upstream of the SD more commonly than currently thought. We therefore developed 30S-seq to map 30S-mRNA interactions in a bacterial transcriptome (Escherichia coli), inspired by translation complex profile sequencing (TCP-seq) previously used in eukaryotes (4,5). Our results provide new and unsuspected insights into the behaviour of 30S and 70S complexes during the canonical translation initiation process. Notably, 30S subunits are recruited upstream of the start codon, primed to receive the SD released by the departing 70S ribosome. Remarkably, we also find hundreds of non-canonical 30S binding sites within mRNA 5'UTRs, sometimes over 100 nucleotides upstream of the start region. We validated several of these upstream ribosome binding sites, and demonstrated their strong impact on gene expression. Thus, even in bacteria, ribosomes frequently bind mRNAs outside of the start region to initiate translation, challenging the classic ribosome binding site model.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

Three scenarios were analysed: a normal winter (22 weeks), a COVID-19-like pandemic (4-week wave), and a severe pandemic (8-week wave). Avoided infections were translated into healthcare, economic and avoided quality-adjusted life years (QALY) metrics. Costs included purchasing, installing, maintaining, and operating UV-C lamps. In Switzerland, cost-benefit ratios ranged from one franc to: 30-290 CHF during a normal winter; 65-430 CHF during a COVID-like pandemic; and 2,300-20,500 CHF during a severe pandemic. In Germany, cost benefit ratios ranged from 1 euro to: 7-226 EUR during a normal winter; 118-449 EUR during a COVID-like pandemic; and 659-18,946 EUR during a severe pandemic.

However, because the piggyBac transposase originates from a lepidopteran genome, concerns about potential endogenous activity and remobilization raise questions about its suitability for long-term genomic modifications across a wide range of species. As an alternative, we tested the effectiveness of the Minos transposase, a Tc1/mariner family element derived from a dipteran insect, for stable germline transformation in the pantry moth Plodia interpunctella. By injecting a Minos-based construct along with in vitro synthesized Minos transposase mRNA into syncytial embryos, we observed somatic activity of the 3xP3::EGFP eye/glia reporter gene in only 1 out of 14 (7.1%) injected G0 individuals that reached the pupal stage. Nonetheless, pooled in-crossing of G0 individuals resulted in high rates of germline transmission of the transgene, with 23.6% of G1 pupae showing 3xP3-driven eye fluorescence. Together with a previous study in Bombyx silkworms, these data suggest that Minos-mediated transgenesis yields practical rates of germline integration in Lepidoptera, providing an alternative tool for functional genomics in species where piggyBac may not be optimal.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

However, many questions about TADs' function and their influence on transcription remain unresolved due to technical limitations in defining TAD boundaries and measuring the direct effect that TADs have on gene expression. Here, we develop consensus TAD maps for human and mouse with a novel ""bag-of-genes"" approach for defining the gene composition within TADs. This approach enables new functional interpretations of TADs by providing a way to capture species-level differences in chromatin organization. We also leverage a generative AI foundation model computed from 33 million transcriptomes to define contextual similarity, an embedding-based metric that is more powerful than co-expression at representing functional gene relationships. Our analytical framework directly leads to testable hypotheses about chromatin organization across cellular states. We find that TADs play an active role in facilitating gene co-regulation, possibly through a mechanism involving transcriptional condensates. We also discover that the TAD-linked enhancement of transcriptional context is strongest in early developmental stages and systematically declines with aging. Investigation of cancer cells show distinct patterns of TAD usage that shift with chemotherapy treatment, suggesting specific roles for TAD-mediated regulation in cellular development and plasticity. Finally, we develop ""TAD signatures"" to improve statistical analysis of single-cell transcriptomic data sets in predicting cancer cell-line drug response.

Particularly for transcriptional enhancers, deep learning models excel at deciphering sequence features and grammar that underlie their spatiotemporal activity. To enable end-to-end enhancer modeling and design, we developed a software and modeling package, called CREsted. It combines preprocessing starting from single-cell ATAC-seq data; modeling with a choice of several architectures for training classification and regression models on either topics or pseudobulk peak heights; sequence design using multiple strategies; and downstream analysis through a collection of tools to locate transcription factor (TF) binding sites, infer the effect of a TF (activating or repressing) on enhancer accessibility, decipher enhancer grammar, and score gene loci. We demonstrate CREsted using a mouse cortex model that we validate using the BICCN collection of in vivo validated mouse brain enhancers. Classical enhancers in immune cells, including the IFNB1 enhanceosome are revisited using a PBMC model, and we assess the accuracy of TF binding site predictions with ChIP-seq. Additionally, we use CREsted to compare mesenchymal-like cancer cell states between tumor types; and we investigate different fine-tuning strategies of Borzoi within CREsted, comparing their performance and explainability with CREsted models trained from scratch. Finally, we train a CREsted model on a scATAC-seq atlas of zebrafish development and use this to design and in vivo validate cell type-specific synthetic enhancers in three tissues.

Microglial mutations are directly linked to many neurodevelopmental (e.g., schizophrenia) and neurodegenerative (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) disorders, indicating the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of microglia for treating these conditions. Currently, we lack robust molecular tools to specifically image and manipulate microglia in vivo, which presents a major hurdle in our understanding of the brain-wide functions of these cells during the early onset of brain diseases. Here, we describe a molecular technology for imaging and manipulation of homeostatic microglia in live organisms (e.g., in zebrafish and mice) by covalently targeting the purinergic receptor, P2RY12. Using this technology, we imaged microglia-pathogen interactions in the larval zebrafish brain and revealed various morphological states of microglia in the adult mouse brain. We further expanded the microglia labelling approach to single-microglia tracking and microglial surfaceome mapping using photoactivatable fluorophores and photoproximity labelling, respectively. We anticipate the use of this universal tool for studying microglial biology across species to reveal the dynamics and polarization of resting microglia into a reactive state found in many neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

Domestication of its wild progenitor, the African wildcat (F. lybica), is widely attributed to the emergence of farming. Wildcats are said to have been attracted to settled communities by the rodent populations that were thriving within this new agricultural niche. Some claim the African wildcat even reached Europe during the Neolithic, though many credit the Romans with their dispersal. Through a program of zooarchaeological analysis, genetic identification and radiocarbon dating, we redefine the established chronology for the cats domestication and dispersal across Europe. We argue that early human-cat relationships were more complex than the commensal and mutualistic pathways that have been proposed, and that both the domestication and translocation of cats were linked to its association with deities. Our results suggest domestic cats first arrived in Europe prior to Roman expansion during the early first millennium BCE, and that successive populations of domestic cats with unique mitochondrial signatures were introduced during the Roman, Late Antique and Viking periods. Lastly, by characterising the spatiotemporal representation of both domestic cats and the native European wildcat (F. silvestris), we argue that the introduction of domestic cats precipitated a decline in native European wildcat populations.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

However, we have a limited understanding of how TMS influences neural activity in the sgACC, owing to its deep location within the brain. To better understand the mechanism of antidepressant response to TMS, we recruited two neurosurgical patients with indwelling electrodes and delivered TMS pulses to the DLPFC while simultaneously recording local field potentials from the sgACC. Spectral analysis revealed a decrease in high-frequency activity (HFA; 70-180 Hz) after each stimulation pulse, which was especially pronounced in the sgACC relative to other regions. TMS-evoked HFA power was generally anticorrelated between the DLPFC and sgACC, even while low-frequency phase locking between the two regions was enhanced. Together, these findings support the notion that TMS to the DLPFC can suppress neural firing in the sgACC, suggesting a possible mechanism by which this treatment regulates mood.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season. Methods. Employees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results. Among 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%). Conclusions. This study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.","NA","medrxiv",1743977373948

These were classified into two groups: Pama-Nyungan (PN), comprised of one language Family, and Non-Pama-Nyungan (NPN) with more than 20 language Families. The Yolngu people belong to the larger PN Family and live in Arnhem Land in northern Australia. They are surrounded by groups who speak NPN languages. This study, using nuclear genomic and mitochondrial DNA data, was undertaken to shed light on the origins of the Yolngu people and their language. The nuclear genomic sequences of Yolngu people were compared to those of other Indigenous Australians, as well as Papuan, African, East Asian and European people. Materials and methods: With the agreement of Indigenous participants, samples were collected from 13 Yolngu individuals and 4 people from neighbouring NPN speakers and their nuclear genomes sequenced to a 30x coverage. Using the short-read DNA BGISEQ-500 technology, these sequences were mapped to a reference genome and identified ~24.86 million Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs). The Yolngu SNVs were then compared to those of 36 individuals from 10 other Indigenous populations/locations across Australia and four worldwide populations using multidimensional scaling, population structure, F3 statistics and phylogenetic analyses. Results: Using the above methods, we infer that Yolngu speakers are closely related to neighbouring NPN speakers, followed by the Weipa population. No European or East Asian admixture was detected in the genomes of the Yolngu speakers studied here, which contrasts with the genomes of many other PN speakers that have been studied. Our results show that Yolngu speakers are more closely related to other PN speakers in the northeast of Australia than to those in central and western Australia studied here. Yolngu and the other Australian populations from this study share Papuans as an out-group. Discussion: The study presented here provides an account of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomic diversity within the PN Yolngu Aboriginal population. The results show the Yolngu sample and their NPN neighbours have a strong genetic relationship. They also offer evidence of ancestral links between the Yolngu and PN-speaking populations in Cape York. From earlier fingerprint studies, consistent with the genomic results shown here, we suggest that there was a movement of people from the east into northeast Arnhem Land, associated with the flooding of the Sahul Shelf, and that this occurred between about 11 Kya and 8 Kya ago. Several Yolngu myths point to such a movement. It is suggested that the spread of the PN language or its speakers may have influenced the population structure of the Yolngu. Further genomic studies, with larger samples, of populations to the east of the Yolngu around the Gulf of Carpentaria into Cape York are required to test this hypothesis. Our results imply that PN did not spread with the movement of people across the continent, rather, the PN languages diffused among the different populations. It seems clear that the languages dispersed and not the people. The low level of relatedness detected between the Yolngu people and the people of the central arid desert of Australia suggests a long period of separation with different patterns of migration. Beyond Australia, Yolngu are most closely related to the Papuan people of New Guinea.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

Studies employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) identified increased activation in specific brain regions during different cognitive states. However, the neural processes during the performance of an intelligence test remains largely unknown. This study considers intelligence as a whole-brain network phenomenon and investigates how the connectedness of specific brain regions contributes to performance on the Raven Progressive Matrices (RAPM), a well-established intelligence test. Connectedness was characterized with graph-theoretical measures based on functional connectivity derived from fMRI BOLD (N=67) and EEG theta-band (N=128) activity. The results reveal that the extent to which specific frontal and parietal regions are connected to other brain systems during intelligence testing relates to individual test performance. These regions may act as controllers, enabling flexible and efficient switches between cognitive states required to excel in intelligence tests.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

Uncertainty remains regarding whether domestic cats originated in the Levant, Egypt or elsewhere in its natural range, and on the timing and circumstances of their dispersal into Europe. By analysing 87 ancient and modern cat genomes, we demonstrate that domestic cats did not spread to Europe with Neolithic farmers, as previously thought. Conversely, our results suggest that they were introduced to Europe over the last 2,000 years, most likely from North Africa. We also demonstrate that a separate earlier (1st millennium BCE) introduction of wildcats from Northwest Africa originated the present-day wild population in Sardinia.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

Yet, the direct impact of sweeteners on gut bacteria remains largely uncharacterized. Here we report interactions between 25 phylogenetically diverse gut bacterial strains and 39 commercially used sweeteners. We tested these sweeteners individually and in combination with four commonly co-consumed compounds, viz., advantame, caffeine, vanillin, and duloxetine. Three quarters of the tested sweeteners individually impacted growth of at least one bacterial strain. Further, over 100 interactions were found between sweeteners and the four co-consumed compounds. Isosteviol, a commonly used sweetener, and duloxetine, an antidepressant, synergistically inhibited Roseburia intestinalis, a bacterium previously linked to glucose homeostasis, and Parabacteroides merdae, a prevalent commensal linked to healthy microbiota. Proteomic, metabolomic, and genetic analyses indicate altered small molecule transport underpinning this sweetener-drug synergy. The isosteviol-duloxetine combination also modulated metabolism of a synthetic gut bacterial community leading to increased toxicity to HeLa cells and altered secretion of inflammation modulatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 by Caco-2 cells. Together, our data bring forward the prevalence of interactions between low-calorie sweeteners and common xenobiotics.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

Over the past decade, the concept of minimum selective concentrations (MSC) has been adopted in environmental regulation to define maximum permissible antibiotic concentrations. Such empirically determined MSC values often fail to reflect the complexity of natural communities, where susceptibility and resistance-associated fitness costs vary widely across species. To address this limitation, computational approaches have been developed to predict no-effect concentrations for selection of antibiotic resistance (PNECres) from routinely collected minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data. However, these approaches often lack a strong ecological basis, undermining confidence in their predictions. Here, we propose a simple but biologically consistent framework to derive PNECres values by integrating MIC data with probabilistic estimates of resistance-related fitness costs. Our results suggest that current regulatory environmental threshold concentrations should be lowered by at least one order of magnitude to guard against selection for antibiotic resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

MethodsData were extracted from linked administrative healthcare claims and electronic health records (EHR) for vaccinations from 23 August 2024 through 24 December 2024 and followed through 31 December 2024. We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study with propensity score weighting to adjust for differences between groups to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 outcomes. VE was calculated as 1 minus the hazard ratio (HR) from Cox proportional hazards models.

ResultsOverall, 465,073 mRNA-1273 KP.2 vaccine recipients were matched 1:1 to unexposed adults. The mean (standard deviation) age was 63 (17) years, with more than half of the population being 65 years or older. Approximately 70% of individuals had an underlying medical condition making them high risk for severe outcomes for COVID-19. VE was 52.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.8%, 65.8%) against COVID-19-related hospitalization and 39.4% (35.0%, 43.5%) against medically attended COVID-19 over a median follow-up of 57 (interquartile range: 33-78) days.

ConclusionThe mRNA-1273 KP.2 vaccine demonstrated significant incremental effectiveness in preventing hospitalization with COVID-19 and medically attended COVID-19 in adults during the 2024-2025 season to date. These findings support ongoing vaccination efforts to mitigate the public health impact of COVID-19.

A frontocentral ERP associated with reward feedback, the reward positivity (RewP), has been linked to reflect information about reward value and motivational states. It is, however, unclear if changes in the RewP are influenced by changes in reward value as a function of motivational state. To examine this, hungry participants (n=31) completed two rounds of a modified Doors Task incorporating Pavlovian conditioning during EEG recordings and obtained feedback associated with sweet and savory food reinforcers equally matched in pleasantness and desirability. Participants underwent reinforcer devaluation, a paradigm designed to isolate inference-based behavior based on decreasing reward value, in between rounds by eating one of the foods to satiety. Prior to devaluation, participants were hungry and rated both food reinforcers equally pleasant. After devaluation, participants were sated and rated the devalued food, but not the non-devalued food, significantly less pleasant, suggesting a sensory-specific change in reward value. Logistic regression of win-stay/lose-switch behavior during the Doors Task shows participants made sensory-specific adjustments in food preferences during post-devaluation. Non-parametric permutation tests based on the tmax statistic performed revealed no significant differences in RewP amplitudes, suggesting the RewP is insensitive to reinforcer devaluation. This could not be explained by differences in perceived pleasantness or desirability. These findings suggest the RewP signals general properties of reward value if assessment involved inference.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

However, analyzing these increasingly complex datasets requires specialized expertise across computational biology, statistics, and biological context. To address this challenge, we introduce the Spatial Transcriptomics AI Agent (STAgent), an autonomous multimodal agentic AI that integrates multimodal large language models (LLMs) with specialized computational tools to transform weeks-long analysis tasks into minutes of automated processing. Unlike conventional machine learning approaches that are limited to narrow, predefined tasks, STAgent leverages the emergent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, such as flexible reasoning, contextual understanding, and cross-modal integration, which allow it to adapt to novel data, execute multi-step analyses, and generate biologically meaningful insights with minimal human input. STAgent enables autonomous deep research through integrated capabilities, including dynamic code generation for complex analytical workflows, visual reasoning for interpreting spatial patterns, real-time retrieval of relevant peer-reviewd scientific literature, and synthesis of comprehensive, actionable reports. We applied STAgent to investigate the in vivo maturation of human stem cell-derived pancreatic cells (SC-pancreas) transplanted into immunodeficient mice. We generated single-cell spatial transcriptomics data spanning multiple developmental timepoints. STAgent autonomously (1) identified the maturation of initially scattered endocrine cells into well-defined islet-like structures, with predominantly peripheral -cells surrounding {beta}-cell cores supported by an expanding mesenchymal network; (2) revealed strengthening endocrine-endocrine cell interactions over time and, through context-aware gene set analysis, uncovered spatially resolved biological processes driving maturation; (3) unlike traditional analytical approaches, STAgent offers mechanistic explanations of spatial patterns, contextualizing findings with relevant literatures and developing cohesive insights into human pancreatic development. This agentic approach establishes a new paradigm in spatial transcriptomics analysis by substantially lowering the expertise barrier and reducing analysis time, accelerating biological and biomedical discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

Cells therefore require mechanisms to resolve these lesions during mitosis. The CIP2A-TOPBP1 complex is described to function as a molecular tether that connects fragmented DNA molecules. However, whether CIP2A also functions in processing of incompletely replicated DNA remained unclear. We show that CIP2A-TOPBP1 forms large filamentous structures at sites of incomplete DNA replication during mitosis, which recruit the SMX tri-nuclease complex members SLX4, MUS81 and ERCC1/XPF. These structures form in proximity to sites of mitotic DNA synthesis, although CIP2A is not required for mitotic DNA synthesis. In addition to its globular and coiled-coil domain, the unstructured C-terminal domain of CIP2A is essential for CIP2A-TOPBP1 filamentous structure formation and recruitment of the SMX complex. BRCA1-/- and BRCA2-/- cells have increased mitotic DNA lesions that recruit CIP2A and SLX4. We show that the C-terminal part of CIP2A is required for survival of BRCA2-/- cells. Moreover, SLX4 is crucial for genome stability in BRCA2-/- cells. Combined, we demonstrate that CIP2A-TOPBP1 recruits the SMX complex during mitosis, which is required to resolve mitotic DNA lesions, allows faithful chromosome segregation and maintain viability of BRCA2-/- cells.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

Unlike other cell functions, such as proliferation which can be studied using high-throughput assays, cell migration requires more sophisticated instruments and analysis, which decreases throughput and has led to more limited mechanistic advances in our understanding of cell migration. Current assays either preclude single-cell level analysis, require tedious manual tracking, or use fluorescently labeled cells, which greatly limit the number of extracellular conditions and molecular manipulations that can be studied in a reasonable amount of time. Using the migration of cancer cells as a testbed, we established a workflow that images large numbers of cells in real time, using a 96-well plate format. We developed and validated a machine-vision and deep-learning analysis method, DeepBIT, to automatically detect and track the migration of individual cells from time-lapsed videos without cell labeling and user bias. We demonstrate that our assay can examine cancer cell motility behavior in many conditions, using different small-molecule inhibitors of known and potential regulators of migration, different extracellular conditions such as different contents in extracellular matrix and growth factors, and different CRISPR-mediated knockouts. About 1500 cells per well were tracked in 840 different conditions, for a total of ~1.3M tracked cells, in 70h (5 min per condition). Manual tracking of these cells by a trained user would take ~5.5 years. This demonstration reveals previously unidentified molecular regulators of cancer cell migration and suggests that collagen content can change the sign of how cytoskeletal molecules can regulate cell migration.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

Older adults experience brain changes associated with aging and cognitive decline at different ages and progress at varying rates, leading to heterogeneous patterns of cognitive decline. As a result, people within the same diagnostic category often exhibit significant differences in cognitive abilities and brain functions. The present study aimed to investigate how data-driven categories map onto diagnostic categories. Therefore, using data from 515 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database and a multivariate clustering approach, Similarity Network Fusion, we combined brain imaging features (cortical thickness average, surface area, and volume) with cognitive measures (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive, Mini-Mental State Exam, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Clinical Dementia Rating) in older adults who had a clinical diagnosis of CU, MCI, or AD. We identified four data-driven groups spanning a gradient of cognitive and neural severity. Group 1 (87% diagnosed with dementia) showed the most significant impairment, while Group 4 (96% cognitively unimpaired) showed minimal impairment. Groups 2 and 3 captured transitional stages, including an ""at-risk"" group with early neural and cognitive decline. The current study provides evidence that more nuanced, data-driven approaches can reveal commonalities in individuals' etiology and underlying neurobiology across traditional diagnoses. These results may lead to more focal therapies and a better understanding of who is at risk for converting to dementia, allowing for earlier detection and treatment of cognitive decline.","NA","medrxiv",1743977373948

Many studies focus on cell renewal through regeneration, while fewer studies explore mechanisms that promote cell longevity despite cell death stimuli. Here, we reveal that the adult Drosophila hindgut ileum is an excellent model to study tissue maintenance by long-lived cells. Hindgut ileal enterocytes resist the damaging detergent SDS and upstream caspase signaling by head-involution-defective (hid). This hid-induced death insensitivity arises early in adulthood and associates with numerous transcriptional changes. We interrogated 82 of these transcriptional changes in a candidate screen for enhancers of hid-induced death in the ileum. Top among our screen hits is an immunoglobulin family cell adhesion gene, CG15312. CG15312 maintains the adhesion protein FasIII on cell membranes. In hid-expressing ileal cells, CG15312 loss causes cell death and pyknotic nuclear clustering. We name this conserved gene low on-membrane fas and enhancer of hid (loofah).

Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells.

Using EEG-based neural encoding models based on temporal response functions, we investigated how 7-month-old infants track maternal vs. unfamiliar speech and whether this affects simultaneous face processing. Infants showed stronger neural tracking of their mothers voice, independent of acoustic properties, suggesting an early neural signature of voice familiarity. Face tracking responses differed depending on the voice infants heard. When listening to a strangers voice, face-tracking accuracy at central electrodes increased with occipital face tracking, suggesting heightened attentional engagement. However, we found no evidence for differential processing of happy vs. fearful faces, contrasting previous findings on early emotion discrimination. Our results reveal interactive effects of voice familiarity on multimodal processing in infancy: while maternal speech enhances neural tracking, it may also alter how other social cues, such as faces, are processed. The findings suggest that early auditory experiences shape how infants allocate cognitive resources to social stimuli, emphasizing the need to consider cross-modal influences in early development.

Significance statementHow infants continuously process familiar social signals and how this familiarity shapes perception has remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that infants brains preferentially track maternal speech over unfamiliar voices, highlighting the early tuning of the auditory system to socially relevant signals. Moreover, the maternal voice modulates the neural encoding of concurrently presented faces--altering the interplay between early visual and attentional processing--without eliciting emotion-specific differences. These findings underscore the role of caregiver signals in shaping multisensory integration during early development.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

Using metacell flow analysis, we reveal that neural stem cells (NSCs) progressively shift from a progenitor-biased state toward an astrocytic lineage and that this process is accompanied with changes in DNA methylation and 3D genome organization. A model integrating transcription factor motif affinities with epigenetic features identifies key regulators of cis-regulatory element (CRE) activation.

We show that memory of navigational episodes does not achieve a stable state, but rather continues to transform for many years. Our data suggest that at any given point in time, memory of navigational episodes is a changing combination of episode-independent schematic information with several interacting spatial representations that directly relate to a navigational episode and that show distinct decay rates.

As dataset sizes keep increasing, the time and expertise required for accurate and consistent human curation pose a major challenge for experimental labs. To address this issue, we developed UnitRefine, a classification toolbox that leverages diverse machine-learning algorithms to minimize manual curation efforts. Using acute recordings with Neuropixels probes, we collected a large neural dataset with reproducible experimental conditions and had multiple expert human curators label each recording for reliable cluster identification. This carefully labeled dataset served as the foundation for our automated curation system to learn from human annotations and replicate curator decisions. UnitRefine incorporates existing and newly developed quality metrics, including hyper-synchronous spiking events and drifts in firing rate, to automatically separate noise from neural clusters with high accuracy. To address inherent labeling imbalances between well-isolated single-unit clusters and mixed-population activity, we implemented a cascading classification system. UnitRefine uses a comprehensive hyperparameter optimization search across various classification algorithms to identify optimal model parameters. Across recordings, an optimized Random Forest decoder outperformed other approaches, with up to 83% balanced decoding accuracy for unseen recordings. The broad applicability of UnitRefine is demonstrated by its successful performance across diverse labs and recording conditions, including high-density probes in mice, rats, mole rats, primates, and clinical recordings in epilepsy patients. UnitRefine is developed for broad community adoption. It is fully integrated into the open-source SpikeInterface toolbox, allowing users to either apply our pre-trained models or generate new decoders based on their own curation.

The disease can lead to hepatic, renal, and pulmonary dysfunctions and may contribute to the development of chronic kidney disease. The Complement System plays a crucial role in eliminating bacteria by generating opsonins, anaphylotoxins, that degranulate mastocytes and basophils, and attract immune cells to the infection site, among other important functions. This study aimed to investigate the role of C3, the central protein of the Complement System, in vivo during chronic infection of L interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain FIOCRUZ L1-130 (LIC). C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and C3 knockout (C3KO) mice were infected with 108 LIC and monitored at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 180 days post-infection (d.p.i.). LIC-infected C3KO mice exhibited a significantly higher leptospiral load in the kidneys compared to WT counterparts. Both groups showed local inflammation at 15 and 30 d.p.i., but only C3KO LIC-infected mice had a higher number of Leptospira DNA copies at 30 d.p.i. At the same time point, C3KO LIC-infected mice developed a larger fibrotic area than WT mice. Interestingly, independent of C3, mice pre-treated with a nephrotoxic drug increased the renal inflammatory response; however, this pretreatment did not affect the local leptospiral load in infected mice. Additionally, levels of specific IgG2b and IgG3 antibodies were significantly higher in LIC-infected C3KO mice compared to WT mice. Proteomic analysis showed lower levels of C5/C5a in WT and C3KO LIC-infected mice, as well as in C3KO control mice. M-CSF and SDF-1 cytokine levels were reduced in both LIC-infected groups. Furthermore, naive T lymphocytes count (both CD4+ and CD8+) were higher in LIC-infected C3KO mice, whereas effector CD8+ T lymphocyte numbers declined during LIC infection - a phenomenon more pronounced in C3KO mice. Overall, this study demonstrates that during LIC infection, the absence of C3 does not affect mouse survival but leads to increased renal leptospiral load and fibrosis. Additionally, it highlights the crucial role of C3 in supporting the maturation and differentiation of T lymphocytes into pre-effector cells, underscoring its importance as a key link between the innate and adaptive immune responses in leptospirosis.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

One factor affecting IVF efficacy is mitotic-origin (mosaic) aneuploidy in which embryos contain a mixture of cells with different numbers of chromosomes. We previously showed that chromosome segregation error phenotypes are frequent in the first mitotic division of the human embryo. However, the cause of these errors and impact on daughter cell karyotype is unknown. Here, using live chromosome imaging and next generation sequencing we show that activation of the microtubule depolymerase KIF2C reduces chromosome segregation errors and mitotic-origin aneuploidy at the 2-cell stage. The number of first divisions that show alternative cleavage patterns (associated with failed embryo development in IVF clinics) are also reduced with KIF2C activation. Our findings demonstrate that modulation of microtubule dynamics is a potential therapeutic route to improving human embryo quality and IVF outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

Emerging preclinical data suggests activated EGC have beneficial roles in controlling gut pathophysiology. Objective: Understanding EGC activation and adaptation during experimental and clinical IBD. Design: We provide the first highly integrated approach to identify EGC activation signature in IBD. Profiling 390 samples from IBD patients via bulk and single-nucleus (sn) transcriptomics and replicate the findings on publicly available bulk and single-cell (sc) datasets from 1160 patients and 19,000 single EGC. Preclinical modelling of Th1/Th17 inflammation, reporter-assisted EGC sorting, analysis of regulated cell death, and Casp8 ablation in EGC was performed. Results: We identified novel IBD type and sampling associated EGC activation signature. Specific EGC activation markers were shared in biopsies and resection specimens, and were divergent between Crohns disease and Ulcerative colitis. Preclinical modelling of intestinal inflammation identified combinatorial TNF and IFN-{gamma}-driven activation of EGC, associated with elevated necroptosis, and negatively impacting gut motility. Genetic-reporter-enabled sorting and downstream analyses confirmed TNF and IFN-{gamma}-driven EGC necroptosis, potentiated by Casp8 deficiency. Furthermore, snRNA-Seq from IBD patient samples confirmed elevated cell death signature in activated but not in rare neuroglia progenitor-like cluster. Conclusion: Our findings identify IBD type-associated activated EGC markers involved in immune and epithelial homeoastasis. We uncover necroptosis of activated EGCs as a constituent of intestinal inflammation. Advancing our understanding of activated EGC survival is pivotal in elucidating their complex roles in maintaining gut immune-epithelial homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

Transposable elements (TEs) are increasingly recognized as contributors to genome evolution, but their role in shaping neural crest regulatory programs remains underexplored. Here, we investigate the domestication of human-specific TEs as transcriptional enhancers during cranial neural crest cell (CNCC) specification, a process critical for vertebrate head development. Using human iPSC-derived CNCCs, we identified ~250 human-specific TEs acting as active enhancers. These TEs were predominantly LTR5Hs and, to a lesser extent, SVA-E/Fs. We demonstrate that these elements have been co-opted through the acquisition of the conserved CNCC coordinator motif, and are bound by the CNCC signature factor TWIST1, and that their co-option appears to be largely exclusive to CNCCs. To assess their functional relevance, we used CRISPR-interference to repress ~75% of all the LTR5Hs and SVAs active in CNCCs, which led to widespread transcriptional changes in genes associated with neural crest migration, a process essential for CNCCs to populate the embryo and form craniofacial structures. Using a cell migration assay, we showed that CNCC migration was significantly impaired by CRISPR-mediated TE repression. Finally, we demonstrate that genes near human-specific TEs are more highly expressed in human CNCCs relative to chimpanzee, and TE repression returns their expression to chimpanzee levels. These findings reveal how human-specific TEs have been co-opted to fine-tune CNCC regulatory networks, potentially contributing to the evolution of lineage-specific craniofacial traits.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

DNA analysis has become an essential tool for taxonomic research and biodiversity assessment; however, freezer storage for all samples is impractical due to space limitations and operational costs. This creates a pressing need to develop more widely applicable DNA preservation methods. We investigated the comparative effects of traditional preservation methods versus DESS (DMSO/EDTA/saturated NaCl solution) preservation on both morphology and DNA integrity using museum specimens from various taxonomic groups. Our results demonstrated that DESS preservation maintained high-quality DNA fragments exceeding >15 kb at room temperature across all examined species, with nematode samples maintaining DNA integrity even after 10 years of storage. When preserving whole organisms, the optimal preservation solution conditions for maintaining both morphological features and DNA integrity varied among species. Notably, DNA integrity was maintained even after complete evaporation of the DESS solution. These findings suggest that DESS utilization for specimen DNA preservation is effective across many species, not only for long-term storage in environments without freezer facilities but also for temporary preservation until freezing.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

To transmit from its human host to mosquito vector, malaria parasites differentiate into male and female, semi-quiescent stages that can re-initiate development within seconds after transmission. Here, we identify the RNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) as the mediator of a rapid, sex-specific, and temperature-sensitive mechanism to restructure protein synthesis during transmission. We find that male parasites maintain high levels of translation during their semi-quiescence that are rapidly repressed following mosquito uptake. This translational shutdown is essential for the continuation of male parasite development and depends on the m6A-binding protein YTH.2. We further show that m6A and YTH.2 are already present prior to transmission, but that their repressive interaction requires a temperature drop accompanying the exit from the human host. Hence, m6A appears to prime the parasite transcriptome and subsequently converts an environmental shift into a rapid translational response.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

A key obstacle to progress is the fact that traditional methods for inducing sleep deprivation (SD) in animal models often introduce confounding stress or disrupt circadian rhythms. Here, we present JACUZI-SD (Jetting Automated Currents Under Zebrafish to Induce Sleep Deprivation), a fully automated, high-throughput system designed to induce sleep deprivation in larval zebrafish with minimal stress. By delivering randomized water pulses via a custom milli-fluidic device integrated with a 96-well plate, JACUZI-SD promotes wakefulness during the natural dark cycle without the stress associated with existing SD methods. Our results demonstrate that JACUZI-SD reduces total sleep time by 41-64% and elicits a robust rebound sleep characterized by increased sleep bout length following deprivation. Importantly, this method avoids activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) stress axis, as evidenced by reduced stress marker expression compared to other deprivation methods. Additionally, the system reliably activates established sleep pressure pathways, including the upregulation of galanin in the neurosecretory preoptic area, while also revealing biologically relevant inter-individual variability in homeostatic rebound responses. JACUZI-SD provides a powerful, minimally invasive platform for dissecting the neural and molecular underpinnings of sleep homeostasis in vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

As a result, ectopic D-2HG accumulation induces neurometabolic disorders and promotes progression of multiple cancers. However, the disease-associated effects of ectopic D-2HG accumulation are dependent on genetic context. Specifically, neomorphic mutations in the mammalian genes Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 result in the production of enzymes that inappropriately generate D-2HG from -ketoglutarate (KG). Within this genetic background, D-2HG acts as an oncometabolite and is associated with multiple cancers, including several diffuse gliomas. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in the gene D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D2hgdh) render cells unable to degrade D-2HG, resulting in excessive buildup of this molecule. D2hgdh mutations, however, are not generally associated with elevated cancer risk. This discrepancy raises the question as to why ectopic D-2HG accumulation in humans induces context-dependent disease outcomes. To enable such genetic studies in vivo, we generated two novel loss-of-function mutations in the Drosophila melanogaster gene D2hgdh and validated that these alleles result in ectopic D-2HG. Moreover, we observed that D2hgdh mutations induce developmental and metabolomic phenotypes indicative of elevated D-2HG accumulation. Overall, our efforts provide the Drosophila community with new mutant strains that can be used to study D-2HG function in human disease models as well as in the context of normal growth, metabolism, and physiology.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373948

However, it is unclear whether circulating glucose levels affect mood subconsciously or via subjectively sensed metabolic states. Here, we continuously monitored the interstitial glucose levels of 90 healthy adults for four weeks while they completed ecological momentary assessments (EMA; M=47 runs per participant) to rate their mood and metabolic states. As expected, hungry participants reported lower mood, and metabolic state ratings were associated with glucose levels. Although glucose levels were associated with mood, the metabolic state ratings fully mediated this association. Individual differences reflecting metabolic health (i.e., BMI and insulin resistance) did not affect the interaction between glucose and metabolic state ratings on mood. Notably, individuals with higher interoceptive accuracy had fewer fluctuations in mood ratings. We conclude that hunger-related mood shifts depend on conscious sensing of the body's internal state instead of acting subconsciously. Our study highlights the relevance of considering the self-report of bodily signals in understanding mood shifts, offering new fundamental insights into mood regulation mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

We then use medicinal chemistry to establish next-generation AA263 analogs showing improved potency and efficacy for ATF6 activation, as compared to the parent compound.

One promising approach to modulate such connectivity between cortical areas is dual-site transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), which non-invasively applies weak alternating currents to two brain areas. Objectives/Hypotheses: In the current study, we aimed to modulate inter-regional functional connectivity with dual-site tACS to bilateral primary motor cortices (M1s) during bimanual coordination and, in turn, alter behaviour. Methods: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we recorded participants' brain responses during a bimanual coordination task in a concurrent tACS-fMRI design. While performing a slow and fast version of the task, participants received one of three types of beta (20 Hz) dual-site tACS over both M1s: in-phase, jittered-phase or sham, in a within-subject, repeated measures design. Results: While we did not observe any significant tACS effects on behaviour, the study revealed a disruptive effect of in-phase tACS on interhemispheric connectivity. Additionally, the two active types of tACS (in-phase and jittered-phase) differed in the task-related M1 connectivity with other motor cortical regions, such as premotor cortex and supplementary motor area. Furthermore, individual E-field strengths were related to functional connectivity in the in-phase condition. Conclusions: Dual-site beta tACS over both M1s altered functional connectivity between motor areas. However, this effect did not translate to the behavioural level, possibly due to compensatory mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Importantly, the virulence assay showed that HZ7 was highly virulent and compared with the well known hvKP strain NTUH-K2044 and the highly virulent clinical strain ST11 K64 HZ54 isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia. In addition, HZ7 showed strong biofilm formation ability. Whole-genome sequencing analysis identified seven potential virulence genes in HZ7: kp7_000748, kp7_002156, kp7_002157, kp7_002158, kp7_002159, kp7_003103, kp7_003104, which are absent in K. pneumoniae patient isolates from Yangzhou and the environmental samples. Finally, transcriptomic analysis of HZ7 identified six genes wcaJ, fimA, mrkH, pgaA, ugd, and gndA that are associated with biofilm formation. Given its high virulence likely associated with the seven unique genes acquired via horizontal transfer and strong biofilm forming ability, this strain should be closely monitored to prevent wider spread in the clinic.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Yet, current methods do not allow us to specifically monitor inflammasome activation in real-time at endogenous protein levels. To overcome this shortcoming, we developed and characterized a novel fluorescent reporter that visualizes inflammasome assembly and reports on the recruitment of the effector protein caspase-1 without impairing downstream signaling. The reporter permits the analysis of inflammasome assembly over time as well as precise quantification of cells with assembled inflammasomes. We have successfully applied the reporter in lentivirus-transduced human and murine cell lines and primary cells but have also applied recombinant viruses that encode the reporter in their genome to detect inflammasome responses in primary cells. Mouse intestinal enteroids expressing the reporter allowed us to visualize how Salmonella infection triggers NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome assembly, cell death, and expulsion in complex tissues. Lastly, we apply the new tool to gain mechanistic insights and prove that caspase-1 activation on inflammasomes relies on the assembly of filaments of caspase-1CARD, which can be terminated by the CARD-only protein CARD17 to shut down cytokine secretion. We anticipate broad application of the reporter in fundamental and applied research, as it permits the quantitative assessment of inflammasome assembly at both high temporal and spatial resolution or in high throughput.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Multiple studies have further suggested a key role for herpesviruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV). Using transgenic 3xTg-AD mice, we demonstrate that systemic infection with the {beta}-herpesvirus murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) accelerates the development of cognitive decline, tauopathy, and synaptic loss in the hippocampus, all of which are key features of AD. Accelerated disease progression after infection was associated with substantial lymphocyte infiltration into the brain dominated by CD8+ T cells specific for MCMV. Moreover, T cell receptor analyses revealed that these responses were clonally diverse, suggesting that multiple viral antigens were targeted in the brain during chronic infection with MCMV. T cell depletion during virus chronicity rescued infection-induced cognitive decline. In addition, antiviral drug treatment reduced lymphocytic infiltrates in the brain and reversed cognitive decline, suggesting potential clinical utility. These data provide a mechanistic link between chronic viral infections and the development of AD.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Yet, the mechanistic relationship among these roles is unknown. Here, we show DA's tripartite roles are causally linked by a process in which phasic striatal DA rapidly and persistently recalibrates the propensity to move, a measure of vigor. Using a self-timed movement task, we found that single exposures to reward-related DA transients (both endogenous and exogenously-induced) exerted one-shot updates to movement timing--but in a surprising fashion. Rather than reinforce specific movement times, DA transients quantitatively changed movement timing on the next trial, with larger transients leading to earlier movements (and smaller to later), consistent with a stochastic search process that calibrates the frequency of movement. Both abrupt and gradual changes in external and internal contingencies--such as timing criterion, reward content, and satiety state--caused changes to the amplitude of DA transients that causally altered movement timing. The rapidity and bidirectionality of the one-shot effects are difficult to reconcile with gradual synaptic plasticity, and instead point to more flexible cellular mechanisms, such as DA-dependent modulation of neuronal excitability. Our findings shed light on how natural reinforcement, as well as DA-related disorders such as Parkinson's disease, could affect behavioral vigor.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Here we introduce a computational engine for systematic causal discovery of the functional consequences of altering network architecture and local biophysics in the brain. We integrate multimodal anatomical and functional neuroimaging to implement over 2,000 in-silico brains, and provide mechanistic insight into the functional consequences of local lesions, global wiring, and empirically-derived maps of regional cytoarchitecture and chemoarchitecture. We comprehensively assess how each manipulation of brain macrostructure reshapes spatial and temporal signal coordination, information dynamics, and functional hierarchy - as well as spontaneous co-activation of meta-analytic cognitive circuits, and >6,000 dimensions of local neural dynamics. Our computational model systematically identifies which features of brain architecture have overlapping or antagonistic causal influence over each dimension of brain function, and how functional properties are traded off against each other across disorders and neuromodulation. We find that regions' functional vulnerability to lesions in silico recapitulates their vulnerability to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric in vivo, along a core-periphery organisation. We provide convergent evidence that the brain's wiring diagram is finely tuned to favour the hierarchical integration of information. Notably, our model successfully recapitulates known empirical results that have not been modelled before, including desynchronisation and flattening of the brain's functional hierarchy induced by psychedelic 5HT2A agonists. To catalyse future discoveries, we make this resource freely available to the neuroscience community through an interactive website (https://systematic-causal-mapping.up.railway.app/), where users can interrogate our systematic database of simulated cause-effect relationships.

However, these areas' contributions to language remain unclear given that the evidence for their recruitment comes from diverse paradigms, many of which conflate language processing with perceptual, motor, or task-related cognitive processes. Using fMRI data from 772 participants performing an extensively-validated language localizer paradigm that isolates language processing from other processes, we a) delineate a comprehensive set of areas that respond reliably to language across written and auditory modalities, and b) evaluate these areas' selectivity for language relative to a demanding non-linguistic task. In line with prior claims, many areas outside the core fronto-temporal network respond during language processing, and most of them show selectivity for language relative to general task demands. These language-selective areas of the extended language network include areas around the temporal poles, in the medial frontal cortex, in the hippocampus, and in the cerebellum, among others. Although distributed across many parts of the brain, the extended language-selective network still only comprises ~1.2% of the brain's volume and is about the size of a strawberry, challenging the view that language processing is broadly distributed across the cortical surface. These newly identified language-selective areas can now be systematically characterized to decipher their contributions to language processing, including testing whether these contributions differ from those of the core language areas.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

However, it is unclear whether these attributes are solely related to the sound intensity of mechanical sounds, since in most real-world scenarios, mechanical sounds are present at high intensities, or if other acoustic or semantic factors are also at play. We measured the Skin Conductance Response (SCR), reflecting sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity as well as the pleasantness and eventfulness of the soundscape across two passive and active listening tasks in (N = 25) healthy subjects. The auditory stimuli were divided into two categories, nature, and mechanical sounds, and were manipulated to vary in three perceived loudness levels. As expected, we found that the sound category influenced perceived soundscape pleasantness and eventfulness. SCR was analysed by taking the mean level across the stimulus epoch, and also by quantifying its dynamic. We found that mean SCR was modulated by loudness only. SCR rise-time (a measure of speed of the skin response) correlated significantly with soundscape pleasantness and eventfulness for nature and mechanical sounds. This study highlights the importance of considering both loudness level and sound category in evaluating the perceptual soundscape, highlighting SCR as a valuable tool for such assessments.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Although large-scale genomic sequencing has transformed our ability to map genetic variation, accurately modeling and interpreting this data remains challenging due to fundamental limitations in existing genomic foundation models (GFMs). Current genomic models typically treat DNA simplistically as linear textual sequences, overlooking critical biological context, such as genomic structural annotations, regulatory elements, and functional contexts central to genomic interpretation. As a result, these models are prone to positional memorization of common sequences, severely limiting their generalization to biologically meaningful tasks. Here, we introduce BioToken, a modular and extendable tokenization framework designed to encode genomic variants and biologically relevant structural annotations directly into genomic representations. By utilizing intrinsic inductive biases, BioToken facilitates meaningful representation learning and generalization across diverse molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression, alternative splicing, and variant pathogenicity prediction. Built on BioToken, our genomic foundation model, BioFM, achieves competitive or superior results relative to specialized models (e.g., Enformer, SpliceTransformer) across a comprehensive suite of genomic benchmarks, including noncoding pathogenicity, expression modulation, sQTL prediction, and long-range genomic interactions.

Feature alignment constructs a graph based on spatial proximity and gene expression to propagate features and impute missing values. Optimal transport adjusts data sparsity to match scRNA-seq references, enabling single-cell foundation models such as scGPT to generate unified features. Batch alignment then refines scGPT-transformed embeddings, mitigating batch effects while preserving biological variability. Evaluations on mouse brain samples from five different technologies demonstrate that LLOKI outperforms existing methods and is effective for cross-technology spatial gene program identification and tissue slice alignment. Applying LLOKI to five ovarian cancer datasets, we identify an integrated gene program indicative of tumor-infiltrating T cells across gene panels.

Although most COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic or mild, severe infections requiring hospitalization have resulted in likely more than 14 million cumulative deaths to date. One hallmark of severe COVID-19 is a dysregulated immune response that leads to systemic inflammation and contributes to disease severity and mortality but is not explained by viral replication alone. Severe COVID-19 has been shown to disrupt the gut microbiome and increase intestinal permeability which may contribute to immune dysregulation and systemic inflammation. In this study, we investigated the differences in plasma biomarkers for microbial translocation and gut barrier damage as well as circulating cytokines between healthy volunteers and patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We then performed a correlation analysis to understand how the relationships between these plasma biomarkers differed and used a random forest model to assess their accuracy in distinguishing between these two groups. Our results demonstrated that hospitalized COVID-19 patients have elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers of microbial translocation, and that the relationships between these biomarkers were significantly altered compared to healthy volunteers, especially those related to the mucosal associated homeostatic cytokines IL-17A and IL-23. Furthermore, IL-6 and LBP were the top biomarkers for prediction accuracy in our random forest model, highlighting the importance of managing microbial translocation in COVID-19 and its potential utility as a biomarker for disease severity.

Off-target binding, defined as a probe binding to something other than the target gene, can distort a gene's true expression profile, making probe specificity essential for reliable transcriptomics. Here, we investigate off-target binding in the 10x Genomics Xenium v1 Human Breast Gene Expression Panel. We developed a software tool, Off-target Probe Tracker (OPT), to identify putative off-target binding via alignment of probe sequences and found at least 21 out of the 280 genes in the panel impacted by off-target binding to protein-coding genes. To substantiate our predictions, we leveraged a previously published Xenium breast cancer dataset generated using this gene panel and compared results to orthogonal spatial and single-cell transcriptomic profiles from Visium CytAssist and 3' single-cell RNA-seq derived from the same tumor block. Our findings indicate that for some genes, the expression patterns detected by Xenium demonstrably reflect the aggregate expression of the target and predicted off-target genes based on Visium and single-cell RNA-seq rather than the target gene alone. Overall, this work enhances the biological interpretability of spatial transcriptomics data and improves reproducibility in spatial transcriptomics research.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Much debate has hence surrounded their possible role as intermediate hosts in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, but the virological phenotypes of most pangolin coronaviruses (pCoVs) remain unclear. Here, we comprehensively analyze all pCoVs to date identified from trafficked pangolins seized in the Guangdong province of China, which are remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the spike protein. We explore an unknown genetic diversity within these viruses and uncover how this diversity translates to different virological phenotypes. Strikingly, several Guangdong pCoVs harbor a lysine substitution at residue 519 of spike protein, which contributes to marked immune evasion potentially by modulating the conformational state of spike protein. Furthermore, we highlight that a similar immuno-evasive mutation at residue 519 of the spike protein was acquired by SARS-CoV-2. These findings support that pangolin- and human-infecting coronaviruses represent independent spillover events from natural bat reservoirs, and that immuno-evasive mutations at residue 519 may be a common vector of viral evolution in coronaviruses that infect non-bat hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Most Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains carry filamentous phages called Pf that establish chronic infections and do not require host lysis to spread. However, spontaneous mutations in the Pf repressor gene (pf5r) can allow extreme phage production that slows bacterial growth and increases cell death, violating an apparent detente between bacterium and phage. We observed this paradoxical outcome in an evolution experiment with P. aeruginosa in media simulating nutrients from the cystic fibrosis airway. Bacteria containing pf5r mutant phage grow to a lower density but directly outcompete their ancestor and convert them into pf5r mutants via phage superinfection. Reduced fitness therefore spreads throughout the bacterial population, driven by weaponized Pf. Yet high intracellular phage replication facilitates another evolutionary conflict: ""cheater miniphages"" lacking capsid genes invade populations of full-length phages within cells. Although bacteria containing both full-length phages and miniphages are most immune to superinfection by limiting the Pf receptor, this hybrid vigor is extremely unstable, as a classic Tragedy of the Commons scenario ensues that results in complete prophage loss. The entire cycle - from phage hyperactivation to miniphage invasion to prophage loss - can occur within 24h, showcasing rapid coevolution between bacteria and their filamentous phages. This study demonstrates that P. aeruginosa, and potentially many other bacterial species that carry filamentous prophages, risk being exploited by these phages in a runaway process that reduces fitness of both host and virus.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Experiments with SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.258.17, B.1.1.7, and BA.5.3.2 (termed wild-type, alpha and omicron, respectively) revealed that human astrocytes, not neurons, support viral proliferation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new virus variants exhibited milder disease progression. A retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 infected by wild-type or alpha variants was conducted to test whether ketamine, an anaesthetic that inhibits endocytosis, affects COVID-19. At admission, patients infected with the wild-type showed greater disease severity than alpha variant patients, but the disease course was similar. This may be due to distinct ketamine-mediated SARS-CoV-2 variant-dependent effects, revealing stronger ketamine inhibition of the wild-type variant than the alpha variant mediating astrocyte responses involving the expression of ACE2, a viral cell entry site, viral proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and envelope protein-E in infected cells. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 protein 3a attenuated astroglial lysosomal traffic, and 3a and nsp6 differentially modulated lipid droplet accumulation and initiation of autophagy, where ketamine predominantly affected vesicle dynamics.

To facilitate the cost-effective generation of large scATAC-seq atlases for model training, we developed a new version of the open-source microfluidic system HyDrop with increased sensitivity and scale: HyDrop v2. We generated HyDrop v2 atlases for the mouse cortex and Drosophila embryo development and compared them to atlases generated on commercial platforms. HyDrop v2 data integrates seamlessly with commercially available chromatin accessibility methods (10x Genomics). Differentially accessible regions and motif enrichment across cell types are equivalent between HyDrop-v2 and 10x atlases. Sequence-to-function models trained on either atlas are comparable as well in terms of enhancer predictions, sequence explainability, and transcription factor footprinting.

However, a barrier to the adoption of BCIs is how long it can take users to learn to control them. We hypothesized that human BCI learning could be accelerated by leveraging the naturally occurring geometric structure of brain activity, or its intrinsic manifold, extracted using a data-diffusion process. We trained participants on a noninvasive BCI that allowed them to gain real-time control of an avatar in a virtual reality game by modulating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in brain regions that support spatial navigation. We then perturbed the mapping between fMRI activity patterns and the movement of the avatar to test our manifold hypothesis. When the new mapping respected the intrinsic manifold, participants succeeded in regaining control of the BCI by aligning their brain activity within the manifold. When the new mapping sdid not respect the intrinsic manifold, participants could not learn to control the avatar again. These findings show that the manifold geometry of brain activity constrains human learning of a complex cognitive task in higher-order brain regions. Manifold geometry may be a critical ingredient for unlocking the potential of future human neurotechnologies.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

However, the molecular and neurochemical basis of signalling in Octopus visual circuits is not well understood. Through heterologous expression of ligand-gated ion channel genes from Octopus vulgaris, we have identified and characterised novel ionotropic receptors for two of the major optic lobe neurotransmitters, dopamine and acetylcholine. One of these, DopC1, defines a new class of dopamine-gated cation channels that is broadly conserved in many invertebrates. Dopamine robustly stimulates neural activity in the optic lobe, particularly in layers where DopC1 is expressed, consistent with a role for this channel in excitatory neurotransmission. A second protein, AChRB1, forms acetylcholine-gated anion channels and is implicated in inhibition of dopaminergic amacrine cells in the outer granular layer (OGL). This combination of inhibitory cholinergic input and excitatory dopaminergic output may allow OGL amacrine cells to carry out lateral inhibition; thus, despite their very different functional and neurochemical properties, Octopus amacrine cells may execute similar computations to amacrine and horizontal cells in the vertebrate retina.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

However, no efficient software reliably derives and tests --state-specific and contrastive-- molecular diagnoses. UITOTO addresses this gap by identifying, testing, and visualizing Diagnostic Molecular Combinations (DMCs). The software uses a weighted random sampling algorithm based on the Jaccard Index for building candidate DMCs. It then selects DMCs with the highest specificity stability, meeting user-defined thresholds for exclusive character states. If multiple optimal DMCs exist, it derives a majority-consensus DMC. UITOTO includes a validation module for testing DMCs against aligned or unaligned sequences. A user-friendly Shiny App GUI with an additional module for customizable publication-quality DMC visualizations is also available online and in RStudio. We assess UITOTOs performance by comparing its DMCs to those derived from a recent software (MOLD) for three large empirical datasets: i) genus Megaselia (69 species, 2,229 training and 30,289 testing barcodes); ii) family Mycetophilidae, (118 species, 1,456 training and 60,349 testing barcodes); and iii) European Lepidoptera (49 species, 591 training and 21,483 testing barcodes). Based on several classification metrics (e.g., Accuracy, F1 Score), UITOTOs DMCs are more reliable, because MOLDs DMCs tend to be too short to be species-specific. Overall, we demonstrate that the biggest challenge for generating molecular and morphological diagnoses are the same. This is balancing specificity and length. Short diagnoses often lack specificity, while excessively long DMCs are often so specific that they do not accommodate intraspecific variation. We thus provide guidelines for generating molecular diagnoses, including detailed instructions for using UITOTO.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

This survival strategy is conserved from Drosophila to mammals but little is known about its underlying metabolic mechanisms. Here, we show that CNS uptake and catabolism of circulating glutamine is essential for neural stem cell proliferation during brain sparing but not normal brain development. Glutamine is imported into perineurial glia of the blood-brain-barrier, which upregulate glutaminase (Gls) and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGlut1) to promote glutaminolysis and glutamate secretion. Neural stem cells then import released glutamate via excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (Eaat1) and maintain it at homeostatic levels via glutamine synthetase 1 (Gs1). Glutamine nitrogen contributes surprisingly little to newly synthesized DNA or protein in neural stem cells but its carbon fuels the oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle. These findings identify an intercellular metabolic relay specifically required to sustain the proliferation of neural stem cells during brain sparing.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

We investigate this for Type II restriction-modification (RM) systems, using a dataset of thousands of conjugative plasmids belonging to different plasmid taxonomic units (PTUs).

While a large number of brain single-cell mRNA sequencing atlases have become available over the last years, spatial transcriptomic studies have lagged behind for a variety of reasons.

We generate a three-dimensional atlas of this structure, which we made available through a dedicated website (https://larva3dnovosparc.iim.fr). This allowed us to identify spatially compartmentalized cell types and spatially patterned genes, to predict hotspots of neuronal cell death and identify the expression of neuronal type-defining transcription factors. Importantly, we identify caveats in such algorithms that could allow for the development of refined versions.

However, studies have shown that neurons in visual areas of non-human primates encode some object concepts, raising questions about the extent to which object concepts are uniquely possessed by humans.

We tested more than 10 binary classification tasks, including animate versus inanimate, natural versus man-made objects, and mammalian versus non-mammalian animals. The monkeys learned each rule in a few days, generalized the learned rules to new images of objects they had probably never seen before and made error patterns consistent with human judgments. Visual deep neural networks (DNNs) could also perform the tasks that monkeys could learn, whereas both DNNs and monkeys failed to classify some less common abstract concepts. Thus, the monkeys' successful classification likely depended on whether concepts were embedded in natural images as visual features that could be extracted by high-level visual processing. The observed capacity of primate brains may subserve the formation of rich abstract concepts that the human mind possesses.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

The identification of prognostic biomarkers would greatly facilitate personalized treatments. Psychosis patients often display brain-wide disruptions of inter-regional functional coupling (FC), with some being linked to symptom severity and remission. FC may thus hold prognostic potential for people experiencing psychosis.

MethodsNinety antipsychotic-naive FEP patients (51% female, 15-25 years) were randomized to receive either antipsychotic or placebo tablets for 6 months alongside psychosocial interventions. A subset of these patients also completed functional magnetic resonance imaging (55 with usable data at baseline and 37 at 3 months), which was used to evaluate whether baseline FC, or 3-month change in FC, could predict 6- and 12-month changes in symptoms and functioning, quantified using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale, respectively. We considered three different cross-validated prediction algorithms: (i) connectome-based predictive modelling; (ii) kernel ridge regression; and (iii) multilayer meta-matching.

ResultsAll algorithms showed poor performance in predicting patients 6- and 12-month changes in symptoms and functioning (all rmean < 0.3), and no model achieved significance via permutation testing (all p > 0.05).

Variant effect scores from MAVEs can, however, be influenced by the experimental method to create experiment-to-experiment differences in the mapping from molecular level-variant effects to MAVE readout, which presents a challenge for supervised learning across datasets. We here propose a framework for performing supervised learning with MAVE data that takes the influence of the experimental protocol into account, thus enabling variant effects to be learned across datasets produced in independent experiments. We apply the framework to train a model against variant effect scores collected with VAMP-seq, a MAVE technique that quantifies the steady-state cellular abundance of protein variants. We show that mapping variant abundance to VAMP-seq readout in a dataset-specific manner during model training improves the learned abundance model and moreover allows the learned model to predict variant effects on an interpretable scale. Our work highlights the importance of validating MAVE results with low-throughput methods to facilitate MAVE score interpretation and supervised model training.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

The suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), characterized by complex interactions among immune and stromal cells, is gaining recognition in conferring resistance to CAR T cell therapy. Despite the abundance and diversity of macrophages in the TME, their intricate involvement in modulating responses to CAR T cell therapies remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on tumors from 41 glioma patients undergoing IL13R2-targeted CAR T cell therapy, identifying elevated suppressive SPP1 signatures predominantly in macrophages from patients who were resistant to treatment. Further integrative scRNA-seq analysis of high-grade gliomas as well as an interferon-signaling deficient syngeneic mouse model--both resistant to CAR T therapy--demonstrated the role of congruent suppressive pathways in mediating resistance to CAR T cells and a dominant role for SPP1+ macrophages. SPP1 blockade with an anti-SPP1 antibody abrogates the suppressive TME effects and substantially prolongs survival in IFN signaling-deficient and glioma syngeneic mouse models resistant to CAR T cell therapy. These findings illuminate the role of SPP1+ macrophages in fueling a suppressive TME and driving solid tumor resistance to CAR cell therapies. Targeting SPP1 may serve as a universal strategy to reprogram immune dynamics in solid tumors mitigating resistance to CAR T therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

High-throughput metagenomic sequencing has provided unprecedented insights into the structure and function of these communities. However, functional profiling of metagenomes remains constrained due to the limited sensitivity of existing sequence homology-based methods to annotate evolutionarily divergent genes. Protein structure, which is more conserved than sequence and intrinsically tied to molecular function, offers a solution. Capitalising on recent breakthroughs in structural bioinformatics, we present EcoFoldDB, a database of protein structures curated for ecologically relevant microbial traits, and its companion pipeline, EcoFoldDB-annotate, which leverages Foldseek with the ProstT5 protein language model for rapid structural homology searching directly from sequence data. EcoFoldDB-annotate outperforms state-of-the-art sequence-based methods in annotating metagenomic protein sequences, in terms of both sensitivity and precision. To demonstrate its utility and scalability, we performed structure-guided functional profiling of 32 million proteins encoded by 8,000 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes from the global soil microbiome. EcoFoldDB-annotate could resolve the phylogenetic partitioning of important nitrogen cycling pathways, from taxonomically restricted nitrifiers to more widespread denitrifiers, as well as identifying novel, uncultivated bacterial taxa enriched in plant growth-promoting traits. We anticipate that EcoFoldDB will enable researchers to extract ecological insights from environmental genomes and metagenomes, and accelerate discoveries in microbial ecology.

This apparatus synthesizes the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall layer that forms the daughter cell poles and protects them from osmotic lysis. In the model Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, PG synthases called class A penicillin-binding proteins (aPBPs) have been proposed to play crucial roles in division. However, there is limited experimental support for aPBPs playing a specialized role in division that is distinct from their general function in the expansion and fortification of the PG matrix. Here, we present in situ cryogenic electron tomography data indicating that the aPBP-type enzyme PBP1b is required to produce a wedge-like density of PG at the division site. Furthermore, atomic force and live cell microscopy showed that loss of this structure weakens the division site and renders it susceptible to lysis. Surprisingly, we found that the lipoprotein activator LpoB needed to promote the general function of PBP1b was not required for normal division site architecture or its integrity. Additionally, we show that of the two PBP1b isoforms produced in cells, it is the one with an extended cytoplasmic N-terminus that functions in division, likely via recruitment by the FtsA component of the divisome. Altogether, our results demonstrate that PBP1b plays a specialized, LpoB-independent role in E. coli cell division involving the biogenesis of a PG structure that prevents osmotic rupture. The conservation of aPBPs with extended cytoplasmic N-termini suggests that other Gram-negative bacteria may use similar mechanisms to reinforce their division site.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, germ cell-less (gcl) is required for the formation of primordial germ cells in the form of cells that cellularize at the posterior pole of the embryo, called pole cells. Forming pole cells is a mechanism of germ cell formation unique to a subset of insects. Even though most animals do not form pole cells as primordial germ cells, gcl is conserved across Metazoa, raising the question of how this conserved gene acquired its central role in the evolutionarily derived process of pole cell formation. Here, we examine the functions of gcl in two other insects with different modes of germ cell specification: the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus and the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. We found that gcl is involved in germ cell development, but not strictly required for germ cell specification, in O. fasciatus, although it appears to function through a mechanism different from that in D. melanogaster. In contrast, we could not detect any impact on the embryonic germ line upon gcl knockdown in G. bimaculatus. This work serves as a case study into how the roles of genes in the process of germ line development can change over evolutionary time across animals.

Single-cell DNA tracing microscopy and polymer physics-based simulations of genome folding have proposed these population-scale patterns arise from motor- driven, heterogeneous movement, rather than stable 3D genomic architecture, implying that motion, rather than structure, is key to understanding genome function. However, tools to directly observe this motion in vivo have been limited in coverage and resolution. Here we describe TRansposon Assisted Chromatin Kinetic Imaging Technology (TRACK-IT), which combines a suite of imaging and labeling improvements to achieve ultra-resolution in space and time, with self-mapping transposons to distribute labels across the chromosome, uncovering dynamic behaviors across four orders of magnitude of genomic separation. We find that sequences separated by sub-megabase distances, typically 200-500 nm of nanometers apart, can transition to close proximity in tens of seconds - faster than previously hypothesized. This rapid motion is dependent upon cohesin and is exhibited only within certain genomic domains. Domain borders act as kinetic impediments to this search process, substantially slowing the rate and frequency of the transition to proximity. The genomic separation-dependent scaling of the search time for cis-interactions within a domain violates predictions of diffusion, suggesting motor driven folding. This distinctive scaling is lost following cohesin depletion, replaced with a behavior consistent with diffusion. Finally, we found cohesin containing cells exhibited rare, processive movements, not seen in cohesin depleted cells. These processive trajectories exhibit extrusion rates of [~]2.7 kb/s across three distinct genomic intervals, faster than recent in vitro measurements and prior estimates from in vivo data. Taken together, these results reveal a genome in motion across multiple genomic and temporal scales, where motor-dependent extrusion divides the sequence, not into spatially separate domains, but into kinetically separated domains that experience accelerated local search.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Here, upon proteomic analysis to identify common players in oncogenic EGFR- and KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma mouse models, we uncovered a largely unknown protein in cancer, flavin-containing monooxygenase 4 (FMO4), whose expression was increased in lung tumors compared with adjacent lung tissue. FMO4 expression was strongly increased also in lung cancer samples from patients compared with healthy lung, and its expression level was inversely correlated with overall survival. Remarkably, in vivo deletion of FMO4 greatly decreased tumor burden and increased survival in oncogenic KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma mice unveiling its crucial role in tumor biology. Mechanistically, we found that FMO4 loss of function promotes ferroptosis and cooperates with ferroptosis inducers in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, FMO4 facilitates the interaction between MAT2A and MAT2B, promoting the generation of cysteine from methionine, which in turn boosts the generation of glutathione, thus protecting lung adenocarcinoma against ferroptosis.

However, recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) histology, which provide a more biologically accurate representation of the spatial heterogeneity of human microanatomy, has led to improved understandings of disease pathology. Yet challenges remain in the development of scalable and computationally efficient pipelines for extracting and interpreting nuclear features in 3D space. 2D histology neglects crucial spatial information, such as 3D connectivity, morphology, and rare events missed by sparser sampling.

Recently, apusomonads have been found to show a negative phototactic response to blue light. Here, by screening available apusomonad 'omics data we found genes of a distinct group of microbial rhodopsins, the ApuRs. ApuRs heterologously expressed in mammalian cells absorbed near-UV/violet or blue light, suggesting that ApuRs could be involved in apusomonads' photoavoidance response. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that ApuRs are anion-selective rhodopsin channels which evolved independently of the family of channelrhodopsins widespread in other unicellular eukaryotes. Among the known rhodopsin channels, ApuRs collectively demonstrate the most blue-shifted absorption spectra. In ApuRs, the channel opening is triggered by photoisomerization of the retinal from its all-trans form to 13-cis and 11-cis forms. We found that intracellular proton transfer is involved in channel opening and determined the channel's open/close kinetics. These findings expand our understanding of the photobiology of heterotrophic flagellates and showcase the significance of these organisms as a source of new rhodopsin families with unanticipated functions.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Biomedical research in Brazil expanded rapidly over the last three decades, with no systematic assessment of the replicability of its findings. With this in mind, we set up the Brazilian Reproducibility Initiative, a multicenter replication of published experiments from Brazilian science using three common experimental methods: the MTT assay, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the elevated plus maze (EPM). A total of 56 laboratories performed 143 replications of 56 experiments; of these, 96 replications of 47 experiments were considered valid by an independent committee. Replication rates for these experiments varied between 15 and 45% according to five predefined criteria. In median terms, relative effect sizes were 60% larger in original experiments than in replications, while coefficients of variation were 60% smaller. Effect size decrease was smaller for MTT, cell line experiments and original results with less variability, while t values for replications were positively correlated with researcher predictions about replicability. Deviations from preregistered protocols were very common in replications, most frequently due to reasons inherent to the experimental model or related to infrastructure and logistics. Our results highlight factors that limit the replicability of results published by researchers in Brazil and suggest ways by which this scenario can be improved.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Conventional sequencing-based methods lack sensitivity and specificity and do not provide critical spatial information. To address this, we present high-phylogenetic-resolution spatial mapping platform (HiPR-Map), a state-of-the-art spectral imaging technology that enables precise enumeration and spatial localization of microbial cells at species-level within complex communities. Through these advantages, HiPR-Map provides unique insights for LBP discovery and development. Applying HiPR-Map to an LBP designed to complement immune checkpoint therapy, we profiled over 1.8 million microbial cells engrafted in the murine gut.

Two factors that likely contribute to this situation include (a) conceptual disagreement about language and its component processes, and (b) intrinsic inter-individual variability in the topography of language areas. Recent functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) studies of small numbers of intensively scanned individuals have argued that a language-selective brain network emerges from correlations (individualized functional connectomics, iFC) in task-free (e.g., rest) or task-regressed activation timecourses. Here we test this hypothesis at scale and evaluate its practical utility for task-agnostic language localization: we apply iFC separately to each of 1,971 (fMRI) scanning sessions (1,199 unique brains), each consisting of diverse tasks. We find that iFC indeed reveals a left-lateralized frontotemporal network that is more stable within individuals than between them, robust to the granularity of the parcellation, and selective for language. These results support the hypothesis that this network is a key structure in the functional organization of the adult brain and show that it can be recovered retrospectively from arbitrary imaging data, with implications for neuroscience, neurosurgery, and neural engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1743977373949

Despite advances in collagen extraction protocols, the process remains destructive, requiring sampling by sawing, drilling or crushing of dry bone, that can damage or destroy physical features and archaeological evidence, and often consumes the entire specimen. While non-destructive approaches have recently been applied in ancient genomics and palaeoproteomics, no equivalent approach has been established for radiocarbon dating of bone. Here, we outline a non-destructive collagen extraction workflow that avoids invasive sampling (cutting or drilling) and produces no visible damage to the bone. By heating the bone in hot water for several hours, collagen is solubilized, and the resulting collagenous solution can be purified and AMS dated. Here we show that the amino acid composition, C/N atomic ratios, {delta}13C and {delta}15N values of the hot-water-extracted collagen are comparable to collagen isolated from the same bones using classic decalcification methodologies. The hot water extraction method was tested on various bones, ranging from the Bronze Age to the Middle and Upper Paleolithic periods, which had been dated previously using routine destructive methods that involved acid demineralization. Our results show that non-destructive collagen extraction, coupled with an additional purification step e.g., ultrafiltration, yields identical radiocarbon ages to those obtained via the routine destructive methods.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

A common theme is generating a nucleotide-derived second messenger in response to phage that activates an effector protein to halt virion production. Phages respond with counter-defenses that deplete these second messengers, leading to an escalating arms race with the host. Here we discover a novel antiphage system we call Panoptes that detects phage infection by surveying the cytosol for phage proteins that antagonize the nucleotide-derived second messenger pool. Panoptes is a two-gene operon, optSE. OptS is predicted to synthesize a second messenger using a minimal CRISPR polymerase (mCpol) domain, a version of the polymerase domain found in Type III CRISPR systems (Cas10) that is distantly related to GGDEF and Thg1 tRNA repair polymerase domains. OptE is predicted to be a transmembrane effector protein that binds cyclic nucleotides. optSE potently restricted phage replication but mutant phages that had loss-of-function mutations in anti-CBASS protein 2 (Acb2) escaped defense. These findings were unexpected because Acb2 is a nucleotide ""sponge"" that antagonizes second messenger signaling. Using genetic and biochemical assays, we found that Acb2 bound the OptS-synthesized nucleotide, 2',3'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (2',3'-c-di-AMP); however, 2',3'-c-di-AMP was synthesized constitutively by OptS and inhibited OptE. Nucleotide depletion by Acb2 released OptE toxicity thereby initiating abortive infection to halt phage replication. These data demonstrate a sophisticated immune strategy that hosts use to guard their second messenger pool and turn immune evasion against the virus.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

The plant microbiota is generally taxonomically structured. Some of the members can promote plant fitness including growth and stress tolerance. However, microbial imbalance can also result in deleterious effects, a phenomenon known as dysbiosis that was first coined in the gut microbiome field. To unveil the regulatory mechanism to maintain plant homeostatic interaction with microbiota, we performed screening using defined synthetic bacterial communities. We identified an Arabidopsis mutant with altered microbial profiles, an overall increase of microbial load and microbiota-dependent growth defects. Transcriptomic and chemical complementation analyses confirmed that the aforementioned microbiota-dependent phenotypes are contributed by an upregulation of the jasmonate signaling pathway. Upregulation of the jasmonate pathway further promotes microbial growth, possibly forming a positive feedback loop. Even though activation of the jasmonate signaling pathway is known to enhance plant stress tolerance, hyperactivation of the pathway alters plant tolerance or resistance against multiple stressors. Plant association with the microbiota together with proper regulation of the jasmonate signaling pathway are thus essential to maintain plant response to environmental stressors.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

In these pathways, including CBASS and type III CRISPR systems in bacteria and cGAS-STING in humans, oligonucleotide synthesis occurs upon detection of virus or foreign genetic material in the cell, triggering the antiviral response2-4. In a surprising inversion of this process, we show here that the CRISPR-related enzyme mCpol synthesizes cyclic oligonucleotides constitutively as part of an active mechanism that maintains cell health. Cell-based experiments demonstrated that the absence or loss of mCpol-produced cyclic oligonucleotides triggers cell death, preventing spread of viruses that attempt immune evasion by depleting host cyclic nucleotides. Structural and mechanistic investigation revealed mCpol to be a di-adenylate cyclase whose product, c-di-AMP, prevents toxic oligomerization of the effector protein 2TM{beta}. Analysis of cells by fluorescence microscopy showed that lack of mCpol allows 2TM{beta}-mediated cell death due to inner membrane collapse. These findings unveil a powerful new defense strategy against virus-mediated immune suppression, expanding our understanding of oligonucleotides in cell health and disease.

Understanding the functions of vocal mimicry can help to uncover the evolutionary drivers of vocal learning. Different adaptive functions like interspecific and intraspecific communication have been suggested, as well as the possibility of vocal mimicry to be a mistake during vocal learning. In the present study, we review the occurrence of mimicry in the family of corvids and investigate the socio-ecological factors driving the evolution of vocal mimicry in this group of birds. We recorded evidence of vocal mimicry from primary (xeno-canto recordings) as well as secondary sources (published literature) and found evidence for vocal mimicry in 31 out of 128 corvid species (24%). Smaller species were described as mimics more compared to larger species. Other socio-ecological factors like breeding status, habitat and trophic niche did not have a significant effect. More mimicry was recorded during the non-breeding season compared to the breeding season. We used Bayesian modelling based on existing data from primary and secondary sources to estimate the occurrence of mimicry, suggesting that vocal mimicry may be more widespread among corvids than currently documented, with many species potentially being  hidden mimics. Our study for the first time systematically reviews the occurrence of vocal mimicry across the family of corvids and investigates a range of socio-ecological factors driving the behaviour. Our analysis suggests many corvid species likely to be  hidden mimics and we provide specific suggestions for species which according to our statistical model are most likely mimicking corvid species, hopefully inspiring future field work on those species.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

We have examined cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS), a preparation technique based on cutting thin sections with a knife, as an alternative to FIB-milling. CEMOVIS sections also sustain damage, including compression, shearing and cracks. However, samples can be sectioned in series, producing many orders of magnitude more imageable area compared to lamellae making CEMOVIS an alternative to FIB-milling with distinct advantages. Using 2-dimensional template matching on images of CEMOVIS sections of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, we reconstructed the 60S ribosomal subunit at near-atomic resolution, demonstrating that, in many regions of the sections, the molecular structure of these subunits is largely intact, comparable to FIB-milled lamellae.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

The emergence of the ancient arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (AMS) was followed by the diversification of alternative mycorrhizal types, including the ericoid mycorrhizae (ErM)3. The evolution of ErM coincides with the emergence of the Ericaceae family of angiosperms and the diversification of leafy liverworts within the order Jungermanniales, as well as their expansion into boreal and high-altitude ecosystem4-6. Despite their evolutionary and ecological relevance, little is known about the molecular and genomic basis of ErM. Here, we sequenced the nuclear genomes of two leafy liverworts from Jungermanniales, and reconstituted ErM under laboratory conditions. We demonstrated the existence of a nutrient-regulated symbiotic state that enables ErM and underlies intracellular colonization of plant tissues. Genome and functional analyses revealed that leafy liverworts retain a conserved suite of functional genes that are required for endosymbiosis in land plants. Comparative transcriptomic analysis under ErM-permissive and restrictive conditions identified gene modules associated with endosymbiosis. Transcriptome sequencing cross-comparisons of ErM and AMS identified a conserved gene module required for the intracellular accommodation of fungal symbionts, marking it as a shared feature across diverse types of land plant symbioses. Our study presents the first genomic resources for leafy liverworts, and provides the first experimental evidence that ErM evolved from AMS. This evolutionary transition involved the co-option of a nutrient-based mechanism for the establishment of ErM, and additionally the co-option of two gene modules essential for signaling and symbiont accommodation during endosymbiosis. Our data offer valuable insights and resources for understanding the molecular basis of ErM and its diversification from AMS in land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

We previously observed that during experimental evolution in the presence of abundant susceptible hosts, the AMR plasmid R1 rapidly evolves variants with increased horizontal transmission due to mutations causing increased plasmid copy number. Yet AMR was progressively lost from the evolving populations. Here, we show that AMR loss was associated with evolution of  stealth plasmids in which the AMR region is spontaneously deleted, making plasmid carriage undetectable by plating on selective antibiotic-containing media. These plasmids transmit both vertically and horizontally more efficiently than the ancestral AMR plasmid, driving AMR extinction in bacterial populations and effectively acting as an intrinsic defence against AMR plasmids. Our results suggest that within-host plasmid evolution could be exploited to limit the spread of AMR in natural populations of bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

In neural progenitor cells, examination of both cis and trans changes -- combined with CRISPR inhibition and transcription factor motif analyses -- identified cis-acting, species-specific gene regulatory changes, including to TNIK, FOSL2, and MAZ, with widespread trans effects on neurogenesis-related gene programs.

In insects and other arthropods, which have only innate immune mechanisms, four main immune-specific modules contribute to defense against microbial invaders: the Toll pathway, the Imd pathway, the melanization response, and phagocytosis by plasmatocytes. Our present understanding of their relative importance remains fragmented, as their contribution to host defense has never been simultaneously assessed across a large panel of pathogens. Here, we have taken advantage of newly-described immune mutants in a controlled genetic background to systematically delete these four immune modules individually, in pairs, or all four simultaneously. Surprisingly, flies simultaneously deficient in all four immune modules are viable, homozygous fertile, and display no overt morphological defects, suggesting these immune mechanisms are not strictly required for organismal development. With this new set of lines, we assessed the individual and collective contribution of each module to host defense against five viruses, three fungi, eight Gram-positive bacteria, and eight Gram-negative bacteria. Our findings show that these four modules largely function independently or additively in host defense, although synergistic effects can occur for select pairs of modules. Our study confirmed the importance of the Imd pathway against Gram-negative bacteria and the Toll pathway against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, largely via the induction of effectors such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and Bomanins (Bom), but also reveals an important role of melanization against viruses, and a contribution of phagocytosis against various germs. Additionally, by examining microbial load kinetics in different mutants, we provide insight into how these modules contribute to tolerance or resistance against specific microbes. Our study provides insights into the architecture of the Drosophila immune system, revealing differential requirements of immune modules according to each pathogen. The set of immune deficient lines provided here offers tools to better assess the role of these immune modules in host defense.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Yet how enhancers determine transcription of their target genes, and how this depends on their relative position inside a cis-regulatory landscape remains unclear. Here we use live-cell imaging to track the activity of a promoter under the control of the same enhancer, but inserted at different positions across a simplified regulatory landscape with minimal complexity. Combined with mathematical modeling, this reveals that RNA production from the promoter occurs in clusters of transcriptional bursts, with enhancer position controlling the frequency at which such clusters appear. This results in bursts being more frequent and occurring more uniformly across cells when the enhancer is genomically close to the promoter than when it is located at large genomic distance. Mathematical modeling further indicates that the enhancer modulates the promoters ability to transition from its basal transcriptional state to a regime where clusters of bursts become more frequent. Our results challenge existing models of mammalian promoter operation, and reveal that enhancer position within a cis-regulatory landscape critically controls the timing and variability of transcriptional output in single cells.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Many of these damaging modifications (i.e., lesions) persist into S-phase of the cell cycle where they may stall the canonical DNA replication machinery. In humans, these stalling events are circumvented by one of at least three interconnected DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathways; translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), Template Switching (TS), and Homology-dependent Recombination (HDR). Currently, the functional interplay between these pathways is unclear, leaving wide gaps in our fundamental understanding of human DDT. To gain insights, we focus on the activation mechanisms of the DDT pathways. PCNA sliding clamps encircling primer/template (P/T) junctions of stalled replication sites are central to the activation of both TLS and TS whereas exchange of RPA for Rad51 filaments on the single strand DNA (ssDNA) sequences of stalled replication sites is central to HDR activation. Utilizing direct, ensemble FRET approaches developed by our lab, we independently monitor and directly compare PCNA occupancy and RPA/Rad51 exchange at P/T junctions under a variety of conditions that mimic in vivo scenarios. Collectively, the results reveal that assembly of stable Rad51 filaments at P/T junctions via RPA/Rad51 exchange causes complete and irreversible unloading of the resident PCNA, both in the presence and absence of an abundant PCNA-binding protein complex. Further investigations decipher the mechanism of RPA/Rad51 exchange-dependent unloading of PCNA. Collectively, these studies provide critical insights into the interplay between human DDT pathways and direction for future studies.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

However, its precise chromosomal composition has remained elusive due to challenges in resolving repetitive regions. Using PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing, we assembled the complete nuclear genome of the Dm28c strain into 32 telomere-to-telomere chromosomes. The assembly revealed conserved chromosomal structures and synteny patterns when compared to the independently sequenced Dm25 strain, both of which belong to clade A (TcI). This indicates that the 32-chromosome karyotype is a stable and conserved feature of T. cruzi. Through a comprehensive annotation pipeline, we refined gene content and resolved haplotypes, resulting in an approximately 25% reduction in core gene redundancy. All chromosomes demonstrate a conserved compartmentalized architecture consisting of core, disruptive, and newly characterized subtelomeric regions. Subtelomeres, enriched in RHS, TS, and DGF-1 genes but lacking MASP and mucins, create a distinct third genomic compartment. Telomere analysis showed significant length heterogeneity, which may influence subtelomeric gene regulation. Overall, this work defines the complete chromosomal complement of T. cruzi, establishing a solid framework for comparative genomics and enabling detailed studies into genome organization, antigenic variability, and evolutionary dynamics across strains and clades.

This study presents the first comprehensive investigation of microbial communities inhabiting heritage artifacts from Argentinas Museum of Independence. By integrating advanced microscopy with phenotypic and genomic characterization, we analyzed samples collected from wooden objects, textiles, architectural elements, and exterior walls. Scanning electron microscopy revealed diverse and well-structured biofilms, with intricate three-dimensional arrangements embedded in extracellular polymeric substances. A total of 49 bacterial strains were isolated and identified via VITEK MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, with a predominance of Gram-positive genera such as Bacillus, Micrococcus, and Kocuria. Remarkably, the 19th-century albumen print photograph emerged as the most biodiverse artifact, yielding 21 distinct strains, including Streptomyces, Oceanobacillus, and thermophilic Caldibacillus thermoamylovorans. The protein-rich and halophilic environment of the albumen layer likely facilitated microbial colonization and persistence. Pseudomonas species were exclusively associated with this photographic substrate, further underscoring its niche specificity. Human-associated taxa like Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus equorum were prevalent in high-contact areas, while exterior surfaces displayed distinct microbial signatures, including potential pathogens linked to environmental exposure. These findings reveal a complex and artifact-specific microbial landscape, emphasizing the need for tailored, bio-informed conservation strategies.

We found that populations that followed this two-stage strategy achieved higher payoffs in the long term than populations using the two exploration strategies in a random order. Our models point at a  just right length of childhood - neither too long, nor too short - allowing individuals enough time to explore before exploiting what they learned.

Cell migration is driven by the extension of actin-based lamellipodia protrusions, powered by actin polymerization, which is tightly regulated by signaling pathways, including Rho GTPases and Ca2+ signaling. While the importance of Ca2+ signaling in lamellipodia protrusions has been established, the molecular mechanisms linking Ca2+ to lamellipodia assembly are unknown. Here, we identify a novel Ca2+ signaling axis involving the mechano-gated channel TRPV4, which regulates lamellipodia protrusions in various cell types. Using Ca2+ and FRET imaging, we demonstrate that TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ influx upregulates RhoA activity within lamellipodia, which then facilitates formin-mediated actin assembly. Mechanistically, we identify CaMKII and TEM4 as key mediators relaying the TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ signal to RhoA.

However, little effort has been dedicated to determining which specific system(s) within defense islands limit lytic phage reproduction in clinical bacterial strains. Here, we employed the CRISPR-based Cascade-Cas3 system to delete defense islands in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate to identify mechanisms of lytic phage antagonism. Deletion of one island in a cystic fibrosis-derived clinical isolate sensitized the strain to phages from the Pbunavirus family, which are commonly used as therapeutics. The causal defense system is a Type IIS restriction endonuclease-like protein (ENDPaCF1), common in Pseudomonads, however it lacks an associated methyltransferase typical Type IIS R-M systems. ENDPaCF1 protects bacteria against phages with hypermodified DNA and is surprisingly agnostic to the specific structure of the modification, which is unlike typical type IV restriction endonucleases. In ENDPaCF1, the endonuclease domain is fused to a catalytically inactive Endonuclease III (iEndoIII), a domain that recognizes non-canonical bases to repair DNA in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. We therefore propose that nucleases containing an iEndoIII domain (END nucleases) can sense diverse DNA hypermodifications. Our findings reveal modularity of the sensing and cleavage domains, as expected of a modification-dependent endonucleases. We further show that some hypermodified phages, including Pbunavirus family members and Wrowclawvirus family (Pa5oct-like) of jumbo phages, encode END nuclease inhibitors that directly bind to the nuclease, likely via the iEndoIII domain. These inhibitors are necessary for Pbunavirus to plaque on clinical isolates and sufficient to enable other hypermodified phages to plaque in the presence of this defense system.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

In this study, we used CRISPRi-mediated deletion of the H3K9me3 methyltransferase SETDB1 in human neural progenitor cells to model disruption of heterochromatin maintenance. Deletion of SETDB1 had a limited effect on cell viability, despite a global loss of H3K9me3 peaks resulting in genome-wide reorganization of heterochromatin domains, cells remained proliferative and expressed appropriate marker genes. We found that a key event following the loss of H3K9me3 maintenance was the expression of evolutionarily young L1 retrotransposons. Derepression of L1s was associated with a loss of CpG DNA methylation at their promoters, suggesting that deposition of H3K9me3 at the L1 promoter is required to maintain DNA methylation. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that loss of H3K9me3 in human neural somatic cells transcriptionally activates evolutionary young L1 retrotransposons, further implicating these elements in human ageing processes.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

We further demonstrate how Lamassu specifically senses dsDNA in vitro and phage replication origins in vivo, thereby triggering the formation of LmuA tetramers that activate the Cap4 nuclease domain. Our findings reveal that Lamassu evolved via exaptation of the bacterial Rad50-Mre11 DNA repair system to form a compact, modular sensor for viral replication, exemplifying how cellular machinery can be co-opted for novel immune functions.","NA","biorxiv",1743977373949

Population immunity is a critical component of influenza pandemic risk assessment. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the population immunity to 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) viruses and analyzed 1794 sera from 723 people (0.5-88 yrs) in multiple US geographic regions during 2021-2024. Low pre-existing neutralizing and hemagglutinin (HA) head binding antibodies and substantial cross reactive binding antibodies to N1 neuraminidase (NA) of 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) were detected in US population. Antibodies to group 1 HA stalk were also prevalent with an age-related pattern. A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and influenza vaccination did not induce neutralizing antibodies but induced significant rise of NA inhibition (NAI) antibodies to N1 of 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1), and group 1 HA stalk antibodies. Understanding population susceptibility to novel influenza is essential for pandemic preparedness.","NA","medrxiv",1743977373949

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1743977373949
