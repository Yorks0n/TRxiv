Little is known, however, about whether and how phages can establish long-term genetic stability. We addressed this eco-evolutionary question in an open marine animal associated system, through two longitudinal samplings years apart in an oyster farm, obtaining >1,000 virulent phages and >600 Vibrio crassostreae strains. Surprisingly, lineages of phage and bacteria were very persistent, with some phages remaining strictly identical after four years. The phage-vibrio infection network remained modular with multiple lineages co-habitating within individual oysters for long periods of time. Seasonal restriction of V. crassostreae, overwintering in wild oysters, and limited viral decay may explain phage stability. Oysters also act as hotspots of activity of diverse mobile genetic element (MGE), hosting plasmids, prophages, phage-plasmids and entirely new classes of satellite-plasmids. Our findings demonstrate how nested ecological constraints can stabilize viral lineages: oysters house vibrio populations that escape host immunity, vibrios restrict phages via receptors and defenses, and satellites parasitize their cognate helper phages. We suggest that ecological context can favor the long-term maintenance of viral lineages and stabilize MGE persistence in the ocean, even amid ongoing mutation and antagonistic co-evolution.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""884988;""},{""name"":""Canada Excellence Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02tvrwm90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-00051;""},{""name"":""FRQ-NT, Fonds des leaders John-R.-Evans"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""44584;""},{""name"":""ANR"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""20-CE35-0014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403063

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season. Methods. Employees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 33 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, including adjusting for influenza activity as an effect modifier. Results. Among 53402 employees, 43920 (82.2%) were vaccinated by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1130 (2.12%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over time the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the risk of influenza was not significantly different during periods when influenza activity was low (HR, .70; 95% C.I., .42 - 1.15; P = .15) or medium (HR, 1.20; 95% C.I., .86 - 1.67; P = .28), but was significantly higher for the vaccinated state than the unvaccinated state when influenza activity was high (HR, 1.33; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.64; P = .009). Conclusions. This study was unable to find a protective influence of influenza vaccination among working-aged adults during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season and found that influenza vaccination was associated with a higher risk of influenza when influenza activity was high.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1760393403063

The pyrenoid, an algal biomolecular condensate that mediates one-third of global CO2 fixation, typically exists as one large condensate per chloroplast, but during cell division it transiently dissolves and reconfigures into multiple smaller condensates. Here, we identify a kinase, KEY1, in the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that regulates pyrenoid condensate size and number dynamics throughout the cell cycle and is necessary for normal pyrenoid function and growth. Unlike wild type, key1 mutant cells have multiple smaller condensates throughout the cell cycle that fail to dissolve during cell division. We show that KEY1 localizes to the condensates and promotes their dissolution by disrupting interactions between their core constituents, the CO2 -fixing enzyme Rubisco and its linker protein EPYC1, through EPYC1 phosphorylation. We develop a biophysical model that recapitulates KEY1-mediated condensate size and number regulation and suggests a mechanism for controlling condensate position. These data provide a foundation for the mechanistic understanding of the regulation of size, number, position, and dissolution in pyrenoids and other biomolecular condensates.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MCB-1935444;MCB-2410354;MCB-1914989;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bj3aw27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0020195;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R01GM140032-01;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403063

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has allowed proteome-scale quantification of hundreds of thousands of ubiquitination sites (ubi-sites), however the functional importance and regulatory roles of most ubi-sites remain undefined. Here, we assembled a human reference ubiquitinome of 108,341 ubi-sites by harmonizing public proteomics data. We identified a core subset of ubi-sites under evolutionary constraint through alignment of ubiquitin proteomics data from six non-human species, and determined ultra-conserved ubi-sites recurring at regulatory hotspots within protein domains. Perturbation proteomics revealed that these highly conserved ubi-sites are more likely to regulate signaling functions rather than proteasomal degradation. To further prioritize functional ubi-sites with roles in cellular signaling, we constructed a functional score for more than 100,000 ubi-sites by integrating evolutionary, proteomic, and structural features using machine learning. Our score identifies ubi-sites regulating diverse protein functions and rationalizes mechanisms of genetic disease. Finally, we employed chemical genomics to validate the functional relevance of high-scoring ubi-sites and leveraged genetic code expansion to demonstrate that ubiquitination of K320 in the RNA-regulator ELAVL1 disrupts RNA binding. Our work reveals systems-level principles of the ubiquitinome and provides a powerful resource for studying protein ubiquitination.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403063

Anthocyanins, a class of flavonoids responsible for vibrant shades of pink, red, and blue pigmentation, are almost ubiquitous in angiosperms but are replaced by betalains in some families in the order Caryophyllales.
C_LIO_LIWe investigated anthocyanin pigmentation in Cucurbitaceae, the second-largest fruit and vegetable family, characterised by white and yellow flowers and red, orange, and green fruits predominantly pigmented by carotenoids. Using a comprehensive collection of 258 datasets representing species across all 15 tribes of Cucurbitaceae and a phylogenomics approach, we observed a systematic absence of genes involved in anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis. Absence of the structural genes DFR, ANS, arGST, LAR, and ANR, along with the anthocyanin-related regulatory MYB genes, was consistently confirmed by synteny and phylogenetic analysis.
C_LIO_LIThese results suggest that anthocyanin loss in angiosperms is more common than previously assumed. In light of this new discovery, we propose a stepwise loss of anthocyanin pigmentation in Cucurbitaceae, likely accompanied by a partial functional replacement with carotenoid pigmentation.

Here, we develop a new multi-locus, time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis for the surgeonfishes based on 19 loci for 80 acanthurid species and 45 outgroups. Detailed head, body, and fin geometric morphometric data were collected for all 80 surgeonfish species in the tree, and patterns of shape evolution across the family were visualized using phylomorphospaces. We used a three-state feeding trait axis across the herbivore to planktivore continuum to examine how morphometric shape relates to diet. Head and body shape were significantly associated with diet. Additionally, species exhibited two alternative locomotor strategies: high aspect ratio (AR) tails were associated with low AR pectoral fins, slender bodies, and pelagic planktivory, whereas species with low AR tail fins had wing-like, high AR pectoral fins, deeper bodies, and were mostly benthic grazers. Using a novel phylogenetic comparative method to investigate evolutionary correlations between shapes, we found that the caudal fin had the highest evolutionary rates and covaried with both the body and pectoral fin, likely due to dietary and locomotor demands, respectively.","[{""name"":""U.S. Department of Education Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""NIH T32 Training Program in Motor Control"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1425049;1541547;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403063

Prevalence estimates can inform public health investment, identify communities with high disease burden or underdiagnosis, and reveal areas of unmet clinical need. With the advent of global-scale biobanks, genetics-based models to estimate the prevalence of disease have become viable. Autosomal recessive (AR) rare diseases are particularly tractable for this approach given that disease prevalence can be estimated from the pathogenic allele frequency (AF) in carriers from unaffected populations. Despite the usefulness of such estimates, this approach has not been validated against real-world clinical datasets at scale. Newborn screening (NBS) programs, which test newborns for a panel of neonatal diseases using quantitative diagnostic methods, provide a comparator for birth prevalence with low ascertainment bias, large sample size, and low diagnostic variability. NBS datasets thus offer a uniquely robust benchmark to evaluate and improve the accuracy of AR genetic prevalence models. Here we explore the feasibility, utility, and pitfalls of estimating AR birth prevalence using genetic and NBS data. We applied a genetic model to estimate birth prevalence for 28 AR diseases consistently present on NBS panels and benchmarked these against reported NBS birth prevalence in more than 12 million newborns in the United States. We found concordance between the genetic estimate and NBS was impacted by the population database used to derive AF, ancestry-matching methodology, and pathogenic variant inclusion criteria. Incorporating these refinements, we demonstrate that a genetics-first approach can provide order-of-magnitude estimates of AR disease birth prevalence for nearly all tested diseases (25/28; 89%). However, we note a general underestimate of the genetic prevalence, suggesting identifying additional pathogenic variants would improve the concordance with NBS. Further, we also assessed the impact of epidemiological and genetic variables, highlighting diseases where genetic prevalence estimates may not be suitable.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1760393403063

In this environment hostile to poly(A) tails, viral RNAs maintain a narrow tail-length distribution centering on 70- 80 nucleotides across infection cycles. They do this through two mechanisms. First, viral tails are extended during RNA synthesis within double-membrane vesicles; second, viral tails are capped by a complex that includes PABPC1 and CSDE1 and slows tail shortening.

Retention elements comprise a select set of CpG-rich gene promoters and act additively. Live-cell imaging and chromatin conformation capture show that retention elements physically interact with mitotic chromosomes at regions which are mitotically bookmarked by transcription factors and chromatin proteins, intermolecularly recapitulating promoter-enhancer interactions. Multiple retention elements are co-amplified with oncogenes on individual ecDNAs in human cancers and shape their sizes and structures. CpG-rich retention elements are focally hypomethylated; targeted cytosine methylation abrogates retention activity and leads to ecDNA loss, suggesting that methylation-sensitive interactions modulate episomal DNA retention. These results highlight the DNA elements and regulatory logic of mitotic ecDNA retention. Amplifications of retention elements promote the maintenance of oncogenic ecDNA across generations of cancer cells, revealing the principles of episome immortality intrinsic to the human genome.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CGCSDF-2021100007;F99CA274692;K00CA274692;K99CA286968;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DGE-2146755;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-2474-22;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Investigator (H.Y.C.);Hanna Gray Fellowship (J.A.B.);""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403063

Here we exploited the heterotrophic growth ability of Cyclotella cryptica to create the first diatom photosynthetic mutant by CRISPR-Cas inactivation of the nucleus-encoded ATP synthase subunit {gamma}. These mutants showed impaired phototrophic capacity and altered thylakoids morphology. In absence of {gamma}-ATP, protons that accumulate in the thylakoid lumen slow down the cytochrome b6f complex, thus keeping the electron carriers downhill oxidized. These results, reversible when the proton gradient is suppressed, demonstrate the existence of a photosynthetic control in diatoms. At variance with the wild type, {gamma}-ATP synthase mutants cannot grow heterotrophically in darkness nor in the light when photosystem II is inhibited. This requirement of heterotrophic growth on photosynthetic electron transfer or on the presence of plastidial ATP synthase suggests that the proton motive force (pmf) is a central integrator of the metabolic interaction between photosynthesis and heterotrophy. Our results establish C. crytica as a robust model for analysis of photosynthetic function, regulation and metabolic integration in organisms with secondary plastids.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403063

However, it is not known if these alleles increase GPC at the expense of other physiologically important traits, such as senescence and yield-component traits. Here, we evaluated the effects of mutations in HB-2 on grain yield and nitrogen (N)-use efficiency as well as senescence and plant architecture in multi-environment glasshouse and field experiments. In glasshouse experiments, the mutations in HB-2 moderately improved GPC irrespective of N supply and without accelerating senescence or decreasing grain number or weight compared to the wildtype. The trait analysis indicated mutant plants were more tolerant of N limitation in terms of above-ground N reduction compared to the wild type. The expression of all HB-2 homeologues increased in spikes at the lemma primordium stage in response to N limitation, indicating the later GPC increase could be a result of enhanced N sink strength determined during early development, rather than processes caused by direct changes in HB-2 expression in the grain. In field experiments, the introgression of HB-2 alleles into Australian elite spring wheat cultivars significantly improved GPC without compromising grain yield. The outcomes of this study support the introduction of miRNA-resistant HB-2 alleles, with a preference to HB-A2, into commercial wheat for improving grain quality without a yield penalty.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403063

Extraintestinal Pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC), a leading cause of bloodstream and urinary tract infections (UTIs), are often resistant to one or more antibiotic classes. Previously, we identified a clonal group of ExPEC strains (P1A) that persisted over a 5-year period from 2012 to 2016 within a female patient who suffered from frequent recurrent UTIs. A subset of these isolates carried a plasmid-borne MDR island (Ec17R) harboring 17 resistance genes. Sampling of fecal and urine samples in 2019 indicated that the patient remained colonized with the P1A lineage, including Ec17R-positive strains, over 7 years after collection of the first P1A isolates in 2012. Highlighting the public health relevance and mobility of Ec17R, we found that Ec17R-like islands are globally distributed across diverse bacterial species from various environmental, agricultural, and clinical sources, including multiple ExPEC isolates from local pediatric patients. By applying clustering approaches and Bayesian network modeling to 267 pediatric ExPEC isolates, we found that functionally distinct classes of resistance genes (including several heavy metal resistance genes) have a high probability of co-occurrence, possibly reflecting carriage within MDR islands like Ec17R. Finally, we observed that strains within the P1A lineage are recalcitrant to antibiotics for which they have no known resistance mechanisms, suggesting that these pathogens have means beyond their formidable array of resistance genes to survive within a host for years despite the administration of numerous, robust antimicrobial treatments.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GM134331;GM007464;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Defense"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0447fe631"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""W81XWH-22-1-0800 (SC210103);""},{""name"":""Margolis Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""University of Utah Research Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""University of Utah 3i graduate research fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403063

However, the relationship between their catalytic activities and antimicrobial functions remains largely unknown. Particularly, few biologically relevant substrates of these proteases have been identified. Huanglongbing (HLB) has been a major threat to the citrus industry worldwide. The HLB-associated bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), was previously shown to deploy an inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) to promote disease in citrus. In this study, we identified an outer membrane protein (OMP) of Las, LasOMP1, as a substrate of the citrus PLCP CsRD21a. LasOMP1 is one of the most highly expressed genes in Las. CsRD21a cleaves LasOMP1 and produces cleaved peptide products, which could be detected in vitro and in HLB-diseased citrus plants. We found that CsRD21a targets the N-terminal portion of LasOMP1, potentially at an extracellular loop region. Importantly, transgenic sweet orange overexpressing CsRD21a showed reduced Las titers and delayed disease symptoms, highlighting that engineering this protease is a promising strategy to enhance HLB resistance in citrus. Together, our work reveals a pathogen-derived substrate of plant PLCPs and highlights bacterial OMPs as direct targets of plant defense.

Significance StatementHuanglongbing (HLB) is the most devastating disease of citrus with no resistance having been identified in commercial cultivars. Previous work implicated papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) as an important hub of defense in citrus; however, their precise role in HLB tolerance remained unclear. Here, we identify and characterize an outer membrane protein (OMP) from the HLB-associated bacterium as a substrate of the citrus PLCP RD21a. We demonstrate a specific cleavage of the bacterial OMP by citrus RD21a, which may impair pathogen growth and/or activate plant immunity. Importantly, overexpression of RD21a enhances HLB tolerance in sweet oranges. This work identifies OMPs as substrates of plant PLCPs and provides insights into protease defense functions.","[{""name"":""USDA-NIFA"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2020-70029-33197;2022-70029-38471;2023-70029-41280;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""UKRI BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/W00691X/1;BBS/E/J/000PR9797;""},{""name"":""ERC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101019324;""},{""name"":""National Natural Science Foundation of China"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h0zpd94"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""32525008;U23A20198;""},{""name"":""Hatch"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FLA-CRC-005979;""},{""name"":""Emergency Citrus Disease Research and Extension"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Florida Citrus Initiative Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Citrus Research and Development Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403063

Zygnematophytes fall into five orders and each of these has chartered its own evolutionary path. Here, we have sequenced a contiguous genome of Spirogyra pratensis, epynomous for Spirogyrales and a classical system for evolutionary cell biology in the green lineage. Building on the genome, we transcriptionally profile the tractable life cycle of Spirogyra and its response to a bifactorial gradient of light and temperature. Our data highlight the deployment of quiescence and homeostatic programs. Yet what stands out most in Spirogyra is its spiral chloroplast, undulating intracellularly and abscising during mixed phragmoplast formation and furrowing. Leveraging the genome in tandem with co-expression network analyses we describe the molecular underpinnings of the unique cytokinetic process that govern both cell and plastid division.

We overturn the fundamental assumption that APC-mutant tumors exist at maximal WNT activation, revealing instead that cancer cells occupy a precarious ""WNT-just-right"" zone along a signaling continuum. This discovery exposes an unprecedented therapeutic vulnerability: while normal intestinal epithelium thrives with enhanced WNT signaling, APC-mutant tumor cells undergo apoptosis when pushed beyond their oncogenic setpoint, a phenomenon we term ""over-WNTing."" Through systematic organoid-based screening, we identified that WNT hyperactivation through multiple approaches: GSK3 inhibition, concentrated WNT proteins, or APC knockdown in GSK3-null backgrounds, selectively kills tumor cells by hyperactivating the driving pathway of CRC. Mechanistically, over-WNTing in APC-mutant cells triggers spillover into non-canonical planar cell polarity signaling, where RHOC upregulation induces ROCK1/2-mediated apoptosis. We demonstrate therapeutic efficacy across the neoplastic continuum, from adenomas to metastatic CRC, including patient-derived tumors, validating GSK3 inhibition with a novel nanoparticle formulation. This discovery enables the first cancer therapy that simultaneously enhances normal tissue function while eliminating tumors.

Discrepancies between expected and realized outcomes, termed reward prediction errors, serve as a teaching signal to update subsequent predictions and promote adaptive behavior. Neural correlates of prediction errors have been identified in several brain regions, including the lateral habenula (LHb), which contains a subpopulation of neurons encoding negative RPEs (nRPEs) that are excited by worse-than-expected outcomes and inhibited by better-than-expected outcomes. LHb projections to the midbrain shape firing in dopaminergic neurons and play a well-established role in reward learning and decision-making. However, the LHb engages in a wide variety of behaviors beyond reward processing, and it remains unclear whether these distinct functions are mediated by specific transcriptionally defined cell types. Little is known about the transcriptomic identity of nRPE-encoding neurons, limiting our understanding of the specific role of these signals in outcome valuation. Using cell type-specific recording in mice performing reward-guided tasks, we demonstrate neurons expressing the neuropeptide gene Tachykinin-1 (Tac1) represent a subpopulation of LHb neurons encoding reward prediction errors. We found LHbTac1 reward outcome responses are sensitive to changes in both the expected value and realized value of rewards, and their activity scales with the magnitude of the difference. Further, LHbTac1 neurons show little modulation to other task-related events, or to innately aversive stimuli that engage a broader population of LHb cell types. Together, these data demonstrate that Tac1 marks a subpopulation of LHb neurons that preferentially encodes nRPE. Our results provide insight into cell type-specific contributions of habenular neurons in RPE signaling and open avenues for more targeted manipulations of nRPE-encoding neurons to understand their role in reward-guided behavior.","[{""name"":""NINDS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RF1NS132914;""},{""name"":""NIMH"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F32MH110144;""},{""name"":""Esther A. & Joseph Klingenstein Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01q222b25"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Sylwestrak Klingenstein-Simons 2023;""},{""name"":""Brain & Behavior Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03a63f080"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""27735;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403063

Utilizing cancer-associated mutations to investigate the regulatory logic of PLC-{gamma}1, we demonstrate that the canonical hallmark of enzyme activity, phosphorylated Tyr783 (pTyr783), is not a proxy for activity level, but is rather a marker of dysregulated autoinhibition. Accordingly, OptoPLC-{gamma}1 with a deregulating mutation (P867R, S345F, or D1165H) exhibits elevated phosphorylation, and membrane localization of such is sufficient to activate substrate hydrolysis and concomitant motility responses. In particular, local recruitment of OptoPLC-{gamma}1 S345F polarizes cell motility on demand. This response is spatially dose-sensitive and only partially reduced by blocking canonical PLC-{gamma}1 signaling yet is lipase-dependent.

Displaced myonuclei are typically attributed to the activity of muscle stem cells, or satellite cells. We sought to address whether displaced myonuclei in adult skeletal muscle are exclusively from an exogenous source such as satellite cells or can result from resident myonuclear migration. To address this question, we used a murine recombination-independent muscle fibre-specific doxycycline-inducible fluorescent myonuclear labelling approach, EdU stem cell fate tracking, two durations of muscle mechanical overload (MOV, 3 days and 7 days), and fluorescent histology. Our findings show that: 1) displaced myonuclei emerge early during MOV, 2) resident myonuclear movement occurs rapidly during MOV, and 3) the contribution of resident versus exogenous displaced myonuclei depends on MOV duration, fibre type, and fibre size. These observations provide fundamental insights on myonuclear motility in response to stress in vivo and reframe our understanding of how a recognized feature of mammalian skeletal muscle can emerge in response to mechanical loading.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AG080047;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403063

Dysregulation of microglial activation occurs in numerous brain disorders, and driving or inhibiting specific states could be therapeutic. To discover regulators of microglial activation states, we conducted CRISPR interference screens in iPSC-derived microglia for inhibitors and activators of six microglial states. We identified transcriptional regulators for each of these states and characterized 31 regulators at the single-cell transcriptomic and cell-surface proteome level in two distinct iPSC-derived microglia models. Finally, we functionally characterized several regulators. STAT2 knockdown inhibits interferon response and lysosomal function. PRDM1 knockdown drives disease-associated and lipid-rich signatures and enhanced phagocytosis. DNMT1 knockdown results in widespread loss of methylation, activating negative regulators of interferon signaling. These findings provide a framework to direct microglial activation to selectively enrich microglial activation states, define their functional outputs, and inform future therapies.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Accumulating evidence indicates that intra-tumoral bacteria can influence tumor biology and contribute to therapy resistance in several cancer types, including pancreatic and colorectal cancer. Despite these findings, whether intra-tumoral bacteria play a role in modulating response and resistance to osimertinib in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma remains largely unexplored. This study aims to investigate the contribution of intra-tumoral bacteria to osimertinib resistance, thereby providing new insights into resistance mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic strategies.

MethodsBacteria previously identified in lung cancer tissue samples were cultured in liquid growth medium, and their preconditioned medium (PCM) was collected. PC9 cells were treated with PCM in the presence or absence of osimertinib to screen for bacteria capable of mediating resistance. Cell viability was assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 assays. To investigate potential mechanisms, Western blotting and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) phosphorylation arrays were performed. Control groups included cells treated with osimertinib alone, PCM alone, or vehicle. Statistical analyses were conducted using Students t-test as appropriate, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Data represent mean {+/-} SD from at least three independent experiments.

ResultsThe addition of PCM from Chryseobacterium indologenes restored cell viability in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cells treated with osimertinib. PCM exposure markedly increased insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) phosphorylation levels. PCM did not enhance cell viability when IGF1R was silenced or inhibited with linsitinib, demonstrating the pathways essential role. Proteinase K treatment abolished the ability of PCM to protect cells from osimertinib, and removal of proteins potentially interacting with IGF1R further diminished its efficacy. Finally, PCM also conferred resistance to osimertinib in patient-derived EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell lines.

ConclusionOur study demonstrates that the intra-tumoral bacteria C. indologenes may significantly influence sensitivity to osimertinib or impart resistance in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma by activating the IGF1R signaling pathway.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R21CA263751-1;P30CA033572;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Ghana virus (GhV), identified in 2012, is the only African bat henipavirus with a near-complete genome assembly. However, without isolates in culture, GhV biology, pathogenicity, and zoonotic potential remain poorly understood. Using reverse genetics, we recovered a full-length infectious clone of GhV at BSL-4 following rational reconstruction of its incomplete 3' leader and modification of a non-canonical transcriptional initiation site. GhV demonstrated restricted receptor tropism (ephrin-B2 but not ephrin-B3) and distinct innate immune antagonism. Replication was attenuated in primary human cells, but was enhanced in bat cells. In Syrian golden hamsters, GhV infection caused no disease or mortality. Furthermore, a chimeric NiV encoding the GhV receptor-binding protein was completely attenuated in vivo, implicating ephrin-B3 receptor usage as a critical determinant of HNV pathogenesis. These findings elucidate GhV zoonotic potential and inform strategies for virus surveillance and control.

Here, we analysed single-cell transcriptomes from 16 metazoan species spanning eight phyla. Using a novel integration method, Orthogroup Recoding, together with experimental validation, we show that monoaminergic neurons form consistent transcriptional clusters across Bilateria. These clusters share a regulatory signature involving conserved transcription factors, including homologues of Fev, Lmx1b, Fer2, Insm, and Isl, suggesting a common regulatory program. This signature extends beyond the brain including other monoaminergic cells, such as the gut enterochromaffin cells and larval sensory neurons. By contrast, non-bilaterian lineages lack the coordinated expression of the transcription factors and the biosynthetic machinery that regulate monoamine production. Our observations support the existence of a shared set of TFs that define 'monoaminergic identity' across in bilaterians.","[{""name"":""Royal Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wnrjx87"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UF160226;URF/R/221011;RGFR1181012;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MIBTP2020: BB/T00746X/1;BB/S019510/1;""},{""name"":""University of Leicester"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""College of Life Sciences PhD Studentship;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

However, despite their utility and wide application, these methods often return the results as an extensive and redundant list of gene sets, impeding interpretation and hypothesis generation. Moreover, network based information can provide additional biological context through functional interaction data, yet this is often overlooked by existing tools. Results: We developed GeDi, an R/Bioconductor package designed to streamline and standardize the interpretation of functional enrichment results. GeDi aggregates gene sets into biologically meaningful clusters using a suite of gene set distance metrics and clustering algorithms, aimed to reduce redundancy and improve clarity. GeDi also enables the integration of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, through the implementation of a weighted distance metric, providing a richer biological context by capturing functional connectivity between pathways and their components. The package offers visualizations, aggregation, and automated reporting, and is available as both a stand-alone R-package and an interactive Shiny application. Conclusion: GeDi facilitates clearer, faster interpretation of enrichment results by combining clustering and network context. Application to a public RNA-seq dataset revealed coherent biological themes, supporting both experimental and computational research.

These mechanisms were long thought to rely exclusively on ATPase or GTPase proteins, until the discovery of CTPase activity in the bacterial chromosome segregation protein ParB. In the ParABS system, CTP binding enables ParB accumulation around the centromere-like parS DNA sites to activate the ATPase ParA, thereby facilitating chromosome partitioning to daughter cells. CTP hydrolysis then releases ParB from DNA for recycling. This discovery uncovered a new regulatory principle, but the broader diversity of proteins employing a CTPase mechanism remains unclear. Here, we conduct a large-scale survey of proteins harboring the ParB-CTPase fold across bacteria, archaea, bacteriophages, and eukaryotes. While many ParB-like proteins follow the canonical ParABS organization with ParA partners, we also identify numerous orphan homologs encoded outside of the parAB operon, frequently linked to mobile genetic elements that may have driven their rapid diversification. The ParB-CTPase folds in these divergent proteins are often fused to lineage-specific domains with diverse predicted biological activities. We further demonstrate that while many homologs retain CTP-binding, others instead bind ATP or GTP, revealing a broader spectrum of nucleotide specificities than previously appreciated. Our findings establish the ParB-CTPase fold as a widely distributed and evolutionarily versatile NTP-binding module, repeatedly co-opted through domain fusion and shifts in nucleotide specificity to enable functions far beyond the classical ParABS-mediated DNA segregation.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""221776/Z/2/Z;227755/Z/23/Z;""},{""name"":""Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03356n642"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NA;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X01097X/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Higher plants encode an expanded family of PUF proteins with 26 members in Arabidopsis thaliana of which 6 (PUM1-PUM6) have a domain organization equivalent to metazoan PUF proteins implicated in mRNA regulation. Here, we show that the PUF proteins PUM2 and PUM6 are expressed in mitotically active cells of root and shoot meristems, while PUM5 is mostly expressed in the differentiation zone of root meristems exiting from active division. Increased PUM2 dosage in proliferating cells causes growth repression and developmental delay reminiscent of mutants with defects in cytoplasmic YTHDF proteins that bind to N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in mRNA. Remarkably, even weak defects in the m6A-YTHDF system enhance the effect of increased PUM2 dosage. In line with this genetic interaction, mRNA targets overlap significantly between PUFs and the major YTHDF proteins ECT2 and ECT3. Furthermore, the enrichment of the core PUF recognition motif URUAY around m6A sites is largely explained by PUF targeting, not by direct URUAY methylation as previously suggested. Our results indicate that the balance between the reciprocal activities of the deeply conserved cytoplasmic RNA binding protein families PUF and YTHDF is an important element of growth control in plants.","[{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04txyc737"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF19OC0054973;NNF24SA0092867;""},{""name"":""Carlsberg Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01kpjmx04"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CF20-0659;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

In nature, plants do not receive exogenous sugar supply, form symbiosis with microbes, and plant growth is influenced by soil edaphic factors. Thus, physiological and multi-omic analyses from plants grown on synthetic media will differ from those of soil-grown plants due to the influence of sucrose, and the lack of influence from microbiota and soil edaphic factors on plant growth. The rapid advancements in spatial-omics call for accurate characterization of plants grown in conditions similar to soil. To address the issue, we developed Artificial Soil (ArtSoil), a growth medium containing essential nutrients for plant growth, and aqueous soil extract (ASE) to maintain soil microbiomes and edaphic factors, simultaneously eliminating the need for sugar supplementation in the medium. We compared Arabidopsis thaliana grown on conventional media to ArtSoil under various growth conditions, and showed that complex soil microbiota in ArtSoil promote plant growth without physiological side effects induced by sucrose. We demonstrate an application for ArtSoil in single-cell transcriptomics and report microbiota-induced cell-type specificity in immune and nitrogen signaling. We tested ArtSoil with six types of ASEs to present the potential of ArtSoil in decoupling the effects of nutrients from microbiota in plant growth. We conclude that ArtSoil recapitulates the soil environment compared to conventional media, hence, enabling physiologically relevant plant growth.","[{""name"":""Cluster of Excellence on Plant Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/034waa237"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""390686111;""},{""name"":""Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012kf4317"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Wolf Frommer;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""391465903/GRK 2466;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Comprehensive mapping and characterization of candidate astrocyte-to-neuron reprogramming factors is an essential step to realizing the potential of this strategy. Here, we established a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa)-based approach for neuronal reprogramming of primary human astrocytes. We conducted high-throughput CRISPRa screens of all human genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) to identify novel and efficient reprogramming factors. scRNA-seq characterization of top hits revealed that single TFs reprogram primary human astrocytes into multiple neuronal subtypes with distinct cell type-specific gene signatures. We demonstrate that INSM1 reprograms astrocytes to a glutamatergic neuron-like state and has broad neurogenic activity across different cell types and across human and mouse contexts. Finally, we conduct paired CRISPRa screens to identify cofactors that cooperate with INSM1 to enhance neuronal reprogramming and subtype specification, and elucidate genomic mechanisms of interaction and downstream regulators.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UM1HG012053;RM1HG011123;T32GM008555;R01MH125236;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Such properties can be probed by single-molecule FRET experiments, which have revealed a strong dependence of the equilibrium degree of compaction on sequence for a set of 16 naturally occurring disordered regions of the same length from RNA-binding proteins. Remarkably, however, we find chain reconfiguration times measured for the same proteins to be almost independent of sequence, although chain dynamics would be expected to be slower for more compact proteins because of stronger intrachain interactions leading to increased internal friction. We investigate this effect with the aid of multi-microsecond, all-atom explicit-solvent simulations of all 16 disordered proteins. The simulations reproduce the experimental FRET efficiencies across the sequence set with near-quantitative accuracy. Explicitly including the FRET dyes improves agreement while minimally perturbing the protein ensemble, with residual deviations arising mainly from slightly overstabilized salt bridges. The simulations further reproduce the experimentally observed lack of correlation between reconfiguration times and chain dimensions across sequences. We are able to rationalize this observation as arising from two compensating factors as the chains get more compact: The narrowing of end-to-end equilibrium distance distributions and a concomitant reduction of the effective end-to-end diffusion coefficients have opposite effects that result in the the small variation of reconfiguration times with protein collapse, helping to ""buffer"" the effect of sequence on linker dynamics.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Pre-vein ECs co-expressed certain arterial (SOX17) and venous (APLNR) markers, harbored poised chromatin at future venous genes, but completed venous differentiation only upon VEGF inhibition. Intersectional lineage tracing revealed that early Sox17+ Aplnr+ ECs also formed veins in vivo. Next, we compared how Ebola, Andes, and Nipah viruses infect artery and vein ECs under biosafety-level-4 containment. Each virus distinctly affected ECs.

Both patients carrying PD-associated variants in GBA1, encoding lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), and a subset of non-carrier patients have been shown to have reduced GCase enzymatic activity, suggesting that reduced GCase activity may be a feature of both genetic and a subset of sporadic PD. However, the effect of PD-associated variants in LRRK2, encoding a serine/threonine kinase, on GCase activity remains controversial, with conflicting results in various tissues and cell types. Moreover, rare patients carrying both GBA1 and LRRK2 risk alleles seem to have a more benign disease course than carriers of GBA1 variants alone, suggesting a complex interplay between these two genes in PD. Here we evaluate the effect of LRRK2 kinase activity on GCase activity in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia (iMGs), a PD-relevant brain cell type expressing high levels of LRRK2. Using CRISPR editing, isogenic control iPSC lines were generated to match PD patient-derived iPSC lines harbouring the LRRK2 p.G2019S, p.M1646T, or p.N551K-p.R1398H protective haplotype variants. Whereas iMGs harbouring the p.M1646T variant, and the protective haplotype, respectively increased and decreased phosphorylation of canonical LRRK2 substrate, Rab10, GCase protein levels and activity were not altered in any of the LRRK2 variant lines. Additionally, whereas pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity had no impact on GCase activity in iMGs under basal conditions, it attenuated the increase in GCase activity elicited in response to interferon {gamma} (IFN{gamma}) treatment. Moreover, GCase activity induced by IFN{gamma} was reduced in PD risk LRRK2 p.M1646T iMGs and increased in p.N551K-p.R1398H protective haplotype iMGs compared to their isogenic corrected controls, congruent with their respective effects on LRRK2 kinase activity and PD risk. Thus, our data suggests a role for LRRK2 kinase activity in regulation of GCase activity in response to neuroinflammation.","[{""name"":""Michael J.

To confirm this hypothesis, we systematically analyzed pan-acetylation and pan-phosphorylation of the entire human genome in HEK293T cells. Herein, we show that both pan-acetylation and pan-phosphorylation of histones in nucleosomes along gene bodies are coupled with the activities of Pol II.

In Drosophila, previous work has shown that fruitless and doublesex transcription factors identify neurons driving sexually dimorphic behaviour. However, the organisation of dimorphic neurons into functional circuits remains unclear.

We now present the connectome of the entire Drosophila male central nervous system. This contains 166,691 neurons spanning the brain and ventral nerve cord, fully proofread and comprehensively annotated including fruitless and doublesex expression and 11,691 cell types. By comparison with a previous female brain connectome, we provide the first comprehensive description of the differences between male and female brains to synaptic resolution. Of 7,319 cross-matched cell types in the central brain, 114 are dimorphic with an additional 262 male- and 69 female-specific (totalling 4.8% of neurons in males and 2.4% in females).

This resource enables analysis of full sensory-to-motor circuits underlying complex behaviours as well as the impact of dimorphic elements. Sex-specific and dimorphic neurons are concentrated in higher brain centres while the sensory and motor periphery are largely isomorphic. Within higher centres, male-specific connections are organised into hotspots defined by male-specific neurons or the presence of male-specific arbours on neurons that are otherwise similar between sexes. Numerous circuit switches reroute sensory information to form conserved, antagonistic circuits controlling opposing behaviours.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""220343/Z/20/Z;221300/Z/20/Z;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00tw3jy02"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Within RGCs, RNAs are transported long distances to basal endfeet, where they can undergo local translation. However, the subcellular composition of RGCs and function of local gene regulation remains largely unknown. Here, we discover that basal endfeet harbor a rich transcriptome including a Dynein component critical for subcellular RGC function. By purifying RGC compartments in vivo, we discover ~3000 endfoot transcripts, including ~800 highly enriched compared to cell bodies. Many endfoot-enriched transcripts exhibit conserved subcellular localization in neurons and glia and are associated with neurodevelopmental disease. We show that endfoot-enriched Dync1li2 regulates RGC basal morphology and subsequently interneuron organization. Finally, we develop LOCAL-KD, a CRISPR-Cas13 based method for subcellular mRNA knockdown in vivo. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that endfoot-localized Dync1li2 is critical for RGC morphology. Our study establishes experimental paradigms to understand RNA localization in the nervous system.

Direct mechanistic evidence from human-relevant models remains limited. To address this gap, we exposed human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical organoids (COs; six independent lines) to physiologically relevant APAP concentrations (25, 50, and 100 M) for 5 days starting at day 21, a developmental stage corresponding to the late first trimester. We assessed organoid growth, apoptosis, neuronal/progenitor ratios, transcriptomics (RNA-seq), and functional maturation using multielectrode arrays (2-4 months). APAP exposure did not alter growth dynamics, cytoarchitecture, or viability, with apoptosis rates remaining below 1% in all conditions. Neuronal and progenitor cell proportions were unchanged. Bulk RNA-seq revealed subtle, dose-dependent transcriptional changes only at higher doses (0 differentially expressed genes at 25 M, 9 at 50 M, and 16 at 100 M), enriched for neurodevelopmental pathways. Despite these slight molecular perturbations, electrophysiological recordings showed normal firing rates, burst frequency, and network synchronicity across exposure groups. Taken together, therapeutic APAP concentrations produced only modest transcriptional effects without structural or functional consequences in developing cortical organoids. These results align with recent sibling-controlled epidemiological studies that attribute reported associations to confounding and provide mechanistic reassurance that recommended APAP use during pregnancy is unlikely to disrupt fetal brain development.","[{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R21HD109616;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R56MH128365;R21MH128827;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00j4k1h63"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01ES033636;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Recent evidence suggests that through repeated exposure to search arrays containing salient color singleton distractors, individuals can learn to divert their attention away from such salient but irrelevant stimuli, even before they capture attention. However, the mechanisms underlying such attentional suppression remain unclear. The current study examined trajectories of singleton distractor representations during visual searches to address this gap. Using multivariate pattern analyses on EEG data (N = 40), we found that singleton distractor representations underwent a rapid inversion approximately 200 ms into the search. These inverted representations were coded in a shared subspace with target representations, but in a reversed orientation, presumably to downweight their salience in the spatial priority map. Target locations were consistently enhanced compared to non-singleton distractors, while singleton distractors were suppressed. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of rapid representational transformation underlying salient distractor suppression at the onset of visual search. The rapid inversion of pop-out singleton distractor signals resulted in an inverted arrangement of target and distractor representations in a shared neural subspace, which facilitates subsequent read-out of both target enhancement and distractor suppression signals in the computation of spatial priorities to successfully guide search.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01EY028746;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Due to this, there are now several variants of Martian regolith that are chemically known and commercially available. These simulants are vital for panspermia models that suggest a transfer of simple life throughout the solar system via ejecta containing life from Mars when its surface was more favourable to host life. Bacteria that produce endospores are suitable candidates for these models as they have adequate protection from the harsh conditions of space, particularly against solar radiation. To assess this, the simple endospore former, Bacillus subtilis, was assessed for growth on several Martian regolith that represented different locations and epochs of Mars. This consisted of a conventional Martian regolith, a sulphur rich regolith, and a simulant of the Jezero crater which was thought to have once been flooded with water. We found that the sulphur rich regolith inhibited endospore formation, while the other two variants favoured endospore production. Interestingly, we also identified that pulsing of UVC in a simulation of endospores on rotational ejecta show that endospores break down faster with lower rotational frequency despite receiving the same UVC dose. Moreover, and most strikingly is that viable endospores after surviving UVC dosage displayed elevated expression of the DNA damage SOS response gene, RecA. Importantly, this study suggests that astrobiological approaches that utilise endospore viability as a benchmark for survival require reassessment as genomic integrity may be compromised.

ImportanceCurrent panspermia models that explore the potential interplanetary transfer of simple microbes, particularly those that focus on Mars, apply a combination of Martian topology and bacterial survival. This study assesses Bacillus subtilis endospore formation on different Martain regolith mediums and simulates their potential exposure on fast and slow rotations while being exposed to UV radiation to simulate space radiation. We outline what regions of Mars would be suitable for the formation of endospores, and moreover, we assess viable endospores post-exposure for the expression of the SOS DNA damage repair gene, RecA. Endospores that are viable after withstanding near lethal doses of UVC show elevated expression of RecA. While our study adds vital information to understanding Martian topography and microbial survival, our finding RecA expression analysis post-exposure adds important information to our understanding of endospores as a whole and should be factored into future astrobiological approaches.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Using controlled mixing experiments between pairs of strains that have defined aggregation tendencies, we apply a quantitative behavioural analysis framework and show that individuals maintain their intrinsic movement patterns and interaction rules regardless of group composition. Notably, neither behavioural differences nor distant genetic relatedness between strains lead to a modulation of individual behaviour; instead, distinct strains behave and coexist without influencing each others intrinsic behavioural tendencies. Using a simulation model, we further show that aggregation in mixed C. elegans groups can be accurately predicted from strain-specific individual-level parameters measured in homogeneous settings. Our integrated approach provides a generalised framework for understanding collective behaviour in diverse heterogeneous systems, which may offer insights into population-level consequences of phenotypic variation and broader ecological processes.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EXC 2117 – 422037984;""},{""name"":""Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior"",""id"":""https://ror.org/026stee22"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""International Max Planck Research School for Quantitative Behavior, Ecology & Evolution"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101098722;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

At the molecular level, machine learning models identified the inflammatory response and regulators of circadian rhythms as key cellular predictors of AD. These signatures were reflected in specific cell types: microglia transitioned to a pro-inflammatory state, while inhibitory neurons within sleep- and circadian-regulating hypothalamic subregions showed the most profound transcriptional alterations, including disruptions in ligand-receptor interactions and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling.

Why perturbations in ER morphology manifest specifically in neurons remains unknown.

Here, by coupling visualisation of global sub-Hz firing bursts to ER ultrastructural manipulations in hiPSC-derived cortical neurons, alongside physical simulations, we establish a key ER structure-function principle: neuronal ER architecture dictates Ca2+ replenishment speed. Altering ER structure hinders network ER luminal connectivity and Ca2+ propagation from refill points at plasma membrane contact sites, impairing the ERs capability to supply repetitive Ca2+ bursts. The ER morpho-regulatory control of Ca2+ refill speed thus constitutes a switch on neuronal activity. These results expose the selective vulnerability of Ca2+-firing cells to ER structural disruptions, rationalising ER dysfunction in neurodegeneration. This mechanism could apply universally to Ca2+-firing cells.","[{""name"":""UK Dementia Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02wedp412"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UK DRI-2004;""},{""name"":""Evelyn Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/047fzcc28"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AS-525;""},{""name"":""Cambridge Commonwealth European and International Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05sprqy15"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2034482;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

To bridge this gap, we developed conditional transgenic models targeting the mitochondrial complex I subunit Ndufs4 in the retina. Broad deletion of Ndufs4 in the retina resulted in vision loss, progressive RGC degeneration, and pronounced immune activation before overt RGC death. Strikingly, depletion of myeloid cells significantly preserved RGCs, demonstrating that inflammation is not simply a downstream consequence but a participant in the degeneration process. To further distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, we generated a mosaic model in which only subsets of retinal cells lacked Ndufs4. In this paradigm, the degeneration first appeared selectively in mutant regions, suggesting that mitochondrial impairment within RGCs is necessary to initiate vulnerability. At later stages, however, the degeneration extended beyond mutant territories, highly suggestive of a propagation through non-cell autonomous processes. Together, these findings support a model in which mitochondrial dysfunction creates the conditions for neuronal vulnerability, while immune responses govern the timing and extent of cell loss. This framework explains the consistent co-occurrence of metabolic deficits and neuroinflammation in optic neuropathies and highlights the importance of their interactions in disease progression. By clarifying the intersection of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, this work advances our understanding of RGC degeneration and provides a conceptual basis for deciphering pathogenic processes across diverse optic neuropathies.","[{""name"":""Glaucoma Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ez53b31"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Catalyst for a cure;""},{""name"":""NIH/NEI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R21EY037445;R01EY030138;""},{""name"":""Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PID2019-107633RB-I00;PID2022-142544OB-I00;PID2020-114977RB-I00;PID2023-151947OB-I00;""},{""name"":""AGAUR"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2017SGR-323;2021SGR-720;""},{""name"":""La Caixa Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ID 100010434;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

To date, no high-resolution structures of native human nucleosomes have been reported. Here we report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of native human nucleosomes isolated from HEK293 cells. The HEK293-NCP structure reveals that native human nucleosomes store 145 bp of DNA. Despite the DNA sequence diversity of native nucleosomes, we observe conserved nucleotides that support the idea of a nucleosome positioning code. In addition to these striking features of nucleosomal DNA, we note alternate conformations of several DNA contacting histone residues that hint at dynamics in the HEK293-NCP. To complement the HEK293-NCP structure, we provide a mass spectrometry analysis of histone modifications and variants present in the sample, which demonstrates that a typical HEK293-NCP is composed of canonical histones with N-terminal tails that are methylated at K9, K27 and/or K36 of histone H3.

Here, we developed a new computational framework to minimize negative transfer for domain-adaptive brain decoding by reframing source selection as a mixture model parameter estimation problem, allowing each source subject to contribute through a continuous mixture weight rather than being outright included or excluded. To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer. Collectively, this research advances toward a more principled and generalizable brain decoding framework, laying the mathematical foundation for scalable brain-computer interfaces and other applications in computational neuroscience.","[{""name"":""Schroeder Institute for Brain Innovation and Recovery"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

However, SARS-CoV-2 could introduce mutations in the viral proteins to confer resistance to antivirals. Thus, screening for drug-resistant SARS-CoV-2 mutants and elucidating their resistant mechanisms are critical for guiding the selection of effective antiviral therapies. Here, we utilized a luminescent attenuated SARS-CoV-2 ({Delta}3a7b-Nluc WT) to safely identify ensitrelvir drug-resistant mutants (DRM-E) without the need of using virulent forms of SARS-CoV-2. We isolated a DRM-E containing a G23 deletion (G23del) in Mpro with high resistance (>1,000 fold) to ensitrelvir, but not to the other Mpro inhibitor (nirmatrelvir) or to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor remdesivir. The contribution of G23del was confirmed by generating a recombinant luminescent attenuated SARS-CoV-2 containing G23del in the non-structural protein 5 (NSP5) gene ({Delta}3a7b-Nluc G23del). {Delta}3a7b-Nluc G23del exhibited significant resistance to ensitrelvir in both cultured cells an in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice. Binding affinity revealed that G23del mutation substantially altered Mpro binding affinity for ensitrelvir but not nirmatrelvir. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that G23del in Mpro can confer high resistance to ensitrelvir. Positively, G23del in Mpro does not render SARS-CoV-2 resistant to nirmatrelvir or remdesivir, suggesting the feasibility of treating infections with SARS-CoV-2 containing G23del with these other approved antivirals.

SIGNIFICANCEThe clinical use of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs is increasingly challenged by the emergence of drug-resistant mutants. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify and characterize antiviral escape SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly for FDA-approved antivirals. Our study addresses this by employing a luminescent attenuated virus platform ({Delta}3a7b-Nluc WT) to safely identify and characterize resistance mutations without the concern of using virulent forms of SARS-CoV-2. Using this safe approach, we have identified a G23 deletion (G23del) in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, which mediates resistance to ensitrelvir in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, while G23del was able to confer more than 1,000-fold increased resistance to ensitrelvir, SARS-CoV-2 containing G23del remained sensitive to other Mpro (nirmatrelvir) and RdRp (remdesivir) inhibitors. Altogether, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using {Delta}3a7b-Nluc to safely identify and characterize drug resistant viruses without the biosafety concern of using virulent SARS-CoV-2 and advance the design of next-generation antiviral drugs.","[{""name"":""NIAID"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U19 AI171403;R01 AI161363;R01 AI161363-03S1;5N93021C00014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Here, we investigate the extracellular CIS from Algoriphagus machipongonensis (AlgoCIS) by a multimodal cryo-electron microscopy approach and structure-guided engineering, which allowed us to arrest AlgoCIS in multiple intermediate states of firing. Together with the post-firing structure, our data suggest a stepwise firing mechanism involving all modules: signal propagation starts with the binding of the tail-fibers, followed by opening of the cage, an expansion of the baseplate iris, and resulting in sheath contraction and the release of cap adaptor.

Our study will serve as a framework for understanding the firing mechanism of diverse CISs and will facilitate the engineering of CISs for biomedical applications.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

G{gamma}30A is essential for broadening responses to long-chain acids, acting with Gs, G{beta}13F, adenylate cyclase Ac13E and the Cngl channel. We further discovered that Cirl, a latrophilin-family GPCR7, is broadly-transcribed in the antenna but the protein is localized only in Ir64a-DC4 sensory cilia, dependent upon G{gamma}30A, but not Ir64a. Importantly, loss of Cirl also narrows Ir64a-DC4 tuning properties. Homologous neurons in Drosophila sechellia naturally exhibit narrow acid tuning, despite functional conservation of Ir64a; these differences correlate instead with lower expression of metabotropic components.

We have evaluated mrpasts accuracy on a variety of models, including stepping-stone models with asymmetric migrations, changes in effective population sizes, out-of-Africa, and American admixture. We demonstrated mrpasts accuracy using simulated ARGs and inferred ARGs, and its high versatility in jointly inferring all parameters in complex models, including time of demographic events (e.g., population split, admixture), effective population size (e.g., constant, exponential growth), and gene flow (e.g., admixture proportion, migration rate). Extending the three-population out-of-Africa model with asymmetric migrations, we observed significantly more migrations from East Asians to Europeans than from Europeans to East Asians. Notably, mrpast can reliably recover all parameters in an American admixture model, when treating non-admixed Native Americans as an unsampled (""ghost"") population. Applying this model to Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Colombian populations, we found that the reconstructed histories of Native and admixed Americans align closely with both historical records and genetic evidence.

However, it is metastasis that causes the vast majority of cancer related deaths and is difficult to target clinically, indicating an urgent unmet need.

Mesothelin-targeting CAR TV cells expressing synthetic or native receptors responsive to the cytokine Interleukin-5 improved the survival of mice bearing an extremely high or  terminal level of metastatic burden compared to CAR T cells that did not express VRs. Against newly established metastatic lesions and lesions undergoing metastatic outgrowth, CAR TV cells showed a robust anti-cancer effect resulting in an improved prognosis compared to control CAR T cells. Histopathological assessments showed a substantial reduction of metastasis number and lesion size with CAR TV treatment, concomitant with increased immune cell infiltration in the metastatic regions. Our work demonstrates the efficacy of high-motility CAR T cells in a metastatic setting and extends their scope to the treatment of metastasis of solid tumors.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U54CA143868;U54AR081774;U54CA268083;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U01AG060903;P30CA006973;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Plasmid dependent phages (PDPs) are particularly attractive as therapeutics because they can both kill targeted pathogen cells, whilst also potentially preventing the further spread of antibiotic resistance genes encoded by plasmids. However, we lack experimental studies of the ecological and evolutionary response of multidrug resistance plasmids against plasmid dependent phage treatment under ecologically relevant scenarios allowing plasmid conjugation. We experimentally evolved populations of E. coli carrying the multidrug resistance RP4 plasmid with the PRD1 PDP under conditions where conjugation was associated with either strong or weak benefits. When opportunities for conjugation were rare, PRD1 only transiently suppressed the conjugative plasmid population due to the rapid evolution of PRD1 resistant plasmids that lacked conjugative ability. Increasing the ecological opportunity for conjugation enhanced plasmid suppression and delayed the evolution of PRD1 resistant plasmids. PRD1 resistance was associated with reduced conjugative ability, but this trade-off was complex due to the heterogeneous impacts of resistance mutations on pilus production and conjugative ability. Mutations and IS element insertions in conjugation genes caused a wide range of PRD1 resistance phenotypes, ranging from complete resistance (virB4) to partial resistance (trbB, trbL). Bioinformatic analysis of publicly available IncP plasmid sequences showed that truncated variants of VirB4 protein are common in natural populations, suggesting that plasmid-dependent phages are an important selective pressure in microbial communities. Our results demonstrate an evolutionary trade-off between conjugative ability and phage resistance that cannot be easily circumvented by plasmids. Targeting multidrug resistance plasmids with PDPs is likely to drive loss of conjugation limiting the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial communities.","[{""name"":""UKRI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/W031361/1;""},{""name"":""UKRI Frontiers Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/Y031067/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Here, using in vivo cellular-resolution calcium (Ca2+) imaging, optogenetics and chemogenetics, we show that risk of punishment dramatically alters animals choice between a large/risky and small- /safe reward and produces novel, causally necessary, patterns of activity in basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons. We find that experience of a punished outcome generates a BLA representation that is selectively replayed when animals subsequently abort choice of the large/risky reward option. Additionally, we show that risk leads to the incorporation of newly encoding BLA neurons into the pre-choice representation, which predicts shifting away from the large/risky option. These findings reveal how dynamic reshaping of BLA representations underpins behavioral flexibility in the face of risk.","[{""name"":""NIAAA Intramural Research Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1ZIAAA000411-19;""},{""name"":""Center on Compulsive Disorders"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Despite this conservation, TBP function diverges across species. In yeast, TBP is required for all three RNA Pols, whereas in mammals, it is essential only for RNA Pol III, but not RNA Pol I or II. To examine the evolutionary divergence of TBP homologs in different species, we determined the ability of murine TBP and its paralogs to complement endogenous TBP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite their highly conserved DNA-binding domains, murine TBP homologs were unable to fully rescue the lethality caused by TBP inactivation in yeast. This incomplete complementation correlates with a failure to fully support binding by RNA Pols II and III. Furthermore, we show that the divergent N-terminal domain (NTD) of TBP contributes to species-specific activity and modulates RNA Pol II binding changes in stress-induced response. Lastly, we demonstrate a negative correlation between the length of the intrinsically disordered NTD of TBP family proteins and the gene density in different species, suggesting that the NTD may have contributed to increasingly complex gene regulation during evolution.","[{""name"":""Canadian Institutes of Health Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gavpb45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PJT-191938;PJT-162289;""},{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN-2020-06106;""},{""name"":""Canada Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0517h6h17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRC-RS 2021-00294;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Leopards (Panthera pardus), a widely distributed generalist species, provide an ideal case for studying the role of the environment. The population dynamics of African and Asian leopards differ dramatically, with near panmixia in Africa versus a strong structure and eight subspecies in Asia. Fossil records show that a population in Europe disappeared after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), further pointing to complex range dynamics in Eurasia. In this study, we explicitly test the role of climate in shaping leopards population dynamics across the continents, by quantitatively combining paleoclimatic, demographic, and genetic simulations over the last 450 thousand years. Using an Approximate Bayesian Computational framework, we show that the genetic structure differences between Africa and Asia can be explained by distinct historical climatic conditions in these two continents: most of sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Southeast Asia exhibited a stable range without geographical barriers, while other areas such as Morocco, Afghanistan and Northeast Asia showed expansion and extinction cycles during glacial and interglacials. We further model population dynamics in Europe and validate it against fossil and radiocarbon dates records. We find that European populations were likely fragile, with extinctions repeatedly predicted over multiple glacial cycles, indicating that climate change possibly led to the extinction of the European subspecies following the LGM. Notably, we found that climate during the Holocene should have allowed a more recent recolonisation that did not happen, indicating other factors such as human presence might have blocked it.","[{""name"":""Cambridge Commonwealth European and International Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05sprqy15"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Actions"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101028348;101063265;""},{""name"":""Natural Environment Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02b5d8509"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NE/S007164/1;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""647787;""},{""name"":""Leverhulme Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012mzw131"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RPG-2020-317;""},{""name"":""Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Despite its importance, the molecular mechanism of CoV polymerase template switching remains unclear. Using magnetic tweezers, we show that the CoV non-structural protein (nsp) 13-helicase drives polymerase template switching, followed by copy-back RNA synthesis. This activity requires nsp13-helicase ATPase activity and a duplex RNA downstream of the CoV polymerase. This novel function of nsp13-helicase is targeted by the nucleotide analogs remdesivir and molnupiravir, whose incorporation in the nascent strand increases CoV polymerase template switching probability, leading to defective RNA production. We propose a novel mechanism of action where incorporation of these analogs dramatically reduces full length genome copy number by stimulating polymerase template switching. Our study further demonstrates nsp13-helicases central role in CoV replication and how this enzyme function can be indirectly targeted by analogs.","[{""name"":""NWO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OCENW.XL21.XL21.115;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/043z4tv69"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AI161841-01;AI171292;AI158463;""},{""name"":""NIGMS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GM12260;GM067153;""},{""name"":""Netherlands Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Gravitation grant 024.003.019;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Upon cell entry, translation of the virus genome is mediated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5 untranslated region (UTR). Despite early identification of the poliovirus IRES, structure determination has been hampered by the flexibility and complexity of the RNA ([~]450 nt, five structured domains), the requirement for almost all of the eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), and additional dependency on PCBP2 for trans-activation. As a result, there is little mechanistic information on how enterovirus Type 1 IRESs recruit and direct translational machinery.

To address this, here we reconstitute human translation initiation on a model poliovirus IRES and examine 48S complexes by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). Our structures reveal a novel set of interactions between the IRES and the translation machinery. Domain IVc contacts uS19 and uS13 on the small ribosomal subunit, and the conserved apical GNRA tetraloop interacts directly with the initiator tRNA during start-codon recognition. We demonstrate that disruption of these contacts causes defects in IRES-driven translation and virus replication. Together, our results define the structural and molecular basis for translation initiation on the Type 1 IRES, and highlight the potential for RNA-RNA tertiary interactions as new targets for antiviral therapeutics.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/Z515668/1;BB/M011151/1;BBS/E/PI/230002A;BBS/E/PI/23NB0003;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/T000376/1;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""220620/Z/20/Z;202471/Z/16/A;221818/Z/20/Z;""},{""name"":""Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03356n642"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures. Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods. We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden.

Here, we revive the idea of a standard model for ion channels based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formulation, and apply it to a recently curated database of ion channel models.

It produces similar, if not identical, responses to voltage-clamp protocols in simulations where the ion channel omnimodels were used. Importantly, the standard formalism enables easy comparison of models based on parameter settings. It can also be used to make new observations about the space of ion channel kinetics found in neurons. Furthermore, it facilitates the inference of ion channel parameters from the responses to standard protocols.

A similar phenotype was found in circulating monocytes from AD patients compared to healthy controls. Blocking IFN-I with monoclonal antibodies or using chimeric AD mice with BM from mice lacking the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR1) alleviated myelopoiesis dysfunction, normalized monocyte phenotypes, and reduced cognitive impairment. These improvements in myeloid function were accompanied by an increased homing of monocyte-derived macrophages in the AD brain.

However, existing methods for heritability estimation attributed to rare-coding variants are often limited by the effects of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and by the sparse nature of rare variant data. We introduce FLEX (Fast, LD-aware Estimation of eXome-wide and gene-level heritability), a scalable and flexible framework for estimating and partitioning heritability across genes or sets of genes using WES data. FLEX integrates all coding variants- from common to ultra-rare - within a unifled model and corrects for LD-induced effects to improve the accuracy of heritability estimates. In addition, FLEX supports both individual-level and summary statistic data and is computationally efflcient for biobank-scale datasets. Through extensive simulations, we show that FLEX is well-calibrated while providing accurate heritability estimates.

We applied FLEX to WES data across N = 153, 351 unrelated European ancestry individuals and 20 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank. We identifled 64 gene-trait pairs with signiflcant gene-level heritability (p < 0.05/18, 624 accounting for the number of protein-coding genes tested), among which rare coding variants explained 38% of gene-level heritability, on average. Compared to heritability estimates from genome-wide imputed SNPs, incorporation of rare and ultra-rare coding variants led to a 24.8% increase in heritability on average, while effect sizes at rare and ultra-rare variants are substantially larger ({approx} 18x on average). Partitioning across variant effect annotations, we flnd that predicted loss-of-function variants had stronger individual effects than missense variants (24% on average) while missense variants accounted for a greater share of rare coding heritability. Together, FLEX provides an adaptable and accurate approach for quantifying gene-level heritability, advancing our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits, and facilitating the discovery of trait-relevant genes.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM153406;""},{""name"":""National Heart Lung and Blood Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012pb6c26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HL170604;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00adh9b73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01DK132775;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CAREER-1943497;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Several studies have compared how food and social rewards are represented in different regions involved in reward processing and found either overlapping or distinct representations. In the basolateral amygdala (BLA) there seems to be opposing evidence for both shared and unique encoding of social and nonsocial stimuli. In our recent work, we found that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region reciprocally connected to the BLA, has distinct social and food representations using a novel self-paced two-choice assay. Given the BLA and mPFCs differing roles in reward processing, it is important to understand how these two nodes may differ in their encoding reward types within the same assay. To resolve how the BLA encodes social and food information, we recorded the activity of individual BLA neurons in female and male mice during a two-choice social-sucrose operant task. We found that BLA neurons robustly and distinctly respond to social and food reward. In contrast to the mPFC, BLA neurons did not show a bias towards social reward responsiveness and instead showed equal social/sucrose representation, in males, or a sucrose reward bias, in females. BLA neurons were sensitive to internal state - water deprivation increased the proportion of sucrose reward responsive neurons. Additionally, sucrose reward responsive BLA neurons were differentially sensitive to reward omissions, such that neurons that were excited by sucrose reward were more sensitive to reward omissions compared to those inhibited by reward. Together, these findings demonstrate distinct, heterogeneous response profiles within the BLA to social and food rewards, in a manner different from the mPFC.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01MH130755;F31MH133373;""},{""name"":""Alfred P.

We explore both pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure therapeutic settings via subcutaneous and intranasal routes of administration.

ImportanceThe COVID-19 pandemic, triggered a rapid wave of innovation, accelerating the delivery of new vaccine technology and anti-viral treatments. In our first paper, we described the discovery and molecular optimization of Bicycle molecules as a novel drug class for the potential treatment of SARS CoV-2. Here, we have performed deeper characterization of these molecules in established animal models that simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission, testing more convenient delivery routes, such as intra-nasal. The Bicycle molecules demonstrated positive outcomes in each of these studies and suggest that Bicycle molecules, as convenient and effective anti-viral treatments, could be an important addition to help future preparedness against new viral pandemics.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

P. aeruginosa isolates from the CF airways are also known to commonly acquire mutations in the quorum sensing regulator, lasR. The appearance of these lasR mutants is associated with a worsening clinical prognosis. In this work, we show that loss of lasR function has a significant impact on the stability of inter-species interactions in a polymicrobial ecosystem, and in particular on the dynamics of a common CF-associated fungus, Candida albicans. Titres of C. albicans were stable in the presence of wild type P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. However, when wild type P. aeruginosa was replaced by a {Delta}lasR mutant, C. albicans titres progressively declined over time. This instability could be reversed by ectopic expression of a Type VI Secretion System effector cluster (tsi) in the {Delta}lasR mutant. We also noted that challenge of the polymicrobial cultures with a clinically-relevant combination of antibiotics (colistin and ciprofloxacin) led to a hyphal bloom of the fungus. This bloom was abolished in the {Delta}lasR mutant, but again, was restored by ectopic expression of the tsi cluster. Finally, we show that whereas wild type P. aeruginosa is relatively agnostic to the presence of other microbes, the {Delta}lasR mutant is not and undergoes substantial transcriptional reprogramming. Our data indicate that lasR has a large and previously unrecognised impact on inter-species interactions. We therefore propose that lasR is an ecological keystone gene.","[{""name"":""Cystic Fibrosis Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03xeae684"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Venture and Innovation Award;""},{""name"":""BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

In the colon, this barrier is repeatedly challenged by mechanical distension from faeces and it is unknown whether and how the colon adapts to such stress, which could otherwise compromise barrier integrity. Here, we show that faeces-mediated mechanical distension triggers coordinated remodelling at cell- and tissue-scale, suggestive of mechanoadaptation. This response includes recruitment of junctional proteins at all three types of adhesive cell-cell junctions (tight junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes). We identified two modes of recruitment: stable responders (ZO-1, E-cad, plakoglobin) with sustained junctional enrichment, and adaptive responders (desmoplakin, keratin 8) with progressive accumulation during distension. Distension was also accompanied by perijunctional recruitment and activation of non-muscle myosin II (NMMII). Through genetic, pharmacological, and mechanical perturbations, we demonstrated that NMMII activation is an early and critical step for mechanoadaptation. This process requires extracellular calcium influx, and Piezo1 activation is sufficient to trigger NMMII activation and junctional recruitment. Loss of NMMII function abrogated the junctional response to distension across all three junctional complexes, including desmosomes, resulting in disorganised junctions and barrier breach. Together, our findings uncover a robust physiological mechano-adaptive response of the adult colonic epithelium to an extrinsic mechanical stress, whereby coordinated reinforcement of all junctional complexes, controlled by myosin II and mechanosensitive calcium influx, plays an essential role in preserving intestinal barrier integrity.","[{""name"":""Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ATIP-Avenir;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

A central unresolved question, however, is whether lipidomic signatures identified in accessible peripheral biofluids faithfully recapitulate the pathogenic alterations within the central nervous system (CNS). This gap impedes the development of reliable biomarkers and constrains a comprehensive understanding of PD pathophysiology. To address this challenge, we employed a cross-species lipidomic approach. We modeled PD in both male and female mice by injecting human -synuclein preformed fibrils into the substantia nigra. Three months post-injection, lipidomic profiles of the midbrain and plasma were generated and compared. These findings were further validated in plasma from male and female PD patients and age-matched controls, enabling the identification of conserved alterations.

We identified shared dysregulation of sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, and fatty acids in the brains and plasma of diseased mice as well as in plasma from PD patients. Notably, lipids associated with lipid droplet biogenesis, including triacylglycerols and monoacylglycerols, were elevated in diseased mouse brains and patient plasma. These alterations coincided with a marked accumulation of lipid droplets in the mouse midbrain, and were further corroborated by increased lipid droplet abundance in macrophages derived from PD patients. Interestingly, lipid droplet accumulation exhibited sex-specific patterns: male mice displayed greater microglial accumulation, whereas female mice showed enhanced neuronal deposition. Together, these findings demonstrate that peripheral lipidomic signatures reflect CNS pathology in PD, highlighting new opportunities for biomarker discovery and therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, sex-specific lipid droplet accumulation in innate immune cells and neurons implicates these pathways as mechanistic contributors to PD and underscores the necessity of sex-stratified strategies in biomarker discovery and disease modeling.","[{""name"":""Cure Parkinson's Trust"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PT01;""},{""name"":""Parkinson's Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mx85j86"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PF-IMP-1437213;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04reqzt68"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IA/E/17/1/503664;""},{""name"":""Science and Engineering Research Board"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03ffdsr55"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SRG/2021/000981;""},{""name"":""Indian Council of Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0492wrx28"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5/4-5/3/43/Neuro/2022-NCD-1;5/4-5Adhoc/Neuro/217/2020-NCD-1;""},{""name"":""SwarnaJayanti Fellowship, SERB"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SB/SJF/2021-22/01;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting  spacetime attractor excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning.

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors1-5, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

We developed OmniPath (https://omnipathdb.org/), a database combining diverse molecular knowledge from 168 resources. It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

These events occur when cohesin loads near the midpoint between two loci and extrudes them through a defined spatial radius, producing encounter durations that exceed those of random collisions. We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors.

We demonstrate the power and versatility of this method by designing binders for four critical phosphotyrosine sites on three clinically relevant targets: Cluster of Differentiation 3 (CD3{varepsilon}), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Insulin Receptor (INSR). Experimental characterization shows that the designs bind their phospho-tyrosine containing targets with affinities comparable to native binding sites and have negligible binding to non-phosphorylated targets or phosphopeptides with different sequences. X-ray crystal structures of generated binders to CD3{varepsilon} and EGFR are very close to the design models, demonstrating the accuracy of the design approach.

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

We experimentally screened the two libraries against 145 of these targets, resulting in a dataset of over 100 million binding interactions.

However, while considerable advances have been made in the de novo design of protein structure and function, the same has not yet been achieved for RNA tertiary structures of similar intricacy. Here, we describe a generative diffusion framework, RFDpoly, for generalized de novo biopolymer (RNA, DNA and protein) design, and use it to create diverse and designable RNA structures. We design RNA structures with novel folds and experimentally validate them using a combination of chemical footprinting (SHAPE-seq) and electron microscopy. We further use this approach to design protein-nucleic acid assemblies; the crystal structure of one such design is nearly identical to the design model. This work demonstrates that the principles of structure-based de novo protein design can be extended to nucleic acids, opening the door to creating a wide range of new RNA structures and protein-nucleic acid complexes.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Some of these targets have been successfully resolved by binding to antibody fragments (Fabs) or fusing with external scaffolds to increase their size. Recent advances in conventional single-particle techniques have enabled the determination of an in-creasing number of structures smaller than 100 kDa, achieving resolutions relevant to drug research. Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions. We envision that this method will further lower the molecular weight limit of single-particle cryo-EM, enabling its application to important drug-binding complexes that are below 50 kDa.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Here, we identify mechanically activated ion channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 as key mechanotransducers required for labor progression. Genetic deletion of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in mice resulted in weakened uterine contractions and severe parturition defects. Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either the uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects, whereas combined loss significantly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing showed that loss of PIEZO reduced expression of connexin43 (Gja1), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction. These findings highlight the critical role of PIEZO channels in mechanotransduction during parturition and suggest therapeutic targets for labor dysfunction.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 NS105067;R01AT012051;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-2405-20;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CMMI-2135428;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2DK128800;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064

Whether chromatin assembly on newly replicated strands is also asymmetric remains unknown, as visualizing this short-lived state in cells is impossible. To circumvent this limitation, we combine in vitro reconstitution of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA and chromatin replication machineries with replication-aware single-molecule chromatin footprinting, to study how chromatin is re-assembled on replicated DNA. Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid. These pathways have implications for essential chromatin-templated processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and gene silencing at replication forks.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""851564;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.233.038;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2-HG012442;""},{""name"":""W.

While we have some understanding of how sensory information is processed in the sensory periphery, the classification of cues according to valence in central brain circuits is less well understood. Here, we addressed this question in the Drosophila larva, where we could leverage the synaptic resolution connectome to determine where innate and learnt information from distinct aversive and appetitive sensory modalities converges; and combine this with imaging and manipulation of neural activity to determine how valence information is encoded and used to guide navigation. We found that information from multiple innately aversive and attractive sensory modalities converges onto a common output neuron of the learning circuit, specifically the Mushroom Body output neuron, MBON-m1. We discovered that this neuron is required for navigating both attractive odor and aversive temperature cues and is activated by attractive cues, such as food odour and sugar, and inhibited by different aversive cues, such as cooling, salt, or non-food odors. Together, our study reveals a neuron that bi-directionally encodes valence and controls actions.","[{""name"":""MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology Core funding"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Janelia Research Campus"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013sk6x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""205038/Z/16/Z;205050/Z/16/Z;""},{""name"":""ERC grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC-2018-COG: 819650;""},{""name"":""DFG German Research Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EXC 2117-587 422037984;""},{""name"":""Fyssen Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""ATIP-Avenir Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760393403064
