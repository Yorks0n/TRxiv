A standard approach for evaluating their similarity to brain function uses DNN activations to predict human neural responses to the same images, yet which visual properties drive this alignment remains unclear. Here, we show that texture-like representations, operationalized as global summaries of local image statistics, largely underlie this alignment. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from 57 participants viewing three image types: natural scenes, texture-synthesized versions that preserve global summaries of local statistics while disrupting global form, and isolated objects without backgrounds. Representational-similarity analysis showed the strongest DNN-EEG alignment when both systems processed texture-synthesized images. When using features from one image condition to predict EEG responses to another, we showed that features from texture-synthesized images generalized to natural scenes. Crucially, we observed a dissociation between DNN-EEG alignment and decodable object category information: alignment increased for texture-synthesized images even when object information was reduced. Together, our findings identify global summaries of local image statistics as a common currency linking DNNs and human visual processing, clarifying that global form features are not required for high DNN-EEG alignment. Our findings highlight the shared importance of local image statistics in artificial and biological visual systems.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757369312070

Remote sensing technologies such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) now enable the 3D mapping of entire landscapes. However, we lack the large, harmonized and geographically representative ALS collections needed to build a global picture of woody ecosystem structure. To address this challenge, we developed the Global Canopy Atlas (GCA): 3,458 ALS acquisitions transformed into standardized and analysis-ready maps of canopy height and elevation at 1 m2 resolution. The GCA covers 56,554 km2 across all major biomes. 19% of this area has been scanned multiple times, and 87% of all GCA products are openly available, covering 95% of the total area. To showcase its wide range of applications, we applied the GCA in three case studies. First, we validated three global satellite-derived canopy height maps, finding poor performance at native resolution (1-30 m, R2 < 0.38) and moderate performance at 250 m resolution (R2 < 0.65). Second, analyzing global patterns in canopy gap size frequency we discovered an unexpectedly large variation of power law exponents from branch to stand level ( = 1.52 to 2.38), pointing to a fundamental scale-dependence of forest structure. Third, we developed a framework to standardize forest turnover quantification from multi-source, multi-temporal ALS. In a temperate forest in North America it revealed that 21% of canopy gaps closed within 12 years of opening and would thus be missed by infrequent monitoring. As demonstrated by these case studies, the GCA provides a novel data source for ecologists, foresters, remote sensing scientists and the ecosystem modelling community that substantially advances our ability to understand the structure and dynamics of woody ecosystems at global scales.","[{""name"":""Leverhulme

Although all-atom structure prediction models like AlphaFold3 (AF3), Boltz-1, Chai-1, DiffDock, and RosettaFold-All Atom (RFAA) were validated on protein-small molecule complexes, no benchmark or evaluation exists specifically for noncovalent protein-carbohydrate docking. To address this, we developed a high-quality dataset of experimental structures - Benchmark of CArbohydrate Protein Interactions (BCAPIN). Using BCAPIN and a novel evaluation metric, DockQC, we assessed the performance of all-atom structure prediction models on non-covalent protein-carbohydrate docking. We found all methods achieved comparable results, with an 85% success rate for structures of at least acceptable quality. However, we found that the predictive power of all models declined with increasing carbohydrate polymer length. With the capabilities and limitations assessed, we evaluated AF3's ability to predict binding for a set of putative human carbohydrate binding and carbohydrate non-binding proteins. While current models show promise, further development is needed to enable high-confidence, high-throughput prediction of the complete protein-sugar interactome.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35-GM141881;R01-AI162381;T32-GM008403;""},{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2108660;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757369312070

The Proximity Prediction Hypothesis (PPH) is the first comprehensive predictive coding model explaining ASMR's underlying neural mechanism. PPH posits that near-field acoustic cues from common ASMR triggers (e.g., brushing sounds, whispered speech) engage the audio-tactile Peripersonal Space Network, generating a top-down prediction of gentle C-tactile (CT) touch on CT fibre-rich skin of the scalp and neck. This prediction suppresses locus coeruleus (LC) arousal and increases vagal output, offering a mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon's therapeutic benefits. In a subjective-experience survey (N = 64), ASMR-labelled trials were rated significantly more pleasant but only slightly more arousing than controls. Pleasantness predicted both the presence and intensity of tingles, supporting PPH's core claim that hedonic value, rather than sympathetic activation, drives the graded somatosensory response. PPH situates ASMR within the Neurovisceral Integration framework, predicting measurable Central Nervous System-Autonomic Nervous System (CNS-ANS) markers (beta-band desynchronisation in the posterior insula and proportional increases in high-frequency heart rate variability with tingle intensity). It further predicts reduced LC activity during ASMR, stronger effects in individuals with high interoceptive prediction error (e.g., anxiety, autism), and attenuation of tingles when spatial proximity cues are removed. By integrating auditory proximity, CT-touch anticipation, and autonomic regulation into a single predictive-coding account, PPH provides a unified, testable framework for explaining ASMR, offering a blueprint for translating this sensory phenomenon into targeted, evidence-based interventions for anxiety and sleep disorders.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757369312070

We used high-spatial-resolution fMRI to investigate human whole brain and cortical layer activity in primary visual cortex (V1) linked with afterimages and perceptually matching animated images: stimuli designed to imitate the appearance of afterimages. Both afterimages and perceptually matched images engaged overlapping, widespread brain activity, particularly in visual sensory regions that follow the contralateral circuitry of the primary visual pathway. However, afterimages elicited weaker fMRI signals across many subcortical and cortical areas compared to images, except in salience network regions, where activity was enhanced for afterimages. Cortical layer-specific analyses in V1 revealed afterimages selectively engaged deep cortical layers, while images activated middle and superficial layers. In addition, we found that baseline eye measures and fMRI signals in arousal and visual networks differed depending on whether afterimages were perceived or not perceived. We argue that these results challenge the prevailing framing on the neurophysiological origins of afterimages as arising from either retinal or central neural processes. As with image perception, typical afterimages emerge by the interaction between retinal activity and central neural processing.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ZIAMH002783;ZICMH002884;ZICMH002888;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757369312070

We develop a linear model to predict chromatin dynamics based on the binding of >200 transcription factors. This identifies nine key regulators acting additively to determine the peak phase and amplitude of each regulatory element. Strikingly, these factors can also generate constitutive, non-rhythmic activity through destructive interference. Validating its power, the model accurately predicts the impact of GRH-1/Grainyhead perturbation on both chromatin and transcript dynamics.

By examining pancreatic islets from AD model mice, we have found deficits in initial phase of glucose-induced calcium signaling and insulin secretion. Furthermore, these transgenic mice showed a tendency towards reduced expression of mature beta cell markers, which was even more pronounced in islets and beta cell lines with a transient knock down of presenilin 1.

As such, taxonomic identification often becomes a bottleneck in tropical forest inventories. Here we present a drone-based workflow to automatically acquire large volumes of close-up, ultra-high resolution photos of selected tree crowns (or specific locations over the canopy) to support tropical botanical and ecological studies (https://youtu.be/80goMEifpc4). Our workflow is built around the small, easy-to-use DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise (M3E) drone, which is equipped with a wide-angle and a telephoto camera. On day one, the pilot maps a forest area of up to ~200 ha with the wide-angle camera to generate a high-resolution digital surface model (DSM) and orthomosaic using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. On subsequent days, the pilot acquires close-up photos with the telephoto camera from up to 300 selected canopy trees per day. These close-up photos are acquired from 6 m above the canopy and contain a high level of visual detail that allows botanists to reliably identify many tree and liana species. The photos are geolocated with survey-grade accuracy using RTK GNSS, thus facilitating spatial co-registration with other data sources, including the photogrammetry products. The primary operational challenge of our workflow is the need to maintain RTK corrections with the drone to ensure that close-up photos are acquired exactly at the predefined locations. The maximum operational range we achieved was 3 km, which would allow the pilot to reach any tree within a ~2800 ha area from the take-off point. Although our workflow was developed to support taxonomic identification of tropical trees and lianas, it could be extended to any other forest or vegetation type to support botanical, phenological, and ecological studies. We provide harpia, an open-source Python library to program these automatic close-up photo missions with the M3E drone (https://github.com/traitlab/harpia).","[{""name"":""IVADO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PRF3: AI, Biodiversity, and Climate Change;""},{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN-2019-04537;""},{""name"":""Population Biology Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Ceiba Fund;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757369312070

Euchromatin and heterochromatin associated histone modifications separate the genome into opposing nuclear compartments. Whereas heterochromatin marks are known to spread from one modified nucleosome to another, no such ability has been ascribed to euchromatin. Using mono-allelic enhancer deletions, native ChIP-seq, and an engineered interaction between an enhancer and transcriptionally inert DNA, we show that enhancers mediate the acquisition of euchromatin features at distal regions through chromatin looping. We term this phenomenon euchromatin hopping and found it occurring on average ~270kb bidirectionally from enhancers, redefining our understanding of enhancer-mediated chromatin architecture with implications on enhancer identification using chromatin features.","[{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2020-05972 (JAM);""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757369312070

Tractor GWAS addresses this issue by incorporating local ancestry into its analysis, empowering identification of ancestry-enriched hits and generating ancestry-specific summary statistics. However, Tractor requires accurate genomic phasing and local ancestry inference as prerequisite steps, which requires additional bioinformatics expertise and decision points regarding reference panel setup. To streamline, harmonize, and automate this process, we present a scalable Nextflow workflow that integrates all necessary steps, minimizing the need for manual intervention while remaining modular and customizable. The workflow supports multiple commonly used tools and offers flexibility in how Tractor is implemented. To demonstrate its utility, we applied this pipeline to analyze 32 blood biomarkers in 6,245 two-way AFR-EUR admixed individuals from the UK Biobank. This pipeline ran efficiently at scale, replicated known associations, and identified novel ancestry-specific loci. These novel associations were largely driven by variants present on African ancestral tracts but absent from European tracts, underscoring the value of local ancestry-aware methods in uncovering previously missed genetic signals. By enabling the efficient analysis of admixed individuals, our workflow facilitates Tractor use, paving the way for more broader genetic discovery.","[{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG012869;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01MH106595;R01MH134468;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757369312070

Extant crocodilians possess platyrostral (broad and flat) snouts, thought to be sub-optimal for resisting feeding loads due to the conflicting demands of feeding and hydrodynamic constraints. In contrast, numerous Mesozoic crocodyliformes possessed oreinirostral (dome-shaped) skulls, were terrestrial and hence free from hydrodynamic constraint. This study aims to examine the role of function in determining skull shape in crocodyliformes, and assesses the difference in stress resistance between oreinirostral and platyrostral taxa. We hypothesise that in the absence of hydrodynamic constraints, oreinirostral taxa have skulls that are better suited for resisting feeding induced loads. Using finite element analysis (FEA), we evaluated biomechanical performance in oreinirostral notosuchian taxa Baurusuchus salgadoensis, Montealtosuchus arrudacamposi and Caipirasuchus paulistanus; compared to the extant platyrostral Alligator mississippiensis, Crocodylus niloticus, and Paleosuchus palpebrosus. Results show that oreinirostral morphologies are comparatively better suited for resisting forces generated during feeding, with increased muscular efficiency, supporting the hypothesis that hydrodynamic constraints influence crocodyliform skull evolution.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757369312070

Here, we optimized CBV VASO on the NexGen 7T scanner for layer-specific investigations of the hippocampus. The presence of venous biases in VASO and BOLD (from the same acquisition) was then compared by using an established autobiographical memory task. While VASO and BOLD based activation patterns converged at macroscale, layer-specific differences emerged in the hippocampal subiculum, consistent with venous bias in the inner layers of the subiculum which can be explained by the unique two-sided venous drainage. Further, both VASO and BOLD showed sensitivity to short blocks (elaboration > construction), revealing an anterior-posterior distinction consistent with stronger involvement of the posterior hippocampus. Hippocampal cortical connectivity revealed brain circuitry between subcortical and cortical regions. Thus, hippocampal fMRI allows mapping layer function with high accuracy, made possible by sequence timing optimization on the high performance NexGen 7T scanner. The improved MR imaging has been developed to enable precision mapping of subcortical brain gray matter.

Here, we combine single-cell RNA sequencing and novel computational approaches to identify oscillatory gene expression in individual cell types. We find that many cell types exhibit looping structures in PCA and UMAP space that correspond to transcriptional oscillations at each larval stage. Oscillatory gene expression is found in all cuticle-producing cell types, including glia, but not detected in neurons or muscle. We develop rigorous statistical approaches for de novo identification of oscillatory genes and cell types, yielding >5,000 genes. While many oscillatory genes relate to cuticle production, each cell type expresses largely distinct genes, suggesting that cuticle production is a patchwork of cell-type-specific programs. Finally, we derive a potential set of regulatory transcription factors that can explain coordinated oscillatory gene expression and find that shared upstream factors likely control gene timing across cell types. Together, our results suggest that shared regulators control cell-type-specific oscillatory gene expression, including in previously overlooked cell types such as glia.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01NS100547;R01NS112343;R01NS124879;""},{""name"":""Surdna Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0225ptr32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Yale University"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03v76x132"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Boston Children's Hospital"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dvg7y05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757369312070

To address these questions, we performed molecular phylogenetic analysis of Lhcx/Lhcsr subfamilies and produced the Lhcx1 knockout mutants of the diatom Chaetoceros gracilis, which has low Lhcx redundancy. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that diatom Lhcxs and the green algal Lhcsrs evolved from a common ancestor, with green plants acquiring them through horizontal gene transfer. The Lhcx1 mutants of C. gracilis mostly abolished non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), and the time-resolved fluorescence measurements clarified that Lhcx1-mediated quenching occurs in the energetically detached antenna complexes. Consistently, clear-native PAGE using Amphipol suggested that CgLhcx1 would interact with FCP L-dimer, functioning as a peripheral antenna for C2S2M2 PSII-FCPII. Notably, the lhcx1 mutant exhibited a higher PSII effective quantum yield than wild-type (WT) under high-light acclimation, attributed to reduced antenna size and enhanced carbon fixation capacity. The lack of NPQ accelerated high-light acclimation, with increased xanthophylls in lhcx1, indicating that compensatory mechanisms can lead to enhanced photosynthetic efficiency.

The fact that the proteins constitute a small portion of mRNAs and the ability of RNA to form highly specific three-dimensional binding pockets for small molecules have generated considerable interest in developing therapeutic agents that target RNAs as an alternative target for small-molecule drugs. Thus, like proteins, precise prediction of small-molecule binding sites across different classes of RNA targets could act as an starting point for drug discovery. In this study, we present a lightweight deep learning framework called Compound Binding Site Prediction for Ribonucleic Acid (CoBRA). This framework can predict ligand-binding nucleotides without requiring any explicit structural information. Our approach uses residue-level embeddings obtained from a pre-trained RNA language model. These embeddings encapsulate the contextual and statistical properties of each nucleotide and are used in a frozen state as the input for a multi-layer perceptron classifier performing binary classification of binding versus non-binding residues. The model was trained using combinations of ten distinct RNA language models and six different loss functions, using the TR60 and HARIBOSS datasets, and tested on four independent benchmark sets (RB9, JL10, TL12, and TE18). The performance of CoBRA demonstrates a relative improvement of 22.1% in Matthew correlation coefficient and an increase in sensitivity of 45.6% compared to existing state-of-the-art RNA-ligand binding site prediction methods with structural information. These results show that sequence-based language model embeddings alone, which do not require any explicit coordinate or distance information, can match or outperform structure-based methods. This makes it a flexible tool for predicting binding sites across diverse RNA targets. CoBRA is available at https://github.com/WonkyeongJang/CoBRA","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757369312070

We identify three parallel pathways, one analyzing whole-field luminance levels, one comparing spatial light levels across eyes, and one computing eye-specific temporal derivatives. Larvae mostly use the latter two spatio-temporal computations for navigation, while juveniles largely employ the first one. We build a library of agent-based models to predict animal behavior across stimulation conditions and in more complex environments. Model-based extraction of latent cognitive variables points towards potential neural correlates of the observed behavioral inversion and illustrates a novel way to explore the mechanisms of vertebrate ontogeny.

By contrast, epithelial cells can utilize an imbalance in contractile force to communicate various information to induce tissue-wide response as in wound healing. Contractility is generated and processed at the apical junctional complex (AJC) by the dynamic behavior of the actin cytoskeleton. Calcium signaling can pattern cellular responses based on its reach and amplitude and the actin cytoskeleton is supported by its wide ranging effects on actin regulators. Calcium transients regulate various cell behaviors associated with actin remodeling, such as in damage response and developmental morphogenesis. Here we report that calcium maintains an adaptive pool of AJC-associated actin that is sensitive to tension and encoded by calcium dynamics. For this, the recently identified epithelial polarity module Homer-MUPP1/PatJ is required. Homer regulates calcium signaling in various tissue contexts through interaction with numerous components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) calcium signal toolkit. Knockout of either Homer or MUPP1/PatJ attenuated tension-induced calcium response and severely disrupted wound healing migration, which is dependent on guidance input through AJC tension. We also show that Homer is integral to early embryonic neurodevelopment as its suppression causes failure of neural tube closure. Our findings highlight the critical role of localized calcium dynamics on AJC actin remodeling and cellular behavior, elucidating the means of tissue coordination through intercellular tension.","[{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JP25H01325;JP25H00994;JP23KJ1689;JP22K06225;""},{""name"":""Japan Science and Technology Agency"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00097mb19"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JPMJFR204L;""},{""name"":""Takeda Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02y123g31"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Toyota Physical and Chemical Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03q75vf28"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757369312070

Based on the number of formants, two different coda quality categories have been described: a-codas and i-codas. In the present paper, we demonstrate that sperm whale codas not only resemble human vowels acoustically, but also pattern like them across several dimensions. First, traditional count- and timing-based coda types interact with coda ""vowel"" quality (a vs. i). Second, a-codas are generally longer than i-codas. Third, the duration of i-codas has a bimodal distribution, showing a contrast between short i-codas and long[i] -codas. Fourth, the baseline coda length differs across whales. And fifth, edge clicks mismatching their coda often match an adjacent coda, a phenomenon that resembles human coarticulation. All five properties have close parallels in the phonetics and phonology of human languages. Sperm whale coda vocalizations thus represent one of the closest parallels to human phonology of any known animal communication system.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSperm whales communicate using series of clicks known as codas. The codas acoustically resemble human vowels. In addition, they pattern in ways similar to human sound systems. For example, different coda types are correlated with particular click qualities, and their durations are intentionally controlled. This shows that sperm whale vocalizations are highly complex and likely constitute one of the most sophisticated communication systems in the animal kingdom. By studying it, we may be able to gain a broader understanding of animal intelligence and social behaviors, determine the impact of human activities on whale habitat, develop strategies to protect whales from threats such as noise pollution and ship traffic, and advance legislation which facilitates that protection.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757369312070
