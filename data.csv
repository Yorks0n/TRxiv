There is limited understanding of factors that influence their biodistribution and immunogenicity. Antibodies to polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is on the surface of the lipid nanoparticle, are detectable in humans and boosted by human mRNA vaccination. We hypothesized that PEG-specific antibodies could increase the clearance of mRNA vaccines. We developed methods to quantify both the mRNA and ionizable lipid in frequent serial blood samples from 19 subjects receiving Moderna SPIKEVAX mRNA booster immunization. Both the mRNA and ionizable lipid peaked in blood 1-2 days post vaccination (median peak level 0.19 and 3.22 ng mL-1, respectively). The mRNA was detectable out to 14-28 days post-vaccination in most subjects. We measured the proportion of mRNA that was relatively intact in blood over time and found the decay kinetics of the intact mRNA and ionizable lipid were identical, suggesting the intact lipid nanoparticle recirculates in blood. However, mRNA and ionizable lipid decay rates did not correlate with baseline levels of PEG-specific nor spike-specific antibodies. The magnitude of mRNA and ionizable lipid detected in blood did correlate with the boost in PEG antibodies. Further, the ability of subjects monocytes to phagocytose lipid nanoparticles had an inverse relationship with the rise in PEG antibodies. This suggests circulation of mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines into the blood and their ability to be cleared by phagocytes influence PEG immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines. Overall, this work defines the pharmacokinetics of lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccine components in human blood after intramuscular injection and the factors that influence this. These insights should prove useful in improving the future safety and efficacy of lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.","NA","medrxiv",1722377031879

Prior work established that heteroplasmic mtDNA variants can be used to delineate clonality in hematopoiesis, but they have limited ability to reconstruct cellular phylogenies. However, a recent report by Weng et al. challenges the current paradigm by describing an unprecedented number of shared mtDNA variants between cells that reportedly resolve high-resolution phylogenetic trees. We re-examined the claims of Weng et al., and identified two major points of concern regarding this unprecedented connectedness. First, shared variants between cells are disproportionately detected in a single molecule per cell, and second, these variants are enriched 10-20-fold at the edges of mtDNA molecules, reminiscent of artifacts reported in other sequencing approaches. Further, our analyses show that pruning low support and likely artificial mtDNA variants removes nearly all of the reported phylogenetic structure. Thus, we strongly caution against using mtDNA variant calling workflows that rely on minimal evidence, including the computational pipeline introduced in Weng et al., as variants with high connectedness and low evidence are likely artifacts that lead to the construction of false phylogenies.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031879

These immune receptors detect pathogen infection by sensing virulence effector proteins. However, the mechanisms by which receptors evolve new recognition specificities remain poorly understood. Here we report that a plant NLR has evolved the capacity to bind to a pathogen effector by acting as a molecular mimic of a virulence target of the effector, thereby triggering an immune response. The barley NLR Mildew Locus A 3 (MLA3) confers resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae by recognizing the effector Pwl2. Using structural analysis, we show that MLA3 has acquired the capacity to bind and respond to Pwl2 through molecular mimicry of the effector host target HIPP43. We demonstrate that the amino acids at the binding interface of MLA3 and Pwl2 are highly conserved in interface of HIPP43 with Pwl2, and are required to trigger an immune response. We used this discovery to bioengineer SR50--an MLA ortholog in rye that confers resistance to wheat stem rust--by introducing the Pwl2 binding interface of MLA3. This chimeric receptor has dual recognition activities, binding and responding to effectors from two major cereal pathogens. Collectively, these results provide evidence that plant immune receptors have evolved sophisticated mimicry strategies to counteract pathogen attack.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031879

In both sepals and leaves, giant cells are scattered among smaller cells; therefore, we asked whether the spatial arrangement of giant cells is random. By comparing sepal and leaf epidermises with computationally generated randomized tissues we show that giant cells are clustered more than is expected by chance. Our cell-autonomous and stochastic computational model recapitulates the observed giant cell clustering, indicating that clustering emerges as a result of the cell division pattern. Overall, cell size patterning is developmentally regulated by common mechanisms in leaves and sepals rather than a simple byproduct of cell growth.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

In response to infection, TIRs can produce a cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose (ADPR) signaling molecule, which activates an effector that depletes the host of the essential metabolite NAD+ to limit phage propagation. How bacterial TIRs recognize phage infection is not known. Here we describe the sensing mechanism for the staphylococcal Thoeris defense system, which consists of two TIR domain sensors, ThsB1 and ThsB2, and the effector ThsA. We show that the major capsid protein of phage {Phi}80 forms a complex with ThsB1 and ThsB2, which is sufficient for the synthesis of 1-3 glycocyclic ADPR (gcADPR) and subsequent activation of NAD+ cleavage by ThsA. Consistent with this, phages that escape Thoeris immunity harbor mutations in the capsid that prevent complex formation. We show that capsid proteins from staphylococcal Siphoviridae belonging to the capsid serogroup B, but not A, are recognized by ThsB1/B2, a result that suggests that capsid recognition by Sau-Thoeris and other anti-phage defense systems may be an important evolutionary force behind the structural diversity of prokaryotic viruses. More broadly, since mammalian toll-like receptors harboring TIR domains can also recognize viral structural components to produce an inflammatory response against infection, our findings reveal a conserved mechanism for the activation of innate antiviral defense pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

Here, we collected radiotherapy phenotype and expression data from 32 TCGA cancer datasets and performed overall survival analysis for 32 cancer types. Additionally, we conducted a signalling pathway enrichment analysis to identify key pathways involved in radiotherapy resistance and sensitivity. Our findings show that radiotherapy improves survival outcomes in certain cancer types, such as GBM, while worsening outcomes in others, such as LGG. Next, we focused on exploring the differences in radiotherapy outcomes between GBM and LGG, focusing on the molecular mechanisms contributing to these variations. The differential regulation of pathways related to programmed cell death, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, chromosome condensation, antiviral responses, and interferon signaling between GBM and LGG patients may elucidate the underlying reasons for these observed differences. These insights underscore the importance of personalized treatment approaches and the need for further research to improve radiotherapy outcomes in cancer patients.","NA","medrxiv",1722377031880

We thus lack a mechanistic framework that links functional adaptability with environmental pressures. Here, we leverage the diversity of natural tubulin variants from three closely related frog species that live at different temperatures: we combine in vitro reconstitution assays, quantitative biochemistry, and cryogenic electron microscopy to show how a small number of primary sequence changes influences the energy landscape of tubulin interactions and thereby mediates cold-adaptation and microtubule stability.

CUT&Tag (Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation, [1]) is a novel enzyme-tethering method for epigenomic profiling, initially developed for mammalian cells. CUT&Tag has several advantages compared to the most commonly used epigenomic profiling methods such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). CUT&Tag allows epigenenomic profiling from a much less amount of starting material compared to ChIP-seq. CUT&Tag is based on the in situ cleavage of DNA by enzymes tethered to antibodies, while in ChIP-seq, the cleavage is done by a nearly random fragmentation step. In theory, this difference in the way of cleaving DNA allows CUT&Tag to reach a higher resolution compared to ChIP-seq. Therefore, CUT&Tag holds the potential to profile the genome-wide distribution at a high resolution even from a small amount of plant tissues. Results: We profiled the genome-wide distribution of three histone modifications, H3K27me3, H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac, from a few seedlings of Arabidopsis that weighed around 0.01 grams. By comparing the H3K27me3 profiles generated from ChIP-seq and CUT&Tag, we showed that CUT&Tag and ChIP-seq capture the same broad lines of the epigenomes, but they also revealed different sets of peaks. Analysis using the CUT&Tag datasets for the three histone modifications revealed their genomic locations and their relationship with the gene expression level, which are consistent with the expected effect of these histone marks on gene transcription. By comparing to the nucleosome occupancy data, we show that CUT&Tag reached nucleosomal resolution, a much higher resolution than ChIP-seq. In the end, we presented that the increased resolution of CUT&Tag could better reveal the exon enrichment of histone modifications and the epigenetic states of the +1 nucleosome, showing benefits and advantages that this technique could bring to the field of plant epigenetics and chromatin study in general. Conclusion: CUT&Tag is a valid, easy-to-perform, cost-effective, and reliable approach for efficient epigenomic profiling in Arabidopsis, even with limited amount of starting material and provides a higher resolution compared to ChIP-seq. Because the CUT&Tag protocol starting input is isolated nuclei, it is also applicable to other model and non-model plants.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

The caudal fin is the primary appendage used for propulsion in most fish species, and exhibits a range of distinct morphologies adapted for different swimming strategies, however the molecular mechanisms responsible for generating these diverse shapes remain mostly unknown. In zebrafish, caudal fins display a forked shape, with longer supportive bony rays at the periphery and shortest rays at the center. Here, we show that a premature, transient pulse of sonic hedgehog a (shha) overexpression during late embryonic development results in excess proliferation and growth of the central rays, causing the adult caudal fin to grow into a triangular, truncate shape. Both global and regional ectopic shha overexpression are sufficient to alter fin shape, and forked shape may be rescued by subsequent treatment with an antagonist of the canonical Shh pathway. The induced truncate fins show a decreased fin ray number and fail to form the hypural diastema that normally separates the dorsal and ventral fin lobes. While forked fins regenerate their original forked morphology, truncate fins regenerate truncate, suggesting that positional memory of the fin rays can be permanently altered by a transient treatment during embryogenesis. Ray finned fish have evolved a wide spectrum of caudal fin morphologies, ranging from truncate to forked, and the current work offers insights into the developmental mechanisms that may underlie this shape diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

In corpus callosum, we observed dynamic chromatin priming of myelin genes across the subregions. Together, it suggests a role for layer specific projection neurons to coordinate axonogenesis and myelination.

In humans, it is essential for coordinating sensorimotor responses, performing associative/executive functions, and representing information in multiple dimensions. Understanding which genetic variants underpin corpus callosum morphometry, and their shared influence on cortical structure and susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders, can provide molecular insights into the CCs role in mediating cortical development and its contribution to neuropsychiatric disease. To characterize the morphometry of the midsagittal corpus callosum, we developed a publicly available artificial intelligence based tool to extract, parcellate, and calculate its total and regional area and thickness. Using the UK Biobank (UKB) and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (ABCD), we extracted measures of midsagittal corpus callosum morphometry and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of European participants (combined N = 46,685). We then examined evidence for generalization to the non-European participants of the UKB and ABCD cohorts (combined N = 7,040). Post-GWAS analyses implicate prenatal intracellular organization and cell growth patterns, and high heritability in regions of open chromatin, suggesting transcriptional activity regulation in early development. Results suggest programmed cell death mediated by the immune system drives the thinning of the posterior body and isthmus. Global and local genetic overlap, along with causal genetic liability, between the corpus callosum, cerebral cortex, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity and bipolar disorders were identified. These results provide insight into variability of corpus callosum development, its genetic influence on the cerebral cortex, and biological mechanisms related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

DNA language models (LMs) implicitly capture functional elements and their organization from genomic sequences alone by modeling probabilities of each nucleotide given its sequence context. However, using DNA LMs for discovering functional genomic elements has been challenging due to the lack of interpretable methods. Here, we introduce nucleotide dependencies which quantify how nucleotide substitutions at one genomic position affect the probabilities of nucleotides at other positions. We generated genome-wide maps of pairwise nucleotide dependencies within kilobase ranges for animal, fungal, and bacterial species. We show that nucleotide dependencies indicate deleteriousness of human genetic variants more effectively than sequence alignment and DNA LM reconstruction. Regulatory elements appear as dense blocks in dependency maps, enabling the systematic identification of transcription factor binding sites as accurately as models trained on experimental binding data. Nucleotide dependencies also highlight bases in contact within RNA structures, including pseudoknots and tertiary structure contacts, with remarkable accuracy. This led to the discovery of four novel, experimentally validated RNA structures in Escherichia coli. Finally, using dependency maps, we reveal critical limitations of several DNA LM architectures and training sequence selection strategies by benchmarking and visual diagnosis. Altogether, nucleotide dependency analysis opens a new avenue for discovering and studying functional elements and their interactions in genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

Two inversions were transferred from deepwater pelagic Diplotaxodon via admixture, while the others established early in the deep benthics. Introgression of haplotypes from lineages inside and outside the Malawi radiation coincided with bursts of species diversification. Inversions show evidence for transient sex linkage and a striking excess of protein changing substitutions pointing towards selection on sensory, behavioural and reproductive genes.

However, the relationships among planthopper lineages and families remain unclear. Previous efforts based on inconsistent morphological traits, a few genes, or limited sampling often resulted in conflicting tree topologies. Here, we used genome-level data to assemble 1164 nuclear single-copy genes and 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes for 149 planthopper species representing 19 out of 21 extant families. Additional markers were added from published mitogenomes, expanding our sampling to 285 species. These markers were used for Maximum Likelihood-based tree inference and dating analyses. The newly inferred phylogenies validated well-accepted relationships and recovered novel placements. Taxonomic conclusions include the establishment of a new family Borysthenidae stat. rev. within Delphacoidea and a new superfamily Meenoploidea superfam. nov. including redefined Kinnaridae stat. rev. and Meenoplidae stat. rev., the confirmation of the monophyletic family Achilixiidae outside the Achilidae-Derbidae clade, and the transfer of tribes Lyncidini and Amyclini to Dictyopharidae and the genus Madagascaritia to Fulgoridae. The time analyses based on 57 nuclear markers and 30 fossils dated the origin of crown Fulgoromorpha back to Guadalupian, Permian ([~]263 Ma), close to the maximum constraint at 267.3 Ma, while applying an older root constraint resulted in an origin in Mississippian, Carboniferous ([~]332 Ma). While future sampling of unstudied fauna in unexplored regions or habitats may change the topology, the current phylogenomic analysis will serve as a solid foundation for research into planthopper ecology, evolution, and significance.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

Utilizing transcriptomic profiling, assessments of chromatin accessibility, mitochondrial phenotyping, and lipidomics analyses, we observed that SC-{beta} cells exhibit reduced oxidative and mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism compared to primary human islets that are related to limitations in key mitochondrial transcriptional networks. Surprisingly, we found that reductions in glucose-stimulated mitochondrial respiration in SC-islets were not associated with alterations in mitochondrial mass, structure, or genome integrity. In contrast, SC-islets show limited expression of targets of PPAR and PPAR{gamma}, which regulate mitochondrial programming, yet whose functions in {beta} cell differentiation are unknown. Importantly, treatment with WY14643, a potent PPAR agonist, induced expression of mitochondrial targets, improved insulin secretion, and increased the formation and maturation of SC-{beta} cells both in vitro and following transplantation.

The most lethal manifestation is invasive aspergillosis for which treatment relies on triazoles. Triazole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus can be recovered from decaying plant material and so-called hotspots containing triazole fungicide residues. Although observations have shown clonal isolates between the environment and clinical samples, a direct link between a specific environment and cases of triazole-resistant invasive aspergillus disease in an individual patient has not yet been demonstrated. Methods: To understand where patients acquire Aspergillus fumigatus isolates causing disease, we used a genomic epidemiology approach with 157 Dutch Aspergillus fumigatus isolates, based on whole genome sequencing. Isolates were from three well-characterized environmental hotspots and two hospitals between 2016 and 2019. Findings: In the Dutch dataset, Aspergillus fumigatus isolates from six patients showed near-identical genomes compared to five environmental isolates. One environmental isolate matched three probable cases of triazole-resistant invasive aspergillosis, including one fatal case. Patient isolates were recovered up to 34 months later than near-identical environmental isolates. Comparison to over 1,2K global publicly available Aspergillus fumigatus genomes showed hundreds of clonal groups spread across three continents. In addition, finding variants associated with resistance to non-triazole fungicides such as benzimidazole, succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor and quinone outside inhibitor classes, strongly suggests an exposure history to multiple agricultural fungicides in these environmental hotspots. Interpretation: Environmental hotspots represent highly selective habitats for multi-fungicide-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus, which we can now directly link to probable cases of aspergillus disease, including a triazole-resistant case. However, geographically widely dispersed clonal expansion limits the utility of genomic epidemiology to identify the source of a particular patients isolate. Furthermore, reducing a single class of fungicides in agriculture may not effectively reduce resistance selection when other classes are still in use.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

Recent studies suggest there is a primate-specific population of striatal inhibitory interneurons, the TAC3 interneurons5. However, there has not yet been a detailed analysis of the spatial and phylogenetic distribution of this population. Here, we profile single cell gene expression in the developing pig (an ungulate) and ferret (a carnivore), representing 94 million years divergence from primates, and assign newborn inhibitory neurons to initial classes first specified during development. We find that the initial class of TAC3 interneurons represents an ancestral striatal population that is also deployed towards the cortex in pig and ferret. In adult mouse, we uncover a rare population expressing Tac2, the ortholog of TAC3, in ventromedial striatum, prompting a reexamination of developing mouse striatal interneuron initial classes by targeted enrichment of their precursors. We conclude that the TAC3 interneuron initial class is conserved across Boreoeutherian mammals, with the mouse population representing Th striatal interneurons, a subset of which expresses Tac2. This study suggests that initial classes of telencephalic inhibitory neurons are largely conserved and that during evolution, neuronal types in the mammalian brain change through redistribution and fate refinement, rather than by derivation of novel precursors early in development.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

Recent evidence suggests that these waves directionality and spatiotemporal extent encode cognitive processes, yet the encoding mechanism related to their frequency remains unclear.

We explore the hypothesis that coherence frequency dictates the velocity of wave propagation. Using nonlinear coherence analysis to compute propagation pathways among four local-field-potential signals collected along the human hippocampuss long axis, we present evidence that the coherence frequency of traveling waves encodes temporal communication aspects. Unlike linear analyses, which may overestimate velocities due to bidirectional flow when considering multiple pair coherences, nonlinear analysis treats pathways as holistic units with affectively unidirectional flow, making it more suitable for calculating wave velocities. Our findings reveal that propagation velocities along the hippocampus at low frequencies (<[~]35Hz) demonstrate a linear dependency on frequency, with an increased slope at higher frequencies, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Although observed within the hippocampus, these findings capture a dependency between frequency and velocity of traveling waves which may be applicable to other cortical areas as well.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

The central biological question about HD pathogenesis has been how the disease-causing DNA repeat expansion (CAGn) in the huntingtin (HTT) gene leads to neurodegeneration after decades of apparent latency. Inherited HTT alleles with a longer CAG repeat hasten disease onset; the length of this repeat also changes over time, generating somatic mosaicism, and genes that regulate DNA-repeat stability can influence HD age-at-onset. To understand the relationship between a cells CAG-repeat length and its biological state, we developed a single-cell method for measuring CAG-repeat length together with genome-wide RNA expression. We found that the HTT CAG repeat expands from 40-45 CAGs to 100-500+ CAGs in HD-vulnerable SPNs but not in other striatal cell types, with these long DNA-repeat expansions acquired at different times by individual SPNs. Surprisingly, somatic expansion from 40 to 150 CAGs had no apparent effect upon gene expression - but neurons with 150-500+ CAGs shared profound gene-expression changes. These expression changes involved hundreds of genes, escalated alongside further CAG-repeat expansion, eroded positive and then negative features of neuronal identity, and culminated in expression of senescence/apoptosis genes. Rates of striatal neuron loss across HD stages reflected the rates at which neurons entered this biologically distorted state. Our results suggest that HTT CAG repeats in striatal neurons undergo decades of biologically quiet expansion, then, as they asynchronously cross a high threshold, cause SPNs to degenerate quickly and asynchronously. We conclude that, at any moment in the course of HD, most neurons have an innocuous (but unstable) huntingtin gene, and that HD pathogenesis is a DNA process for almost all of a neurons life.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

The neck is a hallmark of the tetrapod body plan and allows for complex head movements on land. While head and trunk muscles arise from distinct embryonic mesoderm populations, the origins of neck muscles remained elusive. Here, we combine comparative embryology and anatomy to reconstruct the mesodermal contribution to neck evolution. We demonstrate that head/trunk-connecting muscle groups have conserved mesodermal origins in fishes and tetrapods and that the neck evolved from muscle groups present in fishes. We propose that expansions of mesodermal populations into head and trunk domains during embryonic development underpinned the emergence and adaptation of the tetrapod neck. Our results provide evidence for exaptation of archetypal muscle groups in ancestral fishes, which were co-opted to acquire novel functions adapted to terrestrial lifestyle.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

In this study, we employed a multi-omics approach, including RNA sequencing (GEO identifier GSE273052) and proteomics (ProteomeXchange identifier PXD054147), to investigate the alterations in BAT and its EVs in the SOD1-G93A mouse model of ALS. Our results revealed significant changes in the proteomic and transcriptomic profiles of BAT from SOD1-G93A mice, highlighting ALS-related features such as mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired differentiation capacity. Specifically, primary brown adipocytes (PBAs) from SOD1-G93A mice exhibited differentiation impairment, respiratory defects, and alterations in mitochondrial dynamics. Furthermore, the BAT-derived EVs from SOD1-G93A mice displayed distinct changes in size distribution and cargo content, which negatively impacted the differentiation and homeostasis of C2C12 murine myoblasts, as well as induced atrophy in C2C12-derived myotubes.

While RNAi mediates antiviral innate immunity in plants and many invertebrates, vertebrates adopted sequence-independent response and their Dicer produces siRNAs inefficiently because it is adapted to process small hairpin microRNA precursors in the gene-regulating microRNA pathway. Mammalian RNAi is thus a rudimentary pathway of unclear significance. To investigate its antiviral potential, we modified mouse Dicer locus to express a truncated variant (Dicer{Delta}HEL1) known to stimulate RNAi. Next, we analyzed how Dicer{Delta}HEL1/wt mice respond to four RNA viruses: Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and encephalomyocarditis virus (ECMV) from Picornaviridae; tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) from Flaviviridae; and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) from Arenaviridae. Increased Dicer activity in Dicer{Delta}HEL1/wt mice did not elicit any antiviral effect supporting insignificant antiviral function of endogenous mammalian RNAi in vivo. However, we also report that sufficiently high expression of Dicer{Delta}HEL1 suppressed LCMV in embryonic stem cells and in a transgenic mouse model. Altogether, mice with increased Dicer activity offer a new benchmark for identifying and studying viruses susceptible to mammalian RNAi in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

Mechanistically, we show that delayed regeneration is an intrinsic feature of aged epithelial cells that display reduced protein synthesis and accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins.

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1722377031880

While there have been numerous reports related to PD in East Asia, there has been a lack of contribution from single-cell (or nucleus) transcriptome studies, which have been making significant contributions to understanding PD. In this study, a total of 33,293 nuclei obtained from the substantia nigra (SN) of confirmed pathological PD and control patients in South Korea were profiled, revealing eight different cell types through cluster analysis. Monocle-based pseudotime analysis identified two disease-associated trajectories for each astrocyte and microglia and identified genes that differentiate them. Interestingly, we uncovered the inflammatory intervention in the early PD-associated transition in microglia and identified the molecular features of this intermediate state of microglia. In addition, gene regulatory networks (GRNs) based on TENET analysis revealed the detrimental effect of an HSPA5-led module in microglia and MSRB3- and HDAC8- led modules specifying the two different astrocyte trajectories. In SN neurons, we observed population changes, a decrease in dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurons and a proportional increase in GABAergic neurons. By deconvolution in spatial transcriptome obtained the PD sample, we confirmed spatiotemporal heterogeneity of neuronal subpopulations and PD-associated progressive gliosis specific to dopaminergic nuclei, SN and ventral tegmental areas (VTAs). In conclusion, our approach has enabled us to identify the genetic and spatial characterization of neurons and to demonstrate different glial fates in PD. These findings advance our molecular understanding of cell type-specific changes in the progression of Korean PD, providing an important foundation for predicting and validating interventions or drug effects for future treatments.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

We find that white matter connections are organized by cytoarchitecture, eccentricity, and category from birth. Connectivity profiles of functional regions in the same cytoarchitectonic area are similar from birth and develop in parallel, with decreases in endpoint connectivity to lateral occipital, and parietal, and somatosensory cortex, and increases to lateral prefrontal cortex. Additionally, connections between VTC and early visual cortex are organized topographically by eccentricity bands and predict eccentricity biases in VTC. These data have important implications for theories of cortical functional development and open new possibilities for understanding typical and atypical white matter development.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

Since limitations of both strategies have been highlighted recently, we sought to combine the sequence context provided by deep learning with the information provided by cross-individual training. We utilized fine-tuning to develop Performer, a model with accuracy approaching the cis-heritability of most genes. Performer prioritizes genetic variants across the allele frequency spectrum that disrupt motifs, fall in annotated regulatory elements, and have functional evidence for modulating gene expression. While obstacles remain in personalized expression prediction, our findings establish deep learning as a viable strategy.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

We found that the FDA-approved BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is a potent and rapid inducer of p16High immune subsets both in mice and humans. In turn, p16High immune cells were indispensable for counteracting different lethal conditions, including LPS-induced sepsis, acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and ionizing irradiation.

Furthermore, containing these signals within a beneficial range by deleting MDA5 that appeared sufficient to maintain a low activity of STING, induces p16High immune cells and delays organ deterioration upon aging with improved healthspan.

Here, we demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of spatio-temporal oscillations in the number of droplets, size, and position within a synthetic cell. The coacervate-based droplets in these synthetic cells sediment and fuse at the cells bottom. Through a newly discovered size control mechanism, the sedimented, large droplets shrink by expelling droplet material. The expelled molecules nucleate new droplets at the top of the synthetic cell, which grow and sediment again. These oscillations are sustained by converting chemical fuel into waste and can continue for hundreds of periods without evidence of fatigue. Strikingly, the period of the oscillation is in the minutes regime and tunable. The design of oscillating organelles in synthetic cells brings us closer to creating more life-like materials and de novo life.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

A receptor-kinase signaling pathway for plant stomatal development shares components with the immunity pathway. The mechanism ensuring their signal specificities remains unclear. Using chemical genetics, here we report the identification of a small molecule, kC9, that triggers excessive stomatal differentiation by inhibiting the canonical ERECTA receptor-kinase pathway. kC9 binds to and inhibits the downstream MAP kinase MPK6, perturbing its substrate interaction. Strikingly, activation of immune signaling by a bacterial flagellin peptide nullified kC9's effects on stomatal development. This cross-activation of stomatal development by immune signaling depends on the immune receptor FLS2 and occurs even in the absence of kC9 if the ERECTA-family receptor population becomes suboptimal. Furthermore, proliferating stomatal-lineage cells are vulnerable to the immune signal penetration. Our findings suggest that the signal specificity between development and immunity can be ensured by MAP Kinase homeostasis reflecting the availability of upstream receptors, thereby providing a novel view on signal specificity.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

However, the impact of the mechanical properties of the ECM, specifically collagen fibril alignment and crosslinking, on macrophage behavior and polarization is less understood. To investigate this, we reconstituted 3D collagen matrices to mimic the physical characteristics of the TME. Our results demonstrated that stiffening the matrix through the alignment or crosslinking of collagen fibrils promotes macrophage polarization toward the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. This phenotype is characterized by increased expression of CD105 and CD206 and a distinct cytokine secretion profile. The increased stiffness and aligned fibrils activate mechanotransduction pathways, notably integrin beta1 and PI3K signaling, leading to increased IL-4 secretion, which acts in an autocrine manner to further promote M2 polarization. Interestingly, these stiffened microenvironments also suppressed the proinflammatory response. In coculture experiments with breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7), macrophages within stiffened or aligned matrices significantly increased cancer cell proliferation and invasion. These findings suggest that the mechanical properties of the ECM, specifically its alignment and crosslinking, create a more favorable environment for tumor progression by modulating macrophage activity. Overall, our study underscores the critical role of ECM mechanics in shaping immune cell behavior within the TME, highlighting the potential for therapies that target ECM properties and macrophage polarization to inhibit cancer progression and enhance treatment efficacy.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

During fast growth, replication and segregation co-occur. Overlapping cycles of DNA replication and segregation require efficient segregation of the origin of replication (Ori), which is known to be orchestrated by the protein families SMC and ParAB. We used data-driven physical modeling to study the roles of these proteins in Ori segregation. Developing a polymer model of the Bacillus subtilis genome based on Hi-C data, we analyzed chromosome structures in wild-type cells and mutants lacking SMC or ParAB. Wild-type chromosomes showed clear Ori segregation, while the mutants lacked faithful segregation. The model suggests that the dual role of ParB proteins, loading SMCs near the Ori and interacting with ParA, is crucial for Ori segregation. ParB-loaded SMCs compact individual Ori and introduce an effective inter-sister repulsion that regulates the ParAB-activity to avoid the detrimental scenario of pulling both Ori to the same pole. The model makes testable predictions for sister-chromosome-resolved Hi-C experiments and proposes that replicated sister chromosomes segregate via a mechanistic interplay of SMC and ParAB activity.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

Recent technological advances in DNA sequencing-based assays have revealed locus- and chromatin state-specific structural patterns at the length scale of a few nucleosomes (~1 kb). However, interpreting these data sets remains challenging. Radiation-induced correlated cleavage of chromatin (RICC-seq) is one such chromatin structure assay that maps DNA-DNA-contacts at base pair resolution by sequencing single-stranded DNA fragments released from irradiated cells. Here, we develop a flexible modeling and simulation framework to enable the interpretation of RICC-seq data in terms of oligonucleosome structure ensembles. Nucleosomes are modeled as rigid bodies with excluded volume and adjustable DNA wrapping, connected by linker DNA modeled as a worm-like chain. We validate the model's parameters against cryo-electron microscopy and sedimentation data. Our results show that RICC-seq is sensitive to nucleosome spacing, nucleosomal DNA wrapping, and the strength of inter-nucleosome interactions. We show that nucleosome repeat lengths consistent with orthogonal assays can be extracted from experimental RICC-seq data using a 1D convolutional neural net trained on RICC-seq signal predicted from simulated ensembles. We thus provide a suite of analysis tools that add quantitative structural interpretability to RICC-seq experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

Various studies have characterized the response of textile structures to mechanical loading; yet, our understanding of their exceptional properties and functions remains incomplete. Here we integrate biaxial testing and constitutive neural networks to automatically discover the best model and parameters to characterize warp knitted polypropylene fabrics. We use experiments from different mounting orientations, and discover interpretable anisotropic models that perform well during both training and testing. Our study shows that constitutive models for warp knitted fabrics are highly sensitive to an accurate representation of the textile microstructure, and that models with three microstructural directions outperform classical orthotropic models with only two in-plane directions. Strikingly, out of 2^14 = 16,384 possible combinations of terms, we consistently discover models with two exponential linear fourth invariant terms that inherently capture the initial flexibility of the virgin mesh and the pronounced nonlinear stiffening as the loops of the mesh tighten. We anticipate that the tools we have developed and prototyped here will generalize naturally to other textile fabrics--woven or knitted, weft knit or warp knit, polymeric or metallic--and, ultimately, will enable the robust discovery of anisotropic constitutive models for a wide variety of textile structures. Beyond discovering constitutive models, we envision to exploit automated model discovery as a novel strategy for the generative material design of wearable devices, stretchable electronics, and smart fabrics, as programmable textile metamaterials with tunable properties and functions.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

One rapid response to mitochondrial damage is peri-mitochondrial actin polymerization within 2 mins, which we term ADA (Acute Damaged-induced Actin). ADA is vital for a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis upon mitochondrial dysfunction. In the current study we investigated the effect of ADA on Pink1/Parkin mediated mitochondrial quality control. We show that inhibition of proteins involved in the ADA pathway significantly accelerates Parkin recruitment onto depolarized mitochondria. Addressing the mechanism by which ADA resists Parkin recruitment onto depolarized mitochondria, we found that ADA disrupts ER- mitochondrial contacts in an Arp2/3 complex-dependent manner. Interestingly, over-expression of ER-mitochondrial tethers overrides the effect of ADA, allowing rapid recruitment of not only Parkin but also LC3 after mitochondrial depolarization. During chronic mitochondrial dysfunction, Parkin and LC3 recruitment are completely blocked, which is reversed rapidly by inhibiting ADA. Taken together we show that ADA acts as a protective mechanism, delaying mitophagy following acute damage, and blocking mitophagy during chronic mitochondrial damage.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

The British Pigeon Fanciers Genetics of ILD (BPF-GILD) study aims to address this by studying a population with a clear history of exposure to a common trigger. Methods Participants were recruited from 2019 to 2023 at large UK Pigeon Fancier meetings. Each participant performed spirometry, completed a standardised questionnaire with a doctor, and provided blood samples. We present our baseline data in this manuscript. Results 417 subjects were recruited from four shows. The median age of the cohort was 63 years, 95% were male and 94% self-reported white ethnicity. The median number of pigeons kept was 80 [range 4-800], with fanciers spending 14 hours per week [1-100] in their lofts. 52% of participants had occupational dust exposures. 49% of the cohort reported at least one respiratory symptom related to loft exposure. 14% had a history of ILD and these individuals had more loft-related respiratory symptoms, poorer lung function, and appeared more likely to wear a mask with their pigeons than those without (74% vs 57%). 41% of participants had positive responses to questions employed to detect occult connective tissue disease in ILD clinics. Discussion Our well characterised cohort of pigeon fanciers commonly experience acute HP symptoms and are likely to be at increased risk of fHP.

Through systematic morphological analysis of olfactory projection neurons (PNs), we reveal that global anatomy of these second-order neurons is conserved. However, high-resolution, quantitative comparisons identify a striking case of convergent rewiring of PNs in two distinct olfactory pathways critical for D. sechellia's host location. Calcium imaging and labelling of pre-synaptic sites in these evolved PNs demonstrate that novel functional connections with third-order partners are formed in D. sechellia.

The relevant pharmacologic target of SGLT2i remains unclear. We show here that SGLT2i directly activate pantothenate kinase 1 (PANK1), the rate-limiting enzyme that initiates the conversion of pantothenate (vitamin B5) to coenzyme-A (CoA), an obligate co-factor for all major pathways of fuel use in the heart. Using stable-isotope infusion studies, we show that SGLT2i promote pantothenate consumption, activate CoA synthesis, rescue decreased levels of CoA in human failing hearts, and broadly stimulate fuel use in ex vivo perfused human cardiac blocks from patients with heart failure. Furthermore, we show that SGLT2i bind to PANK1 directly at physiological concentrations and promote PANK1 enzymatic activity in assays with purified components. Novel in silico dynamic modeling identified the site of SGLT2i binding on PANK1 and indicated a mechanism of activation involving prevention of allosteric inhibition of PANK1 by acyl-CoA species. Finally, we show that inhibition of PANK1 prevents SGLT2i-mediated increased contractility of isolated adult human cardiomyocytes. In summary, we demonstrate robust and specific off-target activation of PANK1 by SGLT2i, promoting CoA synthesis and efficient fuel use in human hearts, providing a likely explanation for the remarkable clinical benefits of SGLT2i.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

However, the optimal date for booster administration remains uncertain. Geographic variation in infection rates throughout the year make it challenging to intuit the best yearly booster administration date to effectively prevent infection, and also challenging to provide best guidance in how to alter booster administration in response to a breakthrough infection. Therefore, we leverage longitudinal antibody and reinfection probabilities with spatiotemporal projections of COVID-19 incidence to develop a geographically-informed approach to optimizing the timing of booster vaccination. Additionally, we assess the delay in booster vaccination that is warranted following breakthrough infections whenever they occur during the year, enabling an approach that acknowledges and respects diverse immune statuses, thereby addressing a substantial barrier to uptake. Our results provide guidance for individual decision-making and healthcare provider recommendations, as well as optimal public health policies.

Significance StatementCOVID-19 booster vaccinations are pivotal in reducing disease transmission. However, optimal schedules that would most successfully mitigate adverse health outcomes have not been rigorously determined. Spatial and temporal surges of infections, including breakthrough infections, challenge the implementation of effective boosting strategies. We leverage antibody data and incidence projections to develop a geographically-informed schedule for yearly booster administration and quantify appropriate delays in booster vaccination post-breakthrough infection, thereby accounting for immune status and enhancing vaccination inclusivity. Our findings offer crucial information for individual decision making, healthcare provider guidance, and policy aimed at optimizing the impact of booster vaccination on public health.","NA","medrxiv",1722377031880

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1722377031880

We solve the structure of the seipin/Adig complex by Cryo-EM at 2.98[A] overall resolution. Surprisingly, seipin can form two unique oligomers, undecamers and dodecamers. Adig selectively binds to the dodecameric seipin complex. We further find that Adig promotes seipin assembly by stabilizing and bridging adjacent seipin subunits. Functionally, Adig plays a key role in generating lipid droplets in adipocytes. In mice, inducible overexpression of Adig in adipocytes substantially increases fat mass, with enlarged lipid droplets. It also elevates thermogenesis during cold exposure.

It has been proposed that oscillatory alpha-band activity ([~]10 Hz) aids this process by functionally inhibiting early sensory regions. However, recent studies have challenged this notion. Our EEG and MEG studies aimed to investigate whether alpha oscillations serve as a  gatekeeper for downstream signal transmission. We first observed these effects in an EEG study and then replicated them using MEG, which allowed us to localize the sources.

We employed a cross-modal paradigm where visual cues indicated whether upcoming targets required visual or auditory discrimination. To assess inhibition, we utilized frequency-tagging, simultaneously flickering the fixation cross at 36 Hz and playing amplitude-modulated white noise at 40 Hz during the cue-to-target interval.

Consistent with prior research, we observed an increase in posterior alpha activity following cues signalling auditory targets. However, remarkably, both visual and auditory frequency tagged responses amplified in anticipation of auditory targets, correlating with alpha activity amplitude. Our findings suggest that when attention shifts to auditory processing, the visual stream remains responsive and is not hindered by occipital alpha activity. This implies that alpha modulation does not solely regulate  gain control in early sensory areas but rather orchestrates signal transmission to later stages of the processing stream.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

In many cases, the host is a non-model species with poor tools for genetic manipulation and the symbiont cannot be cultured or its gene expression manipulated to investigate function. Here we investigated the potential for using antisense inhibition to analyse host and symbiont gene function within an obligate aquatic symbiosis. We focused on the kinetoplastid host Bodo saltans and its bacterial symbiont, Candidatus Bodocaedibacter vickermanii, a member of Rickettsiales. We conclude that antisense inhibition is not feasible in the B. saltans and its symbiont, as the holobiont feeds on the antisense molecules - and increases in numbers - upon treatment with the antisense construct. Although our approach has proven unsuccessful, we have developed an array of protocols which can be used to study the biology of this microeukaryote and its microbial associates.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

Orphan GPCRs, lacking identified natural ligands, are a high priority for research, as identifying their ligands will aid in understanding their functions and potential as drug targets. Most GPCRs, including orphans, couple to Gi/o/z family members, however current assays to detect their activation are limited, hindering ligand identification efforts. We introduce GZESTY, a highly sensitive, cell-based assay developed in an easily deliverable format designed to study the pharmacology of Gi/o/z-coupled GPCRs and assist in deorphanization. We optimized assay conditions and developed an all-in-one vector employing novel cloning methods to ensure the correct expression ratio of GZESTY components. GZESTY successfully assessed activation of a library of ligand-activated GPCRs, detecting both full and partial agonism, as well as responses from endogenous GPCRs. Notably, with GZESTY we established the presence of endogenous ligands for GPR176 and GPR37 in brain extracts, validating its use in deorphanization efforts. This assay enhances the ability to find ligands for orphan GPCRs, expanding the toolkit for GPCR pharmacologists.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to biological alignment. We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins with a chain of thought.

Influenza A virus (IAV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded, RNA virus that has not previously been associated with widespread infection in cattle. As such, cattle are an extremely under-studied domestic IAV host species. IAV receptors on host cells are sialic acids (SAs) that are bound to galactose in either an 2,3 or 2,6 linkage. Human IAVs preferentially bind SA-2,6 (human receptor), whereas avian IAVs have a preference for 2,3 (avian receptor). The avian receptor can further be divided into two receptors: IAVs isolated from chickens generally bind more tightly to SA-2,3-Gal-{beta}1,4 (chicken receptor), whereas IAVs isolated from duck to SA-2,3-Gal-{beta}1,3 (duck receptor). We found all receptors were expressed, to a different degree, in the mammary gland, respiratory tract, and cerebrum of beef and/or dairy cattle. The duck and human IAV receptors were widely expressed in the bovine mammary gland, whereas the chicken receptor dominated the respiratory tract. In general, only a low expression of IAV receptors was observed in the neurons of the cerebrum. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for the high levels of H5N1 virus reported in infected bovine milk and show cattle have the potential to act as a mixing vessel for novel IAV generation.

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

So far, a well-known mammalian mutation PB2-E627K has not been maintained in AIV in poultry, which limits the spread of AIVs from avian to humans. Here, we discovered a variant, PB2-627V, which combines the properties of avian-like PB2-627E and human-like PB2-627K, overcoming host restrictions and posing a risk for human pandemics. Specifically, by screening the global PB2 sequences, we discovered a new independent cluster with PB2-627V emerged in the 2010s, which is prevalent in various avian, mammalian, and human isolates of AIVs, including H9N2, H7N9, H3N8, 2.3.4.4b H5N1, and other subtypes. And, the increasing prevalence of PB2-627V in poultry is accompanied by a rise in human infection cases with this variant. Then we systematically assessed its host adaptation, fitness, and transmissibility across three subtypes of AIVs (H9N2, H7N9, and H3N8) in different host models, including avian and human cells, chickens, mice, and ferrets where infections naturally occur. We found that PB2-627V facilitates AIVs to efficiently infect and replicate in chickens and mice by utilizing both avian- and human-origin ANP32A proteins. Importantly, and like PB2-627K, PB2-627V promotes efficient transmission between ferrets through respiratory droplets. Deep sequencing in passaged chicken samples and transmitted ferret samples indicates that PB2-627V remains stable across the two distinct hosts and has a high potential for long-term prevalence in avian species. Therefore, the mutation has the ability to continue spreading among poultry and can also overcome the barrier between birds and humans, greatly enhancing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, it is crucial to closely monitor influenza viruses carrying PB2-627V to prevent a pandemic.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880

This shortcoming increases the rate of false positives and false negatives, giving rise to a potentially misleading scientific record. To address this shortcoming, many researchers now use point-and-click software to run sample size calculations.

ObjectiveWe aimed to (1) estimate how many published articles report using the G*Power sample size calculation software; (2) assess whether these calculations are reproducible and (3) error-free; and (4) assess how often these calculations use G*Powers default option for mixed-design ANOVAs--which can be misleading and output sample sizes that are too small for a researchers intended purpose.

MethodWe randomly sampled open access articles from PubMed Central published between 2017 and 2022 and used a coding form to manually assess 95 sample size calculations for reproducibility and errors.

ResultsWe estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65% [95% CI: 0.62% - 0.67%] of articles). We could reproduce 2% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8%; 3/36).

ConclusionPublished sample size calculations that use G*Power are not transparently reported and may not be well-informed. Given the popularity of software packages like G*Power, they present an intervention point to increase the prevalence of informative sample size calculations.","NA","medrxiv",1722377031880

Our study aims to assess the association between COVID-19 infections and subsequent kidney diseases, using influenza as a positive control and incorporating a negative control to establish clearer associations.

MethodsA large retrospective cohort study with strata matching was conducted using the MarketScan database with records from Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. We used the international classification of 10th revision (ICD-10) codes to identify individuals and build three cohorts, (1) COVID-19 group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of COVID-19; (2) Influenza but no COVID-19 (positive control) group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of Influenza; and (3) no COVID-19 / Influenza (negative control) group, with randomly assigned index dates between Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. The main outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To evaluate the association between COVID-19 and the new onset of kidney diseases relative to both control groups, we employed multivariable stratified Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.

ResultsThe study included 939,241 individuals with COVID-19, 1,878,482 individuals in the negative control group, and 199,071 individuals with influenza. After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and medication histories, COVID-19 was significantly associated with increased risks of AKI (adjusted hazards ratio, aHR: 2.74, 2.61-2.87), CKD (aHR: 1.38, 1.32-1.45), and ESRD (aHR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.67-3.88), while influenza was associated with a modestly increased risk of AKI (aHR: 1.24, 1.11-1.38) and had no impact on CKD (aHR: 1.03, 0.92-1.14), and ESRD (aHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55-1.29). Time-specific analyses indicated that while the HR for AKI declined from 0-180 days to 0-540 days, the HR for CKD and ESRD remained stable, with COVID-19s risk surpassing influenzas risk throughout follow-up. Exploratory analysis also found significant impacts of COVID-19 on glomerular diseases (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50).

ConclusionIn this large real-world study, COVID-19 infections were associated with a 2.3-fold risk of developing AKI, a 1.4-fold risk of CKD, and a 4.7-fold risk of ESRD compared to influenza. Greater attention needs to be paid to kidney diseases in individuals after contracting COVID-19 to prevent future adverse health outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1722377031880

Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1722377031880
