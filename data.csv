Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment. The findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

To systematically explore these combinations, we present COMBINE (combinatorial interaction exploration), a high-throughput platform that tests over 50,000 pairs of epigenetic effector domains up to 2,094 amino acids in length for their ability to modulate endogenous human gene transcription. COMBINE revealed diverse synergistic and antagonistic interactions between epigenetic protein domains, including a potent KRAB-L3MBTL3 fusion that enhanced gene silencing up to 34-fold in dose-limited conditions and enabled robust bidirectional CRISPR perturbation. Inducible screening showed DNA methylation modifiers are essential for epigenetic memory, with distinct combinations driving long-term silencing, repression, or activation. Notably, we identified TET1-based combinations that induce hit-and-run upregulation for over 50 days, demonstrating long-term transcriptional activation. This systematic analysis of pairwise domain interactions provides a rich resource for understanding epigenetic crosstalk and developing next-generation epigenome editing tools.

However, a recent study suggested that sea anemones and other cnidarians have three segregated germ layer identities, corresponding to the bilaterian germ layers (1). Here, we investigated, how the three germ layer identities are specified during early development of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. First, the mesodermal territory is specified at the animal pole at 6 hours postfertilization, followed by the specification of a ring of endodermal territory between mesoderm and ectoderm. We then assessed the role of beta-catenin, MAPK and Notch signaling pathways during mesoderm and endoderm formation. Our results show that the mesoderm is initiated by MAPK signaling and simultaneously restricted to the future oral side by mutually exclusive nuclear beta-catenin signaling. The mesodermal cells then express the Delta ligand, while the ectodermal cells express the Notch receptor. Inhibition of Notch signaling as well as ectopic expression of the Notch intracellular domain showed that endodermal tissue identity is induced by Notch signaling at the boundary between mesoderm and ectoderm. We propose a new model that outlines the different steps leading to the segregation of mesoderm and endoderm identities in Nematostella, confirming the presence of 3 distinct germ layer identities in this cnidarian. Notably, the observed crosstalk of MAPK, beta-catenin and Notch signaling in the specification of three germ layers in Nematostella is highly reminiscent to early stage gastrulae of sea urchins suggesting that triploblasty may predate the split of cnidarians and bilaterians.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Here we review magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies assessing structural and functional brain associations with depressive and anxiety symptoms in insomnia disorder (ID; n=38), insomnia symptoms in depressive and anxiety disorders (n=14), and these symptoms in the general populations (n=2). The studies on insomnia disorder consistently showed overlapping (salience network: insula and anterior cingulate cortex) and differential MRI correlation patterns between depressive (thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex and its associated functional connectivity) and anxiety (functional connectivity associated with default mode network) symptoms. The insula was also consistently identified as indicating the severity of insomnia symptoms in depressive disorder. In contrast, findings for other regions related to insomnia symptoms in both depressive and anxiety disorders were generally inconsistent across studies, partly due to variations in methods and patient cohorts. In the general population, brain regions in the default mode network provided a functional link between insomnia and depressive symptoms. These findings underscore both the shared and distinct neural correlates among depression, anxiety, and insomnia, providing potential avenues for the clinical management of these conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1730412543013

Utilising phylogeographic approaches, we reveal a multi-scale expansion process with both short and long-distance dispersal events, and diffusion velocities in line with human-mediated jumps. We identify forest cover, banana and cocoa cultivation, temperature, and human population density as key environmental factors associated with OROV range expansion. Using ecological niche modelling, we show that OROV circulated in areas of enhanced ecological suitability immediately preceding its explosive epidemic expansion in the Amazon. This likely resulted from the virus being introduced into simultaneously densely populated and environmentally favourable regions in the Amazon, such as Manaus, leading to an amplified epidemic and spread beyond the Amazon. Our study provides valuable insights into the dispersal and ecological dynamics of OROV, highlighting the role of human mobility in colonisation of new areas, and raising concern over high viral suitability along the Brazilian coast.","NA","medrxiv",1730412543013

To identify pathways that are essential under fluoroquinolone stress and thus might represent novel targets to revitalize the use of this class of antibiotics, we performed genome-wide CRISPRi-seq screens to determine antibiotic-gene essentiality signatures. As expected, genes involved in DNA recombination and repair become more important under fluoroquinolone-induced DNA damage, such as recA, recJ, recF, recO, rexAB and ruvAB. Surprisingly, we also found that specific downregulation of the gene encoding the histidine kinase LiaS caused fluoroquinolone hypersensitivity. LiaS is part of the LiaFSR (VraTSR) three-component regulatory system involved in cell envelope homeostasis. We show that LiaS keeps the response regulator LiaR inactive, and that deletion of liaS causes hyperphosphorylation of LiaR and subsequent upregulation of the LiaR regulon. RNA-seq was used to refine the LiaR regulon, highlighting the role of the heat-shock response and the pleiotropic regulator SpxA2 in fluoroquinolone sensitivity. Activating the LiaR-regulon by the cell envelope-targeting antibiotic bacitracin synergized with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. This synergistic antibiotic combination restored sensitivity in fluoroquinolone-resistant strains in vitro. Importantly, bacitracin/levofloxacin combination therapy was also effective in vivo and improved the treatment of fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae infection in a zebrafish meningitis model. Together, the approaches and findings presented here provides a starting point for identification and validation of potent combination therapies that could be used in the clinic to treat antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal infections.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

The plasma membrane protein ninjurin-1 (NINJ1) actively promotes cell lysis by polymerizing into membrane embedded filaments that induce the formation of large plasma membrane lesions. Yet the signals controlling NINJ1 polymerization and the opening of membrane lesions remain unknown. Here we combine cell biology and biophysical measurements to characterize the steps preceding NINJ1-induced PMR in cells undergoing ferroptosis. Our results show that NINJ1 lesions form through a 2-step mechanism requiring oligomerization, which is triggered by signal 1, and subsequent lesion opening driven by signal 2, which we determine to be cell swelling without a concomitant increase in intracellular pressure. The close homologue NINJ2 polymerizes with similar kinetics to NINJ1 but fails to form lesions during cell swelling, further highlighting that oligomerization and PMR are distinct events. Chimeras between NINJ1 and NINJ2 show that the unstructured N-terminal region of NINJ1 controls lesion opening in response to cell swelling. In summary, our data establish a new 2-step model for NINJ1-driven necrosis in which initial oligomerization causes the formation of NINJ1 filaments that serve as weak links in the plasma membrane and can break once cell swelling causes a rise in membrane tension and mechanical stress.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Despite this well-known link, we still know little about underlying age-related epigenetic differences, which could help us better understand inter-individual variation in aging and the etiology, onset, and progression of age-associated disease. Dogs exhibit this negative correlation between size, health, and longevity and thus represent an excellent system in which to test the underlying mechanisms. Here, we quantified genome-wide DNA methylation in a cohort of 864 dogs in the Dog Aging Project. Age strongly patterned the dog epigenome, with the majority (66% of age-associated loci) of regions associating age-related loss of methylation. These age effects were non-randomly distributed in the genome and differed depending on genomic context. We found the LINE1 (long interspersed elements) class of TEs (transposable elements) were the most frequently hypomethylated with age (FDR < 0.05, 40% of all LINE1 regions). This LINE1 pattern differed in magnitude across breeds of different sizes- the largest dogs lost 0.26% more LINE1 methylation per year than the smallest dogs. This suggests that epigenetic regulation of TEs, particularly LINE1s, may contribute to accelerated age and disease phenotypes within a species. Since our study focused on the methylome of immune cells, we looked at LINE1 methylation changes in golden retrievers, a breed highly susceptible to hematopoietic cancers, and found they have accelerated age-related LINE1 hypomethylation compared to other breeds. We also found many of the LINE1s hypomethylated with age are located on the X chromosome and are, when considering X chromosome inactivation, counter-intuitively more methylated in males. These results have revealed the demethylation of LINE1 transposons as a potential driver of inter-species, demographic-dependent aging variation.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Here, we investigated the involvement of those neuropeptide systems in maternal aggression within the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh), a central region of the reward and maternal circuits. Infusion of CRF or Urocortin3 (CRF- receptor 2 agonist), as well as an OXT receptor antagonist, reduced maternal aggression, suggesting a role in pup defence. Furthermore, the effects of CRF infusion in the NAcSh continued beyond the maternal defence test (MDT), reducing nursing and increasing self- grooming. Corroborating the involvement of the stress system in maternal aggression, colocalization of CRF and cFos immunoreactive cells were increased in response to the MDT, regardless of pup presence. In addition, MDT exposure increased intra-NAc OXT release in lactating rats, which could be also triggered by local retrodialysis of CRF, but not Urocortin3. However, both ligands of the CRF system elicited dopamine (DA) release in different dynamics. Crh-r1 were predominantly expressed in the medial NAc on medium-sized spiny neurons (MSN), but also in the rostral part on GABAergic interneurons. Crh-r2 were mainly expressed in the rostral NAc and its expression on GABAergic interneurons increased towards the caudal pole. Lastly, we identified CRF-enriched projections to the NAcSh descending from the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the paraventricular thalamus, among others. In conclusion, intra-NAcSh dampened CRF system activity and enhanced OXT system transmission are indispensable for successful pup defence. Any perturbations like increased CRF system signalling might activate compensatory mechanisms to ensure adequate maternal behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

The molecular underpinnings of this transition have traditionally centered on zygotic chromatin remodeling and genome activation1,2, as their repression can prevent downstream processes of differentiation and organogenesis. Despite precedents that oxygen depletion can similarly suspend development in early embryos3-6, hinting at a pivotal role for oxygen metabolism in this transition, whether there is a bona fide chemical switch that licenses the onset of morphogenesis remains unknown. Here we discover that a mitochondrial oxidant acts as a metabolic switch to license the onset of animal morphogenesis. Concomitant with the instatement of mitochondrial membrane potential, we found a burst-like accumulation of mitochondrial superoxide (O2-) during fly blastoderm formation. In vivo chemistry experiments revealed that an electron leak from site IIIQo at ETC Complex III is responsible for O2- production. Importantly, depleting mitochondrial O2- fully mimics anoxic conditions and, like anoxia, induces suspended animation prior to morphogenesis, but not after. Specifically, H2O2, and not ONOO-, NO, or HO{middle dot}, can single-handedly account for this mtROS-based response. We demonstrate that depleting mitochondrial O2- similarly prevents the onset of morphogenetic events in vertebrate embryos and ichthyosporea, close relatives of animals. We postulate that such redox-based metabolic licensing of morphogenesis is an ancient trait of holozoans that couples the availability of oxygen to development, conserved from early-diverging animal relatives to vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Therefore, approaches targeting food preferences should be integral in counteracting the current epidemic. However, food preferences are affected by a multitude of factors and are usually resistant to changes later in life. Hence, we tested whether the food choices of preschool children can be changed by a child-appropriate interactive fairytale. We used two interactive stories: the first (experimental) story was about how two protagonists of similar age as the participants saved their hometown from being drained of color with the help of magic fruits or vegetables, while the second (control) story consisted of a similar plot that did not mention food. In Experiment 1, we used a crossover design with a one-week baseline measurement. After the experimental stories, healthy food choices (i.e., pieces of fruit vs. cookies, sweets, or cake) increased significantly relative to the one-week baseline, whereas no change was observed after the control story. In preregistered Experiment 2, we replicated these results with vegetables as healthy options using a random control design and investigated the longevity of the effects. The food-story effect on vegetable choices was similar to fruits (Exp. 1) and lasted for two weeks. These findings demonstrate that appropriate narratives about food can have a strong and lasting effect on the healthy food choices of preschool children and might promote healthy food consumption if incorporated into nutrition education.","NA","medrxiv",1730412543013

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Variant Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) exists as several subtypes, which are key ""writers"" of ubiquitylation on histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119ub), crucial for transcriptional repression during development and cell identity determination. The mechanism by which dynamic chromatin exploration by variant PRC1 complexes is coupled to ubiquitin writing is unknown. Here, we developed a single-molecule approach to directly observe chromatin interactions and ubiquitylation by PRC1. We find that variant PRC1 transiently samples chromatin until reaching a catalytically competent nucleosome-bound state, resulting in E2 recruitment and ubiquitin transfer. Variant PRC1 is weakly processive in ubiquitylating neighboring nucleosomes. Moreover, activity differences between PRC1 subtypes, containing either a PCGF1 or PCGF4 subunit, result from distinct probabilities of achieving a catalytically competent state. Our results thus demonstrate that the dynamic formation of an active complex between variant PRC1, E2 and chromatin is the critical determinant of subtype-specific variant PRC1 activity.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

While data-driven statistical and machine learning methods can identify patterns from omics data across multiple samples, they typically require a large number of samples and they often lack interpretability and alignment with existing biological knowledge. In contrast, knowledge-based network methods integrate molecular data with prior knowledge to provide results that are biologically interpretable, but they lack both a unified mathematical framework, leading to ad-hoc solutions specific to particular data types or prior knowledge, limiting their generalisability, and a common modelling interface for programmatic manipulation, restricting method extensions. Furthermore, existing methods generally cannot perform joint network inference across multiple samples or conditions, which restricts their capacity to capture shared mechanisms, making these methods more sensitive to noise and prone to overfitting. To address these limitations, we introduce CORNETO (Constrained Optimisation for the Recovery of NETworks from Omics), a unified framework for knowledge-driven network inference. CORNETO redefines the joint inference task as a constrained optimisation problem with a penalty that induces structured sparsity, allowing for simultaneous network inference across multiple samples. The framework is highly flexible and supports a wide variety of prior knowledge networks - undirected, directed and signed graphs, as well as hypergraphs - enabling the generalisation and improvement of many network inference methods, despite their seemingly different assumptions. We demonstrate its utility by presenting novel extensions of methods for signalling, metabolism and protein-protein interactions. We show how these new methods improve the performance of traditional techniques on a diverse set of biological tasks using simulated and real data. CORNETO is available as an open-source Python package (https://github.com/saezlab/corneto), facilitating researchers in extending, reusing, and harmonising methods for network inference.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

However, despite extensive research, a strictly biochemical mechanism for self-organization in Hydra remains elusive. In this study, we investigated mechanical stimuli and identified a positive feedback loop between Wnt signaling and tissue stretching. We developed a mathematical model of mechanochemical pattern formation in a closed elastic shell, representing regenerating Hydra epithelial spheroids. Our model explains how mechanical forces drive axis formation and predicts the organizer's location under various perturbations, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the spatial dynamics involved. Validation by partially confining regenerating tissues showed that the organizer indeed forms in regions with the greatest stretching potential. This work highlights a novel mechanochemical mechanism for luminal epithelium patterning, suggesting that mechanical forces, in addition to biochemical signals, play a crucial role in tissue regeneration and axis specification. Our findings offer broader implications for the role of mechanical forces in tissue organization in various biological systems, opening new avenues for investigating mechanochemical feedback in development and regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Here, we placed managed bee colonies on conventional farms to assess their impact on arabica coffee yield, quality and market value, while also to evaluate colony health in coffee fields treated with field rates of thiamethoxam-based products. We show that supplementing farms with managed bees increased farmer income by enhancing coffee yield and beverage quality, which is rewarded by specialty coffee markets.

IME has been noted across diverse genes and organisms, but remains mysterious in many respects. For example, how does intron sequence affect the magnitude of IME? In this study, we performed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to assess the effect of varying intron sequence on gene expression in a high-throughput manner, in human cells, using tens of thousands of synthetic introns with natural splice sites and randomized internal sequence. We observe that most random introns splice efficiently and enhance gene expression as well as or better than fully natural introns. Nearly all introns stimulate gene expression ~eight-fold above an intronless control, at both mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that the primary mechanism acts to increase mRNA levels. IME strength is positively associated with splicing efficiency and with the intronic content of poly-uridine stretches, which we confirm using reporter experiments. Together, this work elucidates sequence determinants of IME from tens of thousands of random introns, and confirms that enhancement of gene expression is a general property of splicing.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

In anoxic environments, methane is known to be produced through hydrogenotrophic, acetoclastic or methylotrophic mechanisms. Methane production from hydrocarbons may also be important, especially in hydrocarbon-rich environments, like the Gulf of California, but the mechanism of this hydrocarbonoclastic methanogenesis remains unclear. The activity of consortia of anaerobic methane oxidizing (ANME) archaea and bacteria limits the release of methane to the atmosphere by consuming methane in anoxic environments globally. Here we used isotopic-labeling to track the conversion of hydrocarbons (hexadecane and naphthalene) to methane in enrichments from hydrothermally impacted, hydrocarbon-rich sediments from the Gulf of California. Methane was produced directly from hexadecane and naphthalene, in both the presence and absence of sulfate. We reconstructed metagenomic assembled-genomes (MAGs) from these experiments which revealed a mixture of bacteria dominated by Desulfobacteriota and Bacteroidota, and archaea dominated by Aeinigmarchaeota, Thermoplasmatota, and ANME group 2c. The ANME-2c were the only MAGs that encoded methyl coenzyme M reductases (McrA) and complete Wood-Ljungdahl pathways (WLP). This suggests that ANME-2c archaea may be involved in the production of methane along the seafloor, and that our understanding of the roles of these globally important microbes is not yet fully appreciated.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

However, the molecular mechanisms of translation by plant mitoribosomes remain largely unknown. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to provide a high-resolution structural characterization of the flowering plant mitoribosome, in translating and maturation states. The structure reveals the mitoribosome bound to tRNA in the peptidyl site, along with a segment of mRNA and a nascent polypeptide. Moreover, we identify an extensive set of ribosomal RNA modifications that we confirmed by nanopore sequencing. Additionally, we observe a late assembly intermediate of the small ribosomal subunit, in complex with the RsgA assembly factor. This reveals how a plant-specific extension of RsgA blocks the mRNA channel to prevent premature mRNA association before complete small subunit maturation.

Antibiotics based on programmable antisense oligomers (asobiotics) offer an attractive solution to the ""arms-race"", as their specificity can be quickly updated and tailored to target resistant bacteria. In order to understand the genetic architecture of resistance to asobiotics, we employed laboratory evolution assays to identify mutations that decrease susceptibility to antisense peptide nucleic acid (PNA) against four major gram-negative pathogens: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We observed that the reduction in susceptibility upon asobiotics treatment was dependent on the specific cell penetrating peptide (CPP) being conjugated to the PNAs, suggesting that reduced uptake is a common adaptation strategy only against the (KFF)3-K CPP. We in fact observed that sbmA was frequently mutated in all tested species when treated with (KFF)3-K conjugated PNAs. We further identified mutations related to translation, peptide transport and cell envelope, which provide new hypotheses on cellular response to CPP-PNAs conjugates. Furthermore, for (RXR)4XB-acpP we observed a modest increase in resistance only when mutations in the PNA binding site were induced, which could easily be bypassed by changing the PNA sequence. These findings indicate that the specific identity of the CPP used plays a key role in determining its robustness against the evolution of resistance, and that laboratory evolution can illuminate the remaining gaps in our knowledge on the mechanisms of action of asobiotics.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

We compared the effects of a 12-ingredient nutraceutical on mice lifespan and healthspan markers with that of a high efficacy senolytic intervention consisting of a low dose of Navitoclax combined with the specific mitochondrial uncoupler BAM15.

The senolytic intervention significantly reduced frailty progression and improved cognitive function after the second round of treatment, but without subsequent treatment, these effects appeared to wane at later ages. The multi-ingredient supplement tended to reduce frailty progression steadily with time, albeit not significant, and maintained cognitive function.

Base-level errors are typically fixed with an additional polishing step that uses reads aligned to the draft assembly to identify necessary edits. However, current methods struggle to find a balance between over- and under-polishing. Here, we present an encoder-only transformer model for assembly polishing called DeepPolisher, which predicts corrections to the underlying sequence using Pacbio HiFi read alignments to a diploid assembly. Our pipeline introduces a method, PHARAOH (Phasing Reads in Areas Of Homozygosity), which uses ultra-long ONT data to ensure alignments are accurately phased and to correctly introduce heterozygous edits in falsely homozygous regions. We demonstrate that the DeepPolisher pipeline can reduce assembly errors by half, with a greater than 70% reduction in indel errors. We have applied our DeepPolisher-based pipeline to 180 assemblies from the next Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) data release, producing an average predicted Quality Value (QV) improvement of 3.4 (54% error reduction) for the majority of the genome.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

There is a consensus among quantitative geneticists that the G-matrix can evolve through ""deep"" time. Yet, quantitative genetic models for the evolution of the G-matrix are conspicuously lacking. In contrast, the field of macroevolution has several stochastic models for univariate traits evolving on phylogenies. However, despite much research into multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods, analytical models of how multivariate trait matrices might evolve on phylogenies have not been considered. Here we show how three analytical models for the evolution of matrices and multivariate traits on phylogenies, based on Lie group theory, Riemannian geometry and stochastic differential (diffusion) equations, can be combined to unify quantitative genetics and macroevolutionary theory in a coherent mathematical framework. The models provide a basis for understanding how G-matrices might evolve on phylogenies, and we show how to fit models to data via simulation using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Such models can be used to generate and test hypotheses about the evolution of genetic variances and covariances, together with the evolution of the traits themselves, and how these might vary across a phylogeny. This unification of macroevolutionary theory and quantitative genetics is an important advance in the study of phenotypes, allowing for the construction of a synthetic quantitative theory of the evolution of species and multivariate traits over ""deep"" time.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Here, we describe the development of an antibody-based enrichment approach to immunoprecipitate in vivo remnant UFMylated peptides and identification by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We used this approach to identify >200 UFMylation sites from various mouse tissues revealing extensive modification in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, we show that UFMylation is increased in skeletal muscle biopsies from people living with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (plwALS). Quantification of UFMylation sites in these participant biopsies with multiplexed isotopic labeling and LC-MS/MS reveal prominent increases in myosin UFMylation. Finally, in silico modelling suggest UFMylation of myosin directly adjacent to the ATP-binding site may regulate stability and/or function. Our data suggest that although UFMylation is not as widespread as ubiquitylation, its in vivo status is more complex than previously thought.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Here, we demonstrate that reactivations in the lateral visual cortex are vital for the consolidation of visual association learning. By employing longitudinal two-photon Ca2+ imaging alongside paired LFP recordings in the hippocampus and cortex, we show that targeted manipulation of PV+ inhibitory neurons in the lateral visual cortex after daily training selectively attenuated cue-specific reactivations and learning, with no apparent effect on normal network function during training.

Why MHC-I is susceptible to capture via autophagy remains unclear. By synchronizing exit of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we show that PDAC cells display prolonged retention of MHC-I in the ER and fail to efficiently route it to the plasma membrane. A capture-complex composed of NBR1 and the ER-phagy receptor TEX264 facilitates targeting of MHC-I for autophagic degradation, and suppression of either receptor is sufficient to increase total levels and re-route MHC-I to the plasma membrane. Binding of MHC-I to the capture complex is linked to antigen presentation efficiency, as inhibiting antigen loading via knockdown of TAP1 or beta 2-Microglobulin led to increased binding between MHC-I and the TEX264-NBR1 capture complex. Conversely, expression of ER directed high affinity antigenic peptides led to increased MHC-I at the cell surface and reduced lysosomal degradation. A genome-wide CRISPRi screen identified NFXL1, as an ER-resident E3 ligase that binds to MHC-I and mediates its autophagic capture. High levels of NFXL1 are negatively correlated with MHC-I protein expression and predicts poor patient prognosis. These data highlight an ER resident capture complex tasked with sequestration and degradation of non-conformational MHC-I in PDAC cells, and targeting this complex has the potential to increase PDAC immunogenicity.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Using a high-resolution ribosome profiling approach, we analyzed the transcriptome, as well as monosome- and polysome-bound RNAs of mouse oocytes and embryos, defining an unprecedented extent of spatiotemporal translational landscapes during this rapid developmental phase. We observed previously unknown mechanisms of translational selectivity, i.e., stage-wise deferral of loading monosome-bound mRNAs to polysome for active translation, continuous translation of both monosome and polysome-bound mRNAs at the same developmental stage, and priming to monosomes after initial activation. We showed that a eukaryotic initiation factor Eif1ad3, which is exclusively translated in the 2-Cell embryo, is required for ribosome biogenesis post embryonic genome activation. Our study thus provides genome-wide datasets and analyses of spatiotemporal translational dynamics accompanying mammalian germ cell and embryonic development and reveals the contribution of a novel translation initiation factor to mammalian pre-implantation development.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Counterintuitively, during starvation, multiple mRNAs that are upregulated are also increasingly bound and prematurely terminated and degraded via NNS. Here we demonstrate that this NNS-mediated attenuation is important for controlling the expression and protein concentration of an evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial transporter, Pic2. Strikingly, we find that even a modest increase in Pic2 protein levels caused by defective NNS regulation has major phenotypical consequences, increasing cell volume and intracellular stress, prolonging cell cycle and decreasing growth rate. Disrupting Nab3 binding to PIC2 globally redistributed Nrd1 binding, changing the levels of other NNS-regulated transcripts. We propose that imbalances in the availability of the subunits constituting the NNS complex underlie the cell volume and cycle anomalies.

This coordinate system is abstract - with the same grid cells encoding position across different sensory environments; and hierarchical - with grid modules of increasing spatial scale occupying increasingly ventral locations in the EC. Recent theories suggest that a similar abstract coordinate system could offer the same benefits to general memories that are not sequences drawn from a 2D surface. Here we show that an abstract hierarchical coordinate system supports arbitrary sequences in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL). In single-unit recordings from MTL, we find abstract, coordinate-like coding of a simple sequential memory task. In an fMRI experiment with more complex hierarchical sequences, we discover an abstract hierarchical representation in EC: the coordinate representations at distinct levels in the hierarchy are arranged on an anatomical gradient along the EC's anterior-posterior axis, homologous to the ventro-dorsal axis in rodents. These results therefore mirror the anatomical gradient of grid cells in the rodent EC but now for arbitrary non-spatial sequences. Together they suggest that memories are scaffolded on a hierarchical coordinate system using common neuronal coding principles, aligned to preserved anatomy, across domains and species.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

This division is conserved across highly divergent, early-branching animals including flatworms and cnidarians. While specific interactions between motifs delineate cell type relationships within families, surprisingly, these interactions are not conserved between species. Consistently, while deep learning models trained on one species can predict accessibility of other species sequences, their predictions frequently rely on distinct, but synonymous, motif combinations.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce genular, an open-source platform that unifies gene expression data analysis across diverse cell types by integrating scRNA-seq data with extensive genomic and proteomic information from 16 databases, including NCBI Gene, Human Protein Atlas, STRING, and UniProt. genular aggregates data from more than 2,893 scRNA-seq experiments, encompassing over 74.5 million unique cells across various tissues and conditions. A key feature of genular is calculating a cell marker score for each gene, enabling the quantification of gene expression across cells to derive unique profiles specific to cell types, states, and lineages. Using genular, we differentiate T cell memory states, map differentiation profiles by tracking gene expression changes as monocytes mature into macrophages and lymphoid progenitor cells develop into T cells, and capture tissue-specific reprogramming of macrophages, revealing distinct gene expression profiles that enable specialized functions in different tissues. By integrating scRNA-seq data with multi-domain biological information and employing advanced statistical methodologies, genular provides a scalable platform that accurately defines cellular identities, functional states, and differentiation pathways.

Agricultural crops typically contain limited R gene diversity so resistance is often short-lived as pathogens evolve rapidly to evade recognition. The mildew resistance locus A (Mla) R gene family of barley and wheat represents a rich source of natural genetic variation that is ideal for mining disease resistance specificities. Mla R genes encode immune receptor proteins of the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) class that recognise unrelated plant pathogens by binding secreted virulence proteins termed effectors. The barley NLRs MLA13 and MLA7 confer resistance to different strains of the barley powdery mildew pathogen through direct interaction with the pathogen effectors AVRA13 and AVRA7 respectively. Using DNA shuffling, we generated a variant library by recombining the Mla7 and Mla13 genes in vitro. The variant library was cloned into yeast generating ~4,000 independent clones and was screened for interaction with AVRA13 and AVRA7 using a yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) assay. This yielded a number of clones that encode NLR proteins that interacted with AVRA13. Sequence analysis showed that the interacting MLA proteins can be clustered into three groups, all of which contain a critical residue from MLA13. While MLA13 and MLA7 differ by 30 residues across the LRR domain, the replacement of leucine to serine at this position in MLA7 facilitated interaction with AVRA13 in yeast and AVRA13-dependent immune signalling in planta. We have established a pipeline that evolves MLAs to recognise distinct pathogen effectors without the requirement for protein structural knowledge and the use of rationale design. We suggest these findings represent a step towards evolving novel recognition capabilities rapidly in vitro.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Overall, the characterization of the IRE1 signalosome not only reveals the multi-faceted control of IRE1 RNase activity and stability by its interacting partners and allow us to discuss putative additional IRE1 regulators and cellular functions based on the nature of its interactome and its localization.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

It typically emerges in late adolescence and is associated with dopamine abnormalities and aberrant salience. Most genes associated with schizophrenia risk involve ubiquitous targets that may not explain delayed emergence of dopaminergic disruptions. This includes GRIN2A, the gene encoding the GluN2A subunit of the NMDA receptor. Both common and rare variants of GRIN2A are considered genetic risk factors for schizophrenia diagnosis. We find that Grin2a knockout in dopamine neurons during adolescence is sufficient to produce a behavioral phenotype that mirrors aspects of psychosis. These include disruptions in effort optimization, salience attribution, and ability to utilize feedback to guide behavior. We also find a selective effect of this manipulation on dopamine release during prediction error signaling. These data provide mechanistic insight into how variants of GRIN2A may lead to the latent presentation of aberrant salience and abnormalities in dopamine dynamics. This etiologically relevant model may aid future discovery of course altering treatments for schizophrenia.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

In this study, we aimed to identify the oscillatory correlates of this process across different spatial scales of neural activity. We simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFP) from the LPFC and electroencephalograms (EEG) from the scalp of monkeys performing a modified memory-guided saccade (MGS) task. The monkeys were required to remember the location of a target visual stimulus while anticipating distracting visual stimulus, flashed at 50% probability during the delay period. We found significant theta-band activity across spatial scales during anticipation of a distractor, closely linked with underlying working memory dynamics, through decoding and cross-temporal generalization analyses. EEG particularly reflected reactivation of memory around the anticipated time of a distractor, even in the absence of stimuli. During this anticipated time, beta-band activity exhibited transiently enhanced intrahemispheric communication between the LPFC and occipitoparietal brain areas. These oscillatory phenomena were observed only when the monkeys successfully performed the task, implicating their possible functional role in mitigating anticipated distractors. Our results demonstrate that distractor anticipation recruits multiple oscillatory processes across the brain during working memory maintenance, with a key activity observed predominantly in the theta and beta bands.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Although increased nuclear Syn localization induces neurotoxicity, its definitive physiological role remains elusive. Previous studies on nuclear Syn are limited to its interactions with individual histones and dsDNA, leaving a significant gap in understanding its interactions with assembled histone H2a-H2b dimer and (H3-H4)2 tetramer, as well as its role in chromatin regulation. Here, we demonstrated that Syn binds specifically to both H2a-H2b and (H3-H4)2 with high affinity. Truncation studies revealed that Syn(1-103) region interacts with (H3-H4)2, while the acidic (121-140) C-terminal end is crucial for H2a-H2b binding. Sequence analysis suggests Syn-dimer binding region contains a conserved DEF/YxP motif present in other dimer-binding histone chaperones. High-resolution structure of Syn-dimer binding region with H2a-H2b complex reveals that Syn adopts two binding modes (BM1 and BM2). In BM-1, Syn utilizes nucleosomal DNA-binding surface, while in BM-2, it engages with both DNA- and the H3-interaction interface. Additionally, dimer recognition by Syn overlaps with other dimer-binding histone chaperones, suggesting Syn's potential role in the nucleosome assembly/disassembly process.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

The long-term viability of small populations can be threatened by an extinction vortex a positive feedback loop between declining fitness and declining population size. Two distinct mechanisms can drive an extinction vortex: i) ineffective selection in small populations allows deleterious mutations to fix, driving mutational meltdown, and ii) fewer individuals produce fewer of the novel beneficial mutations essential for long-term adaptation, a mechanism we term mutational drought. We measure the relative importance of each mechanism, on the basis of how sensitive beneficial vs. deleterious components of fitness flux are to changes in census population size near the critical population size at which fitness is stable. We derive analytical results given linkage equilibrium, complemented by simulations that capture the complex linkage disequilibria that emerge under high deleterious mutation rates. Even in the absence of environmental change, mutational drought can be nearly as important as mutational meltdown. Real populations must also adapt to a changing environment, making mutational drought more important. A partial exception is that mutational drought is somewhat less important when the beneficial mutation rate is high, although its contribution remains substantial. The critical population size is driven substantially higher by linkage disequilibria between deleterious and beneficial mutations, which also increase (albeit modestly) the importance of mutational drought.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

However, existing methods typically distort ER-MCSs, by expanding contacts or creating artificial ones. Here we describe a new method for inducible labeling of ER-MCSs using the Lamin B receptor (LBR) and a generic anchor protein on the partner organelle. Termed LaBeRling, this versatile, one-to-many approach allows labeling of different types of ER-MCSs (mitochondria, plasma membrane, lysosomes, early endosomes, lipid droplets and Golgi), on-demand, in interphase or mitotic cells. LaBeRling is non-disruptive and does not change ER-MCSs in terms of the contact number, extent or distance measured; as determined by light microscopy or a deep-learning volume electron microscopy approach. We applied this method to study the changes in ER-MCSs during mitosis and to label novel ER-Golgi contact sites at different mitotic stages in live cells.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Short-read genome sequencing (sr-GS) enables CNV calling for genomic intervals of variable size and across multiple phenotypes. However, unresolved challenges include an overwhelming number of false-positive calls due to systematic biases from non-uniform read coverage and collapsed calls resulting from the abundance of paralogous segments and repetitive elements in the human genome. Methods: To address these interpretative challenges, we developed VizCNV. The VizCNV computational tool for inspecting CNV calls uses various data signal sources from sr-GS data, including read depth, phased B-allele frequency, as well as benchmarking signals from other SV calling methods. The interactive features and view modes are adept for analyzing both chromosomal abnormalities [e.g., aneuploidy, segmental aneusomy, and chromosome translocations], gene exonic CNV and non-coding gene regulatory regions. In addition, VizCNV includes a built-in filter schema for trio genomes, prioritizing the detection of impactful germline CNVs, such as de novo CNVs. Upon computational optimization by fine-tuning parameters to maximize sensitivity and specificity, VizCNV demonstrated approximately 83.8% recall and 77.2% precision on the 1000 Genome Project data with an average coverage read depth of 30x. Results: We applied VizCNV to 39 families with primary immunodeficiency disease without a molecular diagnosis. With implemented build-in filter, we identified two de novo CNVs and 90 inherited CNVs >10 kb per trio. Genotype-phenotype analyses revealed that a compound heterozygous combination of a paternal 12.8 kb deletion of exon 5 and a maternal missense variant allele of DOCK8 are likely the molecular cause of one proband. Conclusions: VizCNV provides a robust platform for genome-wide relevant CNV discovery and visualization of such CNV using sr-GS data.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Obesity and overweight have furthermore been shown to relate to structural brain alterations. Post-COVID condition (PCC) has in turn been associated with structural brain alterations and lingering immunological changes. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess whether obesity contributes to structural brain alterations and differences in immunological markers in PCC patients.

MethodsWe investigated a previously established cohort of PCC patients (n = 61). Whole-brain comparison of gray matter volume (GMV) was conducted by voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Obesity, as measured by body mass index (BMI), as well as age, gender and total intracranial volume (TIV) were included as regressors in a linear regression model.

ResultsA significant negative association was found between higher BMI and lower GMV in the right thalamus (p(FWE) = 0.039, k = 209, TFCE = 1037.97, x = 18, y = -21, z = 8). Moreover, BMI, GMV and immunological markers were linked in PCC. Specifically, BMI was primarily positively associated with Interleukin-6 and negatively with Interleukin-7, while GMV showed strong positive associations with Interleukin-8.

LimitationsA small cohort size and no available data on BMI changes before and after SARS-CoV2 infection limit the interpretation of our findings.

ConclusionThe results suggest that BMI contributes to GMV alterations in PCC patients, with both BMI and GMV being associated with peripheral immunological markers. These findings indicate that converging mechanisms, such as inflammation and structural brain alterations, may play a role in obesity and PCC.","NA","medrxiv",1730412543013

Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages use crlRNAs to thwart CRISPR-Cas immunity by inhibiting Cas expression, or to block Abi by silencing an unprecedented RNA toxin that features consecutive proline codons. Remarkably, the anti-CRISPR protein AcrIF24 selectively inhibits Cas proteins loaded with host crRNAs/crlRNAs, while allowing those complexed with viral crlRNAs to synergistically block Abi responses, as viral crlRNAs have co-adaptively evolved shorter spacer sequences. Furthermore, viral crlRNAs frequently organized as multiplexed arrays, mirroring the architecture of bacterial CRISPRs.

However, AlphaFold3 does not currently provide access to some functions, such as the prediction of protein-ligand complex structures. To reduce the enormous costs in early small molecule drug discovery, verifying the utility of protein-ligand complex prediction methods, such as AlphaFold3, in downstream tasks like free energy perturbation calculations is crucial.

Regarding the complex structure prediction performance of the 8 targets from Wang \etal's FEP benchmark, HelixFold3 showed superior performance to AlphaFold2 and existing methods. Predicting a holo structure rather than an apo structure resulted in higher binding site prediction accuracy. Furthermore, using HelixFold3 predicted structures in practical situations, where binding free energies of all derivatives were estimated, both structures achieved accuracies comparable to crystal structures.

We show that Malat1 is required for appropriate cytokine expression in female but not male Th2 cells. Malat1 deficiency impairs in vitro Th2 differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells from female mice, characterised by transcriptome-wide effects and suppression of cytokine expression, particularly IL10. Mechanistically, naive CD4+ T cells from Malat1-/- female mice demonstrate altered early activation kinetics, followed by impairment of the early differentiation gene expression programme, including up-regulation of an interferon responsive gene module. This is followed by suppression of IL2R and IL2R{gamma} expression and IL2-mediated differentiation. Male CD4+ T cell activation and Th2 differentiation are not sensitive to Malat1 loss due to stronger early activation, higher interferon responsive gene expression during early differentiation, maintenance of IL2R expression independently of Malat1, and lower sensitivity to exogenous IL2 during late differentiation. In vivo female, but not male, Malat1-/- mice demonstrate altered Th2 differentiation characterised by a reduction in IL10+ Th2 cells in both lung and spleen following priming and challenge with Schistosoma mansoni eggs, a model of lung type 2 inflammation.

However, the specific mechanisms driving gastric emptying dysfunction in patients with obesity remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated potential mechanisms by focusing on the homeostasis of gastric smooth muscle, using tissue samples from both patient and mice, as well as human cell culture system. Design: Tissue samples were collected from patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy for obesity, as well as from control subjects with standard weight who were undergoing treatment for gastric or esophageal carcinoma. Stomach tissues were harvested from mice after 12 weeks on a High-Fat Diet (HFD). Differentiated human gastric smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were treated with lipids, siRNA-peptide-based nanoparticles and/or pharmaceutical compounds. All experimental conditions were analyzed for their effects on SMC differentiation using stage-specific smooth muscle markers. Additionally, lipidomic and RNA sequencing analyses were performed on human gastric SMC cultures. The findings were assessed in patients with obesity to evaluate their clinical relevance. Results: The smooth muscle layers in gastric tissue from both patients with obesity and mice fed on a HFD exhibited altered differentiation status. Treatment of differentiated human gastric SMCs with lipids phenocopies these alterations and is associated with increased expression of PDK4 and ANGPTL4. Inhibition of PDK4 or ANGPTL4 upregulation prevents these lipid-induced modifications. Mechanistically, lipid treatment activates PPARD, which regulates PDK4 and ANGPTL4 upregulation, leading to SMC dedifferentiation. Notably, PDK4 and ANGPTL4 levels correlate with immaturity and alteration of gastric smooth muscle in patients with obesity. Conclusion: Obesity triggers a phenotypic change in gastric SMCs, driven by the activation of the PPARD/PDK4/ANGPTL4 pathway. These mechanistic insights offer potential biomarkers for diagnosing stomach dysmotility in patients with obesity.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Additionally, depletion of EWSR1-FLI1 potently suppressed tumor growth in xenograft models validating efforts to directly target EWSR1-FLI1 in Ewing sarcoma.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

While previous studies have primarily focused on skin stretch directly at joints, here we investigate the extent and complexity of natural skin stretch across various body regions, including the face and trunk. We used a quad-camera setup to image large ink-based speckle patterns stamped on participants skin and calculated the resulting stretch patterns on a millimeter scale during a range of natural poses. We observed that skin stretch associated with joint movement extends far beyond the joint itself, with knee flexion inducing stretch on the upper thigh. Large and uniform stretch patterns were found across the trunk, covering considerable portions of the skin. The face exhibited highly complex and non-uniform stretch patterns, potentially contributing to our capacity to control fine facial movements in the absence of traditional proprioceptors. Importantly, all regions demonstrated skin stretch in excess of mechanoreceptive thresholds, suggesting that behaviorally relevant skin stretch can occur anywhere on the body. These signals might provide the brain with valuable information about body state and conformation, potentially supplementing or even surpassing the capabilities of traditional proprioception.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Despite its homology to the well-characterised Type IV pilus, the structure and assembly mechanism of the Tad pilus are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of the protein RcpC from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our analyses reveal that RcpC forms a dodecameric periplasmic complex, anchored to the inner membrane by a transmembrane helix, and interacting with the outer membrane secretin RcpA. We use single-particle Cryo-EM to elucidate the structure of this RcpC dodecamer, and cell-based assays to demonstrate that the RcpC-RcpA complex is essential for Tad-mediated cell-cell aggregation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that RcpC forms the Tad pilus alignment complex, which provides a conduit across the periplasm for the Tad pilus filament to access the extracellular milieu. Our experimental data and structure-based models allow us to propose a mechanism for Tad plus assembly.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Traditional gene-centric methods, which focus on a few hallmark genes like for capsids, miss much of the viral genome, leaving key viral proteins and functions undiscovered. Here, we introduce two powerful annotation-free metrics, V-score and VL-score, designed to quantify the virus-likeness of protein families and genomes and create an open-access searchable database, V-Score-Search. By applying V- and VL-scores to public databases (KEGG, Pfam, and eggNOG), we link 38-77% of protein families with viruses, a 9-16x increase over current estimates. These metrics outperform existing approaches, enabling precise detection of viral genomes, prophages, and host-derived auxiliary viral genes (AVGs) from fragmented sequences, and significantly improving genome binning. Remarkably, we identify up to 17x more AVGs, dominated by non-metabolic proteins of unknown function. This innovation unlocks new insights into virus signatures and host interactions, with wide-ranging implications from genomics to biotechnology.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Leveraging data from the Human Connectome Project, we assess accuracy in reconstructing various functional MRI-based cortical maps using individualised eigenmodes, specifically, across a range of connectome construction parameters. Our results show only minor differences in performance between surface geometric eigenmodes, a local neighborhood graph, a highly smoothed null model, and individual and group-level connectomes at modest smoothing and density levels. Furthermore, our results suggest that spatially smooth eigenmodes best explain functional data. The absence of improvement of individual connectomes and surface geometry over smoothed null models calls for further methodological innovation to better quantify and understand the degree to which brain structure constrains brain function.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

This pathogen can survive at least nine months in its tick vector in an apparent dormant state between blood meals, without losing cell proliferative capability when re-exposed to nutrients. Cultivated B. burgdorferi cells grown to stationary phase or resuspended in nutrient-limited media are often used to study the effects of nutrient deprivation. However, a thorough assessment of the spirochetes ability to recover from nutrient depletion has been lacking. Our study shows that starved B. burgdorferi cultures rapidly lose cell proliferative. Loss of genetic elements essential for cell proliferation contributes to the observed proliferative defect in stationary phase. The gradual decline in copies of genetic elements is not perfectly synchronized between chromosomes and plasmids, generating cells that harbor one or more copies of the essential chromosome but lack all copies of one or more non-essential plasmids. This phenomenon likely contributes to the well-documented issue of plasmid loss during in vitro cultivation of B. burgdorferi. In contrast, B. burgdorferi cells from ticks starved for 14 months showed no evidence of reduced cell proliferative ability or plasmid loss. Beyond their practical implications for studying B. burgdorferi, these findings suggest that the midgut of the tick vector offers a unique environment that supports the maintenance of B. burgdorferi's segmented genome and cell proliferative potential during periods of tick fasting.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Natural Killer (NK) cells play a role in mediating air pollutant effects and regulating vaccine immunity. Objective: This real-world study, conducted on participants in the Pfizer BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine trial, studied the effects of wildfire smoke exposure on long-term vaccine effects. Methods: We collected blood samples from 52 healthy, non-smoking participants (ages 26-83) before and 1 month after placebo or vaccine injections during heavy wildfire smoke events in Sacramento. The study included 28 vaccinated (Group 1) and 24 placebo-injected (Group 2) individuals, the latter vaccinated several months later, outside wildfire season. Blood samples from both Group 1 and 2 were also investigated 6 months after the second dose of vaccine. We analyzed intracellular cytokines, B and NK cell markers by flow cytometry, and serum immunoglobulin levels against common coronaviruses using multiplex assays. Results: A robust S-RBD-specific IgG response observed 1 month post booster, declined variably 6 months later. Wildfire smoke acutely increased IL-13 expression by CD56bright NK cells. IL-13+CD56bright NK cells at the time of vaccination negatively correlated with anti-S-RBD IgG (r=-0.41, p<0.05) one month later. Total IgG levels on the other hand, positively correlated with the air quality index (AQI) measured during vaccination (r=0.96, p<0.01). Similarly to age (but not sex, BMI or race/ethnicity), the two-week AQI averages during vaccination showed a significant negative correlation with anti-S-RBD IgG levels 6 months later (r=-0.41, p<0.05). Conclusion: Wildfire smoke may lead to inappropriate immunoglobulin production and diminished vaccine immunity. Our novel findings highlight a previously unrecognized pathway involving NK-cell derived IL-13 and non-specific B-cell activation and underscore the significance of environmental exposures in shaping immunity.","NA","medrxiv",1730412543013

Ontogeny has therefore become a problematic confounding variable in vertebrate paleontology, especially in study systems distant from extant crown clades, rendering taxonomic hypothesis testing (a fundamental process in evolutionary biology) rife with difficulty. Paleontologists have adopted quantitative methods to compensate for the perception that juvenile specimens lack diagnostic apomorphies seen in their adult conspecifics. Here, I critically evaluate these methods and the assumptions that guide their interpretation using a {micro}CT dataset comprising growth series of American and Chinese alligator. I find that several widespread assumptions are scientifically unjustifiable, and that two popular methods - geometric morphometrics and cladistic analysis of ontogeny - have unacceptably high rates of type II error and present numerous procedural difficulties. However, I also identify a suite of ontogenetically invariant characters that differentiate the living species of Alligator throughout ontogeny. These characters overwhelmingly correspond to anatomical systems that develop prior to (and play a signaling role in) the development of the cranial skeleton itself, suggesting that their ontogenetic invariance is a consequence of the widely conserved vertebrate developmental program. These observations suggest that the architecture of the cranium is fixed early in embryonic development, and that ontogenetic remodeling does not alter the topological relationships of the cranial bones or the soft tissue structures they house. I propose a general model for future taxonomic hypothesis tests in the fossil record, in which the hypothesis that two specimens different ontogenetic stages of a single species can be falsified by the discovery of character differences that cannot be attributed plausibly to ontogenetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

This study conducts a systematic review with meta-analysis of secondary fungal infections (SFIs) associated with COVID-19 considering various significant parameters, such as the frequency of SFIs across the globe, species shift, gender-specific infection rates, the significance of medical history, efficacy of steroid and antifungal, treatment outcomes (mortality rate), and fungal- polymicrobial mortality analysis.

MethodsA literature search was conducted on COVID-19-related fungal infection studies (2020-2024) from SCOPUS and PUBMED databases, excluding preprints. The systematic data extraction captured the PMCID, country, patient demographics (age and gender), clinical outcomes, associated pathogens, medical history, and treatment details.

FindingsThe global meta-analysis of COVID-19-associated SFIs yielded 10,700 cases across 58 countries, exhibiting a significant male predominance (65.6% vs. 34.3% female). Aspergillus spp., Candida spp., and Mucorales spp. emerged as the primary fungal pathogens. The predominant six countries marking 80 % of global cases include India (46.8 %), Italy (10 %), Iran (9.4 %), France (5.1 %), Spain (4.3 %), and Egypt (4.1 %). Complication rates revealed CAM as the most prevalent (59.2%), with a 28% mortality rate. CAC (21.6%) and CAPA (19.1%) had substantially higher mortality rates, at 54% and 58%, respectively. Specific populations were highly affected, including individuals with diabetes were prone to CAM, those undergone catheterization were at increased risk of CAC, and individuals with respiratory diseases or without prior medical history were susceptible to CAPA. In both CAC and CAPA, the species shift towards the non-albicans spp. and non- fumigatus spp., associated with higher mortality. In addition, polymicrobial infection with fungal pathogens (Aspergillus spp., Candida spp., Mucorales spp.) and Multi-bacteria ( K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus) also increased the mortality rate. Effective treatments were identified, including combining caspofungin with corticosteroids for CAC, voriconazole with dexamethasone for CAPA, and AmBisome monotherapy for CAM.

InterpretationIn SFIs populations, CAM prevailed in high-density areas with relatively lower mortality rates, whereas CAC and CAPA exhibited higher mortality rates. Notably, polymicrobial infections significantly increased mortality across all SFIs. Underlying medical conditions primarily influenced the type of fungal pathogen, but treatment outcomes varied. Azole drugs and Amphotericin-B were ineffective against Candidiasis, except for caspofungins limited susceptibility. Voriconazole and AmBisome demonstrated efficacy against Aspergillosis and Mucormycosis, respectively. Additionally, steroid administration proved life-saving in CAPA and CAC cases, yet remained ineffective in CAM.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSFive years after the COVID-19 pandemic, a plethora of research has investigated SFIs associated with COVID-19, with a major focus on pathogenicity, immunomodulation, and the impact of steroids and tocilizumab. However, a critical knowledge gap persists that addresses meta-analysis on the frequency of SFIs by country, gender-specific infection rates, the significance of medical history, species shift within the fungal kingdom, its virulence expression, polymicrobial infection dynamics, synergistic effects of steroids and antifungals in this context remains understudied. To address these gaps, the meta-analysis comprehensively examines these critical aspects, shedding light on various aspects of SFIs.

Added value of this studyThe systematic meta-analysis of COVID-19-associated SFIs revealed the emergence of non-candida spp. and non-fumigatus spp. Polymicrobial infection has been linked to alarming outcomes resulting in a 100% mortality rate.Similarly, the co- infection of C. albicans with non-albicans spp. A. fumigatus with non-fumigatus spp. increased the mortality rate to 100%. For other species-related, effective therapies such as the combination of caspofungin and corticosteroids against Candidiasis (CAC), voriconazole and dexamethasone (CAPA), and AmBisome monotherapy (CAM) to combat SFIs.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe geographic distribution of fungal pathogens varies globally, with differing mortality rates. Deciphering their genomic characteristics will unveil insights into behaviour, transmission, and virulence, enabling targeted diagnostics, treatments, and prevention strategies.

MethodologyO_ST_ABSData collectionC_ST_ABSThe peer-reviewed published case studies, multicentric studies, retrospective studies, single-center studies and cohort studies represented with individuals case files were collected using search keywords ""COVID-19 and Aspergillus"", COVID-19 and Candida"", COVID-19 and Mucorales"", ""COVID Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis"", ""COVID Associated Mucormycosis"", COVID Associated Candidiasis"", in SCOPUS and PUBMED databases. Based on the search results, the articles from Aug 2020 to May 2024 were filtered excluding the preprint articles. A total of 1981 articles that included duplicates, articles unrelated to the study as well without abstracts were eliminated. A systematic review yielded 663 eligible publications, which were subjected to independent individual case meta- analysis. The distribution included 154 studies on CAC, 240 on CAPA, and 269 on CAM (Figure 1). From each article, the details of PMCID, country, age, gender, treatment outcome (live/dead), pathogens, medical history, and usage of steroids, antibacterial & antifungal were systematically collected. For the global surveillance of COVID-19-associated SFIs, the information from review, cohort, and retrospective studies was included.

The meta-analysis surveillance was conducted considering various significant parameters, such as frequency of SFIs across the globe, species shift, gender-specific infection rates, the significance of medical history, efficacy of steroid and antifungal, treatment outcomes (mortality rate), and fungal- polymicrobial mortality analysis. For the statistical analysis, Jamovi v2.6.2 tool and other tools were used as given below.

The proportional meta-analysis was studied using a random effects model to quantify the distribution of SFIs attributed to Mucorales spp., Candida spp., and Aspergillus spp., across the countries. The analysis was considered with a 95% confidence interval (Cl). The analysis also evaluated the overall effect size and sample heterogeneity as indicated by the I{superscript 2} statistic. To investigate the frequency distribution of individual species within SFI, a ClinicoPath table one was employed. This statistical approach enabled the examination of the frequency range of specific species in respective SFIs. To estimate the mortality rates, a two-outcome proportion test was conducted, providing proportion values accompanied by 95 % CI. This study calculated the overall respective SFIs ( CAM , CAPA, and CAM) as well as for specific species. For instance, the mortality rate of A. fumigatus in CAPA was determined providing insight into species-specific outcomes, which enabled a detailed understanding of mortality rates across the various SFIs and their respective causative pathogens. A survival analysis was conducted to explore the interplay between gender, age, and species-specific conditions. The Long-rank, Gehan, and Tarone-Ware tests assessed differences in survival patterns. The analysis also estimated median age at risk for each species-specific condition, by gender, using cumulative hazard functions and 95% CI. A binomial logistic regression model was employed to assess the risk of treatment outcomes with species-specific pathogens. The model calculated the probability of successful treatment outcome, accompanied by standard errors (SE) and Z-scores. These metrics enabled the evaluation of the likelihood of treatment success or failure in correlation with specific pathogens. To provide the optimal treatment strategy, a Crosstable for dependent outcome analysis was performed to predict mortality rates for the treatment outcome. This final step enabled the identification of the most effective treatment approach by examining the intersection of treatment options and mortality rates, providing actionable insights for clinicians to make data-driven decisions for the management of SFIs.","NA","medrxiv",1730412543013

Importantly, we keep full proteins or domains intact, maintaining catalytic cores and surfaces for protein-protein interactions. We observe more than 5800 significant hits that modulate transcription, we demonstrate cell type specific transcriptional modulation, and we further investigate epistatic relationships between our effector combinations. We validate unexpected combinations as synergistic or buffering, emphasizing COMET as both a method for transcriptional effector discovery, and as a functional genomics tool for identifying novel domain interactions and directing locus-specific biochemistry.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Methodological disparities in quantifying and mapping 6mA in genomic DNA have fueled this controversy. Yet, the distantly related early branching fungi, ciliates and the algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibit robust 6mA methylation patterns, but the origin and evolution of 6mA remain unknown. Here we use Oxford Nanopore modified base calling to profile 6mA at base pair resolution in 18 unicellular eukaryotes spanning all major eukaryotic supergroups. Our results reveal that only species encoding the adenine methyltransferase AMT1 display robust genomic 6mA patterns. Notably, 6mA consistently accumulates downstream of transcriptional start sites, aligning with H3K4me3-enriched nucleosomes, suggesting a conserved role in placing transcriptionally permissive nucleosomes. Intriguingly, the recurrent loss of the 6mA pathway across eukaryotes, particularly in major multicellular lineages, implies a convergent alteration in the dual methylation system of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, which featured transcription-associated 6mA and repression-associated 5mC.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Two subtypes of ISCs exist, and both - and {beta}-ISCs regulate pH- and ion-homeostasis in epithelia. Gain and loss of FOXI1 function are associated with human diseases, including Pendred syndrome, male infertility, renal acidosis and cancers. Foxi1 functions were predominantly studied in the context of ISC specification, however, reports indicate additional functions in early and ectodermal development. Here, we re-investigated the functions of Foxi1 in Xenopus laevis embryonic mucociliary epidermis development and found a novel function for Foxi1 in the generation of Notch-ligand expressing mucociliary multipotent progenitors (MPPs). We demonstrate that Foxi1 has multiple concentration-dependent functions: At low levels, Foxi1 confers ectodermal competence through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms, while at high levels, Foxi1 induces a multi-step process of ISC specification and differentiation. We further describe how foxi1 expression is affected through auto- and Notch-regulation, how Ubp1 and Dmrt2 regulate ISC subtype differentiation, and how this developmental program affects Notch signaling as well as mucociliary patterning. Together, we reveal novel functions for Foxi1 in Xenopus mucociliary epidermis formation, relevant to our understanding of vertebrate development and human disease.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Tools such as standardized cognitive tests and symptom inventories have played a crucial role in informing neuroimaging studies, helping to uncover the underlying brain systems associated with these measures. Substantial strides have been taken in developing models, such as connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), that establish connections between external measures and the human connectome, offering insights into how the functional organization of the brain varies in relation to scores on external measures2-8.

Here, we depart from the conventional feed-forward approach and introduce a feed-back approach that allows testing of the tests. Since the inception of cognitive psychology over 60 years ago9,10, cognitive tests have been meticulously developed to measure specific components of cognition. These tests, which have undergone extensive validation11-16 and have been standardized and administered to millions, operate on explicit assumptions about the cognitive components they assess. Rather than using external tests to identify the circuits supporting test scores, we a priori define networks of interest and quantify the extent to which these circuits support the test measure. To demonstrate this, we define functional connectivity networks for six cognitive constructs and quantify their contribution to performance across a spectrum of standardized cognitive tests and clinical measures. Employing robust machine learning in a predictive modeling framework, we show how this approach can be used to select tests according to the networks they rely upon. This establishes a biologically grounded metric for test comparison.

This approach also yields a brain-driven process for forming composite tests by selecting test combinations that depend on the same proportional brain systems, or for a single network of interest, combining tests with the highest predictive power for that network. This brain-driven approach results in more robust behavioral assessments and enhanced predictive power for the network of interest. We illustrate how this methodology can be applied to evaluate the inclusion of specific sub-tests within a composite score, revealing instances where composite scores are reinforced or weakened by subtest inclusion in terms of the specificity of the brain network they interrogate.

The brain-test score modeling approach presented here provides a biologically driven approach to the selection of external cognitive and symptom measures directed at specific brain systems. It opens new avenues of research by providing a framework for the development of new tests and measures guided by quantitative brain metrics.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Here, we determined electron cryo-microscopy structures of CpaF in three distinct conformations and nucleotide occupancies. Packing unit analyses revealed differences in nucleotide coordination in the active sites, as well as synchronized domain movements during the catalytic cycle. Alphafold3 modeling demonstrated that CpaF and other motors within the type IV filament superfamily use a similar binding interface to engage their respective platform proteins.

Predicting the effect of up or down gene regulation or drug treatment on the gene expression profile of a cell can open avenues in understanding biological mechanisms and potentially treating disease. Most foundation models for single-cell biology learn from scRNA-seq counts, using experimental data as a modality to generate gene representations. Similarly, the scientific literature holds a plethora of information that can be used in generating gene representations using a different modality - language - as the basis. In this work, we study the effect of using both language and experimental data in modeling genes for perturbation prediction. We show that textual representations of genes provide additive and complementary value to gene representations learned from experimental data alone in predicting perturbation outcomes for single-cell data. We find that textual representations alone are not as powerful as biologically learned gene representations, but can serve as useful prior information. We show that different types of scientific knowledge represented as language induce different types of prior knowledge. For example, in the datasets we study, subcellular location helps the most for predicting the effect of single-gene perturbations, and protein information helps the most for modeling perturbation effects of interactions of combinations of genes. We validate our findings by extending the popular scGPT model, a foundation model trained on scRNA-seq counts, to incorporate language embeddings at the gene level. We start with NCBI gene card and UniProt protein summaries from the genePT approach and add gene function annotations from the Gene Ontology (GO). We name our model ""scGenePT"", representing the combination of ideas from these two models. Our work sheds light on the value of integrating multiple sources of knowledge in modeling single-cell data, highlighting the effect of language in enhancing biological representations learned from experimental data.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

This process is thought to be mediated by neurons organized as attractor networks1,2. However, whether attractor dynamics underlie decision behavior and the complex neuronal responses remains unclear. Here we use an unsupervised, deep learning-based method to discover decision-related dynamics from the simultaneous activity of neurons in frontal cortex and striatum of rats while they accumulate pulsatile auditory evidence. We found that trajectories evolved along two sequential regimes, the first dominated by sensory inputs, and the second dominated by the autonomous dynamics, with flow in a direction (i.e., ""neural mode"") largely orthogonal to that in the first regime. We propose that the second regime corresponds to decision commitment. We developed a simplified model that approximates the coupled transition in dynamics and neural mode and allows precise inference, from each trials neural activity, of a putative internal decision commitment time in that trial. The simplified model captures diverse and complex single-neuron temporal profiles, such as ramping and stepping3-5. It also captures trial-averaged curved trajectories6-8, and reveals distinctions between brain regions. The putative neurally-inferred commitment times (""nTc"") occurred at times broadly distributed across trials, and not time-locked to stimulus onset, offset, or response onset. Nevertheless, when trials were aligned to nTc, behavioral analysis showed that, as predicted by a decision commitment time, sensory evidence before nTc affected the subjects decision, but evidence after nTc did not. Our results show that the formation of a perceptual choice involves a rapid, coordinated transition in both the dynamical regime and the neural mode of the decision process, and suggest the moment of commitment to be a useful entry point for dissecting mechanisms underlying rapid changes in internal state.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

Importantly, maintenance of liver ATP levels and within-meal food intake inhibition is impaired in human subjects with obesity and obese pre-clinical models. We demonstrate that decreased hepatic mitochondrial energy metabolism in liver-specific, heterozygous PGC1a mice results in reduced mitochondrial response to changes in {Delta}GATP and tissue ATP following fasting. These impairments in liver energy state are associated with larger and longer meals during chow feeding, impaired dose-dependent food intake inhibition in response to mixed and individual nutrient oral pre-loads, and greater acute fasting-induced food intake. These data support previous work proposing liver-mediated food intake regulation through modulation of peripheral sanitation signals.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

We investigate the role of four major cortical interneuron classes in a competitive-cooperative computational primitive and validate these circuit motifs implemented soft winner-take-all (sWTA) computation for gain modulation, signal restoration, and context-dependent multistability. Using a novel parameter mapping technique, we configured IBMs TrueNorth (TN) chip to implement sWTA computations, mirroring biological neural dynamics. Retrospectively, we observed a strong correspondence between the biophysical model and the TN hardware parameters, particularly in the roles of four key inhibitory neuron classes: Parvalbumin (feedforward inhibition), Somatostatin (feedback inhibition), VIP (disinhibition), and LAMP5 (gain normalization). Moreover, the sparse coupling of this sWTA motif was also able to simulate a two-state neural state machine on the TN chip, replicating working memory dynamics essential for cognitive tasks. Additionally, integrating the sWTA computation as a preprocessing layer in the Vision Transformer (ViT) enhanced its performance on the MNIST digit classification task, demonstrating improved generalization to previously unseen data and suggesting a mechanism akin to zero-shot learning.

Introduced mammal species often use anthropogenic features in their environment and demonstrate a higher tolerance of human disturbance, but their importance remains understudied in ectotherms.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to verify the association between SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of Stroke, based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, in order to assess the inclusion of the virus as a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases.

MethodsA metaumbrella was conducted, which included 34 systematic reviews, of which 4 were selected for the final analysis based on methodological quality and consistency. The analysis aggregated the results of 70 primary studies, considering different stroke subtypes and outcomes associated with COVID-19. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} index, and significance bias was verified using Eggers test.

ResultsThe analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 is significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 1.55 - 3.95), particularly for ischemic stroke (eOR = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.80) and hemorrhagic stroke (eOR = 3.86; 95%CI: 1.79 - 8.33). Additionally, patients with cerebrovascular comorbidities had higher mortality (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 2.48 - 19.63), as did those who had previously suffered a stroke (eOR = 6.08; 95%CI: 3.73 - 9.91).

ConclusionThe association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke was consistent and significant, suggesting that COVID-19 should be considered a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. However, the high heterogeneity among the studies analyzed reinforces the need for further research to consolidate this relationship.","NA","medrxiv",1730412543013

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1730412543013

The results indicate that Omicron BA.1.1 and its pure reverse mutants were widely distributed throughout the United States from the early days of their emergence, showing a statistically significant difference compared to other major variants, which spread from a small number of sources. The peak emergence of BA.1.1 and BA.1.1.18 pure reverse mutants occurred a few weeks before the peak of all collected samples, whereas the peak of pure reverse mutants in major BA.1 variants and BA.2 coincides with the overall sampling peak. Although the peaks of BA.1.x collections are not all synchronous, the peaks of pure reverse mutants in the BA.1 lineage completely overlap, with the number of such mutants declining abruptly after the peak. These regional and temporal anomalies in the Omicron BA.1 lineage, especially in the BA.1.1 lineage, are virtually impossible to explain by current theories of natural mutation and spread by human-to-human infection.","NA","medrxiv",1730412543013
