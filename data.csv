In the vertebrate spinal cord, progenitors are patterned into molecularly defined domains, but how lineage relationships shape neuronal diversity and function has remained unclear. Here, we combine genomic barcoding with single-cell RNA sequencing in chick and human embryos to generate cell-type-resolved clonal maps. We find that spinal neurogenesis follows a hierarchical organisation in which the neural tube first partitions into five broad subdivisions that resolve into the eleven progenitor domains generating the cardinal neuronal classes. This bifurcating architecture implies a patterning mechanism of sequential binary decisions. The most prominent lineage restriction occurs at the embryonic alar-basal boundary, separating sensory-processing from motor-control circuits. Individual progenitors generate neurons across multiple temporal waves while remaining constrained within their lineage subdivision, demonstrating persistence of spatial identity despite temporal competence changes. Among sensory populations, we identify two developmental routes, via unifated or bifated progenitors, to pain- and itch-processing interneurons. These principles are conserved between chick and human, with clonal analysis in human embryos revealing that most fate choices are resolved by six weeks post-conception. Together, these findings provide a framework for spinal cord development and reveal lineage compartmentalisation as a fundamental principle in neural circuit assembly and evolution.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC001051),;""},{""name"":""Wellcome"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC001051;220379/D/20/Z;218670/Z/19/Z;215116/Z/18/Z;""},{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC001051;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""742138;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""792-2021;""},{""name"":""UKRI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X031225/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Acute stress is known to impact the hippocampus but may have opposite effects on these competing functions. That is, although stress impairs episodic encoding, it may instead enhance statistical learning. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested how stress influences the hippocampal pathways and subfields that support episodic encoding and statistical learning while participants performed a task that engaged both processes. Across several analyses, stress biased hippocampal processing in favour of statistical learning, suppressing pattern separation between events in the dentate gyrus and enhancing the representation of statistically predictive features. Furthermore, stress drove the hippocampal monosynaptic pathway to support statistical learning rather than episodic encoding during predictive situations. Together, these data suggest that acute stress elicits targeted, adaptive changes in hippocampal pathways which may facilitate predicting and responding to upcoming events.","[{""name"":""NIMH"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R21MH128740;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Using an unbiased proteomic approach, we here identified the bridge-like lipid transport protein VPS13C/PARK23 as a key component of a global early response pathway to lysosome damage. VPS13C readily binds lysosomes under mechanical or osmotic tension in anticipation of membrane lesions. The latter trigger a conformational change in the protein's C-terminus, involving its ATG2C domain acting as sensor of damage-induced lipid packing defects. We show that ER-lysosome contacts formed by VPS13C provide critical binding platforms for OSBP/ORPs to enable efficient ER wrapping of damaged lysosomes. A chemical approach to assess directional ER-to-lysosome lipid transport revealed that VPS13C is essential for large-scale lipid delivery to acutely damaged lysosomes to facilitate their repair. Our findings offer new mechanistic insights into how loss-of-function mutations in VPS13C may enhance the risk of Parkinson's disease.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""512783018;467522186/SFB1557–P9;467522186/SFB1557–P6;467522186/SFB1557–Z1;467522186/SFB1557–Z2;""},{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04txyc737"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF17OC0029432;""},{""name"":""German Academic Exchange Service"",""id"":""https://ror.org/039djdh30"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""57552340;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Here, we find that the promoter-proximal region is critical for cell-type specific enhancer-promoter compatibility. Using high-throughput genome-engineering in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), we systematically replace the endogenous Sox9 promoter with different libraries of core and extended (i.e. full) promoters and assess their response to long-range regulatory elements in mESCs and neural progenitor cells. We find that only a subset of full promoters is activated by distal neuronal enhancers and that the promoter-proximal region is necessary for this enhancer-promoter compatibility. Core promoters alone are insufficient to respond to distal enhancers but modulate the transcriptional output of responsive promoters. Our results suggest that within multipartite regulatory domains, the promoter-proximal region fulfills a facilitator-like function that filters and transmits signal from distal enhancers, ultimaltely conferring enhancer-promoter compatibility.","[{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101076709;101125530;813327;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IB 139/6-1;KR 5247/1-1;KR 5247/1-2;KR 5247/1-3;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Here, we present a second high-quality Denisovan genome, reconstructed from a molar found at Denisova Cave. It belonged to a man who lived [~]200,000 years ago in a small Denisovan group. This group mixed with early Neandertals and was then replaced by Denisovans who had mixed with later Neandertals. We show that in addition Denisovans received gene flow from hominins that diverged before the split of the ancestors of Denisovans and modern humans. The two Denisovan genomes allow us to disentangle Denisovan ancestry in present-day humans revealing contributions from at least three distinct Denisovan groups. In particular, Oceanians and South Asians independently inherited DNA from a deeply diverged Denisovan population which was likely isolated in South Asia. This supports an early migration of the ancestors of Oceanians through South Asia followed by the later arrival of the ancestors of present-day South Asians. East Asians do not share this Denisovan component in their genomes, suggesting that their ancestors arrived independently, perhaps by a northerly route. Finally, the two high-quality Denisovan genomes allow us to refine the catalogue of genetic changes that arose on the Denisovan lineage, some of which were contributed to present-day humans.","[{""name"":""Max Planck Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01hhn8329"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""694707;""},{""name"":""Russian Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03y2gwe85"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""24-18-00069;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Quantitative binding assays define a minimal CTNIP4 region required for high-affinity HSL3 interaction and signaling activation. A 2.12 [A] crystal structure of the HSL3-CTNIP4 complex reveals a unique C-terminal receptor pocket that accommodates the cyclic architecture of the peptide through a combination of hydrophobic and polar contacts, a feature absent in the closely related HAE/HSL LRR-RKs. The cyclic CTNIP4 fold further establishes a largely hydrophobic interface that bridges HSL3 to the SERK co-receptor, forming a distinct activation surface. Together, these structural, biochemical and physiological insights uncover a previously unrecognised mechanism of peptide perception and receptor activation, highlighting how subtle architectural variations enable precise ligand selectivity among highly conserved plant receptor kinases.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_204526;10001549;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 1061-2023;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""773153;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

However, sampling root exudates and rhizosphere soil remains challenging due to low throughput and the destructive nature of the process. We used the staple crop barley [Hordeum vulgare] as a model to benchmark different sampling approaches for simultaneous exudation and microbiota profiling of soil-grown plants. Exudate profiles and total dissolved organic carbon exudation rates were consistent across different sampling approaches, whereas root biomass, root morphology measurements, and organic nitrogen exudation varied. High-throughput amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of phylogenetic markers and nitrogen cycle-selected genes revealed a protocol-specific footprint in the composition and abundance of rhizosphere bacterial and fungal microbiota. Yet, on average, 75% of microbes enriched in, and differentiating between, barley rhizosphere and unplanted soil controls were recovered across all the sampling approaches evaluated. Our results demonstrated that, under the tested conditions, different sampling approaches produced comparable microbiota and exudation patterns, enabling the integrated study of root exudation and microbial profiles from the same plant.

While traditionally thought to consist of a uniform set of proteins, here we discover that ribosome composition is reprogrammed to adapt to intrinsic and external cellular perturbations. During infection by non-segmented negative-sense viruses, viral entry into cells recruits the large ribosomal subunit protein rpL40 to a noncanonical site on the small subunit of 80S ribosomes near the mRNA entry site. These specialized ribosomes preferentially bind viral mRNAs to drive enhanced viral protein synthesis that is critical for replication under host pressures. Unexpectedly, we find that viruses have co-opted this translation pathway from a previously unrecognized endogenous ribosome remodeling program in which metabolic stress alters ribosome structure to promote mRNA translation required for cell survival. Thus, ribosome remodeling is a conserved mechanism enabling dynamic protein synthesis across pathogen and cellular adaptation.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1S10OD036228-01;GM067945;GM007122;1R35GM142527;""},{""name"":""Pew Charitable Trusts"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02xhk2825"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""G.

It is an exemplar condition for evaluating penetrance in adult cohorts due to its relatively low mortality, variable expressivity and link to several large genes. Using genome sequencing data from [~]500,000 adults in UK Biobank, we curated a set of rare pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in COL1A1, COL1A2 and IFITM5 using annotations from gnomAD, ClinVar and SpliceAI. Analysis of summed read-count data from genome and exome sequencing led to exclusion of 16 mosaic variants with consistently low allelic balance of 3.4-35.9%. We identified 61 likely constitutive heterozygous pathogenic variants in COL1A1 and COL1A2 (29 loss-of-function or splice variants and 32 missense) in 115 participants, with a mean age at recruitment of 55.1 years; no pathogenic variants were identified in IFITM5. Phenotypes were assessed using ICD-10 codes, self-reports and heel bone mineral density. Overall disease penetrance was lower than anticipated: 40.7% for COL1A1 and 21.3% for COL1A2, potentially due to depletion of severe early-onset disease. When considering only truncating variants in COL1A1, disease penetrance increased to 73.1%, and 90% of individuals had reduced levels of circulating COL1A1 protein. For COL1A2, bone mineral density data supported the low penetrance, whereas for COL1A1, data suggested the possibility of a subclinical phenotype. Overall, for pathogenic missense variants (including those altering Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats), the low penetrance observed suggests reliance on current ClinVar assertions to support pathogenicity may overstate OI risk in population screening.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1761516552418

Specifically, enhancing the homing of monocyte-derived macrophages to the affected brain has been shown to reduce local inflammation, decrease proteinopathy, rescue neurons, and mitigate cognitive decline. However, the factors limiting their spontaneous recruitment remain unclear. Using multi-omics techniques, we identified impaired myelopoiesis and monocyte development in both mice and AD patients. While not the primary cause of the disease, this impairment is associated with disease progression. In the 5xFAD mouse model, monocyte differentiation was found to be disrupted due to a maladaptive bone marrow (BM) response, driven by type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling. A similar phenotype was found in circulating monocytes from AD patients compared to healthy controls. Blocking IFN-I with monoclonal antibodies or using chimeric AD mice with BM from mice lacking the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR1) alleviated myelopoiesis dysfunction, normalized monocyte phenotypes, and reduced cognitive impairment. These improvements in myeloid function were accompanied by an increased homing of monocyte-derived macrophages in the AD brain. Our results reveal an unexpected dysfunction in BM myelopoiesis in the context of neurodegeneration and support the emerging concept that neurodegenerative diseases are not solely brain-centric.","[{""name"":""Advanced European Research Council"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""7417;""},{""name"":""Israel Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04sazxf24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""991/16;""},{""name"":""ISF Legacy Heritage Bio-Medical Science Partnership"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1354/15;""},{""name"":""Thompson Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fundación Ramón Areces"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

There is robust evidence on the role of right-hemisphere frontoparietal dysfunction, interhemispheric structural disconnection and maladaptive activity in the left hemisphere in the persistence of neglect. However, the specific impact of right frontoparietal dysfunction on the functional (re)organization of the left hemisphere remains poorly understood. In this study, we introduce a novel application of functional connectivity gradient analysis to investigate macroscale functional reorganization in the non-lesioned left hemisphere of patients with chronic left spatial neglect. Focusing on resting-state fMRI data, we demonstrate that abnormal segregation patterns in the left frontoparietal and default mode networks are robustly associated with neglect severity and spatial attentional bias. Notably, the principal gradient--typically capturing a global unimodal-to-transmodal hierarchy--was altered in these patients, suggesting a reorganization favoring lateralized unimodal networks. We also show that the structural integrity of the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) plays a key role in shaping these functional dynamics. These findings reveal a previously overlooked aspect of neglect pathophysiology: the maladaptive dominance of the non-lesioned hemispheres intrinsic architecture. By combining innovative gradient-based metrics with classical lesion approaches, our study offers a new framework for understanding neglect as an emergent property of large-scale network imbalance, with clinical implications for diagnosis and intervention, and theoretical consequences for models of hemispheric asymmetries and conscious access.

Highlights[bullet] Functional connectivity gradients uncover altered segregation in the non-lesioned left hemisphere of patients with chronic spatial neglect.
[bullet]Left lateral prefrontal cortex is linked to persistent rightward attentional bias in neglect.
[bullet]Structural integrity of the left IFOF underpins functional reorganization in spared networks.

We propose a Bayesian approach to the estimation of atomic scattering factors which incorporates the effect of the molecular environment while remaining fast, interpretable and transferable between molecules. Our algorithm infers atomic scattering factors directly from maps of the electrostatic potential determined by cryo-EM single particle analysis, bypassing the need for computationally-intensive theoretical calculations. The algorithm is used to infer empirical scattering factors from high-resolution reconstructions of catalase enzymes. To illustrate its broad applicability, the algorithm is also applied to a training set of publicly-available cryo-EM data. The empirical scattering factors show improved agreement with a test set of cryo-EM reconstructions. The predictions are further validated by comparison with magnetic susceptibility values of organic compounds, as well as by application to the refinement of atomic models.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MC_UP_A025_1012;MC_UP_120117;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

NM2 function is tightly regulated by a structural transition between an autoinhibited monomeric (10S) conformation in which ATPase activity, actin binding, and filament assembly are coordinately suppressed and an enzymatically active, filamentous conformation. The autoinhibited conformation is critical for the spatial and temporal control of contractility in nonmuscle cells, yet structural insights into the 10S conformation remain largely elusive. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of full-length human NM2B in the 10S conformation at ~5.24 angstrom resolution. The structure reveals a tri-segmented tail fold that introduces asymmetric interactions between both myosin heavy chains and associated light chains and the sequestration of key interfaces required for actin binding and filament assembly. These structural insights provide a mechanistic foundation for understanding how regulatory post-translational modifications and disease-associated mutations shift NM2 conformational equilibria and may enable the development of structure-based interventions for cytoskeletal diseases including hearing loss, neurodegeneration, and cancer.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM143539;R01GM143414;HL001786;R01HL181868;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

The ability to selectively identify and study these states is crucial for under-standing the dynamic nature of proteins and their roles in cellular processes, yet can be currently limited by the artefacts of existing molecular labels and the lack of strategies to exploit them in diverse ways. Whilst i) methods for the photochemical perturbation of pro-teins and ii) photophysical protein probes and sensors are both known powerful tools, simultaneous methods for site- and context-specific photochemical modification of a protein side chain with concomitant modulation of photophysical properties would allow interrogation of protein function via diverse modes (potentially reporting simultaneously on structure and dynamics of ground- and reactive- state properties). Due to their mechanistic complexity, rational approaches for the design of suitable photochemical strategies can be difficult and non-intuitive. Here, we describe a high-throughput experimentation (HTE) strategy designed to allow the photochemical modification of a genetically-encoded, minimally disruptive ('zero-size'), photophysically-active - yet typically unreac-tive and biologically-inert - unnatural amino acid (uAA) residue in proteins. The discovery of a novel dearomative, formal [4+3] photocycloaddition of imidazopyrimidine reagents which proceeds via photochemically generated carbon-centred radical intermediates with polyaromatic substrates enabled chemoselective application to the normally unreactive Trp-mimetic residue, 2-naphthylalanine (Npa). Npa's site-selective installation allows dual photo-chemical and photophysical dearomative perturbation benignly and efficiently in proteins. Replacement of Trp in the archetypal apoptotic biosensor protein Annexin A5 (AnxV) enabled dual photochemical-photophysical determination of switched, conforma-tionally-determined reactive states induced by Ca2+-binding, without any apparent functional perturbation of its in vitro or cellular recognition of phospholipids, indicating an ordered annexin mechanism. This ready and benign unification of photochemistry and photophysics suggests a general approach for using high-throughput light-mediated experimentation in artefact-free chemical biology to capture different functional states of proteins and to interrogate those states using combined photochemical-photophysical methods.","[{""name"":""UKRI-EPSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/V011359/1, EP/V011367/1, EP/T012021/1, EP/X527245/1, EP/W002914/1, EP/N025652/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

In 21 healthy adults, resting-state EEG data was collected before and after placebo or diazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of type A {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors. The shape of individual cycles in the alpha band was then derived using empirical mode decomposition, followed by extraction of principal components (PCs) describing specific facets of alpha shape. Results of this approach show that all shape features were unchanged following placebo. In contrast, diazepam was associated with complex changes in several shape features, including peak-trough shape and edge speed. While changes in shape were apparent in all cortical lobes, the strongest alterations were specific to sensorimotor and parietal cortices. Taken together, our results support the neurophysiological utility of waveform shape, particularly with respect to non-invasive human recordings.

Butyrate, a gut microbial metabolite, has been found to be reduced in AD patients; butyrate supplementation improved cognition and decreased amyloid burden in animal models. However, the precise underlying mechanisms are unclear. Our previous studies have demonstrated that insulin signaling impacts A transport kinetics at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we investigated the effect of butyrate treatment on intra-endothelial A accumulation and BBB integrity by modulating the insulin signaling pathway. The effect of butyrate on A accumulation was assessed by flow cytometry in BBB cell culture models. Insulin signaling activation and the expression of various receptors and transporters at the BBB were evaluated by Western blots and confocal microscopy. The roles of various molecular mediators were confirmed using specific inhibitors (MK2206, Trametinib, Rapamycin, VX-745). The effect of butyrate on the expression of BBB receptors and transporters that play a critical role in A trafficking was examined in mouse brains colonized with butyrate-producing bacteria via immunohistochemistry. Butyrate significantly decreased A{beta}42 accumulation in endothelial cells. This effect was associated with insulin signaling pathway activation, particularly AKT and ERK phosphorylation. Inhibitor studies established the critical role of these specific arms, as co-incubation with MK2206 (AKT inhibitor) or Trametinib (ERK inhibitor) reversed the protective effect of butyrate and increased A{beta}42 accumulation. However, mTOR and p38 inhibitors did not show a similar effect. In addition, butyrate restored P-glycoprotein efflux transporter expression and claudin-5 tight junction protein levels that were reduced with A{beta} treatment. These effects were supported by in vivo work, which demonstrated the upregulation of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2). This protein is associated with AKT activation and extracellular matrix stabilization in mice colonized with butyrate-producing bacteria. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that butyrate decreases A{beta}42 uptake at the BBB endothelium by activating the AKT and ERK arms of the insulin signaling pathway. These changes may also improve the integrity of BBB tight junctions by increasing claudin-5 expression and extracellular matrix, and by upregulating TIMP-2 expression. This study highlights butyrate's potential as a therapeutic modulator of AD-related BBB dysfunction.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Several morphological types are differentially distributed between the functionally distinct anterior and posterior insula, providing the substrates for a quantitative demarcation between the anterior and posterior insular subregions.

Here, we report that Actinomyces procaprae Csm6 (ApCsm6) selectively employs cA5 as its activator.

Cryo-EM structures of ApCsm6 and its complexes with cA5 and cA6 reveal a homotetrameric assembly, where each monomer binds a single cOA within a composite pocket formed by two tandem CARF-HEPN domains.

Here, to fill this gap we focus on model systems made of oligonucleotides with tuned lengths and degree of hybridization, mixed with a moderately charged, disordered peptide. Combining multiple length scales through experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we unravel the distinct effect of the properties of NAs on the phase behavior and we propose a metric for the stability of biocondensates. We also characterize the conditions for the onset of liquid crystalline order in the droplets and we show that it is associated with a dramatic slowing down of the dynamics of oligonucleotides, while peptides retain high mobility. Our results can be generalized to natural and non-natural NAs of arbitrary structure, providing a guide for the design of synthetic NA-containing coacervates.","[{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CN3 Spoke 7 - National Center for Gene Therapy and Drugs based on RNA Technology;""},{""name"":""4EU+"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SEED4EU+ RECHARGE;""},{""name"":""Cineca"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02f013h18"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""HP10CS3JKT;HP10C5KO39;""},{""name"":""Università degli studi di Padova"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CAPRI initiative Infrastructure Grant 2017;""},{""name"":""Ministero dell'Università e della Ricerca"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Department of Excellence Project SCALE UP;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Despite correlations between thermal performance traits having been reported in the literature for a few taxa and performance tasks, such as population growth rate, a comprehensive global analysis of the entire tree of life and multiple performance tasks remains an open challenge. To advance in this open question, we compile a database of 1,300 thermal response curves, encompassing 38 variable types related to individuals' performance (including per capita population growth rate, photosynthetic rate, among others) and 1,125 different species, ranging from viruses to mammals, encompassing all major lineages of the tree of life. Our analysis reveals that among all possible relationships between traits and optimal performance, four traits form a line with a high goodness-of-fit, while the remaining traits exhibit a polygonal pattern, either a triangle or a tetrahedron. We derive a thermodynamic framework that explains the relationships described by a curve or line (as opposed to a surface or polygon), highlighting the linear relationship between maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as between maximum and optimum temperatures. We also discuss other generic trait evolution models, which could account for the other significant sublinear relationships, as well as the more general model, Pareto optimality theory, which could account for relationships in the form of lines or polygons. Our theoretical framework and empirical evidence suggest that, based on a single data point (e.g., minimum temperature), all critical temperature limits and maximum performance boundaries can be predicted using the estimated parameter from this study. Our results reveal universal scaling relationships in thermal performance, which could be useful for predicting changes in performance under scenarios of climate warming.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

We mapped editing outcomes in human CD34 hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), mouse LSK HSPC equivalents, human upper airway organoids, and mouse multi-organ in vivo editing. Profiling 500,000 alleles across 74 cell types, scOUT-seq revealed that outcomes in most cell subtypes differ markedly from the bulk average. Various cell types shifted major repair classes, preferred different molecular sequences, and even enriched large structural variants, with distinctive patterns of allelic co-occurrence.

Although macrophages are important for controlling GAS infection, we and others have demonstrated that GAS can persist in macrophages by perforating the phagolysosome using the pore-forming toxin streptolysin O (SLO). In this study, we examined how phagosomal perforation releases lysosomal and bacterial proteins into the cytosol and alters cytosolic protein content in the macrophage. Using IL-1{beta} as a measure of intracellular pathogen detection, we confirmed that cytosolic preparations from macrophages infected with either wild-type (WT) or SLO-deficient ({Delta}SLO) bacteria contained new proteins that are absent in uninfected cytosol controls. Proteomic analysis revealed distinct cytosolic protein profiles in both WT- and {Delta}SLO-infected macrophages. M1 protein was detected only in the cytosol of WT-infected macrophages and corresponded with the IL-1{beta} response, indicating SLO-mediated release of M1 protein from the phagosome, and providing a mechanism for cytosolic recognition of this virulence factor. Unexpectedly, cytosolic extracts of both WT- and {Delta}SLO-infected macrophages contained all histone proteins, suggesting that nucleosomal complexes are released into the cytosol during GAS infection. Our work reveals both a mechanism for the activation of the inflammatory response on a cellular level, and the surprising consequences of phagosomal perforation in GAS infections. These responses may collectively contribute to the pathologies observed during severe invasive GAS infection, and can help inform therapies aimed at improving macrophage function and patient outcomes.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Anthocyanins, a class of flavonoids responsible for vibrant shades of pink, red, and blue pigmentation, are almost ubiquitous in angiosperms but are replaced by betalains in some families in the order Caryophyllales.
C_LIO_LIWe investigated anthocyanin pigmentation in Cucurbitaceae, the second-largest fruit and vegetable family, characterised by white and yellow flowers and red, orange, and green fruits predominantly pigmented by carotenoids. Using a comprehensive collection of 258 datasets representing species across all 15 tribes of Cucurbitaceae and a phylogenomics approach, we observed a systematic absence of genes involved in anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis. Absence of the structural genes DFR, ANS, arGST, LAR, and ANR, along with the anthocyanin-related regulatory MYB genes, was consistently confirmed by synteny and phylogenetic analysis.
C_LIO_LIThese results suggest that anthocyanin loss in angiosperms is more common than previously assumed. In light of this new discovery, we propose a stepwise loss of anthocyanin pigmentation in Cucurbitaceae, likely accompanied by a partial functional replacement with carotenoid pigmentation.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: 49 biomedical journals published by BMJ Group. PARTICIPANTS: Submitting authors of 25,114 empirical research manuscripts including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, submitted between 8 April 2024 and 6 November 2024. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of manuscripts with self-disclosed use of AI, types of AI tools used, the tasks they assisted with and factors associated with disclosure. RESULTS: There was a total of 25,114 eligible submissions: Asia (13,505; 53.8%), Europe (6,523; 26.0%), North America (2,795; 11.1%), Africa (1,196; 4.8%), Oceania (708; 2.8%), and South America (387; 1.5%). A total of 1,431 submissions (5.7%) disclosed the use of AI. The most frequently reported AI tools used were Generative AI Chatbots (812/1431; 56.7%) and writing assistants (182; 12.7%). The majority of authors who disclosed AI use reported using it to improve the quality of their writing (1,248/1,431; 87%). Additionally, translation (107; 7.5%), generating data and output (87, 6.1%), literature searches (49; 3.4%), analyzing data (31; 2.2%), image processing or analysis (49; 3.4%), code writing (15; 1.0%), and managing references (14; 0.9%) were mentioned as tasks AI assisted with. Authors from South America (OR=1.75; 95%-CI: 1.22-2.49) and Europe (OR=1.28; 95%-CI: 1.14-1.45) were significantly more likely to disclose AI use than those from Asia.

Nevertheless, experimental studies and network simulations suggest that interneuron subclasses such as parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) exert distinct control over oscillatory dynamics. Yet, we lack a theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying oscillations in E-PV-SOM circuits and of the differences with respect to the classical mechanisms for oscillations in simpler E-I networks. Here, we derive a biologically realistic mean-field model of a canonical three-population E-PV-SOM circuit. This model robustly generates oscillations whose features are consistent with experimental observations, including the relative timing of PV and SOM activity and the effects of optogenetic perturbations. By reducing the model to a linear analytical form, we demonstrate that gamma oscillations emerge directly from the cell-specific connectivity of the three-population circuit. This connectivity motif alone accounts for experimentally observed phase relationships, with PV activity consistently leading that of SOM neurons. Together, this mean field model identifies a distinct structural mechanism giving rise to oscillations in canonical E-PV-SOM circuits and provides theoretical primitives for constructing large-scale, cell-type-specific models of cortical dynamics.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Using a IS110 element from Caloranaerobacter azorensis, we show that IS110 transposons utilize two independent transposition pathways. The first depends on bridge-RNA and excises the element via copy-out to form a circular intermediate, revisiting the earlier cut-out model. Integration occurs predominantly through top-strand insertion, suggesting an alternative to the earlier Holliday junction-mediated dual-strand mechanism. The second involves cooperation between a truncated target-binding loop RNA and bridge-RNA, enabling direct top-strand transfer to a new target via two sequential reactions, bypassing circular intermediates. Both pathways preserve the original transposon copy.

It also limits spontaneous- and virus-induced innate immune responses by suppressing proinflammatory cytokine and type-I interferon (IFN-I) production. Some viruses escape SAMHD1 restriction by utilizing SAMHD1-mediated innate immune suppression to establish effective infection through viral antagonism. Our previous studies showed that SAMHD1 is a proviral factor facilitating replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in human macrophages, monocytic THP-1 and epithelial-like HEK293T cell lines by suppressing IFN responses. However, it is unclear about the function of SAMHD1 in lung epithelial cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report that SAMHD1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung epithelial Calu-3 cells by enhancing endogenous expression of the viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1) and HNF1{beta}. Using pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 and lentiviral vectors, we found that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated viral entry was suppressed in Calu-3 cells with SAMHD1 knockout (KO). SAMHD1 KO repressed ACE2 expression in Calu-3 cells at mRNA and protein levels. Functional analyses revealed that HNF1 and HNF1{beta} were crucial for the endogenous ACE2 expression in Calu-3 cells. Additionally, SAMHD1 KO led to a reduction in the expression levels and ACE2-promoting function of HNF1 and HNF1{beta}. Inhibition of IFN antiviral response by baricitinib, a Janus kinase 1 and 2 (JAK 1/2) inhibitor, did not revert the suppression of SARS-CoV-2 in SAMHD1 KO Calu-3 cells.

A marked decrease in inter-hemispheric connectivity was observed in patients (70.9%) compared with controls (29.1%; p < 0.001). The finding was consistent across all diagnostic groups. These alterations remained stable following reanalysis and aggregation, reliably distinguishing patients from controls. No significant differences were found in intra-hemispheric connectivity across the patient groups. Additionally, out of 12 predefined interregional connections, ten showed significant alterations in at least one patient group. The findings reveal robust and consistent reduced inter-hemispheric connectivity in patients with MCS, FSD, and PC, highlighting a potentially shared neurobiological signature among the patient groups.","[{""name"":""Aase og Ejnar Danielsens Fond"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02hcraz70"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""22-10-0460;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Without intervention, 10 million AMR-related deaths per year by 2050 are estimated by the WHO. Nonetheless, the development of novel antibiotics has almost come to a halt. In this context, naturally occurring narrow-spectrum antimicrobial proteins, known as bacteriocins, are promising alternatives to address the need for effective and selective antimicrobial treatments. However, the widespread distribution of cognate immunity proteins among bacteriocin producers vastly limits the natural antimicrobial spectrum against Gram-negative bacteria. On the example of pyocin S2 (PyoS2), an S-type HNH DNase bacteriocin targeting the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, this study demonstrates for the first time that a rationally introduced single mutation and chemical protein functionalisation at PyoS2's immunity protein exosite fully eradicate immunity protein-mediated resistance to pyocins in multidrug-resistant clinical P. aeruginosa isolates. The presented findings highlight a strategy to engineer bacteriocins from pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria with an extended antimicrobial spectrum, overruling the prevalent and predominant bacteriocin resistance mechanism of immunity protein binding. This strategy could expedite the development of engineered bacteriocins to expand our repository of antimicrobials to combat the worsening antimicrobial resistance crisis and avert a post-antibiotic era.","[{""name"":""Jürgen Manchot Stiftung"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) senses nutrient availability, with amino acids serving as key signals. Lysosomes, which act as nutrient recycling centers, maintain amino acid homeostasis by breaking down macromolecules and releasing amino acids for cellular use. SLC38A9, a lysosomal amino acid transporter, functions as both a transporter and a sensor in the mTORC1 pathway. Here, we investigated whether SLC38A9 activity is regulated by pH. We show that arginine uptake by SLC38A9 is pH-dependent, and that the histidine residue His544 serves as the pH sensor. Mutating His544 abolishes the pH dependence of arginine uptake without impairing overall transport activity, indicating that His544 is not directly involved in substrate binding. Instead, protonation or deprotonation of His544 appears to influence transport through SLC38A9. To explore this mechanism, we compared two structures of SLC38A9 that we determined, one at high pH and one at low pH, and proposed a working model for pH-induced activation. These findings highlight the role of local ionic changes in modulating lysosomal transporters and underscore the intricate regulatory mechanisms that govern SLC38A9 function and, ultimately, mTORC1 signaling.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P41GM136508;RM1GM158451;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F32CA278619;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

We identified almost universal repression of cGAS or STING in human osteosarcomas. However, a STING-activation gene signature was predictive of survival in osteosarcoma patients suggesting potential for activation of this pathway in the osteosarcoma tumor microenvironment. Indeed, in immunocompetent osteosarcoma models, systemic STING agonism led to complete regression and induced lasting immunologic memory. Host STING activation is sufficient to promote this anti-tumor immunity even in the absence of tumor STING. These results nominate the cGAS-STING pathway as an important therapeutic target in osteosarcoma, a disease in which no new curative therapies have been developed in the last 40 years.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01CA243555;R50CA274213;""},{""name"":""St. Baldrick's Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03h1gea69"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/038ja4880"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Osteosarcoma Institute"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MIB Agents"",""id"":""https://ror.org/053pqtj30"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Hyundai Hope On Wheels"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f6q3121"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""CURE Childhood Cancer"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05r5v7643"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Rally Foundation for Childhood Cancer Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01mkym489"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Here we uncover a critical role for RBMX retrocopy in shaping neurodevelopment and modulating disease. Pathogenic variants in RBMX, an X-linked splicing regulator, cause intellectual disability, microcephaly, and cortical malformations. Through integrated human genetic, cellular, and mouse model studies, we show that RBMX pathogenic variants disrupt cortical development through both loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms. Surprisingly, despite severe phenotypes in humans, Rbmx-deficient mice display only mild cortical abnormalities, a discrepancy likely due to compensation by Rbmxl1, a retrocopy that arose independently in mice and humans. We demonstrate that RBMX and RBMXL1 share protein and RNA partners and act redundantly in brain development, with RBMXL1 buffering the impact of RBMX deficiency. These findings establish retrocopies as functional paralogs safeguarding neurodevelopment, and suggest that functional RBMX retrocopy could contribute to the robustness and evolutionary diversification of mammalian brain.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1761516552418

We investigate the structure of these models by training sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on the hidden representations of two widely used scFMs, scGPT and scFoundation. The learned features reveal diverse and complex biological and technical signals, which emerge even in pre-trained models. We also observe that the encoding of this information differs between scFMs with distinct training protocols and architectures. Further, we find that while many features capture the information about cell types across several studies, they often fall short of unifying it into a single generalized representation. Finally, we demonstrate that SAE-derived features are causally related to model behavior and can be intervened upon to reduce unwanted technical effects while steering model outputs to preserve the core biological signal.

These chemically-identical ""mass tags"" conjugate to peptides to encode samples with different mass offsets for parallel analysis. The current state-of-the-art for multiplexing with non-isobaric mass tags was recently improved from 3-plex to 9-plex, but what is the largest plex size that can be reasonably achieved with current technology? A full answer to this question requires evaluating current mass spectrometry hardware, facets of which have been well-investigated by others. However, it may be under-appreciated that multiplexing 1000s of samples with mass tags does not actually require 1000s of isotopes, or 1000s of synthesis steps to create. Non-intuitively, high plex mass tags can require relatively few different isotopes. The focus of this exposition is to characterize the potential of the differential mass defect to create tens to over a thousand isotopologues of small molecules and how careful combinations of these small molecules can combinatorially scale the plex size to minimize synthetic steps. Importantly, we show that plex sizes in the hundreds, an order of magnitude greater than state-of-the-art, are achievable using molecules comparable in size to existing commercial tags, and that going beyond hundreds may require larger molecules. Approaches to achieve high-plex proteomics will almost certainly require using the differential mass defect, so we hope this exposition serves to accelerate progress in reagent development to achieve high plex proteomics.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

These artifacts can affect demultiplexing accuracy and downstream analyses. Results We performed a rapid barcoding experiment on 66 diagnostic samples and found that 83% of reads carried the expected single-barcode pattern, while 17% contained multiple barcodes or other artifacts. Current demultiplexers, including the widely used Dorado, fail to correctly handle these complex cases, leaving approximately 7% of reads partially trimmed and contaminated with adapter fragments. Additional issues include the presence of two barcodes at the same read end - either identical, originating from the same sample, or different, introduced after pooling. The latter can lead to barcode bleeding when the outer barcode is incorrectly selected. To address these challenges, we developed Barbell, a pattern-aware demultiplexer that detects all barcode configurations. Barbell reduces trimming errors by three orders of magnitude, minimizes barcode bleeding, and supports custom experimental setups such as shorter barcodes, dual-end barcodes, and custom flank sequences. Conclusions Our results highlight the impact of complex barcode attachments in Nanopore sequencing and demonstrate that Barbell drastically reduces their effects on downstream analyses.

All three TFs have potentially druggable pockets where mutations have strong functional effects on binding, either within the binding interface or distant from it.

We isolated 184 microbes from wild Alaskan threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) guts across six lakes and screened for plastic degrading potential using lipase/esterase assays and biofilm formation on PET and PP. During the screen for microbes with plastic degrading potential, we discovered that stickleback gut microbiota members enhance and suppressed the lipase, esterase, and biofilm activity of other microbes. Isolates with the highest plastic degrading potential were incubated in minimal media with PET or PP as the sole carbon source to determine whether plastic degradation potential is enhanced. Surface analysis identified a Pseudomonas trivialis strain that exhibited degradation of PP in monoculture; however, this activity was suppressed in the presence of another gut isolate, Pseudomonas germanica.

To enumerate adaptive immune responses associated with MS and to identify MS-related epitopes recognized by CD8 T cells, we evaluated T-cell recognition of 1,158 predicted major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-binding peptides derived from latent EBV antigens (laEBVs) and selected neuroantigens (NAgs) using DNA barcode-labelled pMHC multimers. HLA-B*07:02+ individuals living with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS (PMS) were characterized by a relative reduction in EBNA6-specific and MAG-specific CD8 T cells compared to healthy donors. Furthermore, both RRMS and PMS patients exhibited a delayed expansion of CMV- and laEBV-specific CD8 T cells compared to healthy donors indicating an age-specific interaction with disease. Female RRMS patients were moreover characterized by a specific reduction of laEBV-specific CD8 T cells compared to male RRMS patients. NAg-specific CD8 T cells recognized heterogeneous peptides, were of low cellular frequency in peripheral blood, and exhibited a circulating, naive-like, anergic phenotype. In contrast, virus-specific CD8 T cells were characterized by high-frequency cellular responses with an effector-like, tissue-homing phenotype. These immunophenotypes were largely shared between MS and healthy donors. Collectively, our data provide novel insights into CD8 T-cell recognition of both NAg and laEBV antigens in MS and constitute a key reference map of epitopes for further immunomonitoring of EBV- and self-specific CD8 T cells in health and disease.","[{""name"":""The Lundbeck Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R190-2014-4178;""},{""name"":""European Research Council ERC Consolidator"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MIMIC 101045517;""},{""name"":""Scleroseforeningen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/037s01565"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""A44005;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Dysregulation of microglial activation occurs in numerous brain disorders, and driving or inhibiting specific states could be therapeutic. To discover regulators of microglial activation states, we conducted CRISPR interference screens in iPSC-derived microglia for inhibitors and activators of six microglial states. We identified transcriptional regulators for each of these states and characterized 31 regulators at the single-cell transcriptomic and cell-surface proteome level in two distinct iPSC-derived microglia models. Finally, we functionally characterized several regulators. STAT2 knockdown inhibits interferon response and lysosomal function. PRDM1 knockdown drives disease-associated and lipid-rich signatures and enhanced phagocytosis. DNMT1 knockdown results in widespread loss of methylation, activating negative regulators of interferon signaling. These findings provide a framework to direct microglial activation to selectively enrich microglial activation states, define their functional outputs, and inform future therapies.

Two-component systems are especially attractive due to their potential for functional complexity. In this study, we demonstrate that the subunits of the 240mer nucleocapsid NC-4, which was previously evolved to package and protect its encoding mRNA, can be split into two fragments without disrupting cage assembly or structure, generating a two-component, 480-subunit capsid. This modification introduces additional termini on the cages exterior surface, creating new opportunities for functionalization. We exploited these new sites by genetically appending peptide and protein tags to the exterior surface of split NC-4 (spNC-4), enabling site-specific glycosylation via post-translational modification and cell-specific delivery by targeted antibody recruitment. Our findings broaden the utility of the NC-4 nucleocapsid. By extension, splitting related protein compartments that bind diverse cargoes could offer a robust platform for biotechnological applications requiring simultaneous encapsulation and customizable surface modification.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTNatural protein shells such as viral capsids and bacterial microcompartments have inspired efforts to design synthetic compartments that protect and deliver functional molecules. Here we show that a nonviral, artificially evolved nucleocapsid can be split into two fragments that reassemble into a closed, two-component, 480-subunit cage that packages its own mRNA. This redesign preserves the original architecture and selective RNA packaging while creating new engineerable sites on both the interior and exterior surfaces, enabling simultaneous control of internal cargo binding and external modification. The resulting two-component architecture highlights the structural plasticity of synthetic nucleocapsids and provides a general strategy for constructing modular, evolvable protein containers for biotechnology and synthetic biology.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Centromere kinetochore domains emerged as focal sites of structural, genetic, and epigenetic variation, leading to remodeling of centromere kinetochore binding domains during tumor evolution.

The syncytium can be damaged in vivo focally by high-velocity and turbulent maternal blood flow, or more globally by oxidative stress. It then quickly regenerates, a process critical for the maintenance of placental functions including nutrient transfer and protection from infections. To investigate this process, we developed apical-out trophoblast organoids from first-trimester placentas and induced mechanical damage to the syncytium. We observed spontaneous regeneration of syncytiotrophoblast both morphologically and functionally. TNFRSF12A, the TWEAK receptor, was identified as a potential enhancer of syncytiotrophoblast regeneration. Supplementation with recombinant TWEAK in organoids increased the expression of cell proliferation and fusion markers, promoting syncytiotrophoblast formation. The source of TWEAK was found to be macrophages derived from maternal blood monocytes that adhere to sites of syncytiotrophoblast damage in vivo. This in vitro model that allows the exploration of syncytial biology has relevance for important pregnancy disorders including pre-eclampsia, where breaks occur more often, and vertical infections, where maternal monocytes could be a source of transmission.","[{""name"":""Novartis Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04f9t1x17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""10004677;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

More than half of human proteins, however, contain mixtures of disordered regions and one or more folded domains, and the biological function of these multi-domain proteins depends on the interplay between the folded and disordered regions. Here, we developed AF-CALVADOS, a coarse-grained simulation model that is informed by AlphaFold to model the dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins and multi-domain proteins containing mixtures of folded and disordered regions. AF-CALVADOS leverages information from AlphaFold 2 to model folded regions that we then integrate with the coarse-grained CALVADOS model.

It facilitates molecular evolution and has been characterized in a variety of biological systems, but studies of prokaryotic promoters are limited. Prokaryotic promoters are non-coding DNA sequences that regulate transcription. The main housekeeping promoters ({sigma}70) share two sequence motifs called the -35 and the -10 box that are spaced 17{+/-}1 base pairs (bps) apart. The sequence of these boxes, their distance, and the existence of multiple nearby boxes can determine promoter strength, the ability of a promoter to drive high levels of transcription. Here we used computational modelling to show that the mutational robustness of {sigma}70 promoters - the persistence of promoter strength upon mutation - correlates with promoter strength itself. Mutational robustness is also influenced by potential overlaps between -10 and -35 boxes, and by specific positions within the boxes. It is higher when the boxes are exactly 17 bps apart. These findings can be partially explained by the flexibility of -35 boxes, which enables adjacent bases to create overlapping and new -35 boxes. Our work can help to engineer synthetic promoters for strength and robustness, and to understand the dynamics of promoter evolution.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""31003A_172887;310030_208174;""},{""name"":""University of Zurich"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02crff812"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FK-23-120;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

While recent outbreaks have revealed much about the epidemiological dynamics that sustain human-to-human transmission, the mechanisms by which the virus persists between outbreaks are unknown. Previously, phylogenetic approaches have been used to characterise the EBOV reservoir from the evolutionary relationships among observed human outbreaks. We here employ a novel phylogenetic latency model - inspired by recent observations of extreme EBOV evolutionary rate heterogeneity in humans - to characterise the natural history of EBOV and by extension its reservoir. We find the prevailing model of EBOV reservoir dynamics is deficient, and the long-term EBOV evolutionary rate is slower than previously believed. The hypothesis that EBOV diversity dates back to a bottleneck event just prior to the first human outbreak is not supported by the data. Further, our results suggest that EBOV undergoes extended periods of quiescence in the reservoir, similar to that observed in a small fraction of human infections. These findings have significant implications for understanding the source of EBOV outbreaks, characterising the EBOV reservoir, and uncovering the factors that contribute to EBOV outbreaks in humans.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""206298/Z/17/Z;313694/Z/24/Z;218471/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Research Foundation - Flanders"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03qtxy027"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""G0E1420N;G098321N;""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""01102733;""},{""name"":""Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""260003/005679/2023;260003/013252/2024;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IG-5305-2023;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AI153044;AI162611;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""725422;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

BCI implants have targeted broad cortical regions known to have relevant motor representations, but emerging technologies will allow flexible targeting to specific neural populations. The structure of motor representations at this scale, however, has not been well characterized across frontal motor cortices. Here, we investigate how motor representations and population dynamics (temporal coordination) vary across a large expanse of frontal motor cortices. We used high-density, laminar, microelectrode arrays to simultaneously record many neurons and then sampled neural populations across frontal motor cortex in two monkeys while they performed a reaching task. Our experiments allowed us to map neuronal activity across three spatial dimensions and relate them to movement. Target decoding analysis revealed that task information was heterogeneously distributed across the cortical surface and in depth. Similarly, we found that the temporal dynamics of different neural populations were heterogeneous, but that the amount of task information predicted which neural populations had similar dynamics. The neural populations with the most similar dynamics were composed of neurons with high task information regardless of spatial location. Our results highlight the spatiotemporal complexity of motor representations across frontal motor cortex at the level of neurons and neural populations, where well-learned movements consistently recruit a spatially distributed subset of neurons. Further insights into the spatiotemporal structure of neural activity patterns across frontal motor cortex will be critical to guide future implants for improved BCI performance.

Significance StatementMotor brain-computer interfaces (BCI) translate neural activity into movement, but how to target implants within motor cortices to maximize performance remains unclear. We used high-density recordings of neural activity spanning a large cortical area and related them to movement to map the spatial distribution of task information and the evolution of neural population activity over time. Our measurements revealed that neurons with the most task information were heterogeneously distributed across cortex yet also evolved coherently in time, suggesting that spatially distributed neurons coordinate to control movements. Our results provide new links between neuron- and population-level maps of motor representations, and highlight the complex spatiotemporal structure of activity that may need to be considered when designing next-generation BCIs.","[{""name"":""National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TL1 TR002318;""},{""name"":""Heiwa Nakajima Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/000k40t10"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Graduate Fellowship;""},{""name"":""Weill Neurohub"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""postdoctoral fellowship;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Simons Collaboration for the Global Brain Pilot award, 898220;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2117997;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIH R01 NS134634;UF1NS126485;""},{""name"":""Office of Research Infrastructure Programs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01jdyfj45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P51 OD010425;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Together, these datasets enable real-world penetrance estimation of rare variants at a population scale, stratification of individuals and families by clinical actionability, and the discovery of novel IRD-associated variants. Among 1,879 known variants, we found 96 high or complete penetrance, supporting clinical integration, while 36 showed null penetrance, warranting reclassification. We identified 2,131 asymptomatic individuals and 1,013 families as potential candidates for preventive care. Using phenotype-first familial prioritization, we identified 69 likely pathogenic variants among high-disease-burden families, including a novel biallelic BBS12 variant confirmed through cross-cohort screening.

We provide a comprehensive molecular portrait of MRD cells with novel markers, shared across genetically heterogeneous patients.

The DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), classically defined as the maintenance methyltransferase that preserves DNA methylation patterns during replication, exemplifies this versatility. Beyond its canonical role, DNMT1 is highly expressed in the developing and adult brain, where it contributes to transcriptional regulation in postmitotic neurons. Notably, cytoplasmic DNMT1 localization has been observed in neural cells, and emerging evidence links DNMT1 to mitochondrial function with implications for neurodegenerative disease, whereby the underlying functional mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.

Here, we identify a previously unrecognized cytosolic function of DNMT1 in developing cortical excitatory neurons. Through genetic perturbation, proteomics, and high-resolution imaging, we show that DNMT1 regulates dendritic and axonal branching independently of its catalytic activity and nuclear localization. Instead, DNMT1 operates as a cytosolic scaffold interacting with the polarity regulator DOCK7 to modulate Rac1-STMN1 signaling, microtubule dynamics, and organelle trafficking. These findings expand the conceptual framework of DNMT1 from a genome guardian to a dual-compartment regulator that coordinates cytoskeletal remodeling and mitochondrial positioning. Beyond advancing our understanding of neuronal morphogenesis, this work provides mechanistic insight into how DNMT1 mutations may lead to neurodegenerative diseases.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ZI-1224/13-1;ZI-1224/13-1;368482240/GRK2416;""},{""name"":""Excellence Strategy of the Federal Government and the Länder"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OPSF678;OPSF812;SFASIA002;""},{""name"":""European Union&#8722;NextGenerationEU-HEAL ITALIA"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PE00000019;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Oct4, a master regulator of pluripotency, exemplifies this capacity as it can bind nucleosome-occupied DNA. Yet, how Oct4 reshapes chromatin fibres beyond the scale of a single nucleosome has remained unclear. Here, we harness our near-atomistic coarse-grained chromatin model to dissect how full-length Oct4 interacts with chromatin fibres of varying nucleosomal repeat lengths. We find that Oct4 increases DNA accessibility not by decondensing chromatin, but by driving fibres into compact liquid-like states in which nucleosomes breathe, reorient, exchange neighbours, and transiently expose DNA. Oct4 binds preferentially to linker DNA through its structured POU domains, while its disordered activation domains mediate cluster formation: a three-stage process consisting of nucleation of small clusters, attachment to chromatin via the DNA binding domains, and growth that is amplified when long DNA linkers enable fibre bending and looping. Oct4 clusters deform chromatin and bridge distal DNA segments in a stoichiometry- and linker length-dependent manner, revealing a tunable mechanism for controlling higher-order structure. Together, our results establish how Oct4 exploits multivalency, nucleosome breathing, and chromatin flexibility to reorganise fibres into liquid-like states that reconcile condensation with enhanced accessibility, providing a physical route to overcome the transcription-factor  search problem and activate silenced genes during reprogramming.","[{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X02332X/1;EP/Z002028/1;EP/X035603/1;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""803326;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Furthermore, these trial-by-trial ACD fluctuations predicted trial-by-trial choice variability. Finally, ex-vivo slice electrophysiology and computational modeling revealed two mechanisms through which astrocytes could regulate behavioral variability: by regulating presynaptic excitatory-inhibitory balance, and by sharing RPE signals across populations of striatal neurons.

However, emerging viral variants have escaped all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved NAb treatments, underscoring the urgent need for effective therapeutic alternatives. Using a nanoluciferase (Nluc)-expressing attenuated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 lacking the open reading frames (ORF) 3a and 7b ({Delta}3a7b-Nluc), we characterized resistance profiles of two broadly protective NAbs targeting the S receptor binding domain (RBD) in S1 (1301B7) and the stem helix domain (SH) in S2 (1249A8). Serial passaging of {Delta}3a7b-Nluc under selective pressure identified a 1301B7 antibody-resistant mutants (ARM-B7) harboring an RBD mutation (S371F) that conferred resistance to 1301B7 and other RBD-directed NAbs (Casirivimab, SC27 and Sotrovimab). In contrast, no ARM emerged under treatment with 1249A8, or an antibody cocktail of 1301B7 (RBD) + 1249A8 (SH). These findings demonstrate that S2 SH-targeting NAbs shows higher genetic barrier to resistance than S1 RBD-targeting NAbs, and that a NAbs cocktail therapy targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD and S2 SH offers the most effective strategy to prevent the emergence of escape mutations. Together, our findings provide critical insights into developing next-generation resistance-evading NAb therapies against SARS-CoV-2, and potentially other coronaviruses, and demonstrate the value of using our attenuated viral platforms for the safe identification of ARM without the potential biosafety concerns of doing these experiments using wild-type (WT) forms of SARS-CoV-2.

SIGNIFICANCEThe clinical efficacy of early SARS-CoV-2 NAbs has been challenged by the emergence of escape viral variants, highlighting an urgent need to anticipate resistance. Using a luminescent attenuated SARS-CoV-2 platform, we profiled resistant mutations against two broadly protective SARS-CoV-2 NAbs. Passage of {Delta}3a7b-Nluc in the presence of a NAb targeting the RBD S1 domain (1301B7) readily selected for an ARM, whereas passage in the presence of an SH S2 domain NAb (1249A8) did not. Notably, a cocktail of 1301B7 and 1249A8 created a high barrier of selecting SARS-CoV-2 ARM, preventing the emergence of resistant variants. We identified an S371F mutation in the S1 RBD of ARM-B7 that confers resistance to 1301B7 and other S1 RBD-targeting NAbs. These results highlight the importance of combination therapies targeting both variable RBD S1 and conserved SH S2 domain for the efficient treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and to prevent the emerge of NAb-induced escape mutations.","[{""name"":""NIAID"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 AI161363;75N93021C00014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

We have dissected ssDNA gap dynamics following nucleoside analogue-mediated nascent strand termination and report a novel mechanism via which loss of the MRE11 negative regulator MRN-Interacting Protein (MRNIP) leads to MRE11 exonuclease-dependent suppression of post-replicative ssDNA gaps. This process is driven by UBC13 and the B-family TLS polymerase REV3L, suggesting that in the absence of MRNIP, dysregulated MRE11 activity at chain termination sites licenses gap filling via template switching. In the absence of PRIMPOL-dependent repriming, MRNIP loss leads to paradoxical SMARCAL1, MRE11 and primosome-dependent ssDNA gaps, suggesting that nucleolytic digestion of reversed forks generates DNA intermediates that platform primase redundancy in the context of chain termination. We also highlight novel site-specific roles for the anti-resection factor 53BP1 in enabling primase redundancy via suppression of the nuclease EXO1, and in limiting the EXO1-dependent processing of post-replicative ssDNA gaps. Finally, we demonstrate that CDK-dependent MRNIP phosphorylation is required for MRNIP functionality in the regulation of ssDNA gaps and sensitivity to chain terminators.

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

Here, we developed a new computational framework to minimize negative transfer for domain-adaptive brain decoding by reframing source selection as a mixture model parameter estimation problem, allowing each source subject to contribute through a continuous mixture weight rather than being outright included or excluded. To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer. Collectively, this research advances toward a more principled and generalizable brain decoding framework, laying the mathematical foundation for scalable brain-computer interfaces and other applications in computational neuroscience.","[{""name"":""Schroeder Institute for Brain Innovation and Recovery"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

While clonal expansions in the hematopoietic system have been extensively characterized and reported to be nearly ubiquitous, clonal mosaicism (CM) has more recently also been described across multiple solid tissues. However, outstanding questions remain about the parameters and processes of human somatic evolution in non-cancerous solid human tissues, including when clones arise, how they evolve over time, and what mechanisms lead to their expansion. Questions of timing and clonal dynamics can be addressed through phylogenetic reconstruction, which serves as a  temporal microscope, while uncovering the mechanisms of expansion necessitates simultaneous phenotypic profiling. To address this gap, here we develop Single-cell Miniaturized Automated Reverse Transcription and Primary Template-directed Amplification (SMART-PTA) for joint single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing for large scale and cost efficient interrogation of solid tissue CM. We established a workflow that generates hundreds of matched single-cell whole genome and transcriptome libraries within a week. We profiled phenotypically normal esophagus tissue from four aged donors and used somatic variants to build high-resolution single-cell lineages from >2,700 cells with accompanying transcriptomic information, reconstructing >70 years of somatic evolution. T cell expansions identified from T cell receptor (TCR) sequences validated the clonal structure of the single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based phylogenies and phylogenetic cross-correlation analysis showed that epithelial cells had higher degrees of shared ancestry by spatial location compared to immune cells. Mapping mutation signatures to the phylogenetic tree revealed the emergence of tobacco/alcohol exposure-related signatures later in life, consistent with the donors exposure histories. We identified variants in driver genes that were previously reported in the phenotypically normal esophagus, detecting clonal expansions harboring mutations in genes including TP53 and FAT1. We mapped the evolution of clones with both monoallelic as well as biallelic TP53 loss, including a clone associated with high expression of cell cycling genes and higher chromosome instability. Leveraging the matched transcriptome data, we uncovered cell type biases in mutant clones, with a higher proportion of TP53 or FAT1-mutant cells in an earlier basal epithelial cell state compared to wild-type cells. We further observed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) events on chromosome 9q that spanned the NOTCH1 locus in up to [~]35% of epithelial cells. Mapping CNLOH events to the phylogenetic tree revealed a striking pattern in which CNLOH was separately acquired many times, reflecting convergent evolution. Cells with CNLOH events were biased towards the earlier basal epithelial state, suggestive of a selective advantage that leads to prevalent recurrence of chr9q CNLOH. Together, we demonstrate that SMART-PTA is an efficient, scalable approach for single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome profiling to build phenotypically annotated single-cell phylogenies with enough throughput and power for application to normal tissue somatic evolution. Moreover, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the esophageal epithelium at high scale and resolution, providing a window into the dynamics and processes that shape clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues throughout a lifespan.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3NS132139;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R33 CA267219;""},{""name"":""NIDDK"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30 DK132710;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RM1HG011014;""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01d35cw23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Career Award for Medical Scientists;""},{""name"":""Vallee Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05nmp3276"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Scholar Award;""},{""name"":""Blood Cancer United"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00v7th354"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MacMillan Family Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

A promising strategy for ""proteome editing"" is to use bifunctional molecules (e.g. PROteolysis-Targeting Chimeras or PROTACs1) that bring a target protein into proximity with a degradation or stabilization effector, but their broader application is constrained by a limited repertoire of well-characterized target or effector ""handles"". We asked whether coupling de novo protein design to a multiplex screening framework could address this gap by accelerating the discovery of effector handles for intracellular protein degradation, stabilization, or relocalization. Using LABEL-seq2, a sequencing-based assay that enables multiplex, quantitative measurement of protein abundance, we screened 9,715 de novo designed candidate effector handles for their ability to recruit a target protein to components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system3 (UPS) (FBXL12, TRAF2, UCHL1, USP38) or the autophagy pathway4 (GABARAP, GABARAPL2, MAP1LC3A). In a single experiment, we discovered hundreds of de novo designed effector handles that reproducibly drove either intracellular degradation (n = 277) or stabilization (n = 204) of a reporter protein. Validation of a subset of these hits in an orthogonal assay confirmed that sequencing-based measurements from the primary screen reliably reflected changes in intracellular abundance of the target protein. Successful effector handles were discovered for both the UPS (n = 194) and autophagy (n = 287) pathways, which provide complementary routes for programmable proteome editing. Autophagy-recruiting effector handles generalized to endogenous targets, as substituting the reporter-specific target handle with a high-affinity MCL1 binder5 reduced endogenous levels of this intracellular oncoprotein6. Moreover, directing autophagy-recruiting effector handles to the outer mitochondrial membrane dramatically perturbed mitochondrial networks in a manner consistent with synthetic tethering and sequestration7,8. Beyond generating a diverse repertoire of protein abundance or localization effector handles, our results establish a scalable, low-cost platform that links deep learning-guided protein design to functional cellular readouts, and chart a course toward a general framework for programmable proteome editing.","[{""name"":""National Heart Lung and Blood Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012pb6c26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31HL168982;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T32GM136534;""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV-043758;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG010632;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility.

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552418

While open models for unconstrained ""minibinder"" design have shown great experimental promise, methods for designing binders in specific formats, such as antibodies, have lagged behind in experimental success rates. In this work, we present mBER, an open-source protein binder design system capable of designing antibody-format binders with state-of-the-art experimental success rates. mBER builds on the ColabDesign framework, achieving successful antibody design primarily through the inclusion of informative sequence and structure conditioning information. Using mBER, we designed two libraries comprising over 1 million VHH binders against 436 diverse targets. We experimentally screened the two libraries against 145 of these targets, resulting in a dataset of over 100 million binding interactions. We achieved specific and significant design success against 45% of targets. In a filtered set of designs, we detect binding rates to specific epitopes as high as 38%. Through mBER, we demonstrate that format-specific binder design is possible with no additional training of underlying folding and language models. This work represents the largest reported de novo protein design and validation campaign, and one of the first open-source methods to demonstrate double-digit percentage experimental success rates for antibody binder design.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552419

Here, we present a spatially resolved, multi-omics framework that integrates whole-organ 3D imaging at cellular resolution with targeted proteomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic profiling to detect and characterize microscopic tubal lesions. Using this platform, we identified a total of 99 STICs and their presumed precursors that harbor TP53 mutations in morphologically unremarkable tubal epithelium in all five specimens obtained from cancer-free organ donors with average-risk of developing ovarian cancer. Although these lesions comprised only 0.2% of the epithelial compartment, they displayed geographic diversity, immune exclusion, metabolic rewiring, and DNA copy number changes among lesions and normal fallopian tube epithelium discovered alterations in STIC-associated genes and the pathways they control. In sum, this platform provides a comprehensive 3D atlas of early neoplastic transformation, yielding mechanistic insights into tumor initiation and informing clinical screening strategies for detecting cancer precursors in whole organs at cellular resolution.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U54CA268083;RO1CA300052;UG3CA275681;P50CA228991;R01GM149976;U01AI167892;5R01NS111039;R21NS125395;U54 HL165443;U54 DK 134301;R01 HL170107;U2CCA271891;""},{""name"":""Sloan research fellow award, a CZI Scialog award, and UCSD Startup funds"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Johns Hopkins University and Instituto Superior Técnico student exchange program (HOPTEC and FLAD)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Richard W.

This is especially a problem in children, where cancer survivors experience a subsequent high risk of bone mineral deficits and fractures, normally seen in the older population. Here, we model this to show that early-life treatment with a single dose of the commonly used chemotherapy cisplatin profoundly impairs late-life bone health, and that these bone deficits are completely resolved through treatment with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). While we had previously shown that this same strategy protects against chemotherapy induced female infertility, this maintenance of aged bone health appears to be unrelated to endocrine changes due to protection of the ovarian reserve. Rather, this is driven by altered phosphorus homeostasis and protection against renal damage, which otherwise increases parathyroid hormone secretion to mobilise calcium stores from bone.

Here, we question this view by demonstrating cross-communication between distinct arbitrium systems. Using prototypical arbitrium phages, we demonstrate that AimP peptides bind and repress unrelated AimR receptors, promoting lysogeny and reducing prophage induction.

This revealed that selenoprotein production is limited by ribosome collisions that occur at inefficiently decoded selenocysteine codons. Accordingly, slowed translation elongation reduced collisions and enhanced selenocysteine decoding. Oxidative stress also slowed translation elongation and augmented selenoprotein production. We identified translation elongation factor EEF1G as a sensor of oxidized glutathione that couples the cellular redox state to translation elongation rate.

Little is known, however, about whether and how phages can establish long-term genetic stability. We addressed this eco-evolutionary question in an open marine animal associated system, through two longitudinal samplings years apart in an oyster farm, obtaining >1,000 virulent phages and >600 Vibrio crassostreae strains. Surprisingly, lineages of phage and bacteria were very persistent, with some phages remaining strictly identical after four years. The phage-vibrio infection network remained modular with multiple lineages co-habitating within individual oysters for long periods of time. Seasonal restriction of V. crassostreae, overwintering in wild oysters, and limited viral decay may explain phage stability. Oysters also act as hotspots of activity of diverse mobile genetic element (MGE), hosting plasmids, prophages, phage-plasmids and entirely new classes of satellite-plasmids. Our findings demonstrate how nested ecological constraints can stabilize viral lineages: oysters house vibrio populations that escape host immunity, vibrios restrict phages via receptors and defenses, and satellites parasitize their cognate helper phages. We suggest that ecological context can favor the long-term maintenance of viral lineages and stabilize MGE persistence in the ocean, even amid ongoing mutation and antagonistic co-evolution.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""884988;""},{""name"":""Canada Excellence Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02tvrwm90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-00051;""},{""name"":""FRQ-NT, Fonds des leaders John-R.-Evans"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""44584;""},{""name"":""ANR"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""20-CE35-0014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552419

We design RNA structures with novel folds and experimentally validate them using a combination of chemical footprinting (SHAPE-seq) and electron microscopy. We further use this approach to design protein-nucleic acid assemblies; the crystal structure of one such design is nearly identical to the design model.

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has allowed proteome-scale quantification of hundreds of thousands of ubiquitination sites (ubi-sites), however the functional importance and regulatory roles of most ubi-sites remain undefined. Here, we assembled a human reference ubiquitinome of 108,341 ubi-sites by harmonizing public proteomics data. We identified a core subset of ubi-sites under evolutionary constraint through alignment of ubiquitin proteomics data from six non-human species, and determined ultra-conserved ubi-sites recurring at regulatory hotspots within protein domains. Perturbation proteomics revealed that these highly conserved ubi-sites are more likely to regulate signaling functions rather than proteasomal degradation. To further prioritize functional ubi-sites with roles in cellular signaling, we constructed a functional score for more than 100,000 ubi-sites by integrating evolutionary, proteomic, and structural features using machine learning. Our score identifies ubi-sites regulating diverse protein functions and rationalizes mechanisms of genetic disease. Finally, we employed chemical genomics to validate the functional relevance of high-scoring ubi-sites and leveraged genetic code expansion to demonstrate that ubiquitination of K320 in the RNA-regulator ELAVL1 disrupts RNA binding.

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552419

Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either the uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects, whereas combined loss significantly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing showed that loss of PIEZO reduced expression of connexin43 (Gja1), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction. These findings highlight the critical role of PIEZO channels in mechanotransduction during parturition and suggest therapeutic targets for labor dysfunction.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 NS105067;R01AT012051;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-2405-20;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CMMI-2135428;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2DK128800;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761516552419
