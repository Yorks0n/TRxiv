"Ubie Symptom Checker: A Clinical Vignette Simulation Study","10.1101/2024.08.29.24312810","medrxiv",54,54,54,54,54,"Taylor, N. K.; Nishibayashi, T.","Nicholas Kenji Taylor","Ubie Health","2024-08-31","1","PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","cc_no","health informatics","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2024/08/31/2024.08.29.24312810.source.xml","BackgroundAI-driven symptom checkers (SC) are increasingly adopted in healthcare for their potential to provide users with accessible and immediate preliminary health education. These tools, powered by advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, assist patients in quickly assessing their symptoms. Previous studies using clinical vignette approaches have evaluated SC accuracy, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement.

ObjectiveThis study aims to evaluate the performance of the Ubie Symptom Checker (Ubie SC) using an innovative large language model-assisted (LLM) simulation method.

MethodsThe study employed a three-phase methodology: gathering 400 publicly available clinical vignettes, medical entity linking these vignettes to the Ubie SC using large language models and physician supervision, and evaluation of accuracy metrics. The analysis focused on 328 vignettes that were within the scope of the Ubie SC with accuracy measured by Top-5 hit rates.

ResultsUbie achieved a Top-5 hit accuracy of 63.4% and a Top-10 hit accuracy of 71.6%, indicating its effectiveness in providing relevant information based on symptom input. The system performed particularly well in domains such as the nervous system and respiratory conditions, though variability in accuracy was observed across different ICD groupings, highlighting areas for further refinement. When compared to physicians and comparator SCs that used the same clinical vignettes set, Ubie compared favorably to the median physician hit accuracy.

ConclusionsThe Ubie Symptom Checker shows considerable promise as a supportive education tool in healthcare. While the study highlights the systems strengths, it also identifies areas for improvement suggesting continued refinement and real-world testing are essential to fully realize Ubies potential in AI-assisted healthcare.","NA","medrxiv",1726006114639

Synthetic genetic constructs compete with a host cells native genes for expression resources, burdening the cell and impairing its growth. This creates a selective pressure favouring mutations which alleviate this growth defect by removing synthetic gene expression. Non-functional mutants thus spread in cell populations, eventually making them lose engineered functions. Past work has attempted to limit mutation spread by coupling synthetic gene expression to survival. However, these approaches are highly context-dependent and must be tailor-made for each particular synthetic gene circuit to be retained.

In contrast, we develop and analyse a biomolecular controller which depresses mutant cell growth independently of the mutated synthetic genes identity. Modelling shows how our design can be deployed alongside various synthetic circuits without any re-engineering of its genetic components, outperforming extant gene-specific mutation spread mitigation strategies. Our controllers performance is evaluated using a novel simulation approach which leverages resource-aware cell modelling to directly link a circuits design parameters to its population-level behaviour.

Our designs adaptability promises to mitigate mutation spread in an expanded range of applications, whilst our analyses provide a blueprint for using resource-aware cell models in circuit design.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

The fossil, known on the basis of two specimens, has been historically assigned to seamoths (Pegasidae), then to oarfish and relatives (Lampriformes). We describe its enigmatic skeletal anatomy in detail, and provide a new genus name. ""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of COVID-19 articles that had corrections made and reported in the NYT ""corrections page"". We categorized authors in a NYT COVID-19 article as a NYT reporter, NYT other, or independent author. We calculated the number and type of corrections by author type (NYT reporter, NYT other, and independent author) and number and percentage of corrections indicating an over- or under-statement of the COVID-19 situation.

ResultsThere were 576 total corrections for the included 486 articles. Forty-three percent (n=245) corrections specifically pertained to COVID-19. Compared to corrections not pertaining to COVID-19, corrections pertaining to COVID-19 were less likely to be about spelling (0% vs 23.6%), locations (1.2% vs 16.3%), or title/degree (0% vs 10.6%), and more likely to be about a vaccine/vaccination (21.2% vs 0.3%), incidence/cases of conditions (12.2% vs 0.3%), or disease testing (7.8% vs 0.3%; p<0.001).

Compared to corrections not pertaining to COVID-19, corrections pertaining to COVID-19 were less likely to result in an equivocal tone (16.7% vs 88.8%), but they were more likely to both overstate (54.7% vs 8.5%) and understate (23.7% vs 2.4%) the situation in the original text (p<0.001). Ten reporters (of 346) accounted for 24% of the corrections. The reporter with the single most corrections accounted for 7% of the corrections.

ConclusionsDifferential tone of the corrections suggests bias in the reporting of COVID-19 topics in a top news outlet. The reporting of unbiased information is a first step in addressing issues of misinformation in public health messaging.","NA","medrxiv",1726006114639

Available data support that the burst of cytokines and bradykinin, observed in some COVID-19 patients, sustains systemic inflammation and the hypercoagulant state, thus increasing thrombotic risk. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) can play a direct role in the activation of the coagulation cascade. Adding Mpro to human plasma from healthy donors increased clotting probability by 2.5-fold. The results of enzymatic assays and degradomics analysis indicate that Mpro triggers plasma clotting by proteolytically activating coagulation factors zymogens VII and XII at their physiological activation sites, i.e. Arg152-Ile153 bond for FVII and Arg353-Val354 bond for FXII, where FVII and FXII are strategically positioned at the very beginning of the extrinsic or intrinsic pathways of blood coagulation. These findings are not compatible with the substrate specificity of the protease known so far, displaying a prevalence for a Gln-residue in P1 and a hydrophobic amino acid in P2 position. This apparent discrepancy was resolved by High Throughput Protease Screen assay, unveiling an extended, time-dependent, secondary specificity of Mpro for Arg-X bonds, which was further confirmed by Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass spectrometry analysis of Arg-containing inhibitors binding to Mpro and by enzymatic assays showing that the protease can cleave peptide substrates containing Arg in P1. Overall, integrating biochemical, proteomics and structural biology experiments, we unveil a novel mechanism linking SARS-CoV-2 infection to thrombotic complications in COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

However, the data acquisition is limited by low spatial frequency EPI artifacts; termed here as Fuzzy Ripples. These artifacts limit the practical applicability of acquisition protocols with higher spatial resolution, faster acquisition speed, and they challenge imaging in lower brain areas. Methods: We characterize Fuzzy Ripple artifacts across commonly used sequences and distinguish them from conventional EPI Nyquist ghosts, off-resonance effects, and GRAPPA artifacts. To investigate their origin, we employ dual polarity readouts. Results: Our findings indicate that Fuzzy Ripples are primarily caused by readout-specific imperfections in k-space trajectories, which can be exacerbated by inductive coupling between third-order shims and readout gradients. We also find that these artifacts can be mitigated through complex-valued averaging of dual polarity EPI or by disconnecting the third-order shim coils. Conclusion: The proposed mitigation strategies allow overcoming current limitations in layer-fMRI protocols: (1) Achieving resolutions beyond 0.8mm is feasible, and even at 3T, we achieved 0.53mm voxel functional connectivity mapping. (2) Sub-millimeter sampling acceleration can be increased to allow sub-second TRs and laminar whole brain protocols with up to GRAPPA 8. (3) Sub-millimeter fMRI is achievable in lower brain areas, including the cerebellum.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

Leveraging the phenotypic diversity in large non-clinical datasets such as the UK Biobank (UKBB), offers a potential solution to this problem. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether classification models trained on non-clinical populations will generalise to individuals with clinical OCD. This question is also relevant for the conceptualisation of OCD; specifically, whether the symptomology of OCD exists on a continuum from normal to pathological. Here, we examined a recently published ""meta-matching"" model trained on functional connectivity data from five large normative datasets (N=45,507) to predict cognitive, health and demographic variables. Specifically, we tested whether this model could classify OCD status in three independent clinical datasets (N=345). We found that the model could identify out-of-sample OCD individuals. Notably, the most predictive functional connectivity features mapped onto known cortico-striatal abnormalities in OCD and correlated with genetic brain expression maps previously implicated in OCD. Further, the meta-matching model relied upon estimates of disordered cognition, such as cognitive flexibility and inhibition, to predict OCD successfully. Overall, our findings suggest that core subclinical features associated with obsessive-compulsive variability can discriminate clinical OCD status. These results support a dimensional and transdiagnostic conceptualisation of the brain and behavioural basis of OCD, with implications for research approaches and treatment targets.","NA","medrxiv",1726006114639

The bacteria is known to establish direct physical contact with the host compartment prior to phagosome disruption. However, the impact of direct-physical contact on the phagosome remodeling and deformation remains elusive. To probe this, we first developed a method wherein we reconstitute a phagosome-like giant compartment encapsulating Mycobacterium smegmatis, a non-motile opportunistic bacterium. We discover that the direct contact between the bacteria and the encapsulating host membrane induces membrane bending, lipid wrapping, and local lipid phase separation at the contact site. The degree of phase separation is driven by the bacterial load leading to fluidization of the membrane, as evident from the decreased area stretch and bending modulus, making the host compartment more deformable. Surprisingly, for saturating bacterial load the fluid host membrane transforms into a scaffold-like rigid layer. We also find that the direct contact of the bacteria enhances the membranolytic potential of ESAT-6 thus contributing to its virulence. Together our findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of direct physical contact of the bacteria during phagosome disruption.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

However, prior studies are largely limited to European ancestry populations and differential risk by sex and ancestry has not been widely evaluated. We utilized a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach to explore APOE- associated phenotypes in the All of Us Research Program.

MethodsWe determined APOE alleles for 181,880 All of Us participants with whole genome sequencing and electronic health record (EHR) data, representing seven gnomAD ancestry groups. We tested association of APOE variants, ordered based on Alzheimers disease risk hierarchy ({varepsilon}2/{varepsilon}2<{varepsilon}2/{varepsilon}3<{varepsilon}3/{varepsilon}3<{varepsilon}2/{varepsilon}4<{varepsilon}3/{varepsilon}4<{varepsilon}4/{varepsilon}4), with 2,318 EHR-derived phenotypes. Bonferroni-adjusted analyses were performed overall, by ancestry, by sex, and with adjustment for social determinants of health (SDOH).

FindingsIn the overall cohort, PheWAS identified 17 significant associations, including an increased odds of hyperlipidemia (OR 1.15 [1.14-1.16] per APOE genotype group; P=1.8x10-129), dementia, and Alzheimers disease (OR 1.55 [1.40-1.70]; P=5x10-19), and a reduced odds of fatty liver disease (OR 0.93 [0.90-0.95]; P=1.6x10-9) and chronic liver disease. ORs were similar after SDOH adjustment and by sex, except for an increased number of cardiovascular associations in males, and decreased odds of noninflammatory disorders of vulva and perineum in females (OR 0.89 [0.84-0.94]; P=1.1x10-5). Significant heterogeneity was observed for hyperlipidemia and mild cognitive impairment across ancestry. Unique associations by ancestry included transient retinal arterial occlusion in the European ancestry group, and first-degree atrioventricular block in the American Admixed/Latino ancestry group.

InterpretationWe replicate extensive phenotypic associations with APOE alleles in a large, diverse cohort, despite limitations in accuracy for EHR-derived phenotypes. We provide a comprehensive catalog of APOE-associated phenotypes and present evidence of unique phenotypic associations by sex and ancestry, as well as heterogeneity in effect size across ancestry.

Diet is a risk factor for inflammatory bowel diseases such as CD and represents a promising adjunctive treatment, yet there are few well-controlled dietary intervention studies in CD patients. Fiber may have beneficial effects; however, most CD patients are told to avoid high-fiber foods. We conducted a longitudinal patient-preference study to examine the effect of a catered low-fat, high- fiber diet (the Mi-IBD diet) on CD symptoms, inflammation, and the microbiome.

MethodsCD patients (n=73) received one-time diet counseling (Group 1, n=23), the Mi-IBD diet (Group 2, n=26), or the Mi-IBD diet along with a healthy household control (Group 3, n=24 patient- HHC dyads). The Mi-IBD diet was catered for 8 weeks, and CD symptoms were recorded. Serum samples were collected to measure inflammatory marker levels and evaluate systemic changes via proteomic analyses (SomaScan Discovery v4.1 assays). Stool samples were collected to perform metabolomic analyses.

ResultsAt baseline, CD patients had a low-fiber, high-fat diet. One-time diet counseling did not result in dietary changes. In contrast, catering led to marked dietary changes in CD patients (increased fiber intake, decreased fat intake; all ps < 0.001) and high adherence rates (96%). Group 3 exhibited improvements in CD symptoms (PRO2 and sCDAI scores). Proteomic analysis revealed higher baseline serum levels of proinflammatory proteins (SAA and CRP) in CD patients than in HHCs; these levels decreased with the catered diet. The diet also improved fecal metabolites related to protein and energy metabolism as well as markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in CD patients.

ConclusionA nonpharmacological approach involving a high-fiber, low-fat diet to manage CD was well tolerated, even by patients with fibrostenotic CD. These findings fill a gap in development of dietary recommendations for CD patients.

Locating this root is crucial for reconstructing the features of LECA, both as the endpoint of eukaryogenesis and the start-point for the evolution of the myriad complex traits underpinning the diversification of living eukaryotes. However, the position of the root remains contentious due to pervasive phylogenetic artefacts stemming from inadequate evolutionary models, poor taxon sampling, and limited phylogenetic signal. Here, we estimate the root of the eToL with unprecedented resolution based on a new, much larger, dataset of mitochondrial proteins which includes all known eukaryotic supergroups. Our comprehensive analyses with state-of-the-art phylogenetic models reveal that the eukaryotic root lies between two multi-supergroup assemblages:  Opimoda+ and  Diphoda+. Compellingly, this position is consistently supported across different models and robustness analyses. Notably, groups containing  typical excavates are placed on both sides of the root, suggesting the complex features of the  excavate cell architecture trace back to LECA. This study is the most comprehensive phylogenetic investigation of the eukaryote root to date, shedding light on the ancestral cells from which extant eukaryotes arose and providing a crucial framework for investigating the origin and evolution of canonical eukaryotic features.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

By exploiting the mechanistic connection between the locus coeruleus (LC), a key regulator of central arousal, and pupil dynamics, we recently demonstrated that participants can gain volitional control over arousal-regulating centers including the LC using a pupil-based biofeedback approach. Here, we test whether pupil-based biofeedback modulates electrophysiological markers of cortical excitability, cortical arousal, and phasic LC activity. Combining pupil-based biofeedback with single-pulse TMS, EEG recordings, and an auditory oddball task revealed three main results: pupil self-regulation significantly modulates (i) cortical excitability, (ii) the EEG spectral slope, a marker of cortical arousal, and (iii) the P300 response to target tones, an event-related potential suggested to be tightly linked to phasic LC activity. Interestingly, pupil self-regulation strength was linearly linked to the modulation of the spectral slope, suggesting a common physiological mechanism. Here, we have shown that pupil-based biofeedback modulates fundamental aspects of brain function. Whether this method could further be used to modulate these aspects in case of disturbances associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders needs to be investigated in future studies.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

In 2021, Partners In Health established an oxygen distribution network in Lesotho to increase medical oxygen access.

MethodsWe conducted a longitudinal analysis of the implementation of an oxygen distribution network in Lesotho from November 2022 to January 2024. Oxygen delivery data were abstracted from tracking logs and analysed in Stata. Continuous and ordinal variables were summarized by medians and ranges. Categorical variables were described using frequencies and proportions.

ResultsOver the 15-month study period, the network expanded from 1 oxygen production hub serving 5 recipients to 4 hubs and 21 recipients located across nine of Lesothos ten districts. The network delivered 1,565 filled cylinders containing 9,619.23 m3 oxygen. For the 13 recipients with inpatient beds, the median monthly volume of oxygen delivered per bed was 1.43 m3 (IQR: 0.57 to 2.31).

ConclusionThis study demonstrates the feasibility and impact of an oxygen distribution network in Lesotho, providing proof-of-concept for an intervention to improve oxygen access in LMICs. By employing real-time monitoring and redundant sourcing, the network provided a reliable oxygen supply responsive to variations in demand and periods of oxygen plant downtime. This study also provides insights into facility-level oxygen consumption, which may help policymakers improve quantification and prediction of oxygen demand. Future efforts should focus on enhancing data collection, characterizing oxygen usage, and strengthening infrastructure to promote sustainable oxygen security.

KEY QUESTIONSO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSImproving access to medical oxygen is a global health priority, as underscored by World Health Assembly Resolution 76.3. Existing research has largely concentrated on facility-level interventions, establishing the impact of multifaceted strategies such as distributing oxygen concentrators, training clinicians, and strengthening supply chains.

What this study addsTo our knowledge, this is the first study to provide detailed prospective data on the operation of a national oxygen distribution system utilizing a novel ""network"" model integrating multiple production hubs. It demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach, showing improved resilience and reliability in medical oxygen supply across a broad geographic area in a LMIC.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyOur results demonstrate that oxygen distribution networks with multiple hubs can help meet regional and national oxygen demands, providing a resilient solution for strengthening oxygen ecosystems by dynamically aligning supply and demand. Additionally, these networks facilitate enhanced data collection for estimating oxygen demand, thereby informing future policy and implementation strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1726006114639

Here, we use a highly resolved dataset of 821 DOM samples covering the surface waters to the deep Atlantic, Southern, and Pacific oceans to examine molecular-level responses to warming water temperatures, i.e. their thermal responses. In general, the strength and diversity of thermal responses among individual molecules both decline towards the deep waters, but they show decreasing and increasing trends with more recalcitrant molecules in concentration, respectively. Their contrasting trends concur with the more important role of photochemical processes in explaining the diversity of thermal responses than the strength. By projecting global ocean thermal responses from 1950-2020, we predict increases in the diversity are unexpectedly largest at deeper depths (> 1,000 m). Such increases could elevate recalcitrant deep-ocean carbon sink by approximately 10 Tg C yr-1 which accounts for > 5% of the carbon flux survived to the deep ocean. Our findings highlight the importance of photochemical legacies in driving DOM thermal responses and further help predict the future oceanic carbon sink under global change.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

In addition, individual European countries developed their own risk classifications for severe COVID-19 to select individuals recommended for annual COVID-19 vaccination. We assessed the discordance between the European and respective national medical risk classifications in assigning children and adults to risk groups for developing severe COVID-19 in populations of the Netherlands and Norway.

MethodsThis multi-country, healthcare data-linkage study covered 17.4 million inhabitants of the Netherlands and 5.6 million inhabitants of Norway by 1 January 2020. Medical conditions were defined based on ICD-10 hospital discharge codes in the European and Dutch classifications, and on ICD-10 and ICPC-2 primary care codes in the Norwegian classification. Subjects were classified as high-, moderate-, or low-risk. Discordance was calculated as the proportion of the population with a different risk status in the respective national compared to the European classification.

FindingsThe overall discordance between European and national risk classification was 12.0% in the Dutch and 13.8% in the Norwegian population. The European classification assigns more individuals to high-risk (9.0% and 9.2% of the Dutch and Norwegian populations, respectively) than the national classifications (1.5% and 3.0%, respectively). National classifications define more individuals as moderate-risk (11.3% and 12.7%, respectively) than the European classification (1.0% and 1.3%, respectively). Classification discordances most frequently involved subjects with cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and diabetes mellitus.

InterpretationThe European classification defines a substantially larger percentage of the population as high-risk for severe COVID-19 than the national classifications. This may have implications for post-pandemic vaccination programs. Further research should assess to what extent the medical conditions responsible for the classification discordances determine the risk of developing severe COVID-19.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for English-language articles published from 1 January 2020 to 1 July 2024, using the search terms ((((""COVID-19""[Title] OR ""SARS-CoV-2""[Title]) AND (""sever*""[Title] OR ""hospital*""[Title] OR ""death""[Title] OR ""decease*""[Title]) AND (""chronic condition*""[Title/Abstract] OR ""comorbidit*""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""guideline""[Title] OR ""classification""[Title] OR ""system""[Title]) AND 2020/01/01:2024/07/01[Date - Create]) NOT ""clinical trial""[Publication Type]) NOT ""case reports""[Publication Type]). This search identified 64 studies, but none of them assessed the impact of different medical risk classifications for severe COVID-19 or compared them across countries or to the European classification.

Added value of this studyTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that compared the impact of European and national medical risk classifications for severe COVID-19 by assigning the populations of the Netherlands and Norway to medical risk groups using national healthcare registries. We demonstrated important discrepancies between the European and respective national schemes in classifying high- and moderate-risk individuals in both countries. The chronic conditions responsible for the classification discordances were lung disease, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and hypertension.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur comparative analysis suggests that the choice between the European and national classifications may have important consequences for public health interventions such as vaccination campaigns. The variability in risk assignment based on chronic medical conditions underscores the absence of an international uniform approach. More research is needed to determine the extent to which each chronic medical condition impacts COVID-19 severity in the post-pandemic period, facilitating the refinement of risk classifications and supporting targeted public health interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1726006114639

However, it remains uncertain whether such diverse tuning corresponds to distinct functions within the hippocampal network or if a more generic computation can account for these observations. To disentangle the contribution of externally driven cues versus internal computation, we developed a task in mice where space, auditory tones, rewards, and context were juxtaposed with changing relevance. High-density electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons were tuned to each of these modalities. By comparing movement paths and action sequences, we observed that external variables had limited direct influence on hippocampal firing. Instead, spiking was influenced by online action plans modulated by goal uncertainty. Our results suggest that internally generated cell assembly sequences are selected and updated by action plans toward deliberate goals. The apparent tuning of hippocampal neuronal spiking to different sensory modalities might emerge due to alignment to the afforded action progression within a task rather than representation of external cues.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

By altering wildlife condition, density, and behavior, provisioning can influence transmission of infectious diseases and thus may impose strong selection pressure on wildlife pathogens. But surprisingly, we lack theory on the eco-evolutionary consequences of provisioning for host-pathogen dynamics. Here we develop a mathematical model of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of a wildlife pathogen under provisioning, motivated by Mycoplasma gallisepticum, a bacterial pathogen that emerged, spread, and changed its virulence in provisioned house finches. We model how provisioning influences the evolution of pathogen virulence, defined here as mortality associated with infection. Consistent with past empirical work, house finches recover from infection and acquire incomplete immunity; this incomplete immunity is stronger if their initial infection was with a more virulent pathogen strain. We find that, even though provisioning improves body condition, it should still select for higher virulence, and thus may actually lead to declines in host populations. These negative effects arise because provisioning magnifies the impact of incomplete immunity, selecting for higher virulence and driving host populations down. Our results highlight that food provisioning can select for more virulent pathogens, with potentially far-reaching implications for conservation.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

As a COG-UK partner, Quadram Institute Bioscience (QIB) in Norfolk sequenced over 87,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, contributing to the region becoming densely sequenced. Retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 lineage dynamics in this region may contribute to preparedness for future pandemics.

Methods29,406 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences and corresponding metadata from Norfolk were extracted from the COG-UK dataset, sampled between March 2020 and December 2022, representing 9.9% of regional COVID-19 cases. Sequences were lineage typed using Pangolin, and subsequent lineage analysis carried out in R using RStudio and related packages, including graphical analysis using ggplot2.

Results401 global lineages were identified, with 69.8% appearing more than once and 31.2% over ten times. Temporal clustering identified six lineage communities based on first lineage emergence. Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants of concern (VOC) accounted for 8.6%, 34.9% and 48.5% of sequences respectively. These formed four regional epidemic waves alongside the remaining lineages which appeared in the early pandemic prior to VOC designation and were termed  pre-VOC lineages. Regional comparison highlighted variability in VOC epidemic wave dates dependent on location.

ConclusionThis study is the first to assess SARS-CoV-2 diversity in Norfolk across a large timescale within the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 was both highly diverse and dynamic throughout the Norfolk region between March 2020 - December 2022, with a strong VOC presence within the latter two thirds of the study period. The study also displays the utility of incorporating genomic epidemiological methods into pandemic response.

Recent evidence shows that LAMFs resemble cancer-associated fibroblasts, with LAMF-LEC interactions contributing to disease progression. To explore these mechanisms, we used spatial transcriptomics on LAM lung tissues and identified a gene cluster enriched in kinase signaling pathways linked to myofibroblasts and co-expressed with LEC markers. Kinase arrays revealed elevated PDGFR and FGFR in LAMFs. Using a 3D co-culture spheroid model of primary LAMFs and LECs, we observed increased invasion in LAMF-LEC spheroids compared to non-LAM fibroblasts. Treatment with sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, significantly reduced invasion, outperforming Rapamycin. We also confirmed TSC2-null AML cells as key VEGF-A secretors, which was suppressed by sorafenib in both AML cells and LAMFs. These findings highlight VEGF-A and bFGF as potential therapeutic targets and suggest multikinase inhibition as a promising strategy for LAM.

We describe how a suite of forecasts for respiratory pathogens, embedded in national and regional decision-making structures, were used to mitigate the impact on hospital systems and patient care. We developed forecasting models predicting hospital admissions and bed occupancy two weeks ahead for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV in England over winter 2023/24. Bed occupancy forecasts were informed by the ensemble admissions models. Forecasts were delivered in realtime at multiple scales. The use of sample-based forecasting allowed for effective reconciliation and trend interpretation. Admission forecasts, particularly RSV and influenza, showed high skill at regional levels. Bed occupancy forecasts had well-calibrated coverage, owing to informative admissions forecasts and slower moving trends. National admissions forecasts had mean absolute percentage errors of 27.3%, 30.9% and 15.7% for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV respectively, with corresponding 90% coverages of 0.439, 0.807 and 0.779.

Common variant analysis highlighted three longevity-associated loci: APOE, ZSCAN23, and MUC5B. We identified six genes whose burden of loss-of-function variants is significantly associated with reduced lifespan: TET2, ATM, BRCA2, CKMT1B, BRCA1 and ASXL1. Additionally, in eight genes, the burden of pathogenic missense variants was associated with reduced lifespan: DNMT3A, SF3B1, CHL1, TET2, PTEN, SOX21, TP53 and SRSF2. Most of these genes have previously been linked to oncogenic-related pathways and some are linked to and are known to harbor somatic variants that predispose to clonal hematopoiesis.

While WCMs offer deeper insights into how cells behave, they also require significant computational resources to run. Here, we show how machine learning (ML) surrogates can be used to address this limitation by training them on WCM outputs to accurately predict whether cells divide successfully across several generations when a subset of genes are removed (knocked out). Our ML surrogate achieves a 95% reduction in computational time when compared to the original WCM. We then used the surrogate and a genome-design algorithm to generate an in silico reduced E. coli cell, where 40% of the genes included in the WCM were removed. This approach illustrates how the holistic understanding provided by the WCM can be leveraged for synthetic biology tasks, while mitigating its computational burden through machine learning.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

A diverse sample of 11,868 children aged 9-10 at baseline from 22 sites across the U.S. was analyzed, assessing perceived discrimination at ages 10-11, 11-12, and 13-14 using items adapted from the Perceived Discrimination Scale. Binomial logistic regression models were used to evaluate longitudinal trends and geographic variation, adjusting for demographic factors such as race/ethnicity, parental education, and income. Results show that perceived racial discrimination increased significantly from ages 10-11 to 13-14, particularly among Black and Asian adolescents. By age 13-14, nearly half of Black adolescents and over a quarter of Asian adolescents reported discrimination. Geographic analysis revealed that Black adolescents in the Western U.S. and predominantly White affluent neighborhoods had the highest odds of perceived discrimination. Higher state-level anti-Black bias was associated with lower discrimination rates among Black adolescents but higher rates for Asian adolescents. These findings highlight the evolving nature of racial discrimination during adolescence and underscore the need for targeted interventions that address racisms mental health impacts on adolescents, particularly in high-risk geographic and socio-economic contexts.","NA","medrxiv",1726006114639

However, the prevalence of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs among Japanese has remained unclear. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and correlates of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs in Japan using a nationwide survey of 28,175 residents aged 16-81 years old.

MethodsA nationally representative, cross-sectional self-administered survey was conducted from September to October 2021. To assess the number of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, we used three questions from the Oxford Coronavirus Explanations, Attitudes, and Narratives Survey. Independent variables included general vaccine conspiracy beliefs, sociodemographic variables, information sources for COVID-19, trust in authorities, and fear of COVID-19.

ResultsAfter applying sampling weights and imputation, the estimated prevalence of holding at least one COVID-19 conspiracy belief was 24.4%. From a linear regression model, several factors were independently associated with conspiracy beliefs. Notably, people with the lowest level of education (lower secondary school) endorsed fewer COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs (B -0.089, vs. upper secondary school). Furthermore, higher socioeconomic backgrounds-such as higher income, higher wealth, and regular employment-were associated with endorsing conspiracy beliefs. Additionally, only 37.3% of respondents trusted the government of Japan, but paradoxically, trust in the government was positively associated with conspiracy beliefs (B 0.175, vs. distrust).

ConclusionsConspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 were prevalent in about a quarter of the Japanese population. Certain groups are more likely to endorse conspiracy beliefs, and targeting interventions towards these groups might be efficient in stemming the spread of conspiracy beliefs.","NA","medrxiv",1726006114639

The outer membrane protein Invasin of Yersinia is known to activate multiple integrin-{beta}1 complexes, including integrin-6{beta}1. A C-terminal integrin-binding fragment of Invasin, coated on culture plates, mediated gut epithelial cell adhesion. Addition of organoid growth factors allowed multi-passage expansion in 2D. Polarization, junction formation and generation of enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and enteroendocrine cells was stable over time. Sustained expansion of other human-, mouse-, and even snake epithelia was accomplished under comparable conditions. The 2D  organoid sheet format holds advantages over the 3D  in gel format in terms of imaging, accessibility of basal and apical domains and automation for high throughput screening.

There is no evidence of geographic population structure. Nucleotide diversity was significantly lower than in co-localized P. falciparum isolates, while linkage disequilibrium was significantly higher. Genome-wide selection scans identified no erythrocyte invasion ligands or antimalarial resistance orthologs as top hits; however, targeted analyses of these loci revealed evidence of selective sweeps around four erythrocyte invasion ligands and six antimalarial resistance orthologs.

However, most lack a formal approach to analyse the parameters and context-specific variations of these regulatory components. This study addresses this gap by establishing formal and convenient methods for characterising regulatory circuits. We model the bacterial cell as a collection of a small number of proteome fractions. Then, we derive the proteome fraction over time and obtain a general theorem describing its change as a function of its expression fraction, which represents a specific portion of the total biosynthesis flux of the cell. Formal deduction reveals that when the proteome fraction reaches a maximum, it becomes equivalent to its expression fraction. This equation enables the reliable measurement of the expression fraction through direct protein quantification. In addition, experimental data demonstrate a linear correlation between protein production rate and specific growth rate over a significant time period. This suggests a constant expression fraction within this window. The expression fractions estimated from the slopes of these intervals and those obtained from maximum protein amount points can both be independently fitted to a Hill function. In the case of an IPTG biosensor, in five cellular contexts, expression fractions determined by the maximum method and the slope method produced similar dose-response parameters. Additionally, by analysing two more biosensors, for mercury and cumate detection, we demonstrate that the slope method can be effectively applied to various systems, generating reliable Hill function parameters.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

To know its growth characteristics before parasitism, we examined the effect of various environmental conditions on seed germination and seedling growth in Cuscuta campestris. As for the effect of light on germination, far-red light was rather preferable to red light and the reversible response of the seeds to red and far-red light was confirmed, implicating a phytochrome-mediated signaling opposite to that in many seed plants. Among amino acids, aspartic acid and alanine had a promotive effect and histidine had an inhibitory effect on germination. We further found that, in addition to gibberellic acid, methyl jasmonate was stimulatory to germination and shoot elongation. While 2,4-D extended the viability of trichomes around the root cap, kinetin induced the formation of scale leaves on the shoot and calli at the base of the shoot and the root tip. RT-PCR experiments confirmed that expression of a putative RbcS gene for photosynthesis showed no response to light but that of a Phytochrome A homolog was increased in the dark. Our results indicate that some of the molecular mechanisms to respond to light and hormone signals are uniquely modified in dodder seedlings, providing a clue for understanding the survival strategy of parasitic plants.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

ME diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME patients low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1726006114639

The rapid evolution of H5 HPAIVs continues to raise concern with heightened zoonotic and pandemic risks. The immunodominant haemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA) is crucial for influenza virus receptor binding and pH-induced fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Mutations in HA are frequent due to polymerase error, immune pressure and host adaptation, resulting in antigenic modulation and/or an expansion of host tropism, respectively, ultimately hindering control strategies. We evaluated a comprehensive panel of H5 viruses representing prevalent genotypes from UK outbreaks spanning 2020 to 2022 for HA functionality. HA genes from each genotype were assessed through receptor binding, pH of fusion, thermostability and HA inhibition assays to evaluate factors contributing to zoonotic potential, stability, and antigenicity. The viruses only bound to avian receptors and exhibited fusion at a pH of 5.8, above the pH range (pH 5.0 to 5.5) associated with efficient human-to-human transmission. Therefore, these H5 viruses have low immediate zoonotic threat. Contemporary H5 viruses were more thermostable and showed antigenic drift compared to the earlier 2017-2018 clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 viruses, and N236D in HA was identified as a significant antigenic epitope. The findings of this study underscore the evolving nature of the HA of these viruses and highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance and characterisation efforts to identify factors that might contribute to zoonotic risk.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

We present a chromosome-scale genome assembly of a Bassiana duperreyi XY male individual, constructed using a combination of PacBio HiFi and ONT long reads scaffolded using Illumina HiC data. The genome assembly length is 1.57 Gb with a scaffold N50 of 222 Mbp, N90 of 26 Mbp, 200 gaps and 43.10% GC content. Most (95%) of the assembly is scaffolded into 6 macrochromosomes, 8 microchromosomes and the X chromosome, corresponding to the karyotype. Fragmented Y chromosome scaffolds (n=11 > 1 Mbp) were identified using Y-specific contigs generated by genome subtraction. We identified two novel alpha-satellite repeats of 187 bp and 199 bp in the putative centromeres that did not form higher order repeats. The genome assembly exceeds the standard recommended by the Earth Biogenome Project; 0.02% false expansions, 99.63% kmer completeness, 94.66% complete single copy BUSCO genes and an average 98.42% of transcriptome data mappable to the genome assembly. The mitochondrial genome (17,506 bp) and the model rDNA repeat unit (15,154 bp) were assembled.

To maintain the infection cycle, soil phages must travel from one suitable host to the next. However, traversing the soil matrix presents a dangerous journey for phages, which need to encounter the right hosts in this spatially complex habitat, but are not capable of active motion and can adsorb to soil particles. Here, we tested the hypothesis that bacterial-feeding nematodes (roundworms) present a reliable vehicle of soil transport for phages. First, we demonstrated that the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans vectored the laboratory model phage T7 as well as the soil phage {Phi} Ppu-W11 on agar. Sorption assays carried out with paralyzed and non-paralyzed nematodes showed that phage transport can occur via both external cuticular attachment and ingestion, and that the presence of host bacteria is not required for phage vectoring. Finally, we designed a microcosm to test phage transfer in compost and sandy soil using C. elegans and its sister species, C. remanei, respectively. This experiment confirmed that nematodes also enable phage movement through complex spatial habitats. This novel mechanism of phage vectoring extends our understanding of virus transmission in soil, revealing new multitrophic interactions that may influence soil functioning.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

In this study, we report on the neutralizing antibody (nAb) escape, infectivity, fusion, and stability of these subvariants--LB.1, KP.2.3, KP.3, and KP.3.1.1. Our findings demonstrate that all of these subvariants are highly evasive of nAbs elicited by the bivalent mRNA vaccine, the XBB.1.5 monovalent mumps virus-based vaccine, or from infections during the BA.2.86/JN.1 wave. This reduction in nAb titers is primarily driven by a single serine deletion (DelS31) in the NTD of the spike, leading to a distinct antigenic profile compared to the parental JN.1 and other variants. We also found that the DelS31 mutation decreases pseudovirus infectivity in CaLu-3 cells, which correlates with impaired cell-cell fusion. Additionally, the spike protein of DelS31 variants appears more conformationally stable, as indicated by reduced S1 shedding both with and without stimulation by soluble ACE2, and increased resistance to elevated temperatures. Molecular modeling suggests that the DelS31 mutation induces a conformational change that stabilizes the NTD and strengthens the NTD-Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) interaction, thus favoring the down conformation of RBD and reducing accessibility to both the ACE2 receptor and certain nAbs. Additionally, the DelS31 mutation introduces an N-linked glycan modification at N30, which shields the underlying NTD region from antibody recognition. Our data highlight the critical role of NTD mutations in the spike protein for nAb evasion, stability, and viral infectivity, and suggest consideration of updating COVID-19 vaccines with antigens containing DelS31.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1726006114639

This study analysed gene expression in 23 strains across six subpopulations of Lachancea thermotolerans, shaped by anthropization, under winemaking conditions to understand the impact of adaptation on transcriptomic profiles and fermentative performance, particularly regarding lactic acid production. By sequencing mRNA during exponential growth and fermentation in synthetic grape must, we identified unique expression patterns linked to the strains originated from wine-related environments. Global expression analysis revealed that anthropized subpopulations, particularly Europe/Domestic-2 and Europe-Mix, exhibited distinct gene expression profiles related to fermentation processes such as glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism. These processes were differentially expressed, along with other important biological processes during fermentation, such as nitrogen and fatty acid metabolism. This study highlights that anthropization has driven metabolic specialization in L. thermotolerans, enhancing traits like lactic acid production, which is a trait of interest in modern winemaking. Correlation analysis further linked lactic acid dehydrogenase genes with key metabolic pathways, indicating adaptive gene expression regulation. Additionally, differences in other metabolites of oenological interest as glycerol or aroma compounds production are highlighted. Here, we provide insights into the evolutionary processes shaping the transcriptomic diversity of L. thermotolerans, emphasizing the impact of winemaking environments on driving specific metabolic adaptations, including lactic acid production. Understanding the gene expression differences linked to lactic acid production could allow a more rational address of biological acidification while optimizing yeast-specific nutritional requirements during fermentation.

We have generated 3D genomic datasets consisting of promoter-focused Capture-C, Hi-C, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq and integrated these data with GWAS of 16 autoimmune traits to physically map disease-associated variants to the effector genes they likely regulate in 57 human cell types. These 3D maps of gene cis-regulatory architecture are highly powered to identify the cell types most likely impacted by disease-associated genetic variation compared to 1D genomic features, and tend to implicate different effector genes than eQTL approaches in the same cell types. Most of the variants implicated by these cis-regulatory architectures are highly trait-specific, but nearly half of the target genes connected to these variants are shared across multiple autoimmune disorders in multiple cell types, suggesting a high level of genetic diversity and complexity among autoimmune diseases that nonetheless converge at the level of target gene and cell type. Substantial effector gene sharing led to the common enrichment of similar biological networks across disease and cell types. However, trait-specific pathways representing potential areas for disease-specific intervention were identified. To test this, we pharmacologically validated squalene synthase, a cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme encoded by the FDFT1 gene implicated by our approach in MS and SLE, as a novel immunomodulatory drug target controlling inflammatory cytokine production by human T cells. These data represent a comprehensive resource for basic discovery of gene cis-regulatory mechanisms, and the analyses reported reveal mechanisms by which autoimmune-associated variants act to regulate gene expression, function, and pathology across multiple, distinct tissues and cell types.","NA","medrxiv",1726006114639

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1726006114639

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

Evolutionary transitions between sex-chromosome systems-- which change the chromosome pair that determines sex, the system of heterogamety, or both--are frequent in some clades. In others, however, sex chromosome systems show long-term stability. Previous explanations of this stasis rely on evolutionary dynamics peculiar to sex linkage, such as the accumulation of deleterious mutations on the sex-specific chromosome or sexually antagonistic mutations on either sex chromosome. Here, I show that the ordinary operation of stabilizing selection on quantitative traits can, as a by-product, promote stability of sex chromosome systems. The reason is that stabilizing selection on a trait permits individual chromosomes genetic contributions to the trait to drift upwards or downwards, subject only to the constraint that they all sum to the trait optimum. This chromosome-specific drift causes reduced fitness in individuals with unusual chromosomal constitutions, such as the novel sexual genotypes that sex chromosome turnovers always produce. The theory can explain a suite of patterns in the phylogenetic distribution of sex determining systems. Applied to interspecific hybrids, it can also explain two key observations concerning their reduced fitness: Haldanes rule and the large-X effect.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

Thus, TRAIP promotes DNA inter-strand crosslink repair by triggering the disassembly of CDC45-MCM2-7-GINS (CMG) helicases that have converged on these lesions. However, disassembly of single CMGs that have stalled temporarily would be deleterious, suggesting that TRAIP must be carefully regulated. Here, we demonstrate that human cells lacking the de-ubiquitylating enzyme USP37 are hypersensitive to topoisomerase poisons and other replication stress-inducing agents. We further show that TRAIP loss rescues the hypersensitivity of USP37 knockout cells to topoisomerase inhibitors. In Xenopus egg extracts depleted of USP37, TRAIP promotes premature CMG ubiquitylation and disassembly when converging replisomes stall. Finally, guided by AlphaFold-Multimer, we discovered that binding to CDC45 mediates USP37s response to topological stress. In conclusion, we propose that USP37 protects genome stability by preventing TRAIP-dependent CMG unloading when replication stress impedes timely termination.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

While altered ER-associated processes are linked to age-onset pathogenesis, whether shifts in ER morphology underlie these functional changes is unclear. We report that ER remodeling is a conserved feature of the aging process in models ranging from yeast to C. elegans and mammals. Focusing on C. elegans as an exemplar of metazoan aging, we find that as animals age, ER mass declines in virtually all tissues and ER morphology shifts from rough sheets to tubular ER. The accompanying large-scale shifts in proteomic composition correspond to the ER turning from protein synthesis to lipid metabolism. To drive this substantial remodeling, ER-phagy is activated early in adulthood, promoting turnover of rough ER in response to rises in luminal protein-folding burden and reduced global protein synthesis. Surprisingly, ER remodeling is a pro-active and protective response during aging, as ER-phagy impairment limits lifespan in yeast and diverse lifespan-extending paradigms promote profound remodeling of ER morphology even in young animals. Altogether our results reveal ER-phagy and ER morphological dynamics as pronounced, underappreciated mechanisms of both normal aging and enhanced longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

This positional identity is genetically encoded by PD patterning genes that instruct blastema cells to regenerate the appropriate PD limb segment. Retinoic acid (RA) is known to specify proximal limb identity, but how RA signaling levels are established in the blastema is unknown. Here, we show that RA breakdown via CYP26B1 is essential for determining RA signaling levels within blastemas. CYP26B1 inhibition molecularly reprograms distal blastemas into a more proximal identity, phenocopying the effects of administering excess RA. We identify Shox as an RA-responsive gene that is differentially expressed between proximally and distally amputated limbs. Ablation of Shox results in shortened limbs with proximal skeletal elements that fail to initiate endochondral ossification. These results suggest that PD positional identity is determined by RA degradation and RA-responsive genes that regulate PD skeletal element formation during limb regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

However, only a limited number of clade I MPXV genomes have been characterized so far, from a limited number of regions.

MethodsWe conducted whole genome sequencing of 603 mpox-positive samples that were collected from 581 patients between 2018-2024 in 17 of the 26 provinces of the DRC.

ResultsGenome coverage was at least 70% for 429/603 (71.1%) samples and near full-length MPXV genomes (>90% coverage) were obtained for 348/603 (57.7%) samples from 337 patients. All newly generated MPXV sequences belonged to clade I, among which 17 were clade Ib strains, all from patients infected in 2024 in the South-Kivu province. The large majority (>95%) of the new strains fall within previously described clade Ia groups and potential new groups have also been observed. The low number of APOBEC3 mutations found among clade Ia suggests that most human mpox cases are probably linked to zoonotic transmissions. Genetically diverse MPXV lineages co-circulate in small geographic areas during the same outbreak suggesting multiple zoonotic introductions over a short period from one or multiple reservoir species. Recent identification of mpox cases in Kinshasa shows that multiple lineages circulate in a large urban center, indicating separate introduction events.

ConclusionThe mpox epidemic in the DRC exhibits two distinct patterns. In traditional endemic regions, the epidemic is predominated by zoonotic spill-over events involving clade Ia. Conversely, in the eastern part of the country, the clade Ib outbreak is driven by human-to-human transmission highlighting the need for a coordinated response effort at the national, regional and international levels.","NA","medrxiv",1726006114639

We identified a single mutation outside of the receptor binding site, T199I, was responsible for increased binding breadth, as it increased receptor binding site flexibility. Together, these data show recent H5N1 viruses are evolving increased receptor binding breadth which could impact the host range and cell types infected with H5N1.","NA","biorxiv",1726006114639

The Cox proportional-hazards model and inverse probability of treatment weighting were employed to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs). Among homologous primary-series NVX-CoV2373 versus BNT162b2 recipients, the aHR was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.82-0.91) for all laboratory-confirmed and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.48-1.33) for severe infections. Among homologous 1st-booster recipients, it was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.61-0.90) for all laboratory-confirmed and 0.48 (95% CI: 0.12-1.92) for severe infections. At 30-days post-immunization, we observed homologous, NVX-CoV2373 primary-series and 1st-booster offered added protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection versus BNT162b2; while there was numerically lower risk of severe disease among NVX-CoV2373-vaccinated, no statistically significant differences were observed.","NA","medrxiv",1726006114639

This study compared leading commercial blood tests for amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.

MethodsPlasma samples from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were assayed with AD blood tests from C2N Diagnostics, Fujirebio Diagnostics, ALZPath, Janssen, Roche Diagnostics, and Quanterix. Outcomes measures were amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, cortical thickness, and dementia severity. Logistic regression models assessed the classification accuracies of individual or combined plasma biomarkers for binarized outcomes, and Spearman correlations evaluated continuous relationships between individual plasma biomarkers and continuous outcomes.

ResultsMeasures of plasma p-tau217, either individually or in combination with other plasma biomarkers, had the strongest relationships with all AD outcomes.

DiscussionThis study identified the plasma biomarker analytes and assays that most accurately classified amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1726006114639

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1726006114639

As IP occurs only in recall immune responses, we investigated the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of unvaccinated individual to determine whether their immune response aligned with the primary or recall immune response patterns.

Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases. The levels of antibodies correlated positively with the severity of the condition rather than a milder course. High-resolution flow cytometry of fresh PBMNCs showed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cell subsets, and cTfh, suggesting a recall response. The transcriptomic profile demonstrated that this group was directly comparable to other contemporary cohorts. Overall, these findings support the idea that the response to SARS-CoV-2 is, in most cases, a recall response, likely due to B and T memory cells to CCCV, and therefore susceptible to immune imprinting and antibody-dependent enhancement.","NA","medrxiv",1726006114639
