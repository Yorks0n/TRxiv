MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1744322954038

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1744322954038

However, the reproducibility and reliability of these findings could remain uncertain for years. Here, we implemented a multi-institutional collaborative approach to define the robust and replicable effects of the psychedelic drug psilocybin on mouse behavior. Five laboratories performed the same experiments to test the acute and persistent effects of psilocybin (2 mg/kg, IP) on various behaviors that psychedelics have been proposed to affect, including anxiety-related approach-avoidance, exploration, sociability, depression-related behaviors, fear extinction, and social reward learning. Through this coordinated approach, we found that psilocybin had several robust and replicable acute effects on mouse behavior, including increased anxiety- and avoidance-related behaviors and decreased fear expression. Surprisingly, however, we found that psilocybin did not have replicable effects 24 hours post psilocybin administration on reducing anxiety- and depression-like behaviors or facilitating fear extinction learning. Additionally, we were unable to observe psilocybin-induced alterations in social preference or social reward learning. Overall, our comprehensive characterization of psilocybin's acute and persistent behavioral effects using ~200 total male and female mice per experiment spread across five independent labs demonstrates with unique certainty several acute drug effects and suggests that psilocybin's persistent effects in mice may be more modest and inconsistent than previously suggested. We believe this unusual multi49 laboratory, highly coordinated research effort serves as a model for facilitating the generation of replicable results and consequently will reduce efforts based on unreliable and spurious results.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

However, these powerful algorithms present an intriguing paradox regarding image resolution: contrary to intuition, lower-resolution images can yield superior performance for specific image analysis carried out by deep learning. This phenomenon is particularly significant in microscopy imaging, where high-resolution acquisitions come with substantial costs in throughput, data storage requirements, and potential photodamage to specimens. Through systematic experimentation, we evaluate how varying image resolution impacts deep learning performance in cellular image segmentation tasks. We trained popular architectures on datasets downsampled to 6-50% of their original resolution, mimicking acquisitions at lower image magnification, and compared their performance against models trained on native-resolution images. Our results show that segmentation accuracy either improves (by up to 25% of mean Intersection over Union (IoU)) or experiences only minimal degradation (<5% of mean IoU) when using images downsampled by up to a factor of 4 (25% of the original resolution). This downsampling proportionally increases information throughput while reducing data storage requirements and inference time. With these findings, we contribute systematic guidelines to deep learning practitioners in creating efficient experimental pipelines for image-driven discoveries. This approach improves the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of bioimaging studies by reducing data and computing needs while optimising microscopy techniques.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

Here we combine advanced image processing and the bubbly vertex model for epithelial cell shape to achieve a fully three-dimensional reconstruction of cell shapes and forces during the development of mouse intestinal organoids. We show that the transition to budded morphologies is caused by a global increase in apical tension, which however is not maintained after budding, suggesting ratchet-like non-reversibility. We further demonstrate that luminal pressure decreases and basal line tensions increase during development, thus facilitating budding on the apical side, but at the same time mechanically stabilizing the system at the basal side, for example against cell extrusion. Our approach demonstrates how one can achieve a complete mechanical analysis of a complex tissue-like system.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

We present BromoCatch, a novel SLP platform based on a small [~]13 kDa bromodomain (BD) engineered with a nucleophilic cysteine for covalent ligand engagement. A structure-based designed library of 16 ""bumped"" binders bearing diverse electrophilic warheads was screened against two different cysteine mutants using differential scanning fluorimetry and intact protein mass spectrometry to monitor covalent complex formation. The para-acrylamide bumped derivative MR116 and the Brd4-BD2 double mutant L387A,E438C formed the most potent and stable adduct, and its binding mode through covalent modification was confirmed by an X-ray cocrystal structure solved to 1.3 [A] of resolution. BromoCatch exhibited potent and irreversible target engagement in cells through nanoBRET and residence time assays. Practicality and scope are further demonstrated through the design and proof-of-concept application of a biotinylated conjugate, PROTAC tag degraders, and fluorescent probes of both full-on and switch-on types for ex-cellulo and live-cell imaging. Together, we qualify BromoCatch as a novel, versatile and efficient protein labelling tool and technology platform. Its advantageous design features and kinetic fitness, and its modular design enabling diverse functionalities, are anticipated to usher a range of future applications and witness broad utility.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

This is because it is especially useful for incorporating fossil data into such analyses, integrating fossils along with their age information directly into the tree as tips or sampled ancestors. Two approaches are common for placing fossil taxa in trees: inference based on morphological character data or using taxonomic constraints to control their topological placement. These approaches have historically been treated as alternatives, though combining the two is theoretically possible. For phylogenetic inference of entirely extinct organisms, additional related fossil taxa other than those for which morphology is available are generally overlooked. Here, we implement a combined approach on an empirical dataset for a group of trilobites. We use a morphological matrix and ages for 56 taxa and age information for another 196 taxa from the Paleobiology Database. To evaluate the effects of a combined approach, we conducted FBD dated phylogenetic analyses using a combined approach with morphology and taxonomic constraints and compared them to analyses of taxa with morphology alone. We find that a combined approach yields topologies that are more stratigraphically congruent, substantially more precise parameter estimates (e.g., divergence times), and more informative tree distributions. These findings are a consequence of the substantial increase in stratigraphic age information and a more representative sample of their temporal distributions.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

A protein destined for degradation is first tagged with a polyubiquitin chain, which is selected by the proteasome. Different ubiquitin chain topologies serve as distinct signals, with K48-linked chains acting as the canonical degradation signal and K11/K48-branched chains providing even more potent targeting, particularly during cell cycle regulation. However, the structural basis for how the proteasome distinguishes between these different chain architectures has remained unclear. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the human 26S proteasome bound to both a K48-linked tetraubiquitin chain and a K11/K48-branched chain. Our structures reveal distinct binding modes for these two types of chain linkage. K48 chains wrap around the Ubiquitin interaction motif of the receptor RPN10 in an unexpected spiral conformation, while K11 branches engage the proteasome through previously uncharacterised interfaces in a cleft formed between RPN2 and RPN10. Through structure-guided mutagenesis and cellular studies, we demonstrate that these binding modes are essential for efficient substrate degradation and cell cycle progression. These findings establish how the proteasome achieves selective substrate recognition through chain topology-specific interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

We studied the consequences of EPB41L4A-AS1 perturbation in breast cancer cells and found that it acts both in cis, to enhance transcription of the proximal EPB41L4A gene and additional genes in its two flanking topologically associated domains, and in trans by broadly regulating gene expression, including expression of snoRNAs, transcription of genes involved in nucleolar biology and the distribution of nucleolar proteins.

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

These motifs interact with the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains of the KLCs. The mechanism coupling SLiM recognition to activation-associated conformational changes in the complex is unknown. Here we combine protein design, computational modelling, biophysical analysis, and electron microscopy to examine the structural and mechanistic consequences of SLiM binding to the KLC-TPR domain within the complete heterotetrameric holoenzyme. We show that coiled coil 1 (CC1) of the KHC docks KLC TPR domains in the autoinhibited complex, forming the ""shoulder"" feature observed in electron microscopy. Disrupting this interaction or binding an activating SLiM dislocates the TPR shoulder, freeing the motor domains and promoting transition between its closed, inactive, and open states. Therefore, cargo-mediated dislocation of the TPR shoulder serves as a key initial step in kinesin-1 activation, allosterically linking cargo binding to motor dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

While many existing studies have primarily focused on omics data, they often fail to integrate clinical heterogeneity, which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of disease biology. Although significant progress has been made in researching crosstalks between inter-pathways and inter-cells, and tools like CellChat have emerged to analyze these interactions, they have notable limitations. These include the assumption that mRNA expression directly reflects protein activity, a heavy reliance on pre-established ligand-receptor interactions, and an inability to connect ""chats"" with clinical phenotypes. Furthermore, existing methods have limitations in distinguishing between paracrine signaling (interactions between different cell types) and autocrine signaling (self-signaling within the same cell type). These limitations hinder the ability to translate molecular insights into phenotypic outcomes, thereby limiting clinical applicability. To provide another solution for these challenges, we introduce RNAchat, a novel approach that utilizes machine learning techniques to identify metapathways for crosstalks among pathways at not only the bulk level but also cell types at the single-cell level, incorporating both clinical and multi-omics data. Results: RNAchat provides another solution by providing an interactive, reproducible platform designed to analyse metapathways between inter-pathways and inter-cell types using multi-omics level data in a clinical context. This tool enables researchers to integrate diverse datasets, conduct exploratory analyses, and identify cooperated pathways. The platform facilitates hypothesis generation and produces intuitive visualizations to support further investigation. As a proof of concept, we applied RNAchat to connect omics data to pain, drug resistance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), disease severity to RA and Heart Failure (HF). We discovered cooperated molecular pathways associated with different treatments using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) values. Then, we demonstrated how to use it to find cellular interactions at single cell level. Last but not the least, we further extended crosstalk exploration between host and parasites and found potential novel important pathways interaction not mentioned by previous studies. Conclusion: We introduce RNAchat, a computational platform designed to identify pathway communications with clinical and multi-omics data in real-time. This tool supports both user-generated and publicly available datasets, offering a robust solution and enhancing our understanding of complex diseases such as RA and HF.

To achieve such cognitive flexibility, the brain is wired by plastic synapses that are hotspots of energy consumption. Supplying energy to distant synapses is challenging as they are distributed throughout dendrites and axons, spanning hundreds of microns from their cell body. Synapses, therefore, require an instant and local energy supply provided by mitochondria stabilized near dendritic spines. However, the mechanisms by which synapses communicate their energy demands to locally stable mitochondria to drive local energy production and sustain synaptic plasticity is unknown. Using highly sensitive spine- and mitochondrial ATP reporters and two-photon glutamate uncaging to stimulate individual spines, we find that synaptic plasticity input drives instant and sustained increase in spine ATP levels, provided by local ATP synthesis in ~10-20 m spatially confined compartments within mitochondria. This spatially localized mitochondrial ATP generation is driven by a spatially localized mitochondrial calcium influx independent of the endoplasmic reticulum. Notably, the initial spine ATP increase, supported by local mitochondrial ATP synthesis, is independent of CaMKII and the energy demands of spine structural plasticity. Without local calcium signaling and mitochondrial stabilization, synapses do not meet their instant and sustained energy needs, resulting in synaptic plasticity defects, as observed in neurological disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

These breaks are scheduled to maintain tolerably high levels of tumor burden, employing competitive suppression of treatment-resistant sub-populations by treatment-sensitive sub-populations. AT has been integrated into several ongoing or planned clinical trials, including treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and BRAF-mutant melanoma, with initial clinical results suggesting that it can offer significant extensions in the time to progression over the standard of care.

However, these clinical protocols may be sub-optimal, as they fail to account for variation in tumor dynamics between patients, and result in significant heterogeneity in patient outcomes. Mathematical modeling and analysis have been proposed to optimize adaptive protocols, but they do not account for clinical restrictions, most notably the discrete time intervals between the clinical appointments where a patients tumor burden is measured and their treatment schedule is re-evaluated. We present a general framework for deriving optimal treatment protocols which account for these discrete time intervals, and derive optimal schedules for a number of models to avoid model-specific personalization. We identify a trade-off between the frequency of patient monitoring and the time to progression attainable, and propose an AT protocol based on a single treatment threshold. Finally, we identify a subset of patients with qualitatively different dynamics that instead require a novel AT protocol based on a threshold that changes over the course of treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1744322954038

Early cases were associated with this market, and environmental sequencing placed the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity within the market. Phylogenetic analysis also suggested separate introductions of lineages A and B into the human population, a finding that can be tested with additional data. Here, we curated an expanded sequence dataset of early SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes, including newly available sequences from mid-January 2020. In this dataset, we found no additional support for previously proposed alternative progenitor sequences, or for any evolutionary intermediates between lineages A and B in the human population. Instead, we identified SARS-CoV-2 lineages that may have spread from the market, and additional samples of a sublineage of lineage A with three mutations, including one found in closely related bat coronaviruses. Although our analysis of early pandemic genomes suggests that this mutation is unlikely to characterize the immediate SARS-CoV-2 ancestor, it is more plausible than two previously proposed ancestral genomes. These findings reinforce the proposed emergence of SARS-CoV-2 from the wildlife trade at the Huanan market, demonstrating how new data continues to both solidify and clarify our understanding of how the pandemic began.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

Identifying genes involved in specialized metabolism remains difficult. While coexpression analysis is a widely used approach to identify genes acting in the same pathway or process, it has limitations, particularly in distinguishing genes coexpressed due to shared regulatory triggers from those directly involved in the same pathway. To enhance functional predictions, integrating phylogenetic analysis provides an additional layer of confidence by considering evolutionary conservation. Here, we introduce CoExpPhylo, a computational pipeline that systematically combines coexpression analysis and phylogenetics to identify candidate genes involved in specialized biosynthetic pathways across multiple species based on one to multiple bait gene candidates. Results CoExpPhylo systematically integrates coexpression information and phylogenetic signals to identify candidate genes involved in specialized biosynthetic pathways. The pipeline consists of multiple computational steps: (1) species-specific coexpression analysis, (2) local sequence alignment to identify orthologs, (3) clustering of candidate genes into Orthologous Coexpressed Groups (OCGs), (4) functional annotation, (5) global sequence alignment, (6) phylogenetic tree generation, and optionally (7) visualization. The workflow is highly customizable, allowing users to adjust correlation thresholds, filtering parameters, and annotation sources. Benchmarking CoExpPhylo on multiple pathways, including anthocyanin, proanthocyanidin, and flavonol biosynthesis, confirmed its ability to recover known genes while also suggesting novel candidates. Conclusion CoExpPhylo provides a systematic framework for identifying candidate genes involved in the specialized metabolism. By integrating coexpression data with phylogenetic clustering, it facilitates the discovery of both conserved and lineage-specific genes. The resulting OCGs offer a strong foundation for further experimental validation, bridging the gap between computational predictions and functional characterization. Future improvements, such as incorporating multi-species reference databases and refining clustering for large gene families, could further enhance its resolution. Overall, CoExpPhylo represents a valuable tool for accelerating pathway elucidation and advancing our understanding of specialized metabolism in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

There has been increasing evidence for post-transcriptional control of SPI gene expression by Hfq-dependent small RNAs (sRNAs) such as PinT. This 80-nucleotide sRNA is highly expressed after Salmonella enters host cells and modulates the transition from the SPI-1 to SPI-2 program by targeting different virulence factor mRNAs. It has been elusive, however, how PinT activity could be counteracted when virulence gene suppression were to be relieved. To identify putative inhibitors of PinT, we have mapped the RNA interactome of Salmonella recovered from infected macrophages, using an optimized version of the RIL-seq method. Next to offering an unprecedented view of Hfq-mediated RNA interactions during Salmonellas intracellular infection stage, RIL-seq uncovered the 3 end-derived sRNA InvS as a direct negative regulator of PinT. Biochemical and genetic experiments suggest a decoy mechanism whereby InvS lifts the PinT-mediated repression of virulence factors. Additionally, InvS acts as an mRNA repressor of the host cell adhesion protein, MipA, and PinT interaction with InvS relieves mipA repression. Together, our work identifies a unique pair of antagonistic sRNAs in a growing post-transcriptional network of virulence gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

However, a key challenge is to interpret these models to relate the sequence rules to underlying biological processes. This task is especially difficult for complex genomic readouts such as MNase-seq, which maps nucleosome occupancy but is confounded by experimental bias. To overcome these limitations, we introduce pairwise influence by sequence attribution (PISA), an interpretation tool that combinatorially decodes which bases are responsible for the readout at a specific genomic coordinate. PISA visualizes the effects of transcription factor motifs, uncovers previously hidden motifs with complex contribution patterns, and reveals experimental biases of genomics assays. Inte-grated into a deep learning suite called BPReveal, PISA enables accurate MNase-seq nucleosome prediction models with reduced experimental bias, allowing the de novo discovery of motifs that mediate nucleosome positioning and the design of sequences with altered nucleosome configurations. These results show that PISA is a versatile tool that expands our ability to extract novel cis-regulatory sequence rules from genomics data, paving the way towards deciphering the cis-regulatory code.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

However, how adaptive TEs arise in populations and historical contingencies affect TE dynamics remains unknown. Fungal pathogens in agriculture provide unique frameworks to address such questions due to the availability of spatially explicit sampling and well-characterized niche conditions. We characterised TE evolutionary dynamics using an extensive intraspecies sampling of 1,953 genomes across the global distribution range of the major fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Employing a pangenomic approach, we characterise genomic diversity and benchmark methods to robustly infer TE insertion polymorphism, before systematically assessing TEs as a source of adaptive variation. We annotated [~]3.2 million TE loci among genomes, finding substantial variation in TE content within and among populations. TE activity surged during the pathogens expansion from its centre of origin in the Middle East, with unique TE activity profiles arising in derived populations. TE-mediated adaptation emerged from distinct waves of TE mobilization. The highest rates of TE activity were observed over timescales as short as 25 years. 45 TE loci showing local adaptation signatures within 1kb of 49 host genes were identified, with adaptive TE insertions likely related to adaptation to antifungals and the plant host environment. This work highlights the power of vast genomic datasets to unravel intraspecies TE invasion histories and pinpoint factors likely driving recent adaptation. This argues for a shift in focus to incorporate deep population-level TE activity surveys in our pursuit to uncover the molecular drivers of adaptive evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

By sub-second live imaging of injured zebrafish larval fins, we identify events across timescales: a millisecond tissue depolarization gradient, followed by seconds-persistent intracellular Calcium responses. Subsequently within one hour, Voltage Sensing Phosphatase activity translates depolarisation into proliferation. Connecting these timescales with an electro-diffusive model showed that ionic fluxes and electric potential become coupled in the fins interstitial space, enabling organ-wide signal spreading.

These models rely on tokenizers to split input sequences into manageable chunks --- a straightforward task in natural language but more challenging for long DNA sequences that lack distinct ""words"". Most biological tokenizers are data-driven and do not align with ""the central dogma of molecular biology"": DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins, with each three-letter codon specifying a particular amino acid, some of which are synonymous for the amino acids they represent. Start codons signal the beginning of protein synthesis, while stop codons signal its termination. The Genomic Tokenizer (GT) incorporates this biological process flow into a standard tokenizer interface within the HuggingFace transformer package. GT can be used to pre-train foundational transformer models on DNA sequences. We compare the performance of GT with two alternate tokenization strategies and discuss its potential applications. Availability and implementation: The source code of GT is available from https://github.com/dermatologist/genomic-tokenizer under the MPL-2.0 license.

Unfortunately, the extent to which microbiomes from different populations are characterised is limited by their economic resources. Over 70% of the sequenced human microbiomes come from analyses of European and North American populations, skewing our understanding by focusing excessively on just 15% of the global population. Thus, entire continents rely on results from research conducted in wealthier countries whose main findings are unlikely to generalize across other world regions. Moreover, statistical models perform poorly when applied to minorities, a blind spot with serious consequences in biomedicine, and which can only be addressed by analysing microbiome data from currently neglected areas. To address this problem, we created saMBA, the largest archive of gut microbiomes from South America, one of the worlds most biodiverse regions in terms of the gut microbiome of its inhabitants, yet the one with the fewest samples. ""saMBA"" includes 33 gut microbiome studies, ~73% of which were incorporated in a microbiome archive for the first time.

Circadian timing in plants is governed by an oscillator gene network of transcriptional regulators that exists in each cell. Wheat provides an opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of the plant circadian oscillator in an important agricultural species. We recently found that a single oscillator component EARLY FLOWERING 3 is expressed at a different time in wheat compared to the model plant Arabidopsis. This was unexpected since there is remarkable conservation of timing of activity of the different oscillator components within a kingdom, for example, even when animals switch from nocturnal to diurnal activity. We have examined how the change in timing of ELF3 transcription between Arabidopsis and wheat has occurred and its implications for circadian oscillator function. We describe an optimised computational model of the wheat circadian oscillator that is informed by experimental data and the structure of the promoter elements driving oscillator gene expression. Our optimised computational models suggest that the dawn-expression of the key oscillator gene ELF3 in wheat occurs due to repression of the ELF3 promoter by TOC1. Our simulations predict that plant circadian oscillators are robust against changes in ELF3 timing. Our work demonstrates that plant circadian oscillators can have a flexible architecture such that different oscillator structures can originate circadian rhythms.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

Despite being the first recombinant therapeutic approved by the FDA, insulin remains challenging to access for many around the globe. Here we report on advancements in manufacturing insulin using cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems to rapidly produce mature desB30-insulin in less than a day. This is a major advance towards decentralizing insulin manufacturing and bringing production closer to the point-of-care, thereby improving diabetic patient accessibility. To this end, a purified cell-free extract, PUREfrex(R) 2.1, was utilized to synthesize a tagged proinsulin construct that can be captured and converted into mature insulin using an on-column affinity chromatography process. Notably, two chaperones, peptidyl prolyl isomerase (FkpA), and seven kilodalton protein (Skp) were observed to play a critical role during cell-free expression of proinsulin. The proinsulin was then immobilized on a Ni-NTA column where the purification and conversion of cell-free products were performed sequentially to yield desB30-insulin. Following further optimization, this method serves as a time and resource-efficient production process as compared to current methods. When applied simultaneously, the cell-free expression and on-column conversion methods reported here can be adopted to enable rapid on-demand insulin manufacturing in order to improve the accessibility of insulin and prevent future shortages.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

LeafCutter2 requires minimal gene annotations (start and stop codons) to annotate NMD-inducing splicing events, and identifies differential unproductive splicing between groups, providing insights into its contributions to differential gene expression. Moreover, LeafCutter2 enables mapping of unproductive splicing quantitative trait loci (u-sQTLs), which often colocalize with expression QTLs and GWAS loci. Applying LeafCutter2 to RNA-seq data across human and 6 non-human species, we uncovered a broad landscape of unproductive splicing, which varies widely across tissues. Strikingly, we observed a conserved developmental-stage-specific increase in unproductive splicing during testis maturation across all species. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), we analyzed RNA-seq data from the AD Functional Genomics consortium FunGen-xQTL project and identified unproductive splicing events in 18 AD risk genes, including TSPAN14, PICALM, and CASS4, likely mediating genetic effects on disease risk.

How these two large-scale collective cell movements cooperate remains unclear. Here, we examine the cell mechanics and tissue dynamics underlying epiboly of the chicken blastoderm. We found that cells at the blastoderm edge undergo a wetting-like process to spread on the vitelline membrane through stiffness sensing and cytoskeleton remodelling. This interaction is robust to edge cell loss and cooperates with cell-proliferation-based blastoderm growth to drive epiboly. Surprisingly, epiboly in turn remodels the extracellular matrix (ECM) to establish a basal lamina and maintain cell-cell connections. Impairing either edge cell wetting or the ECM causes tissue thickening and buckling across the blastoderm, disrupting gastrulation movements. We conclude that epiboly facilitates gastrulation by organizing an ECM that maintains a thin blastoderm. These findings suggest a general logic of mechanical coupling between distinctly controlled tissue movements during early development.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

Immunohistochemical analysis of the synaptic architecture of these spinal circuits has been notoriously difficult in formaldehyde-fixed tissue and often requires antigen retrieval techniques to reveal antigen binding epitopes. To avoid the damage this harsh treatment can induce, studies have used antibodies raised against scaffolding proteins Homer1 and gephyrin, which anchor glutamate and GABA receptors to the membrane, respectively, to identify synaptic associations in rodent spinal cord underlying pain and itch transmission. In contrast, few studies have attempted to visualise spinal cord synapses in the human, partly due to a lack of high-quality tissue with low postmortem intervals. In this study, we reveal both excitatory and inhibitory synapses at a high resolution in human lumbar spinal cord tissue using antibodies to Homer1 and gephyrin and show that the basic organisation of these proteins within the dorsal horn is similar to that seen in the rodent. We show these postsynaptic markers are highly colocalised with glutamate and GABA receptor subunits and are in close apposition to presynaptic markers, confirming their specificity. Finally, we use Homer1-immunolabelling to demonstrate that primary afferents can form complex synaptic arrangements in human. We conclude that these antibodies can be used as reliable tools for the study of the human CNS and we have used them to reveal insight into the microanatomy of somatosensory connections in the human spinal cord that can be expanded upon in future studies.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

The fungus was found in 11 locations across France and two locations in the Netherlands. The identification was based on an analysis of morphological characteristics and ITS rDNA sequences. The pathogenicity was confirmed through reinoculation using fresh urediniospores. This represents the first record of U. plumbarius outside its native range in North America. Its widespread distribution in France appears to result from rapid dissemination, likely facilitated by the plant trade between nursery gardeners.

Using genetic complementation, we demonstrate that disease-associated UBE3C mutations alter its autoubiquitination activity and disrupt cortical lamination. Proteomic profiling of UBE3C-deficient forebrains and organoids identifies Cbll1 as a UBE3C substrate, and we show that the UBE3C-Cbll1 duo drives N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA methylation. Hyperactivation of m6A writers in UBE3C-deficient neural progenitors impairs cell cycle exit, a defect reversible in vivo by the METTL3 inhibitor STM2457.

The jump model has been completely solved analytically and provides the exact distribution of syntenic gene block lengths (SBL) in compared genomes based on gene translocations alone. Comparing the SBL distribution predicted by the jump model with the distributions empirically observed for multiple groups of closely related bacterial and archaeal genomes, we obtained robust estimates of the genome rearrangement to gene flux (gain and loss) ratio. In most groups of bacteria and archaea, this ratio was found to be on the order of 0.1 indicating that the loss of synteny in the evolution of bacteria and archaea is driven primarily by gene gain and loss rather than by gene translocation.

A key component of such studies is the protection function, the mathematical relationship between the value of an immunological assay and the relative risk of disease. This function is often estimated using lo-gistic regression, comparing the odds of disease at a given assay value to the odds at assay value zero. Here, we show through mathematical analysis and simulation experiments that logistic regression, while common, fundamentally constrains the functional forms of protection that can be inferred from data in TNDs, potentially leading to overly simplistic estimates of the protection function. To address this limitation, we adapt and analyze a scaled logit model, originally developed for case-control data, as a flexible alternative that allows for greater flexibility in estimating protection functions from TND data. We demonstrate that this approach improves accuracy across a range of biologically plausible protection functions, highlight conditions under which it may fail, and provide practical guidance for researchers to adopt it as a new standard for TND studies evaluating correlates of protection.","NA","medrxiv",1744322954038

Reinforcement learning (RL) has provided a computational framework to study this process, and neural signals linked to RL have been identified in the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex. More recently, hippocampal contributions to this kind of value-learning have been proposed, at least under some conditions. Here, we test whether the hippocampus provides a signal of the option's identity that aids in credit assignment when learning about several perceptually similar items, and evaluate how this process differs across the lifespan. A sample of 251 younger and older adults, including a subset (n = 76) with simultaneous fMRI, completed an RL task in which they learned the value of four houses through trial-and-error. Older adults showed decreased choice accuracy, accompanied by reduced neural signaling of value at choice but not feedback. Using representational similarity analysis, we found that the precision with which choice options were represented in the posterior hippocampus during choice predicted accurate decisions across age groups. Interestingly, despite previous evidence for neural de-differentiation in older adults, we found no support for a ""blurring"" of these stimulus representations in older adults. Rather, we observed reduced connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and the medial PFC in older adults, and this connectivity correlated with choice consistency. Taken together, these findings identify a hippocampal contribution to incremental value learning, and that reductions in incremental value learning in older adults are associated with the reduced transfer of information between the hippocampus and mPFC, rather than the precision of the information in the hippocampus itself.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

This study's goal was to determine prospective registration, results reporting, trial registration number reporting, and publication accessibility status for trials with primary completion dates from 2014 to 2017 affiliated with seven California universities. Methods: We identified trials with investigators, sponsors, or responsible parties affiliated with seven California universities and searched for their results publications manually. We then used semi-automatic methods to determine prospective registration, summary results reporting in a registry, publication status, and reporting of registration numbers in the abstract and the full text of manuscripts. Results: We identified 1,091 unique trials. Most trials were single-center (n=752, 69%) and had a median of 50 participants (IQR 21 to 150). Overall, 64% of trials (n=698) were prospectively registered, 46% (n=500) had summary results reported in the registry, 69% (n=750) had results published as articles, and an additional 3% (n=36) as abstracts or posters.

The DNA sensor IFI16 binds nascent DNA at stalled replication forks and signals via the DNA sensing adaptor STING, to induce the activation of NF-{kappa}B and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to replication stress. IFI16 also acts directly at stalled replication forks to protect nascent DNA from degradation by the nucleases MRE11 and DNA2.

Here, we show in mice that feeding of antigen-containing diet generates in mesenteric lymph nodes and intestinal lamina propria peripherally derived regulatory T (pTreg) cells that exhibit a terminally differentiated effector phenotype as seen with tissue-resident thymus-derived Treg (tTreg) cells. Antigen feeding also enables the generated pTreg cells to acquire Treg-specific epigenomic changes in Treg signature genes including Foxp3, hence the stability of Treg-specific function. Cessation of antigen feeding, however, results in decline in oral tolerance with diminution of pTreg cells. Transcriptomic comparison with tTreg cells has revealed that pTreg cells induced by antigen feeding predominantly express CD101. CD101+ Treg cells with a similar phenotype and epigenetic alterations can be generated in vitro from antigen-primed naive CD4+ T cells by blockade of CD28-mediated co-stimulation during TGF-{beta}-dependent Treg induction. Furthermore, in vivo CD28 signal blockade by CTLA-4-immunoglobulin fusion protein (CTLA4-Ig) before antigen feeding can establish oral tolerance in the mice precedingly antigen-sensitized by a non-oral route. The CTLA4-Ig treatment not only suppresses activation of antigen-reactive conventional T cells but also facilitates their differentiation into antigen-specific CD101+ pTreg cells. Thus, continuous oral antigen administration combined with CD28 co-stimulation blockade generates a specific type of antigen-specific functionally stable pTreg cells, which can establish long-term systemic antigen-specific immune tolerance even in antigen-pre-sensitized animals. This strategy for mucosal tolerance induction would be instrumental in treating chronic allergy and other immunological diseases in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

The mechanisms linking this peripheral disease to cognitive symptoms are thought to include heightened circulating cytokines and other inflammatory mediators resulting in a leaky blood-brain barrier and increased neuroinflammation (i.e., inflammation taking place in the brain). This can lead to aberrant synaptic transmission and cognitive dysfunction. A key component of neuroinflammation is the reactivity of astrocytes, in a process termed astrogliosis, associated with altered morphology, proliferative capacity, gene expression, and function. Accumulating evidence suggests astrogliosis likely occurs in mild to moderate COVID-19 ; however, there has been limited investigation. In this study, we quantified changes to astrocytes in a Syrian hamster model of mild to moderate respiratory COVID-19. Methods: We used an intranasal inoculation model to produce mild to moderate respiratory COVID-19 in 8-10-week-old male and female Syrian hamsters. We extracted brains at 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 31-days post-inoculation and from uninfected controls, and immunolabelled brain sections with astrocyte- (GFAP and SOX9) and neuron-specific (NEUN) markers. We captured tiled confocal micrographs of entire brain sections and analyzed the resulting signals from five regions of interest: cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, third ventricle, and dorsal striatum. Results: To systematically quantify cell-type-specific labelling for astrogliosis markers, we first developed an unbiased pipeline. We found a transient increase in GFAP signal density in female hamster, specifically in the cortex at 3 days post-inoculation. There were no corresponding changes noted in astrocyte (SOX9), neuron (NEUN) or total cell (Hoechst) numbers. Moreover, there were no changes in male hamsters at any timepoint in any region of interest. Conclusions: Our findings provide the first spatiotemporal insight into astrogliosis in a hamster model of mild to moderate respiratory COVID-19. We identified a transient and sex-specific increase in GFAP signal density, indicative of astrogliosis. Our findings contribute to the literature surrounding sex differences in (neuro)immune responses and add to the growing body of COVID-19 literature, in which sex-specific outcomes are apparent in both human patient populations and rodent experimental models.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

Species distribution models (SDMs) are used for understanding where species live or could potentially live and are a key resource for ecological research and conservation decision-making. However, current SDM methods often perform poorly for rare or inadequately sampled species, which includes most species on earth as well as most of those of the greatest conservation concern. 2. Here, we evaluate the performance of three recently developed modeling approaches specifically designed for data-deficient situations: 1) plug-and-play modeling, 2) density-ratio modeling, and 3) environmental-range modeling. We compare the performance of these methods with Maxent, a widely used method. We compare model performance across sample sizes as well as comparisons limited to only data-poor species. We also ask to what extent model cross-validation performance on training data was correlated with model performance on independent, presence-absence data. 3. We show that, across all species, one or more of the plug-and-play, density-ratio, or environmental-range algorithms outperformed Maxent in 72% of cases, with three of the algorithms having AUC distributions not significantly different from Maxent's. For data-poor species (those with 20 or fewer occurrences), 24 of the algorithms considered had AUC distributions that were not significantly different from Maxent. However, despite these comparable AUC scores, we found that the algorithm outputs (when thresholded to predict presence vs absence) spanned a wide gradient of sensitivity vs. specificity. Specificity and prediction accuracy assessed on training data were strongly correlated with specificity and prediction accuracy assessed on independent presence-absence data, however AUC and sensitivity had weak correlations. We found that only for 16% of species was the model that performed best on the training data the best performing model when evaluated on independent, presence-absence data. Finally, we show how ensembles of models that span the sensitivity-specificity gradient can represent model disagreement in poorly sampled species and improve model predictions. 4.This work supports plug-and-play, density-ratio, and environmental-range modeling as useful alternatives to Maxent, particularly for data-deficient species. While our work suggests that identifying the best model for a given species is challenging, we argue that incorporating the predictions of multiple models provides a useful way forward.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

While vaccination played a key role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, variants of concern (VOC) with immune evasive substitutions emerged on multiple occasions, causing widespread breakthrough infections. The combined threats of zoonosis and newly emerging VOCs, coupled with the potential for recombination, underscore the need to assess the breadth of existing vaccine-mediated protection. Here, we investigate a cohort of older individuals (median age 68.5 years) for the potential of cross-neutralisation against Omicron lineage VOC and animal sarbecoviruses induced by four COVID-19 vaccine doses. Despite the recent use of a bivalent mRNA vaccine dose (encoding spike from Wu-1 and omicron), we observed that neutralisation of Omicron lineage VOCs such as BA.1 and BA.2 were reduced compared to SARS-CoV-2 Wu-1, suggesting an imprinted immune response from pre-Omicron lineage viruses. Similarly, both SARS-CoV-1 and a SARS-CoV-1-related bat CoV were neutralised less efficiently than SARS-CoV-2 Wu-1. Unexpectedly, however, we observed that two animal SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, BANAL-20-52 (from bats) and a pangolin-CoV, were more sensitive to serum neutralising antibodies than SARS-CoV-2 Wu-1 itself. These surprising findings suggest that vaccine-mediated adaptive immunity may provide efficient cross-protection against certain animal sarbecoviruses.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

Many recent studies have quantified their adverse events with a focus on gastrointestinal adverse events. However, no large epidemiologic study has investigated the risk of hair loss with these medications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone. The adjusted hazard ratio for hair loss for all patients using semaglutide, for men, and for women compared to bupropion-naltrexone were 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.86-2.69), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.05-14.49), and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.17-3.72) respectively. Our results demonstrate an increased risk of hair loss with semaglutide in women. Future studies are required to ascertain the association between semaglutide and hair loss.","NA","medrxiv",1744322954038

In nature, protein folds are well-conserved over the course of evolution, such that there are 100,000 times as many extant protein sequences than there are folds. Despite their common shapes, similar protein folds can adopt wide-ranging functions, raising the question: are protein folds so strongly conserved for the purpose of maintaining function-driving energetic changes in protein families? Here we show that a set of key energetic relationships in a family of bacterial transcription factors (TFs) is conserved using high-resolution hydrogen exchange/mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations. We compared the TFs to their anciently diverged structural homologs, the periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs), expecting that protein families that share the same fold and bind the same sugars would have similar energetic responses. Surprisingly, our findings reveal the opposite: the ""energetic blueprints"" of the PBPs and the TFs are largely distinct, with the allosteric network of the TFs evolving specifically to support the functional requirements of genome regulation, versus conserved interactions with membrane transport machinery in PBPs. These results demonstrate how the same fold can be adapted for different sense/response functions via family-specific energetic requirements - even when responding to the same chemical trigger. Understanding the evolutionarily conserved energetic blueprint for a protein family provides a roadmap for designing functional proteins de novo, and will help us treat aberrant protein behavior in conserved domains in disease-related drug targets, where engineering selectivity is challenging.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

A recent paper investigated motivational trade-offs in bumblebees and concluded that bees can trade-off heat against high sugar rewards. In this paper, we develop a signal detection model to highlight which features would be key to supporting the argument that motivational trade-offs are evidence of the capacity for experience pain. We then re-analyse the data from the original paper and find several limitations. Our own re-analysis finds no support for the final conclusions made by the paper.

We tested these alternatives using the powerful but accessible example of leaf masquerade in katydids, where in some species, highly modified wings strikingly mimic vegetation to avoid predator recognition. Combining a field predation experiment with a phylogenetic comparative analysis of wing morphology in 51 Neotropical katydid species, we show that colour and shape synergistically interact to enhance survival in the wild, and modifications in both traits evolved concurrently during diversification of this clade. Our findings identify the functionality of masquerade camouflage in the wild and highlight how synergy between individual traits fosters evolution of extraordinarily specialised adaptations.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has become a key tool for diagnosing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections, but discrepancies between genotypic and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing can hinder effective treatment and surveillance. This study investigates the impact of including resistant subpopulations and compensatory mutations in WGS-based rifampicin resistance prediction, based on a dataset of 35,538 M. tuberculosis samples. The sensitivity and specificity of resistance classification were evaluated with and without considering subpopulations and compensatory mutations. By lowering the fraction of reads required to identify a resistance associated variant in a sample from 0.90 to 0.05, the sensitivity significantly increased from 94.3% to 96.4% with no significant impact on specificity. This indicates that a substantial fraction of false negative calls in WGS-based rifampicin resistance prediction can be explained by masked resistant subpopulations. Allowing compensatory mutations to predict resistance further lowered the false negative rate. Finally, we found that samples with resistant subpopulations were less likely to be compensated than homogeneous resistant samples, consistent with the recent evolution of resistance in the samples with subpopulations. Further analysis of these samples revealed distinct clusters with differing amounts of within-sample diversity, pointing towards different mechanisms of resistance acquisition, such as within-host evolution and secondary infections.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

What neural mechanisms support this increase of movement vigor for greater rewards? We had three rhesus monkeys perform reaching movements to targets worth different magnitudes of reward. We recorded neural population activity from primary motor and dorsal premotor cortex, brain areas at the output of cortical processing for voluntary movements, and asked how neural activity mediated the translation of reward into increased vigor. We identified features of neural activity during movement preparation, initiation, and execution that were both correlated with vigor and modulated by reward. We also found that the neural metrics that correlate with different aspects of movement vigor exhibit only limited correlation with one another, suggesting that there are multiple mechanisms through which reward modulates vigor. Finally, we note that the majority of reward's modulation of motor cortical activity cannot be accounted for by reward-mediated vigor differences in behavior, indicating that reward modulations within motor cortex may serve roles in addition to affecting vigor. Overall, our results provide insight into the neural mechanisms that link reward-driven motivation to the modulation of the details of movement.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

These enhancers are required for steady-state expression of gut antimicrobial peptides, protection from C. rodentium infection, and development of IL-22-mediated psoriasis. E22-1 resembles many known enhancers, functioning in both Th-ILC counterparts. However, E22-2 is only required for IL-22 expression in ILC3s. Its ILC3 restriction relies on multiple Runx3 sites, combined with the lack of a functional RORgt motif, which is present in E22-1.

These SPMs are biosynthesized through the coordinated interaction of various cells in a process known as transcellular biosynthesis, involving the sequential action of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), and/or 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) enzymes. Additionally, Aspirin-triggered Resolvins are produced by acetylated COX-2, along with various lipoxygenases. Although SPMs regulate various cellular processes to actively resolve inflammation, their in vivo levels are typically low. To address this limitation, we engineered a multigene expression vector that co-expresses COX-2, 5-LOX, and 15-LOX, potentiating the synthesis of various SPMs. HEK293T cells transfected with this vector and cultured with fatty acid-free BSA-complexed DHA, EPA, and aspirin, successfully mimicked both transcellular and aspirin-triggered biosynthesis of Resolvins. These Resolvins are packaged into extracellular vesicles, which significantly inhibited neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, preserved endothelial monolayer barrier integrity, suppressed NF-{kappa}B reporter activity, and enhanced macrophage efferocytosis in vitro. Notably, post-injury administration of Resolvin-loaded EVs mitigated pulmonary inflammation in LPS-treated mice without causing systemic or pulmonary toxicity. In summary, we report a novel cell-based platform for generating Resolvin-loaded EVs that mitigate pulmonary inflammation in mouse models, underscoring their potential for treating other acute inflammatory diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

The effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in adolescents in real-world settings is not well understood.

OBJECTIVETo evaluate the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in adolescents aged 12 to 20 years given within the first five days of acute COVID-19 illness on illness severity during the acute (days 0 to 27) and post-acute phases (days 28 to 179).

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSThis target trial emulation used the electronic health records (EHR) data from twenty-nine medical institutions participating in the NIHs RECOVER consortium. We included data collected between April 1, 2022 and December 31, 2023, and included all patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not hospitalized on the day of entry. Those who were treated with oral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days after the positive test (n=2,923) and those who did not received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days after the positive test during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (control group, n=31,947) were identified.

EXPOSURESTreatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir based on prescription records.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESWe used modified Poisson regression models for binary outcomes to examine the effects of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir on acute phase hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits, and outpatient visits as well as progression to moderate or severe acute illness among individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir compared to control counterparts. Additionally, we assessed the medications associations with 16 conditions and symptoms during the acute phase of illness and its subsequent association with specific Long COVID diagnostic code U09.9 during the post-acute phase. We reported the absolute risks and estimated the relative risks (RRs), with adjustments made for demographic variables, clinical characteristics, and healthcare utilization, using propensity score matching.

RESULTSThe study cohort included 34,870 adolescents (median [Q1, Q3] age 16.0 [14.0, 18.0]); 46.0% male and 43.2% Non-Hispanic White. Among these patients, 2,923 were treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days of cohort entry and 31,947 received no treatment. The absolute rates were 0.58% vs. 0.96% for hospitalization, 74.17% vs. 82.66% for outpatient visits, 1.81% vs. 2.28% for ED visits, 3.08% vs. 3.99% for moderate/severe acute illness, and 0.21% vs. 0.20% for long COVID diagnosis in the treatment vs. control group. After propensity score matching, during acute-phase period, compared to the control group, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with reduced risk of any hospitalization (relative risk (RR) 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29-0.80), outpatient visit (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.82-0.90), and moderate/severe acute illness (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.56-0.87). Additionally, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with reduced risk of 7 of 16 specified conditions in chest pain (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.26-0.63), fatigue and malaise (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32-0.76), generalized pain (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.45-0.95), headache (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.44-0.83), mental health (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.39-0.80), musculoskeletal (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.94), and respiratory signs and symptoms (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52-0.71). No evidence was found to suggest that the treatment was associated with the risk of long COVID diagnosis U09.9 (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.40-2.32).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEThis study found that treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in adolescents within 5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection, was associated with reduced risk of acute-phase COVID-19 illness and subsequent healthcare utilization. However, treatment was not associated with a lower risk of Long COVID diagnosis.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduce the acute COVID-19 illness severity and the risk of developing Long COVID in adolescents aged 12 to 20 years?

FindingsIn this target trial emulation study of 34,870 adolescents with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not hospitalized on the cohort entry day, 2,923 who were treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir exhibited lower acute illness severity including reduced risk of 7 of 16 specified conditions and symptoms, as well as reduced risk of acute-phase hospitalization and outpatient visits, compared with 31,947 who received no treatment. The association with reduced risk of Long COVID was not observed in this study.

MeaningIn adolescents, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir appears to be effective at reducing the severity of acute COVID illness but was not associated with the risk of developing Long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1744322954038

Early studies of mtDNA variation provided the first genetic evidence for the African origin of modern humans. With complete mitochondrial genome sequencing, we can now reconstruct maternal lineages with high resolution, yet large parts of the continent remain underrepresented. Using a newly developed long-range sequencing assay, we generated 1,288 complete mitochondrial genomes from 14 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on previously understudied regions. We combined these with over 3,600 publicly available African mitogenomes to produce a comprehensive dataset and updated overview of maternal genetic diversity across the continent.

We contextualized this diversity with autosomal structure and information on major human expansions, integrating archaeological and linguistic evidence. Our analyses reveal a demographic expansion of Niger-Congo speakers around 17 thousand years ago (kya), followed by a second expansion associated with Bantuspeaking groups around 6 kya. We identify haplogroup L3e as a key marker of this early Bantu expansion, tracking its spread across sub-Saharan Africa. Distinct demographic signatures also emerge for different geographic sub-branches of Bantu speakers.

These findings highlight the power of mitochondrial DNA to trace maternal ancestry and demographic history in Africa, while also acknowledging its limitations for phylogeographic reconstruction.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

Despite nearly a century of research, the computations underlying this projection have not been adequately addressed. In the present study, we employed model-driven psychophysics to fill this gap. We hypothesized that tool-based sensory projection involves the remapping of touch from sensory feedback in the hand into an egocentric coordinate system. We first formalized the computational steps underlying tactile remapping. We designed a novel tool-sensing experiment that allowed us to rigorously test this model. In this task, participants contacted an object with a hand-held rod and then judged whether the object was above or below where they were currently looking. This comparison would only be possible if touch on the tool was projected outside the hand. Crucially, both object location and gaze position varied independently, allowing us to characterize the hand-to-space-to-gaze remapping process. Model-based curve fitting provided strong evidence that all participants in our task projected touch outside their body and into gazecentered coordinates. Crucially, the resolution of this projection was similar to what has been found for touch on the body. These findings provide the first step towards characterizing the computations underlying the spatial projection of touch on external objects, highlighting the incredible versatility of the sensorimotor system.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

Among these, histone modifications like H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 play opposing roles in gene activation and repression, respectively. In Arabidopsis thaliana, H3K27me3 is deposited by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), while Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins mediate H3K4me3 deposition. While the functions of these writer complexes have been extensively studied, far less is known about the histone mark readers that interpret these modifications during development. Here, we investigate the antagonistic interplay between H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 during Arabidopsis embryogenesis. We identify a developmentally specific interaction between the FIS-PRC2 complex and ALFIN-LIKE (AL) proteins - a family of plant-specific PHD domain proteins that read H3K4me3. Our findings reveal a dynamic competition between these two marks during early embryogenesis that helps shape the epigenomic landscape of the developing seed. Disruption of AL function leads to severe developmental defects and loss of cell identity in early embryos. Moreover, loss of ALs impairs H3K4me3 deposition, resulting in aberrant spreading of H3K27me3, misregulation of developmental genes, and defects that persist into adult plant traits. Together, our results show that proper embryonic development relies on a finely tuned antagonism between activating and repressive chromatin states-an interplay orchestrated not only by their writers but also by specific readers that translate these epigenetic cues into developmental outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

A structure of Cap10 reveals a tRNA transglycosylase-family enzyme remodeled to bind the modified N-terminus of a partner cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase linked to a 7-amido-7-deazaguanine (NDG) nucleobase. The structure of Cap9 explains how this QueC-like enzyme co-opts a 7-deazapurine biosynthetic reaction mechanism for NDG conjugation. We demonstrate that Cap9, Cap10, and NDG conjugation are essential for host defense against phage infection. Our results define a previously unknown 7-deazapurine protein modification and explain how nucleobase biosynthetic machinery has been repurposed for antiviral immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1744322954038

While abnormal crossover recombination is known to confer risk for aneuploidy, limited data have hindered understanding of the potential shared genetic basis of these key molecular phenotypes. To address this gap, we performed retrospective analysis of preimplantation genetic testing data from 139,416 in vitro fertilized embryos from 22,850 sets of biological parents. By tracing transmission of haplotypes, we identified 3,656,198 crossovers, as well as 92,485 aneuploid chromosomes. Counts of crossovers were lower in aneuploid versus euploid embryos, consistent with their role in chromosome pairing and segregation. Our analyses further revealed that a common haplotype spanning the meiotic cohesin SMC1B is significantly associated with both crossover count and maternal meiotic aneuploidy, with evidence supporting a non-coding cis-regulatory mechanism. Transcriptome- and phenome-wide association tests also implicated variation in the synaptonemal complex component C14orf39 and crossover-regulating ubiquitin ligases CCNB1IP1 and RNF212 in meiotic aneuploidy risk. More broadly, recombination and aneuploidy possess a partially shared genetic basis that also overlaps with reproductive aging traits. Our findings highlight the dual role of recombination in generating genetic diversity, while ensuring meiotic fidelity.","NA","medrxiv",1744322954038

We demonstrate this approach by augmenting popular DAA models with one or more biologically motivated alternatives. This creates an ensemble that bypasses the challenge of selecting an optimal model and instead combines the strengths of complementary statistical models to achieve superior performance. Our proposed ensemble learning approach is platform-agnostic and can augment any existing DAA method, providing a general and flexible framework for various downstream modeling tasks across domains and data types. We performed extensive benchmarking across both simulated and experimental datasets spanning single-cell gene expression, bulk transcriptomics, and microbiome metagenomics, where the ensemble strategy vastly outperformed non-ensemble methods, identified more differential patterns than the competing methods, and displayed good control of false positive and false discovery rates across diversified scenarios.

This siloed approach prevents generalization across biomolecular classes and limits the ability to model interaction interfaces systematically. We introduce ATOMICA, a geometric deep learning model that learns atomic-scale representations of intermolecular interfaces across diverse biomolecular modalities, including small molecules, metal ions, amino acids, and nucleic acids. ATOMICA uses a self-supervised denoising and masking objective to train on 2,037,972 interaction complexes and generate hierarchical embeddings at the levels of atoms, chemical blocks, and molecular interfaces. The model generalizes across molecular classes and recovers shared physicochemical features without supervision. Its latent space captures compositional and chemical similarities across interaction types and follows scaling laws that improve representation quality with increasing biomolecular data modalities. We apply ATOMICA to construct five modality-specific interfaceome networks, termed ATOMICANO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOWs, which connect proteins based on interaction similarity with ions, small molecules, nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins. These networks identify disease pathways across 27 conditions and predict disease-associated proteins in autoimmune neuropathies and lymphoma. Finally, we use ATOMICA to annotate the dark proteome--proteins lacking known structure or function--by predicting 2,646 previously uncharacterized ligand-binding sites. These include putative zinc finger motifs and transmembrane cytochrome subunits, demonstrating that ATOMICA enables systematic annotation of molecular interactions across the proteome.","NA","biorxiv",1744322954038

Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC.

Methods and FindingsWe used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms.

ConclusionsIn this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes.

AUTHOR SUMMARYO_ST_ABSWhy was this study done?C_ST_ABSO_LIPaxlovid is indicated to prevent severe COVID-19.
C_LIO_LILong COVID is more likely after more severe COVID-19, so there is a plausible mechanism for Paxlovid to reduce the risk of developing Long COVID by preventing severe COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIOnly a few studies have examined the relationship between Paxlovid and Long COVID, with mixed results. To our knowledge, no studies have used causal inference methods to estimate Paxlovids effect on PASC.
C_LIO_LIIf Paxlovid helps prevent Long COVID, it could be a powerful addition to the public health effort to reduce the burden of COVID-19.
C_LI

What did the researchers do and find?O_LIWe used a cohort of 410,026 patients from the National Covid Cohort Collaboratives (N3Cs) electronic health record database to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment during acute COVID-19 on the likelihood of developing Long COVID.
C_LIO_LIWe used the target trial emulation technique to estimate the causal effect of Paxlovid treatment using observational data.
C_LIO_LIWe found that Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall Long COVID incidence.
C_LIO_LIWe found that Paxlovid treatment had a slightly stronger effect on certain symptoms (cognitive and fatigue) of Long COVID.
C_LI

What do these findings mean?O_LIPaxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing Long COVID.
C_LIO_LIHowever, Paxlovid may have a stronger effect on certain subtypes of Long COVID.
C_LIO_LIThis difference in effect by symptom also suggests that viral load may be a more common cause of cognitive and fatigue symptoms than of other Long COVID symptoms.
C_LIO_LIThis studys main limitation is that it estimates causal effects, but it is not randomized like a clinical trial. Instead, we control for other variables which could bias the estimate, but if we missed some important variables, the estimates could be incorrect.

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1744322954038

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1744322954038
