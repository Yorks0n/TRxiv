We introduce ChromBPNet, a deep learning DNA sequence model of base-resolution accessibility profiles that detects, learns and deconvolves assay-specific enzyme biases from regulatory sequence determinants of accessibility, enabling robust discovery of compact TF motif lexicons, cooperative motif syntax and precision footprints across assays and sequencing depths. Extensive benchmarks show that ChromBPNet, despite its lightweight design, is competitive with much larger contemporary models at predicting variant effects on chromatin accessibility, pioneer TF binding and reporter activity across assays, cell contexts and ancestry, while providing interpretation of disrupted regulatory syntax. ChromBPNet also helps prioritize and interpret regulatory variants that influence complex traits and rare diseases, thereby providing a powerful lens to decode regulatory DNA and genetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

However, the biochemical mechanisms underlying these reactive species-mediated labelings, particularly the spatial patterns of labeling methods within the sub-m range, remain poorly understood. Here, we employed DNA nanostructure platforms to precisely measure the labeling radii of TurboID and APEX2 through in vitro assays. Our DNA nanoruler design enables the deployment of oligonucleotide-barcoded labeling targets with nanometer precision near the enzymes. By quantifying labeling yields using quantitative PCR and mapping them against target distances, we uncovered surprising insights into the labeling mechanisms. Contrary to the prevailing diffusive labeling model, our results demonstrate that TurboID primarily operates through contact-dependent labeling. Similarly, APEX2 shows high labeling efficiency within its direct contact range. In parallel, it exhibits a low-level diffusive labeling towards more distant phenols. These findings reframe our understanding in the mechanism of proximity labeling enzymes, at the same time highlight the potential of DNA nanotechnology in spatially profiling reactive species.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Core genes are traditionally identified by the analysis of amino acid similarities among proteomes, but can also be defined using structures, which bear potential in deep clades beyond the twilight zone of amino acids. Despite breakthroughs in accurate AI-driven protein structure prediction, obtaining full 3D structural models on a proteomic scale is still prohibitively slow. Here, we present Unicore, a novel method for identifying structural core genes at a scale suitable for downstream phylogenetic analysis. By applying the ProstT5 protein language model to the input proteomes to obtain their 3Di structural strings, Unicore saves over three orders of magnitude in runtime compared to a full 3D prediction. Using Foldseek clustering, Unicore identifies single-copy structures universally present in the species and aligns them using Foldmason. These structural core gene alignments are projected back to amino acid information for downstream phylogenetic analysis. We demonstrate that this approach defines core genes with linear run-time scaling over the number of species, up to 56 times faster than OrthoFinder, while reconstructing phylogenetic relationships congruent with conventional approaches. Unicore is universally applicable to any given set of taxa, even spanning superkingdoms and overcoming limitations of previous methods requiring orthologs of fixed taxonomic scope, and is available as a free and open source software at https://github.com/steineggerlab/unicore.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Domestic cats are susceptible to AIV infection and provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of AIV infections in felines reported from 2004 through 2024. We identified 607 AIV infections in felines, including 302 associated deaths, comprising 18 countries and 12 felid species. We observed a drastic flux in the number of AIV infections among domestic cats in 2023 and 2024, commensurate with the emergence of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b. We estimate that this phenomenon is underreported in the scientific literature and argue that increased surveillance among domestic cats is urgently needed.","NA","medrxiv",1735250959802

However, the mechanisms that separate TADs remain incompletely understood. Most boundaries between TADs contain CTCF binding sites (CBSs), which individually contribute to the blocking of Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. Using genome-wide classification, we show here that TAD boundary width forms a continuum from narrow to highly extended and correlates with CBS distribution, chromatin features, and gene regulatory elements. To investigate how these boundary widths emerge, we modified the Random Cross-Linker (RCL) polymer model to incorporate specific boundary configurations, enabling us to evaluate the differential impact of boundary composition on TAD insulation. Our analysis identifies three generic boundary categories, each influencing TAD insulation differently, with varying local and distal effects on neighboring domains. Notably, we find that increasing boundary width reduces long-range inter-TAD contacts, as confirmed by Hi-C data. While blocking loop extrusion at boundaries indirectly promotes spurious intermingling of neighboring TADs, extended boundaries counteract this effect, emphasizing their role in maintaining genome structure. In conclusion, TAD boundary width not only enhances the efficiency of loop extrusion blocking but may also modulate enhancer-promoter contacts over long distances across TADs boundaries, providing a mechanism for transcriptional regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Here, we increase the number of complete SAR11 isolate genomes fourfold by describing 81 new SAR11 strains from seven distinct lineages isolated from coastal and offshore surface seawater of the tropical Pacific Ocean. We leveraged comprehensive phylogenomic insights afforded by these isolates to characterize 24 monophyletic, discrete ecotypes with unique spatiotemporal patterns of distribution across the global ocean, which we define as genera. Our data illustrate fine-scale differentiation in patterns of detection with ecologically-relevant gene content variation for some closely related genomes, demonstrating instances of ecological speciation within SAR11 genera. Our study provides unique insight into complex environmental SAR11 populations, and proposes an ecology-informed hierarchy to pave a path forward for the systematic nomenclature for this clade.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

While case studies suggest that population history can also affect specific structures of languages, such as patterns in their sound systems and grammars, results are conflicting, and it remains unknown whether such effects hold globally. Here we show that, adjusting for geography, phylogeny, and environment, genetic diversity is inversely correlated with diversity in linguistic structures. Low genetic diversity (i.e. excess homozygosity) results from relative isolation, and this promotes diversification in language. High genetic diversity results from contact and migration, and this promotes homogenization in language. These effects are particularly pronounced in Asia and, under some conditions, also in a few other areas, suggesting sociocultural factors contributing to differences in how strongly isolation favors linguistic diversity and how strongly contact promotes linguistic homogenization. Our results suggest that present-day hotspots of linguistic diversity, which are characterized by relative isolation, may provide a privileged window on the dynamics of linguistic evolution as they are less affected by the vast demographic expansions, migrations, and extinctions that characterize the Neolithic age.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Upon autophagy induction, a unique double-membraned structure, called a phagophore, forms and expands into a cup shape to engulf these cytosolic substrates. ATG8 proteins are covalently conjugated to autophagic membranes by lipidation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and are thought to localise on both sides of the phagophore membrane. ATG8 conjugated on the inner membrane of the phagophore recruits autophagy cargo receptors, such as p62. To recapitulate events on the inner membrane, we used giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as a model membrane and encapsulated proteins of interest inside GUVs, thus generating a membrane platform to which ATG8 proteins could be localised on the inner leaflet of the vesicles. We reconstituted WIPI2b-directed and cargo-directed ATG8 lipidation inside the GUVs and revealed distinct roles of WIPI2b and p62 in initiating the ATG conjugation cascade. Furthermore, we showed that p62 or p62 droplets were recruited to the inner membrane of the GUVs though interaction with membrane-bound ATG8s. Using a bead-based membrane expansion assay, we demonstrated a redistribution and local enrichment of membrane-bound ATG8s across the membrane upon interaction with p62 and p62 droplets. Our study provides novel model systems to investigate the interactions on the inner membrane of the phagophore and reveals fundamental molecular insights into phagophore membrane bending. This process is directed by ATG8-cargo interaction, during which cargo receptors concentrate ATG8 proteins on the inner surface of the phagophore membrane.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Although different biochemical mechanisms are proposed, due to the dearth of direct force measurements, how mechanical forces determine the competition outcome remains unclear. Here, using ex vivo tissues and different cell lines, we have discovered an unknown form of cell competition that is regulated by differences in force transmission capabilities, favoring cell types with stronger intercellular adhesion. Direct force measurements reveal increased mechanical activity at the interface of the two competing cell types in the form of large stress fluctuations which can lead to upward forces and cell elimination. We show how a winning cell type endowed with a stronger intercellular adhesion exhibits a higher resistance to elimination while benefiting from efficient force transmission to neighboring cells. This cell elimination mechanism could have broad implications of keeping strong force transmission ability for maintaining tissue boundaries and cell invasion pathology.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

Yet, understanding the determinants of niche partitioning within SAR11 has been a formidable challenge due to the high genetic diversity within individual SAR11 sublineages and the limited availability of high-quality genomes from both cultivation and metagenomic reconstruction. Here, we take advantage of 71 new SAR11 genomes from strains we isolated from the tropical Pacific Ocean to evaluate the distribution of metabolic traits across the Pelagibacteraceae, a recently classified family within the order Pelagibacterales encompassing subgroups Ia and Ib. Our analyses of metagenomes generated from stations where the strains were isolated reveals distinct habitat preferences across SAR11 genera for coastal or offshore environments, and subtle but systematic differences in metabolic potential that support these observations. We also observe higher levels of selective forces acting on habitat-specific metabolic genes linked to SAR11 fitness and polyphyletic distributions of habitat preferences and metabolic traits across SAR11 subclades, suggesting that contrasting lifestyles have emerged across multiple lineages independently. Together, these insights reveal niche-partitioning within sympatric and parapatric populations of SAR11 and demonstrate that the immense genomic diversity of SAR11 bacteria naturally segregates into ecologically and genetically cohesive units, or ecotypes, that vary in spatial distributions in the tropical Pacific.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Recent technological advancements enable visualization of mitochondrial dynamics in vivo using fluorescent microscopy. Our study modified this technique to evaluate mitochondrial dynamics in skeletal muscle, comparing young (6mo) and old (24mo) mice in vivo and contrasting this to ex vivo and in vitro models. We hypothesized that in vitro and ex vivo models would have higher rates of dynamics than in vivo models and that young animals would have higher rates than old animals. We electroporated mitochondrial matrix-targeted photo-activatable GFP into the tibialis anterior (TA) of young and old C57Bl6 mice and imaged using multiphoton microscopy. We also measured rates of mitochondrial dynamics using single fibers isolated from the TA of the electroporated mice, as well as C2C12 myotubes transfected with the same plasmids. We found that the rates of dynamic events in vivo are slower than previously indicated, with the C2C12 myoblasts having the fastest rates of dynamic events across all models. We also observed that dynamic rates are slower in old animals compared to young animals. Finally, we found that rates of dynamic events were higher in old animals after an acute bout of exercise. Our data demonstrate it is possible to directly measure rates of mitochondrial dynamics in vivo.

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up.

The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1735250959802

Many species are motile, despite having no appendages and a completely rigid cell body. Cells move to seek out nutrients, locate mating partners, and undergo vertical migration. To explore the natural diversity of diatom motility, we perform a comparative study across five common biofilm-forming species. Combining morphological measurements with high-resolution cell tracking, we establish how gliding movements relate to the morphology of the raphe - a specialised slit in the cell wall responsible for motility generation. Our detailed analyses reveal that cells exhibit a rich but species-dependent phenotype, switching stochastically between four stereotyped motility states. We model this behaviour and use stochastic simulations to predict how heterogeneity in microscale navigation patterns leads to differences in long-time diffusivity and dispersal. In a representative species, we extend these findings to quantify diatom gliding in complex, naturalistic 3D environments, suggesting that cells may exploit these distinct motility signatures to achieve niche segregation in nature.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Cells may prevent deleterious RNA-RNA interactions by genome organization to avoid complementarity however, RNA viruses generate long, perfectly complementary antisense RNA during replication. How do viral RNAs avoid irreversible entanglement? One possibility is RNA sequestration into biomolecular condensates. To test this, we reconstituted critical SARS-CoV-2 RNA-RNA interactions in Nucleocapsid condensates. We observed that RNAs with low propensity RNA-RNA interactions resulted in more round, liquid-like condensates while those with high sequence complementarity resulted in more heterogeneous networked morphology independent of RNA structure stability. Residue-resolution molecular simulations and direct sequencing-based detection of RNA-RNA interactions support that these properties arise from degree of trans RNA contacts. We propose that extensive RNA-RNA interactions in cell and viral replication are controlled via a combination of genome organization, timing, RNA sequence content, RNA production ratios, and emergent biomolecular condensate material properties.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

However, an increased incidence of severe dengue and fatalities are seen in females of the reproductive age. As per vaginal (PV) bleeding is an important complication that has not been well characterized, we sought to determine the frequency, complications and disease outcomes in women who develop PV bleeding. Methodology/Principal findings 288 adult female patients were recruited from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Sri Lanka. All clinical features and laboratory investigations were recorded throughout the duration of hospital admission along with treatment received. 28/288 (9.72%) reported PV bleeding, with 12/28 (42.85%) developing dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) compared to 65/260 (25%) of those who did not have bleeding. Women who developed PV bleeding were more likely to have developed DHF (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.1, p=0.06), abdominal pain (OR=2.17, 95% CI = 0.99 to 4.69, p = 0.06), vomiting (OR= 2.0, 95% CI= 0.89 to 4.44, p= 0.10), diarhoea (OR= 4.35, 95% CI = 1.908 to 9.610, p= 0.0004) or evidence of any fluid leakage (OR= 1.98, 95% CI = 0.91 to 4.5, p = 0.11). Although not significant, those who had PV bleeding were more likely to have been given intravenous fluids, blood transfusions and colloids. Conclusions PV bleeding appears to associate with worse disease outcomes. The possible contribution of PV bleeding to higher incidence of severe dengue and fatality rates observed in many countries, should be further investigated.","NA","medrxiv",1735250959802

Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we found that CD4 T cell depletion before infection results in short-lived plasma cells secreting low-avidity antiviral IgG with limited BCR diversity and weak virus-neutralizing ability. CD4 T cell deficiency during persistent infection incurs a shift from a T-dependent (TD) to T-independent (TI) Ab response, resembling the pre-existing TI Ab response. CD4 T cell loss before infection or during persistent infection is conducive for emergence of Ab-escape variants. Cryo-EM reconstruction of complexes of MuPyV virions with polyclonal IgG directly from infected mice with pre-existing or acquired CD4 T cell deficiency enabled visualization of shortfalls in TI IgG binding.

The network property is defined by the network density and the species of actin-binding proteins. However, the relationship between the network density, the penetration ability of actin-binding proteins into the network, and resulting network dynamics remains elusive. Here, we report an in vitro optogenetic system, named OptoVCA, which induces Arp2/3-mediated actin network assembly on a lipid membrane. By changing the illumination power, duration, and pattern, the OptoVCA flexibly manipulates the density, thickness, and shape of the actin network. Taking these advantages, we examine the effects of the network density on two representative actin-binding proteins, myosin and ADF/cofilin. We find that the penetration of myosin filaments into the network is strictly inhibited by only a several-fold increase in network density due to the steric hindrance. Furthermore, penetrated myosin filaments induce directional actin flow when the network has a density gradient. On the other hand, ADF/cofilin penetrates into the network regardless of network density. However, network disassembly is dramatically inhibited by only a several-fold increase in network density. Thus, the OptoVCA contributes to understanding cell mechanics by examining the network density-dependent effects on actin-binding proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

In an OPM, the sample space is mapped to a distortion free image space via remote focusing, and the oblique light-sheet plane is mapped via a tilted tertiary imaging system onto a camera. As a result, the 3D point-spread function and optical transfer function are tilted to the optical axis of the tertiary imaging system. To satisfy Nyquist sampling, small scanning steps are required to encompass the tilted 3D OTF, slowing down acquisition and increasing sample exposure. Here we show that a judicious amount of under-sampling can lead to a form of aliasing in OPM that can be recovered without a loss of spatial resolution or introducing artifacts. The resulting speed gain depends on the optical parameters of the system and can reach 2-4-fold in our demonstrations. We leverage this speed gain for rapid subcellular 3D imaging of mitochondrial dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

However, movements are regularly triggered and constantly corrected based on sensory inputs caused by disturbances to the body or environment. Since such disturbances are often predictable and since preparing for disturbances would make movements better, we hypothesized that expectations about sensory inputs also influence preparatory activity in motor circuits. Here we show that when humans and monkeys are probabilistically cued about the direction of a future mechanical perturbation, they incorporate sensory expectations into their movement preparation and improve their corrective responses. Using high-density neural recordings, we establish that sensory expectations are widespread across the brain, including the motor cortical areas involved in preparing self-initiated actions. The geometry of these preparatory signals in the neural population state is simple, scaling directly with the probability of each perturbation direction. After perturbation onset, a condition-independent perturbation signal shifts the neural state leading to rapid responses that initially reflect sensory expectations. Based on neural networks coupled to a biomechanical model of the arm3, we show that this neural geometry emerges through training, but only when the incoming sensory information indicating perturbation direction coincides with - or is preceded by - a condition-independent signal indicating that a perturbation has occurred. Thus, motor circuit dynamics are shaped by future sensory inputs, providing clear empirical support for the idea that movement is governed by the sophisticated manipulation of sensory feedback4.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Currently known phage counter-defense systems are specific to (the activity of) the targeted bacterial defense system. Here, we uncover a mechanism by which the T7 bacteriophage broadly counteracts bacterial defenses using protein phosphorylation. We show that the T7 protein kinase (T7K), which was believed to specifically redirect the function of a few host proteins, is in fact a hyper-promiscuous, dual-specificity kinase enacting a massive wave of phosphorylation on virtually all host and phage proteins during infection. The scale of phosphorylation vastly exceeds the number of previously known phosphorylation events in E. coli, has no sequence motif specificity, and results in a higher proteome-wide phosphorylation density than that of mammalian cells which encode [~] 500 kinases. Stoichiometry analysis of phosphorylation sites revealed a strong bias of T7K activity towards nucleic acid-binding substrates, which we show is mediated by its C-terminal DNA-binding domain. This specificity for highly stoichiometric phosphorylation of nucleic acid-binding proteins enables the deactivation of DNA-targeting or - containing bacterial defense systems. We provide mechanistic insight into how T7K weakens two such defense systems, Retron-Eco9 and DarTG1, through specific phosphorylation events, with single phosphomimetic mutations in key sites of the toxins abolishing defense. Finally, by screening a large collection of E. coli strains, we provide evidence of broad counter-defense capacities for T7K in nature, as strains counteracted contain diverse bacterial defense systems.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

To assess the oncogenic potential of histone missense mutations, we have gathered whole-exome sequencing data for the tumors of over 12,000 patients. Overall, histone mutations occurred in about 16% of cancer patients, although specific cancer types showed substantially higher rates. Using a combination of genomic, structural, and biophysical analyses, we found several predominant modes of action, where cancer missense mutations in histones affected acidic patches and protein binding interfaces in a cancer-specific manner and targeted interaction sites with specific DNA repair proteins. Consistent with this finding, we observed a high tumour mutational burden in patients with histone mutations affecting interactions of DNA repair proteins. We also identified potential cancer driver mutations in several histone genes, including histone H4-a highly conserved histone without previously documented driver mutations.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

However, due to the high noise in the unspliced/spliced data for individual genes, existing RNA velocity models often fail to accurately capture the dynamics between unspliced and spliced abundance in the phase portraits of many genes. In addition, optimizing the high dimensional dynamics of all genes within a global framework and effectively handling multi-lineage data still require further exploration in RNA velocity modeling. Inspired by the role of transcriptional regulation in linking genes into complex networks and providing additional context for gene dynamics modeling, we propose TSvelo. TSvelo integrates cross-gene transcriptional regulation and gene-specific splicing processes of all genes into one neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)-based framework. By incorporating cell-specific transcriptional rates with the unspliced-spliced data, TSvelo precisely models the dynamics of velocity genes, learns global pseudotime, and can be extended to multi-branch datasets. Experiments on six scRNA-seq datasets, including two multi-branch datasets, demonstrate that TSvelo outperforms existing methods in modeling gene dynamics, inferring cell pseudotime and trajectories, and analyzing gene expression patterns across branches.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Yet, the complexity of perturbation effects pose significant challenges for robust predictive modeling. Although recent efforts have introduced foundation models alongside traditional statistical and machine learning approaches, a comprehensive benchmarking study of their predictive performance has been lacking. Here we establish a standardized evaluation framework and systematically assess 9 single-cell perturbation prediction models on 17 diverse datasets, spanning multiple cell types and perturbation modalities. Leveraging a multifaceted suite of 24 evaluation metrics, we find that models often excel in capturing global expression profiles yet struggle to predict the nuanced effects of perturbed genes, or vice versa. Moreover, while foundation models frequently outperform simpler methods, they tend to converge on population averages, struggling to capture heterogeneous cellular responses to perturbations. Taken together, our study highlights both the potential and limitations of single-cell foundation models, identifies opportunities for future improvement, and provide a roadmap for advancing single-cell predictive biology.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

GeneSetCluster clusters gene-sets based on shared genes, providing a high-level overview of the involved biological pathways, thereby facilitating interpretability. However, the original version faced limitations in managing redundancies across multiple gene sets. Additionally, programmatic tools like GeneSetCluster can be challenging for users with limited coding expertise.

ResultsWe introduce GeneSetCluster 2.0 which substantially improves upon its predecessor. This update presents a new methodology for addressing duplicated gene-sets and incorporates a seriation-based clustering algorithm that reorders data, enabling the identification of patterns. The updated version is optimized for faster computational performance through parallelization, reducing execution times. Furthermore, the 2.0 version also enhances cluster annotation by identifying relevant tissues and biological processes associated with each cluster. Finally, to improve accessibility and usability, we have developed a user-friendly web application, making GeneSetCluster 2.0 suitable for a broader audience, including those without programming expertise. We also ensured the interplay between the R package, targeting users with programming knowledge, and the web-application, which targets the rest of the users.

ConclusionGeneSetCluster 2.0 significantly improves the original version by providing a more comprehensive, intuitive, and efficient exploration of GSA results. On the other hand, it bridges the gap between bioinformaticians and clinicians in multidisciplinary teams.

Here, we present pipemake, a computational platform designed to streamline the development and implementation of efficient and reproducible Snakemake workflows. pipemake creates modular pipelines that can be seamlessly integrated or removed from the platform without requiring reconfiguration of the core system, enabling flexible adaptation of workflows to different analytical needs across diverse fields. To demonstrate the platform's capabilities, we created and implemented pipelines to reanalyze two distinct biological datasets. First, we recreated a population genomics analysis of the socially flexible halictid bee, Lasioglossum albipes, using pipemake-generated workflows for de novo genome annotation, processing of variant data, dimensionality reduction, and a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We then used pipemake to analyze behavioral tracking data from the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. In both cases, pipemake workflows produced results consistent with published findings while substantially reducing hands-on analysis time. Overall, pipemake's modular design allows researchers to easily modify existing pipelines or develop new ones without software development expertise. Beyond streamlining workflow creation, pipemake leverages the full Snakemake ecosystem to enable parallel processing, automated error recovery, and comprehensive analysis documentation.

Larger gastruloids exhibit delayed symmetry breaking, increased multipolarity, and prolonged axial elongation, with morphogenesis driven by system size. Despite these variations, transcriptional programs and cell fate composition remain remarkably stable across a broad size range. Notably, extreme sizes show distinct transcriptional modules and clear shifts in gene expression patterns. Intriguingly, size perturbation experiments rescued the morphogenetic and pattern phenotypes observed in extreme sizes, demonstrating the remarkable adaptability of gastruloids to their effective system size.

However, current approaches are limited in their ability to generalize to peptides with novel post-translational modifications (PTMs) due to insufficient training data. To address this challenge, we introduce MoSTERT (Molecular Structure Transformer Encoder for Retention Time prediction) and its enhanced variant, MoSTERT-2S, two transformer-based models designed for zero-shot prediction of retention times of peptides with unseen PTMs. Unlike conventional models, MoSTERT encodes peptide residues at the molecular structure level, allowing it to handle diverse PTMs. MoSTERT-2S further improves accuracy by employing a two-step strategy: first predicting the retention time of the unmodified peptide, then estimating the retention time shift induced by the PTMs. Evaluation on an external dataset demonstrates that MoSTERT-2S achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing prediction errors compared to existing methods. Its ability to accurately predict retention times for peptides with a wide variety of PTMs not seen during training highlights its potential for advancing proteomic workflows analyzing proteoforms and protein modifications.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Among the three known mammalian RyR isoforms, RyR1 is critical for muscle contraction and has been studied most extensively. The cytoplasm-exposed multidomain fragment of RyRs integrates multiple cellular signals that regulate channel gating and small deviations from the physiological open probability of RyRs leads to life-threatening diseases. While cryo-EM has been instrumental in revealing near-atomic details of RyR gating mechanisms, the open probability of RyR1 under cryo-EM conditions is notably lower than that observed in electrophysiological studies, complicating structural investigations of RyR1 gating modulation. Here, we present a cryo-EM study examining the open probability of RyR1 solubilized in CHAPS with varying lipid concentrations. We found that increasing lipid concentration from 0.001% to 0.05% raised the RyR1 open probability from 16 to 84%; however, RyR1 reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs remained closed. We modelled 72 lipid molecules in the map reconstructed at the highest lipid concentration.

In this study, we longitudinally quantified in vivo DREADD expression in macaque monkeys using positron emission tomography with the DREADD-selective tracer [11C]deschloroclozapine (DCZ), complemented by functional studies. Twenty macaque monkeys were evaluated after being injected with adeno-associated virus vectors expressing the DREADDs hM4Di or hM3Dq, whose expression was quantified as changes in [11C]DCZ binding potential from baseline levels. Expression levels of both hM4Di and hM3Dq peaked around 60 days post-injection, remained stable for about 1.5 years, and declined gradually after two years. Significant chemogenetic control of neural activity and behavior persisted for about two years. Virus titer and the presence of protein tags significantly influenced expression levels, with co-expressed protein tags reducing overall expression levels.

Existing tools for uncovering co-evolutionary signals primarily rely on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), often neglecting considerations of phylogenetic relatedness and shared evolutionary history. Here, we present a novel approach based on the substitution mapping of amino acid changes onto the phylogenetic tree. We categorize amino acids into two groups: 'tolerable' and 'intolerable,' and assign them to each position based on the position dynamics concerning the observed amino acids. Amino acids deemed 'tolerable' are those observed phylogenetically independently and multiple times at a specific position, signifying the position's tolerance to that alteration. Gaps are regarded as a third character type, and we only consider phylogenetically independent altered gap characters. Our algorithm is based on a tree traversal process through the nodes and computes the total amount of substitution per branch based on the probability differences of two groups of amino acids and gaps between neighboring nodes. We employ an MSA-masking approach to mitigate misleading artifacts from poorly aligned regions. When compared to tools utilizing phylogeny (CAPS and CoMap) and state-of-the-art MSA-based approaches (DCA, GaussDCA, PSICOV, and MIp), our method exhibits significantly superior accuracy in identifying co-evolving position pairs, as measured by statistical metrics including MCC, AUC, and F1 score.

Recently, a proxy for DNA mechanics, cyclizability, was measured by loop-seq and enabled genome-scale investigation of DNA mechanics. Here, we use this dataset to build a computational model predicting bias-corrected intrinsic cyclizability, with near-perfect accuracy, solely based on DNA sequence. Further, the model predicts intrinsic bending direction in 3D space. Using this tool, we aimed to probe mechanical selection - that is, the evolutionary selection of DNA sequence based on its mechanical properties - in diverse circumstances. First, we found that the intrinsic bend direction of DNA sequences correlated with the observed bending in known protein-DNA complex structures, suggesting that many proteins co-evolved with their DNA partners to capture DNA in its intrinsically preferred bent conformation. We then applied our model to large-scale yeast population genetics data and showed that centromere DNA element II, whose consensus sequence is unknown, leaving its sequence-specific role unclear, is under mechanical selection to increase the stability of inner-kinetochore structure and to facilitate centromeric histone recruitment. Finally, in silico evolution under strong mechanical selection discovered hallucinated sequences with cyclizability values so extreme that they required experimental validation, yet, found in nature in the densely packed mitochondrial(mt) DNA of Namystynia karyoxenos, an ocean-dwelling protist with extreme mitochondrial gene fragmentation. The need to transmit an extraordinarily large amount of mtDNA, estimated to be > 600 Mb, in combination with the absence of mtDNA compaction proteins may have pushed mechanical selection to the extreme. Similarly extreme DNA mechanics are observed in bird microchromosomes, although the functional consequence is not yet clear. The discovery of eccentric DNA mechanics in unrelated unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes suggests that we can predict extreme natural biology which can arise through strong selection. Our methods offer a way to study the biological functions of DNA mechanics in any genome and to engineer DNA sequences with desired mechanical properties.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the only treatment option capable of modifying the natural history of the disease, but current AIT schemes present safety and efficacy limitations. One possible strategy to address these limitations is to encapsulate the allergen in nanoparticle carriers that can deliver it to antigen presenting cells while hiding it from effector cells responsible for the allergic reaction. In this work, we evaluate the use of allergen-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) as AIT agents. MSNs of different pore sizes were prepared and characterized, evaluating their capacity to load and release ovalbumin (OVA) as a model allergen. Extra-large pore MSNs (XL-MSNs) showed the optimal loading and release behavior, presenting also enhanced activation of the dendritic cell line DC2.4 and reduced allergenic capacity in pre-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells, both compared to free OVA. After evaluating their biodistribution following subcutaneous, sublingual or intravenous administration, their therapeutic potential in AIT was further assessed in an in vivo murine model of OVA systemic anaphylaxis. The results showed that intravenous administration of OVA-loaded XL-MSNs significantly protected the mice from anaphylaxis and induced a Th1/Treg-immune profile, while administration through other routes failed to prevent the development of an anaphylactic reaction upon provocation with OVA. These findings establish MSNs, particularly via intravenous administration, as a promising platform to develop safer and more effective AIT.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Yet, early embryogenesis is also strikingly conserved in some groups, like Spiralia (e.g., snails, clams, and many marine worms). In this large clade, a shared cleavage program - the so-called spiral cleavage - and similar cell lineages are ancestral to at least seven animal phyla. Why early development is so conserved in specific groups and plastic in others is not fully understood. Here, we investigated two annelid species - Owenia fusiformis and Capitella teleta - with spiral cleavage but different modes of specifying their primary progenitor cells. By generating high-resolution transcriptomic time courses from the oocyte and fertilisation until gastrulation, we show transcriptional dynamics are markedly different between these species during spiral cleavage and instead reflect their distinct timings of embryonic organiser specification. However, the end of cleavage and gastrulation exhibit high transcriptomic similarity. At these stages, orthologous transcription factors share gene expression domains, suggesting this period is a previously overlooked mid-developmental transition in annelid embryogenesis. Together, our data reveal hidden developmental plasticity in the genetics underpinning spiral cleavage, indicating an evolutionary decoupling of morphological and transcriptomic conservation during early animal embryogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

In this study, we evaluated the impact of the morphogenic regulator GRF-GIF on plant regeneration and genome editing outcomes in tomato. We demonstrate that expressing a tomato GRF-GIF chimera reliably accelerates the onset of shoot regeneration from callus tissue culture by approximately one month and nearly doubles the number of recovered transgenic plants. Consequently, the GRF-GIF chimera enables the recovery of a broader range of edited haplotypes and simplifies the isolation of mutants harboring heritable edits, but without markedly interfering with plant growth and development. Based on these findings, we outline strategies that employ basic or advanced diagnostic pipelines for efficient isolation of single and higher-order mutants in tomato. Our work represents a technical advantage for tomato transformation and genome editing, with potential applications across other Solanaceae species.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

SHM allows B cells to rapidly evolve new antibody sequences without compromising their fitness as a consequence of genome-wide mutations. In this work, we developed a continuous directed evolution platform in human B cell lines (CODE-HB) that recruits and repurposes the SHM mechanisms to rapidly evolve reporter proteins like the Green Fluorescent Protein. This approach uses a stable, non-immunoglobulin locus within the genomes of human B cell lines.

Thiol redox reactions, acting as oxidative stress sensors, influence protein structure and function. Redox proteomics based on differential alkylation of reduced and oxidized Cys forms using mass spectrometry enables comprehensive analysis of thiol redox status in cells and tissues.

We introduce PACREDOX, an innovative redox proteomics approach based on the Protein Aggregation Capture (PAC) protocol and we demonstrate its compatibility with library free data-independent acquisition (DIA). PACREDOX reduces preparation time and costs compared to traditional methods, such as FASILOX, while maintaining thiol and proteome coverage. To enable library-free DIA, we corrected in silico spectral libraries in DIA-NN using experimental retention time data from beta-methylthiol-modified peptides. PACREDOX with DIA quantified 4,000 protein groups and [~]45,000 modified peptides in myocardial tissue from a porcine model of atrial fibrillation, including over 8,000 cysteine-containing peptides, 30% of which were reversibly oxidized.

Benchmarking PACREDOX and DIA against FASILOX in a myocardial infarction model reflects the potential and efficiency of this methodology to study oxidative damage. Overall, PACREDOX offers a high-throughput, cost-effective strategy for thiol redox proteome analysis, compatible with label-free quantitative workflows.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

However, there are other reorganizations of the network that do not involve fission and fusion. One such exception is the elusive, beads-on-a-string morphological transition of mitochondria. During such transitions, the cylindrical tubes of the mitochondrial membrane transiently undergo shape changes to a string of pearls connected along thin tubes. These dynamics have been anecdotally observed in many contexts and given disparate explanations. Here we unify these observations by proposing a common underlying mechanism based on the biophysical properties of tubular fluid membranes for which it is known that, under particular regimes of tension and pressure, membranes reach an instability and undergo a shape transition to a string of connected pearls. First, we use high-speed light-sheet microscopy to show that transient, short-lived pearling events occur spontaneously in the mitochondrial network in every cell type we have examined, including primary fibroblasts, T-cells, neurons, and budding yeast. We present evidence that transient mitochondrial pearling occurs during important biological events, particularly during T cell activation and neuronal firing. Using our high-temporal resolution data, we identify two distinct categories of spontaneous pearling, i) internal pressure-driven pearling regulated by ionic flux, and ii) external tension-driven pearling regulated by molecular motors. By applying live-cell STED microscopy we document the structural reorganization of inner cristae membranes during mitochondrial pearling. We then compare numerous methods for inducing pearling, including the ability to induce these dynamics with single mitochondrion precision. These methods include ionophores, channel activators, osmotic shock, detergents, laser stimulation, membrane intercalating molecules, chemical fixation, and micro-needle force. These disparate inducers establish three main physical causes of pearling, i) ionic flux amplifying internal osmotic pressure, ii) membrane packing lowering bending elasticity, and iii) external mechanical force increasing membrane tension. Pearling dynamics thereby reveal a fundamental biophysical facet of mitochondrial biology. We suggest that pearling should take its place beside fission and fusion as a key process of mitochondrial dynamics, with implications for physiology, disease, and aging.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 15 participants under Xenon-induced anesthesia, interconnected neural mass models (NMMs) were developed and time-evolving regional neurophysiological variables and inter-regional connectivity strengths were inferred from the data. Analyses revealed significant correlations between consciousness levels and inter-regional connectivity, particularly in posterior parietal, occipital, and prefrontal regions. Moreover, results support a parietal, rather than frontal, network backbone to facilitate global consciousness. Regional-level analyses further identified correlates of consciousness within the posterior parietal and occipital regions. Lastly, reductions in consciousness were linked to stabilized cortical dynamics, reflected by changes in the eigenmodes of the system. This framework provides a novel, inference-based approach to investigating consciousness, offering a time-resolved perspective on neural mechanism correlates during altered states.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

However, the first version of Verkko was computationally expensive and could not resolve all regions of a typical human genome. Here we present Verkko2, which implements a more efficient read correction algorithm, improves repeat resolution and gap closing, introduces proximity-ligation-based haplotype phasing and scaffolding, and adds support for multiple long-read data types. These enhancements allow Verkko to assemble all regions of a diploid human genome, including the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes and both sex chromosomes. Together, these changes increase the number of telomere-to-telomere scaffolds by twofold, reduce runtime by fourfold, and improve assembly correctness. On a panel of 19 human genomes, Verkko2 assembles an average of 39 of 46 complete chromosomes as scaffolds, with 21 of these assembled as gapless contigs.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a key pathogen from this group associated with chronic lung infections that has been extensively studied in this context, but the mechanism driving its adaptation towards chronic colonisation in the CF lung is not fully understood. This work focuses on the adaptations of P. aeruginosa to long-term hypoxia, one of the important environmental pressures present in the CF lung, to investigate whether it drives the development of persistence in CF patients. We examined how an early CF isolate adapted to 6% oxygen over 28 days using an experimental evolution approach and showed that two distinct P. aeruginosa small colony variants (SCVs) emerged, one exclusively in hypoxia exposure cultures. Importantly, SCVs were more prevalent in hypoxia-adapted cultures than in normoxia-adapted cultures (98% vs <35%). Proteomic analysis revealed significant changes in the abundance of >200 proteins within 28 days, including proteins involved in antibiotic resistance, stress response, iron acquisition, biofilm formation and those previously associated with chronic infection. Importantly the observed changes in the proteome were distinct from changes reported after short-term exposure to hypoxia. Phenotypic characterisation of adapted cultures supported these findings, showing that hypoxia-adapted cultures developed higher resistance to 8 of 13 antibiotics tested; increased biofilm (1.8-4.1-fold (p<0.0001) and decreased pyocyanin production (2.6-fold, p<0.0001). All hypoxia-adapted cultures showed decreased siderophore production (2.9-3.6-fold, p<0.02). Two distinct patterns of adaptation to hypoxic conditions were observed, with the phenotypes of one culture being markedly different from the other two. Overall, we demonstrate that long-term hypoxia exposure contributes to multiple phenotype and proteome changes that are also observed in P. aeruginosa CF lung chronic infection, possibly opening the path to treatment of chronic infections.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

While senescence is a well-established driver of aging and age-related diseases, it is a highly heterogeneous process with significant variations across organisms, tissues, and cell types. The relatively low abundance of senescence in healthy aged tissues represents a major challenge to studying senescence in a given organ, including the human lung. To overcome this limitation, we developed a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning framework to generate a comprehensive senescence marker gene list in human lungs (termed SenSet) using the largest publicly available single-cell lung dataset, the Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA). We validated SenSet in a highly complex ex vivo human 3D lung tissue culture model subjected to the senescence inducers bleomycin, doxorubicin, or irradiation, and established its sensitivity and accuracy in characterizing senescence. Using SenSet, we identified and validated cell-type specific senescence signatures in distinct lung cell populations upon aging and environmental exposures.

However, these computational methods are often tailored to specific scenarios and validated on limited datasets and metrics, making their evaluation and comparison challenging. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmarking framework to systematically evaluate in silico perturbation methods across four key scenarios: predicting effects of unseen perturbations in known cell types, predicting effects of observed perturbations in unseen cell types, zero-shot transfer to bulk RNA-seq of cell lines, and application to real-world biological cases. For each scenario, we curated diverse and abundant datasets, standardizing them into flexible formats to enable efficient analysis. Additionally, we developed multiple metrics tailored to each scenario, facilitating a thorough and comparative evaluation of these methods. Our benchmarking study assessed 10 methods, ranging from linear baselines to advanced machine learning approaches, across these scenarios. While some methods demonstrated surprising efficacy in specific contexts, significant challenges remain, particularly in zero-shot predictions and the modeling of complex biological processes.

It induces pulmonary inflammation and activates multiple stress signaling pathways in bronchial epithelial cells, including the integrated stress response (ISR). The ISR is triggered by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2 in response to a variety of insults and is functionally antagonised by the eIF2alpha phosphatase subunit PPP1R15A. Deletion of PPP1R15A exaggerates the ISR and in many models protects against a cellular stress. However, loss of PPP1R15A was recently shown to exaggerate pulmonary fibrosis in bleomycin-challenged mice. We therefore wished to understand the role of PPP1R15A in the pulmonary response to cigarette smoke, which can cause both COPD and pulmonary fibrosis. Whole cigarette smoke rapidly activated the ISR in mucociliary differentiated human primary bronchial epithelial cells with those from COPD patients exhibiting higher levels of ISR. Acute exposure to cigarette smoke condensate induced a pro-inflammatory cytokine response accompanied by PPP1R15A expression. In this model, PPP1R15A induction was independent of eIF2alpha phosphorylation but was suppressed by antioxidants suggesting a response to oxidative stress. In vivo studies in mice revealed that PPP1R15A deficiency enhanced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in mice, suggesting a regulatory role for PPP1R15A in modulating the inflammatory response to smoke. Taken together, these data suggest that PPP1R15A is induced by cigarette smoke by an ISR-independent oxidative stress mechanism and ameliorates the pro-inflammatory cytokine response to cigarette smoke.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Presence of expanded CTG repeats in DMPK-mRNAs leads to the sequestration of RNA binding factors such as the Muscleblind like (MBNL) proteins resulting in widespread splicing defects contributing to progressive muscle weakness and myotonia. Here, we show that abnormal splicing of SORBS1 exon 25 found in skeletal muscle of myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients is a critical contributor to neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation and maintenance. Forced exclusion of SORBS1 exon 25 in mice results in NMJ degeneration with marked denervation and postsynaptic destabilization. In zebrafish, misregulation of sorbs1 exon 25 results in reduced motor function and abnormal AChR cluster morphology. Finally, we observed that forcing SORBS1 exon 25 exclusion in hiPSC-derived skeletal muscle cells reduces the formation of large AChR clusters upon agrin stimulation. Thus, our study identifies MBNL regulated SORBS1 alternative splicing during skeletal muscle development as a critical event for NMJ formation and maintenance. The aberrant splicing of SORBS1 exon 25 in DM1 expands our understanding of how splicing dysregulation compromises neuromuscular system communication, shedding light on the broader impact of mRNA splicing regulation on NMJ integrity.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Here, we demonstrate in vitro and in Drosophila cells that the mitotic kinase POLO phosphorylates PP187B at a conserved residue (T286) within a pocket implicated in the recognition of RVxF-containing target proteins. Phosphorylation of T286 inhibits PP187B binding to the RVxF motif of the SAC kinase MPS1, dampening the dephosphorylation of MPS1 T-loop. Phosphorylation of T286 is dynamically regulated during mitosis. It occurs at unattached/tensionless kinetochores and decreases as chromosomes congress. Expression of phosphomimetic PP187BT286D prevents MPS1 inactivation in metaphase and causes a SAC-dependent delay of anaphase onset. Conversely, an unphosphorylatable PP187BT286A mutant impairs MPS1 activation at unattached kinetochores and weakens the SAC. In vivo, larval neuroblasts expressing PP187BT286 phosphomutants exhibit frequent chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy. Thus, our findings identify POLO-mediated phosphorylation of PP187B as a critical regulatory strategy that fine-tunes phosphatase activity to ensure a robust and timely SAC and prevent genome instability.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

We discovered that pearling imposes a characteristic length scale, simultaneously mediating nucleoid disaggregation and establishing inter-nucleoid distancing with near-maximally achievable precision. Cristae invaginations play a dual role: lamellar cristae density determines pearling frequency and duration, and preserves the resulting nucleoid spacing after recovery. The distribution of mitochondrial genomes is thus fundamentally governed by the interplay between spontaneous pearling and cristae ultrastructure.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Here, we sought to express recombinant PFKFB2 and develop a robust protocol to measure its kinase activity. These studies resulted in the unexpected finding that bacterially expressed PFKFB2 is phosphorylated in situ on Ser483 but is not a result of autophosphorylation. Recombinant PFKFB2 was used to develop an enzymatic assay to test a library of molecules selected by the Atomwise AtomNet(R) AI platform. This resulted in the identification of a new inhibitor, B2, that inhibits PFKFB2 (IC50 3.29 M) and PFKFB3 (IC50 11.89 M). A-498 cells, which express both PFKFB2 and PFKFB3, were treated with B2. Seahorse XFe analysis revealed B2 inhibited cellular glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. Targeted LC/MS analysis showed B2 decreased fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and downstream glycolytic intermediates but increased fructose-6-phosphate levels, which is consistent with an inhibitory effect on PFK-1 activity. The LC/MS metabolic profile of A-498 cells treated under identical conditions with the known PFKFB3 inhibitor, PFK158, was distinct from that induced by B2.

Human cortical neurons differ from those of other species, such as rodents, in both their morphological and physiological characteristics. Could the distinct properties of human cortical neurons help explain the superior cognitive capabilities of humans? Understanding this relationship requires a metric to quantify how neuronal properties contribute to the functional complexity of single neurons, yet no such standardized measure currently exists. Here, we propose the Functional Complexity Index (FCI), a generalized, deep learning-based framework to assess the input-output complexity of neurons. By comparing the FCI of cortical pyramidal neurons from different layers in rats and humans, we identified key morpho-electrical factors that underlie functional complexity. Human cortical pyramidal neurons were found to be significantly more functionally complex than their rat counterparts, primarily due to differences in dendritic membrane area and branching pattern, as well as density and nonlinearity of NMDA-mediated synaptic receptors. These findings reveal the structural-biophysical basis for the enhanced functional properties of human neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

However, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying productive reiterative initiation and its functional implications has been hindered due to the complexity of heterogenous slippage transcripts. Here, we develop and employ 5' Terminal Native Elongating Transcript Sequencing (5'TNET-seq) to identify and quantify productive reiterative initiation events in Escherichia coli. 5'TNET-seq reveals that over 51% of promoters exhibit productive reiterative initiation. The conserved promoter -10 region, an appropriate spacer between the -10 region and the TSS, and the transcription initiation region associated with weak RNA-DNA hybrid stability, particularly >>AAA>> and >>TTT>> trinucleotide tracts, contribute to high productive reiterative initiation. In addition, up to four nucleotides can be added in a single cycle of productive reiterative initiation. A smaller transcription bubble is observed during productive reiterative initiation, which may stabilize the transcription initiation complex to regulate gene transcription. Our results suggest that productive reiterative initiation emerges as an inherent transcription process regulating biological processes, including cell wall synthesis, independent of protein regulators.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

In static environments, cells require high nutrient concentrations as they steadily consume non-renewable resources. In flowing environments, cells grow robustly at very low nutrient concentrations that are constantly replenished. Our simulation-guided experiments show how stopping flow halts growth within minutes and varying flow impacts growth gradients across bacterial populations. By precisely delivering nutrients using microfluidics, we learned that cells in flow can grow on glucose concentrations 1,000 times lower than those observed in typical laboratory experiments.

Research into natural variation and the evolution of plasticity frequently studies cis-regulatory elements with theory suggesting they are more important evolutionarily than trans-regulatory elements. Genome-wide association studies have supported this idea, observing a predominance of cis-loci affecting plasticity. However, studies in structured populations provide a contrasting image, raising questions about the genetic architecture of natural variation in plasticity. To circumvent potential statistical difficulties present in genome-wide association studies, we mapped loci underlying transcriptomic plasticity in response to salicylic acid using recombinant inbred lines generated from two random Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. We detected extensive transgressive segregation in the salicylic acid response, suggesting that plasticity to salicylate in Arabidopsis is polygenic. Most loci (>75%) underlying this variation act in trans, especially for loci influencing plasticity. Trans-acting loci were enriched in genome hotspots, with predominantly small effect sizes distributed across many genes. This could potentially explain their under-discovery in genome-wide association studies. This work reveals a potentially important role for trans-acting loci in plastic expression responses, with implications for understanding plant adaptation to different environments.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

For students to develop expertise in molecular biology visual literacy, they need to have structured experiences using and creating visual models, but there is little evidence to gauge how often undergraduate biology students are provided such opportunities. To investigate students' visual literacy experiences, we surveyed 66 instructors who taught lower division undergraduate biology courses with a focus on molecular biology concepts. We collected self-reported data about the frequency with which the instructors teach with visual models and we analyzed course exams to determine how instructors incorporated visual models into their assessments. We found that most instructors reported teaching with models in their courses, yet only 16% of exam items in the sample contained a visual model. There was not a statistically significant relationship between instructors' self-reported frequency of teaching with models and extent to which their exams contained models, signaling a potential mismatch between teaching and assessment practices. Although exam items containing models have the potential to elicit higher-order cognitive skills through model-based reasoning, we found that when instructors included visual models in their exams the majority of the items only targeted the lower-order cognitive skills of Bloom's Taxonomy.

Mixotrophy in ciliates is commonplace, but has been investigated at a cellular and molecular level almost entirely in one organism, Paramecium bursaria. Reliance on just one model system makes it difficult to know which cell biological aspects of this system represent general features of ciliate mixotrophy versus accidental features of the specific organism. Here we describe the cell biology and genome of the giant heterotrichous ciliate Stentor pyriformis. We show that this giant unicellular organism contains Chlorella variabilis as its endosymbiont, that the Chlorella can live freely outside the host, that within the host the Chlorella cells are docked near the cell surface, surrounded by microtubule ""baskets"", and that the photosynthetic efficiency of the Chlorella is reduced inside the Stentor cell compared to when it is free-living outside the host, with photon energy instead being shunted to non-photochemical quenching. Compared to the non-mixotrophic Stentor coeruleus, S. pyriformis has several distinct cellular features that may be related to endosymbiosis: the presence of microtubule baskets, which are absent in S. coeruleus; positive rather than negative phototaxis, which is likely an adaptation to allow the photosynthetic symbionts access to sufficient light; and a lack of pigment in the host cell, which may be an adaptation to tolerate high light levels. Compared to P. bursaria, S. pyriformis has several similar cellular features: in both organisms, the symbiont is a strain of Chlorella variabilis; the Chlorella endosymbiont retains the ability to live freely when separated from the host; and the algal symbionts contained in perialgal vesicles are docked at the cell surface. One potentially informative difference between P. bursaria and S. pyriformis is that S. pyriformis employs a standard genetic code, similar to other Stentor species but different from most other ciliates, including P. bursaria, which use a non-standard code in which one or more stop-codons are respecified to encode amino acids. This difference in genetic code could serve as a barrier to impede gene transfer from symbiont to host in other ciliates, but this would not be a factor in S. pyriformis. A second cell biological difference is that whereas P. bursaria performs phototaxis by a kinetic accumulation mechanism, in which swimming is non-directional but cells slow down in regions of higher light intensity, S. pyriformis performs directed swimming towards the direction of high light intensity. However, as in P. bursaria, phototaxis in S. pyriformis requires the presence of the Chlorella, implying a potential flow of information from the symbiont to direct the orientation and swimming of the host cell. We propose that S. pyriformis will serve as a useful model system for studying the evolution of mixotrophy and endosymbiosis, with unique advantages in terms of size and regenerative ability as well as distinct cellular and genomic features compared with other mixotrophic ciliate models.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959802

Here, we examined spatial and temporal evolution of climate-related gene promoters in an insular species, the Western-Canaries lizard Gallotia galloti, across diverse environmental conditions over nine years. Outlier SNPs linked to elevation-sensitive environmental factors identified adaptively significant loci, including in aquaporin and Electron Transfer Flavoprotein Subunit Alpha (ETFA) gene promoters, demonstrating roles in local climate adaptation. Adaptive indexing mapped climate-driven genetic differentiation across the landscape, revealing local adaptation along an elevational gradient. Signatures of climate-related selection at the temporal scale showed specific promoters shaped by balancing selection supporting survival across environments, while others experienced positive selection, revealing a selective sweep of beneficial alleles. In addition, elevation-based ancestry groups of climate loci differed from the pattern observed in neutral loci, and temporal shifts in ancestry composition responded to preceding extreme weather events over the span of a single generation. Selection on specific promoter regions indicated adaptive evolution in transcription factor binding sites with the potential to enhance transcriptional flexibility, resulting in increased cellular stress tolerance. Our findings open new avenues into genomic mechanisms of resilience across spatially heterogeneous environments and how rapid evolution correlates with extreme weather events associated with climate change.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

While contemporary research has somewhat advanced our understanding of DMT, and psychedelics more broadly, there is little research that integrates time-resolved measures of subjective experience with temporally fine-grained brain imaging. We therefore present the current study, a repeated-measures dose-dependent study of the subjective and neural dynamics induced through DMT under naturalistic conditions. Nineteen participants received either a 20mg or 40mg dose of freebase DMT across two dosing sessions in a blinded, counterbalanced order, with blinding rates consistent across doses. Electroencephalography (EEG) data was collected, as well as time-resolved retrospective measures of subjective experience (Temporal Experience Tracing). Both doses of DMT induced rapid changes in experience dimensions. However, the 40mg dose induced significantly more extreme visual hallucinations and emotionally intense experiences. Further, we computed a variety of neural markers on the EEG data, and found that oscillatory alpha power and permutation entropy were most strongly associated with continuous subjective experience dimensions. Strikingly, lempel-ziv complexity, a previously hailed as a robust correlate of subjective experiences within the psychedelic-state, was the least strongly associated neural marker. These findings provide an important insight into how distinct neural dynamics may contribute to this radical and intense altered state of consciousness.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

Previous studies have shown that the deletion of PHB2 results in an arrest in proliferation due to impaired mitochondrial function regulated by the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1. The function of PHB2 in immune cells remains unclear, however, some studies suggest that PHB2 plays a role in the cell membranes of B and T cells. In order to elucidate the role of PHB2 in immune cells, we generated PHB2-deficient T cells. Our findings reveal a pivotal role for PHB2 in the proliferation and differentiation of T cells. PHB2 deficiency inhibits T cell proliferation by inducing a cell cycle arrest at the G1 to S phase, thereby preventing the differentiation into effector T cells. Furthermore, in contrast to previous reports, T cells lacking PHB2 are more resistant to apoptosis. Metabolic analysis reveals that PHB2-deficient T cells fail to upregulate their glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation upon activation, thus rendering them incapable to proliferate.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

The emergence of single-cell multi-omics technologies has driven the development of several methods that integrate transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data to infer GRNs. While these methods provide examples of their utility in discovering new regulatory interactions, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating their mechanistic and predictive properties as well as their ability to recover known interactions is lacking. To address this, we built a comprehensive framework, Gene Regulatory nETwork Analysis (GRETA), available as a Snakemake pipeline, that includes state of the art methods decomposing their different steps in a modular manner. With it, we found that the GRNs were highly sensitive to methods choices, such as changes in random seeds, or replacing steps in the inference pipelines, as well as whether they use paired or unpaired multimodal data. Although the obtained networks performed moderately well in predictive evaluation tasks and partially recovered known interactions, they struggled to capture causal relationships from perturbation assays. Our work brings attention to the challenges of inferring GRNs from single-cell omics, offers guidelines, and presents a flexible framework for developing and testing new approaches.

Kun-peng matched Sylph, achieving the highest precision and lowest false-positive rates while demonstrating superior time and memory efficiency among all tested tools. Furthermore, Kun-peng's efficient database architecture enables the practical utilization of large-scale reference databases that were previously computationally prohibitive. In comprehensive testing across 586 air, water, soil, and human metagenomic samples using an expansive pan-domain database (204,477 genomes, 4.3TB), Kun-peng classified 69.78-94.29% of reads, achieving 38-43% higher classification rates than Kraken2 with the standard database. Unexpectedly, Sylph failed to classify any reads in air samples and left > 99.85% of reads unclassified in water and soil samples. In terms of computational efficiency, Kun-peng processed each sample in 0.2~11.2 minutes using only 4.0~35.4GB peak memory. Remarkably, these processing times were comparable to Kraken2 using the standard database (81GB, 5% of the pan-domain database). Memory-wise, Kun-peng required only 35.4GB peak memory with the pan-domain database, representing a 473-fold reduction compared to Kraken2. When compared to Sylph, Kun-peng processes samples up to 46.3 times faster while using up to 20.6 times less memory.

They infect and cause disease in humans, animals and plants but also play crucial roles in the ecology of microbial communities. Tolerance to genetic change, high-mutation rates, adaptations to hosts and immune escape has driven high divergence of viral genes, hampering their functional annotation and phylogenetic inference. The protein structure is more conserved than sequence and can be used for searches of distant homologs and evolutionary analysis of divergent proteins. Structures of viral proteins are traditionally underrepresented in public databases, but recent advances in protein structure prediction allows us to address this issue. Combining two state-of-the-art approaches, AlphaFold2-ColabFold and ESMFold, we predicted models for 85,000 proteins from 4,400 human and animal viruses, expanding the structural coverage for viral proteins by 30 times compared to experimental structures. We also performed structural and network analyses of the models to demonstrate their utility for functional annotation and inference of distant phylogenetic relationships. Taking this approach, we examined the deep evolutionary history of viral class-I fusion glycoproteins, gaining insights on the origins of coronavirus spike protein. To enable further discoveries, we have created Viro3D (https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/), a virus species-centred protein structure database. It allows users to search, browse and download protein models from a virus of interest and explore similar structures present in other virus species.

Despite the critical importance of antibodies in a wide range of areas of biomedical significance, the traditional process of antibody discovery is limited by inefficiency, high costs and failure rates, fundamental logistical hurdles, limited scalability potential, and long turnaround times. Recent computational biology efforts, including machine learning/artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, have proven to have critical capabilities and advantages over purely experimental techniques, disrupting a number of areas that have traditionally met with limited success, such as protein structure modeling, enzyme engineering, drug design, and others (1-3). In the context of antibodies, AI-based approaches have been developed to optimize existing antibodies and generate novel antibody sequences in a target-agnostic manner (4-6). However, the ability of AI approaches to generate novel paired antibody sequences against a specific target (antigen) of interest has not been validated. In this work, we present MAGE (Monoclonal Antibody GEnerator), a sequence-based protein Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned for the task of generating paired variable heavy and light chain antibody sequences against antigens of interest. Here we show that MAGE is capable of efficiently generating diverse antibody sequences that are distinct from the antibody sequences found in the training datasets, with experimentally validated binding specificity against SARS- CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), an emerging avian influenza H5N1 viral hemagglutinin (H5), and respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV-A) prefusion F. MAGE is trained on protein sequence alone and requires only an antigen sequence as input for antibody design, with no need for a preexisting antibody template. MAGE represents a first-in-class model capable of designing human antibodies with demonstrated functionality against multiple targets. AI models for generation of human antibodies will provide unique and disruptive capabilities in the far-reaching field of antibody science.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

Inhibiting eIF4A with the small molecule Zotatifin reduces translation of transcripts related to the cell cycle and survival. This results in downregulation of AKT, STAT-5, and MCL-1 and underlies synergy of Zotatifin with Venetoclax. The drug combination promotes apoptosis across AML genotypes, while the effect on healthy blood cells is limited.

Here, we reveal a bacterial anti-phage system that mediates immune signaling through nucleobase modification. Immunity is triggered by phage nucleotide kinases, which, combined with the system-encoded adenosine deaminase, produce deoxyinosine 5'-triphosphate (dITP) as immune messengers. The dITP signal activates downstream effector to mediate cellular NAD+ depletion, resulting in population-level defense through the death of infected cells. To counteract immune signaling, phages deploy specialized enzymes that deplete cellular dAMP, the precursor of dITP messengers.

MethodsPCORnet and HealthVerity (HV) data assets were used to identify patients aged [&ge;]65 years with no prior stroke and COVID-19 or influenza during January 1-December 31, 2022, and AIS from 3 days before to 28 days after COVID-19 or influenza diagnosis. Overall demographic information (age [for HV], sex, race/ethnicity), underlying conditions, level of care, outcomes, and incidence were described and compared between those with early (-3 to 7 days from diagnosis date) and late (8 to 28 days) AIS.

ResultsAmong 245,352 (PC) and 639,396 (HV) patients aged [&ge;]65 years with COVID-19, the incidence of ischemic stroke in the 3 days prior to 7 days after diagnosis of COVID-19 (PC: 962/100,000 and HV: 447/100,000) and influenza (PC: 589/100,000 and HV: 387/100,000) was significantly higher than in the 8 to 28 days after diagnosis (COVID PC: 81/100,000 and HV: 141/100,000)(influenza PC:75/100,000 and HV: 15/100,000)(all P<0.01).

Powered by high sequence coverage at targeted loci of interest, TDAC-seq can be uniquely integrated with CRISPR perturbations to enable the functional dissection of cis-regulatory elements, where genetic perturbations and their effects on chromatin accessibility are superimposed on the same single chromatin fiber and resolved at single-nucleotide resolution. We employed TDAC-seq to parse CRISPR edits that activate fetal hemoglobin in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during erythroid differentiation as well as in pooled CRISPR and base editing screens tiling an enhancer controlling the globin locus.

This form of regulation is enabled by voltage sensing domains (VSDs) that respond to transmembrane voltage differences by changing their conformation and exerting force on the pore to open or close it. Here we use cryogenic electron microscopy to study the neuronal Kv2.1 channel in lipid vesicles with and without a voltage difference across the membrane. Hyperpolarizing voltage differences displace the positively charged S4 helix in the voltage sensor by one helical turn (~5 [A]). When this displacement occurs, the S4 helix changes its contact with the pore at two different interfaces. When these changes are observed in fewer than four voltage sensors the pore remains open, but when they are observed in all four voltage sensors the pore constricts. The constriction occurs because the S4 helix, as it displaces inward, squeezes the right-handed helical bundle of pore lining S6 helices. A similar conformational change occurs upon hyperpolarization of the EAG1 channel. Therefore, while Kv2.1 and EAG1 are from distinct architectural classes of voltage-dependent ion channels, called domain-swapped and nondomain-swapped, the manner in which the voltage sensors gate their pores is very similar.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

Despite decades of major advances and key insights from molecular systematics, organismal anatomical features remain a key source of biological data for both inferring phylogenies and investigating patterns of trait evolution among fossil and extant species. In paleobiology, morphologic characters are typically the only source of information available for reconstructing evolutionary trees. Systematists working with fossil data must make decisions regarding how morphological characters are modeled, whether they are continuous or categorical, and how to address biological sources of rate variation. To determine the impact of how different models of morphological evolution influence phylogenetic inferences and downstream comparative analyses of fossil data, we competed a series of increasingly complex model configurations of character evolution to a dataset of Cambrian-Ordovician trilobites containing both discrete morphological characters and continuous traits. Competed models vary in complexity, ranging from simple constant rate scenarios with only discrete categorical traits, to complex evolutionary models including both discrete and quantitative traits across multiple ecological partitions while accounting for multiple sources of rate variation. We compared topological distributions across competed models by visualizing their distances in multidimensional treespace. Results indicate the addition of continuous traits dramatically improves support for complex evolutionary scenarios. Remarkably, we find model complexity also has a major impact on which regions of treespace are explored, which suggests a critical need to carefully model morphologic evolution even when systematists are only interested in patterns of phylogenetic relationships alone.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

Results demonstrated that the Astral analyzer outperformed the Eclipse, achieving over 40% more unique residue pairs (URP) due to its superior sensitivity and dynamic range, attributed to its multi-reflection time-of-flight analyzer and nearly lossless ion transmission. Additionally, the study revealed that single higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation methods significantly outperformed stepped HCD methods on the Astral, while the Eclipse maintained similar performance across both approaches.

These networks are known as gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Several joint dimensionality reduction (JDR) methods and tools for integrating multi-modal data have been developed in recent years. This study presents a new approach to integrate multi-modal data of different dimensions to consider sample-specific GRNs with multi-omics data in ten cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We compare JDR models that include GRNs with those that do not, assessing their association with patient survival.

The periosteum is typically quiescent, but upon fracture, periosteal cells proliferate and contribute to bone fracture repair. The expansion of the periosteum is regulated by gene transcription; however, the molecular mechanisms behind periosteal expansion are unclear. Here, we show that Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) mediate periosteal expansion and periosteal cell proliferation. Bone fracture increases the number of YAP-expressing periosteal cells, and deletion of YAP and TAZ from Osterix (Osx) expressing cells impairs early periosteal expansion. Mechanistically, YAP regulates both  cell-intrinsic and  cell-extrinsic factors that allow for periosteal expansion. Specifically, we identified Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) as a cell extrinsic factor regulated by YAP, that rescues the impairment of periosteal expansion upon YAP/TAZ deletion. Together, these data establish YAP mediated transcriptional mechanisms that induce periosteal expansion in the early stages of fracture repair and provide new putative targets for therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

High-resolution analysis of actin cytoskeleton organization disclosed the generation of tension-bearing, circumferential actomyosin bundles in the endothelial cortex that drive EC deformation and vessel constriction. Importantly, the loss of circumferential actin bundles in krit1/ccm1-deficient ECs causes cell enlargement and impaired vessel constriction that culminate in dilated vessels, characteristic of cerebral cavernous malformation.

Here we combine biochemistry and molecular dynamics simulations to examine, at single base-pair resolution, how nucleosome spacing controls chromatin phase separation. We show that as DNA linkers extend from 25 bp to 30 bp, as examplars of 10N+5 and 10N (integer N) bp lengths, chromatin condensates become less thermodynamically stable and nucleosome mobility increases. Simulations reveal that this is due to trade-offs between inter- and intramolecular nucleosome stacking, favored by rigid 10N+5 and 10N bp linkers, respectively. A remodeler can induce or inhibit phase separation by moving nucleosomes, changing the balance between intra- and intermolecular stacking. The intrinsic phase separation capacity of chromatin enables fine tuning of compaction and dynamics, likely contributing to heterogeneous chromatin organization in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

However, the temporal coordination of AR and co-regulatory binding factors, epigenomic modifications, and 3D chromatin dynamics during AR-mediated transcription remains unclear. Results Using a time-course model of androgen stimulation in LNCaP prostate cancer cells, we integrated temporal multi-omics datasets into the MOFA+ framework to investigate AR-mediated transcriptional dynamics. Our analyses uncovered a critical role for rapid AR binding at gene promoters in driving nascent transcription of AR target genes.

Notably, we identified a temporal early switch in nascent transcription post-androgen stimulation, from MYC to AR target genes, likely mediated by transient androgen-induced 3D chromatin interactions. Significance These findings reveal that androgen stimulation rapidly reorganizes 3D chromatin structure and differential MYC and AR transcription factor binding to trigger three distinct patterns of temporal epigenome states associated with the establishment of AR-mediated transcription in prostate cancer. These insights advance understanding of AR regulation in prostate cancer and contribute to a deeper understanding of the temporal relationship between MYC and AR transcriptional regulation in hormone-driven cancers.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

In this study we establish and characterise a novel split-CRISPR/Cas9 system we term Sex Conversion Induced by CRISPR (SCIC) in Ceratitis capitata (the Mediterranean fruit fly), a major agricultural pest with a global distribution. Using the white eye gene for toolkit selection, we achieved up to 100% CRISPR/Cas9 efficiency, displaying the feasibility of C. capitata split-CRISPR/Cas9 systems using constitutive promoters. We then induce sex-conversion by targeting the transformer gene in a SCIC approach aimed for SIT-mediated releases upon radiation-based sterilisation. Knock-out of transformer induced partial to full female-to-male sex-conversion, with remaining individuals all being intersex and sterile. SCIC population modelling shows superior performance to traditional population control strategies, allowing for faster population elimination with fewer released sterile males. Our results build the foundation for further genetic pest control methods of C. capitata and related tephritid agricultural pests.

Significance statementAgricultural industry faces increasing threat from a multitude of pests including the domineering tephritid fruit flies. Genetic engineering of these pests has been recently tested to develop more efficient and affordable population control strategies. Here, we develop a new approach to improve existing population control measures by testing it in one of the most famous and dangerous tephritids, the Mediterranean fruit fly. Through optimisation, we achieved desired outcomes: female fly absence achieved via semi and full female-to-male sex conversion by CRISPR-mediated genome editing through gene mutations. For the first time in this insect, we used a split, and thus inducible, approach for such genome editing. Our work holds the potential to significantly improve tephritid population control strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

The recent introduction of KRAS inhibitors has been a source of tremendous enthusiasm; however, therapeutic resistance has emerged, and combination approaches are needed. In particular, it is important to understand how downstream signaling of KRAS supports PDAC growth. For example, DUSP6, a dual-specificity phosphatase that modulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation and RAS pathway activity, has emerged as an important regulator of KRAS-MAPK signaling. Analysis across diverse bulk RNA-seq datasets revealed that DUSP6 is markedly overexpressed in primary tumor samples compared to non-tumoral pancreatic tissue. Interestingly, both human bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data indicated that DUSP6 was upregulated in epithelial cells within the tumor. Further examination showed that DUSP6 was also overexpressed in metastatic samples relative to primary tumor samples, and this upregulation correlated with the quasi-mesenchymal/squamous molecular subtype. Pertaining to its clinical significance, patients with high DUSP6 expression exhibited a poorer prognosis for overall survival than those with low expression. Subsequent gene set enrichment analysis of publicly available datasets revealed the enrichment of pathways associated with cell migration and metabolism in metastatic samples. To elucidate the role of DUSP6 in these pathways, we developed PDAC cell lines stably knocked down DUSP6 and observed a concurrent increase in ERK/MAPK activation. Additionally, suppression of DUSP6 demonstrated PDAC cell-specific alterations in migratory capacity . Next, we assessed the metabolism of PDAC cell lines following DUSP6 knockdown and observed a notable increase in basal glycolysis. Interestingly, despite the observed alterations in migratory capacity and glycolytic metabolism upon DUSP6 modulation, the combined approach of DUSP6 downregulation and glycolysis inhibition failed to affect the observed migratory phenotype, suggesting that glycolytic demands did not drive the migratory phenotype . In summary, these findings suggest that DUSP6 elicits two independent functions in PDAC: migratory capacity and glycolysis metabolism, providing new insights into the function of DUSP6 in PDAC.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

Here, we developed a series of red fluorescent G protein-coupled receptor activation-based (GRAB) ACh sensors, with a wide detection range and expanded spectral profile. The high-affinity sensor, rACh1h, reliably detects ACh release in various brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and cortex. Moreover, rACh1h can be co-expressed with green fluorescent sensors in order to record ACh release together with other neurochemicals in various behavioral contexts using fiber photometry and two-photon imaging, with high spatiotemporal resolution. These new ACh sensors can therefore provide valuable new insights regarding the functional role of the cholinergic system under both physiological and pathological conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

Remarkably, in the absence of such signals, collections of pluripotent stem cells can still self-organise and break symmetry in vitro. One such example is gastruloids, three-dimensional stem cell aggregates that form an anterior-posterior axis through the polarised expression of the gene Brachyury/T. How robust and reproducible cell proportions are achieved in these self-organised embryo-like structures is not understood. Here, through quantitative experiments and theoretical modelling, we dissect tissue rheology and cellular feedback in gastruloids. We show that the initial population of Brachyury-expressing cells critically influences the timing of symmetry-breaking. We propose a cell differentiation model, whereby pluripotent cells inhibit mesoderm differentiation, accounting for the observed cell fate dynamics. Our findings suggest that cell-cell communication dictates temporal cell proportions, while differential tissue mechanics governs spatial pole formation. Our work highlights the importance of initial cell heterogeneity in gastruloid development and offers a framework to identify feedback mechanisms in multicellular systems, advancing our understanding of how embryo-like structures self-organise.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

In Drosophila the neuromodulator octopamine (OA) specifically affects STM through adrenergic-like receptors within neurons in the Mushroom Body (MB) network. However, why OA preferentially impacts STM remains unclear. A fly brain connectome reveals that two OA-VPM3 neurons provide most OA input to the MB network. Artificial OA-VPM3 activation during olfactory learning enhances STM and can divert odor salience. -adrenergic-like receptor knock-down in MB {beta} and {gamma} lobe MB Output Neurons (MBONs) generally impaired STM, while {beta}-adrenergic-like receptor loss from  lobe MBONs enhanced memory.

From the first COVID-19 case detected through March 25, 2022, 66,684 of 196,652 residents of Californias state prison system were infected, most of them in two large winter waves of outbreaks that reached all 35 of the state prisons. We used individual-level data on disease timing and nightly room assignments in these prisons to reconstruct locations and pathways of transmission statistically, and from that estimated reproduction numbers, locations of unobserved infection events, and the subsequent magnitude and distribution of long COVID prevalence. Where earlier work has recommended smaller cells over large dormitory housing to reduce transmission, recommended use of cells with solid doors over those with bars only, and cautioned against reliance on solid doors (e.g., in cold months when HVAC systems can circulate aerosols), we found evidence of substantial transmission in both dorms and cells regardless of the door and season. Effective reproduction numbers were found to range largely between 0 and 5, in both cells and dorms of all door types. Our estimates of excess case rates suggest that as a result of disparities in incarceration, prison outbreaks contributed to disproportionate disease burden on Black and Indigenous people in California. We estimated that 9,100-11,000 people have developed long COVID as a result of infection in these prison outbreaks, 1,700-2,000 of them with disabling consequences, and that this burden is disproportionately on Black and Indigenous people in comparison to the state as a whole. We urge high-quality medical care for prison residents affected by long COVID, and decarceration to reduce the risk of future outbreaks of both COVID-19 and other diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1735250959803

In North America, infections in novel avian and mammalian species suggest the potential for changing ecology and establishment of new animal reservoirs. Outbreaks among domestic birds have persisted despite aggressive culling, necessitating a re-examination of how these outbreaks were sparked and maintained. To recover how these viruses were introduced and disseminated in North America, we analyzed 1,818 Hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences sampled from North American wild birds, domestic birds and mammals from November 2021-September 2023 using Bayesian phylodynamic approaches. Using HA, we infer that the North American panzootic was driven by [~]8 independent introductions into North America via the Atlantic and Pacific Flyways, followed by rapid dissemination westward via wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, shorebirds, and Galliformes, while species such as songbirds, raptors, and owls mostly acted as dead-end hosts. Unlike the epizootic of 2015, outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by [~]46-113 independent introductions from wild birds, with some onward transmission. Backyard birds were infected [~]10 days earlier on average than birds in commercial poultry production settings, suggesting that they could act as ""early warning signals"" for transmission upticks in a given area. Our findings support wild birds as an emerging reservoir for HPAI transmission in North America and suggest continuous surveillance of wild Anseriformes and shorebirds as crucial for outbreak inference. Future prevention of agricultural outbreaks may require investment in strategies that reduce transmission at the wild bird/agriculture interface, and investigation of backyard birds as putative early warning signs.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

However, the mechanism(s) by which changes in LD composition and dynamics contribute to pathophysiology of these disorders remains unclear. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a droplet associated protein with a common risk variant (E4) that confers the largest increase in genetic risk for late-onset AD. E4 is associated with both increased neuroinflammation and excess LD accumulation. In the current study, we sought to quantitatively profile the lipid and protein composition of LDs between the neutral E3 and risk variant E4, to gain insight into potential LD-driven contributions to AD pathogenesis. Targeted replacement mice expressing human E3 or E4 were injected with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and after 24 hours, hepatic lipid droplets were isolated for proteomic and lipidomic analyses. Lipidomics revealed a shift in the distribution of glycerophospholipids in E4 LDs with a concomitant increase in phosphatidylcholine species, and overall, the baseline profile of E4 LDs resembled that of the LPS-treated groups. Quantitative proteomics showed that LDs from E4 mice are enriched for proteins involved in protein/vesicle transport but have decreased levels of proteins involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation. Interestingly, proteins associated with LDs showed substantial overlap with previously published lists of AD postmortem tissue and microglia -omics studies, suggesting a potential role for LDs in modulating AD risk or progression. Given this, we exposed primary microglia from the same E3 or E4 mice to exogenous lipid, inflammatory stimulation, necroptotic N2A cells (nN2A), or a combination of treatments to evaluate LD formation and its impact on the cells immune state. Microglia from E4 mice accumulated more LDs in every condition tested, at baseline, and following addition of fatty acids, LPS stimulation, or nN2As. E4 microglia also secreted significantly more cytokines (TNF, IL-1b, IL-10) than E3 microglia in the control, oleic acid, and nN2A treatment conditions, yet showed a blunted response to LPS. In sum, these results suggest that E4 microglia accumulate more LDs compared to E3 microglia and that E4 is associated with a basal LD composition that resembles a pro-inflammatory cell. Together with the high overlap of the LD proteome with established AD-associated datasets, these data further support the idea that alterations in LD dynamics, particularly within microglia, may contribute to the increased risk for AD associated with APOE4.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

As such early identification of emerging bacterial strains capable of rapidly evolving AMR is key. Although antimicrobial tolerance and persistence are precursor phenotypes for AMR, little evidence exists to support their importance in real-world settings. Here we used bacterial genome wide association on national genomic surveillance data of the diarrhoeal pathogen Shigella sonnei (n=3745) to agnostically identify common genetic signatures among lineages convergently evolving toward AMR (n=15). This revealed an association of an AMR trajectory with a multi- and highly variable second copy of metG, borne by a phage-plasmid we called pWPMR2. Further analyses revealed that pWPMR2 was present across clinically relevant enteric pathogens globally, including past and contemporary outbreaks, and that the additional-metG mechanism was present across multiple bacterial phyla. Functional microbiology, experimental evolution, and single-cell physiology studies confirmed that the expression of auxiliary metG, particularly the mutated version on pWPMR2, created a sub population of persister cells predisposed to survival in, and evolving resistance against, third generation cephalosporins. Thus, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of auxiliary metG carriage that predisposes bacteria to AMR with real world impacts. Furthermore, our approach is a timely example of using genomic epidemiology to rapidly guide functional microbiology studies in the era of routine genomic surveillance, and also highlights several deficiencies in current AMR surveillance practices.","NA","medrxiv",1735250959803

We term this process ""semantic mining,"" which, unlike traditional genome mining, can access a sequence landscape unconstrained by discovered evolutionary innovation. We validate this approach by experimentally testing the activity of generated anti-CRISPR proteins and toxin-antitoxin systems, including de novo genes with no significant homology to any natural protein. Strikingly, in-context protein design with Evo achieves potent activity and high experimental success rates even in the absence of structural hypotheses, known evolutionary conservation, or task-specific fine-tuning. We then use Evo to autocomplete millions of prompts to produce SynGenome, a first-of-its-kind database containing over 120 billion base pairs of AI-generated genomic sequences that enables semantic mining across many possible functions. The semantic mining paradigm enables functional exploration that ventures beyond the observed evolutionary universe.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

Numerous inferential methods have been developed to account for the effect of spatial autocorrelation when evaluating map-to-map similarity. A popular method to generate surrogate maps with preserved spatial autocorrelation is the spin test. Here we show that a key component of the procedure -- projecting brain maps to a spherical surface -- distorts distance relationships between vertices. These distortions result in surrogate maps that imperfectly preserve spatial autocorrelation, yielding inflated false positive rates. We then confirm that targeted removal of individual spins with high distortion reduces false positive rates. Collectively, this work highlights the importance of accurately representing and manipulating cortical geometry when generating surrogate maps for use in map-to-map comparisons.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

Viral sequencing during the pandemic allowed us to track disease spread, quickly identify new variants, and guide the development of vaccines. Tiled amplicon sequencing, in which a panel of primers is used for multiplex amplification of fragments across an entire genome, was the cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. The speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of this method led to its implementation in academic and public health laboratories across the world and adaptation to a broad range of viral pathogens. However, similar methods are not available for larger bacterial genomes, for which whole-genome sequencing typically requires in vitro culture. This increases costs, error rates and turnaround times. The need to culture poses particular problems for medically important bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which are slow to grow and challenging to culture. As a proof of concept, we developed two novel whole-genome amplicon panels for M. tuberculosis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Applying our amplicon panels to clinical samples, we show the ability to classify pathogen subgroups and to reliably identify markers of drug resistance without culturing. Development of this work in clinical settings has the potential to dramatically reduce the time of diagnosis of drug resistance for multiple drugs in parallel, enabling earlier intervention for high priority pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

However, whether and to what degree L1 activity directly impacts genome integrity is unclear. Here, we apply whole-genome sequencing to experimental models of L1 expression to comprehensively define the spectrum of genomic changes caused by L1. We provide definitive evidence that L1 expression frequently and directly causes both local and long-range chromosomal rearrangements, small and large segmental copy-number alterations, and subclonal copy-number heterogeneity due to ongoing chromosomal instability. Mechanistically, all these alterations arise from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by L1-encoded ORF2p. The processing of ORF2p-generated DSB ends prior to their ligation can produce diverse rearrangements of the target sequences. Ligation between DSB ends generated at distal loci can generate either stable chromosomes or unstable dicentric, acentric, or ring chromosomes that undergo subsequent evolution through breakage-fusion bridge cycles or DNA fragmentation. Together, these findings suggest L1 is a potent mutagenic force capable of driving genome evolution beyond simple insertions.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

Coral bleaching, the disruption of the symbiosis between stony corals and zooxanthellate algae, is driven by climate change-induced seawater warming and further exacerbated by pathogenic microbes. However, how pathogens, especially viruses, contribute to accelerated bleaching remains poorly understood. The present study utilizes the model sea anemone Nematostella vectensis to explore these dynamics by creating a transgenic line with a reporter gene regulated by sequences from two RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) genes involved in antiviral responses. Under heat stress, the reporter gene showed significant upregulation, indicating that these regulatory sequences are indeed responsive to thermal stress. Analyses of transcriptome data of N. vectensis, Exaiptasia diaphana (another sea anemone), and the stony coral Stylophora pistillata revealed stress-induced activation of a set of bona fide immune-related genes conserved between the three species. Population-specific differences in stress-induced transcriptional responses of immune-related genes were evident in both Nematostella and Stylophora, depending on geographic origin. In Exaiptasia, the presence or absence of zooxanthellae also influenced stress-induced immune gene expression. To test whether the viruses themselves may contribute to this immune response under stress, we subjected Nematostella polyps to variable periods of heat stress and measured the transcript levels of resident viruses as well as selected antiviral genes. While the antiviral genes responded within 1-3 hours of heat stress, viral gene expression was already upregulated within 30 minutes, suggesting that their increase might be contributing to the elevated immune response under stress, and consequentially, the further demise of organismal homeostasis. These findings highlight the complex interplay between environmental stress, viruses, immune responses, and symbiotic states in Hexacorallia. Better understanding of these mechanisms could provide insights into the role of immune pathways in coral resilience and bleaching in a changing climate.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

To date, almost all megaphages have evaded cultivation, with only phage G being in active culture for over 50 years. We examined with multiomics this five decades long cultivated history from nine different laboratories with five different lab variants to the modern era. In this work, we resolved the five complete phage G genomes, the particle proteome, de novo methylome, and used artificial intelligence (AI) to annotate the genome of phage G. Phage G is one of the largest phages with a size of >0.6 {micro}m, about half the width of the host cell, and a 499 kbp, non-permuted, linear genome that has, uniquely among known phages, two pairs of ends. Its closest known relative is Moose phage W30-1 which was metagenomically assembled without cultivation from a moose rumen sample. Phage G has >650 protein-coding open reading frames (ORFs), with >65% being hypothetical proteins with no known function, with the rest of the genome geared towards nucleic acid replication (e.g., helicases, polymerases, endonucleases) and are structural in nature (e.g., capsid, tail, portal, terminase). The genome encodes a 35 kbp stretch with 66 ORFs without any known functional homology, a cryptic genomic region that is roughly the size of phage lambda. Phage G has an expansive repertoire of auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) acquired from its bacterial host, including a phoH,ftsZ,UvsX/RecA-like, gyrA, gyrB,and DHFR. Furthermore, AMGs discovered in phage G could manipulate host sporulation (sspD, RsfA, spoK) and antiviral escape genes (e.g., anti-CBass nuclease and Anti-Pycsar protein). Phage proteomics found >15% of the protein ORFs were present in either the wild-type or mutant variants of phage G, including genes involved in replication (e.g.,UvsX/RecA-like), host sporulation, as well as structural genes (e.g., capsid, tail, portal). The methylome of phage G was localized to the cryptic region with limited functional homology, with supervised machine learning (i.e., HMMs) was unable to resolve this region, but was resolved with protein structural AI. This cryptic region was a hot spot for methylation at 32%, where many of the functions of the ORF are still unknown.

By screening 10 million eukaryotic proteins, we identified several domains that define multi-copy gene families and frequently co-occur with TE/viral domains. Among these, a Tc1/Mariner transposase helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain was captured by F-box genes in the Caenorhabditis genus, creating a new class of F-box genes. For specific members of this class, like fbxa-215, we found that the HTH domain is required for diverse processes including germ granule localisation, fertility, and thermotolerance. Furthermore, we provide evidence that HSF-1 mediates the transcriptional integration of fbxa-215 into the heat-shock response by binding to Helitron TEs directly upstream of the fbxa-215 locus. The interactome of HTH-bearing F-box factors suggests roles in post-translational regulation and proteostasis, consistent with established functions of F-box proteins. Based on AlphaFold2 multimer proteome-wide screens, we propose that the HTH domain may diversify the repertoire of protein substrates that F-box factors regulate post-translationally. We further demonstrate that F-box genes repeatedly and independently captured TE domains throughout eukaryotic evolution, and describe an additional instance in zebrafish. In conclusion, we identify recurrent TE domain captures by F-box genes in eukaryotes and provide insights into how these novel proteins are integrated within host gene regulatory networks.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

Through in vitro triT acetylation and bioactivity assays, we show that acetylation functions as a resistance mechanism. Genomic searches of triculamin BGC genes across bacteria show that triculamin is more widely distributed than previously anticipated, as triculamin-like core peptides are found in at least three phyla in contrast to previously described lasso peptides that are typically restricted to one phylum. Triculamin BGCs with both canonical and non-canonical RiPP biosynthetic genes were identified. Two strains containing canonical triculamin-like BGCs were chemically characterized and shown to produce the novel triculamin-like lasso peptides palmamin and gelatinamin, the latter of which appears to have an unprecedented additional ring formation. Detailed phylogenetic investigation of the macrocyclases from triculamin-like BGCs suggests that these molecules are products of convergent evolution. These findings broaden the evolutionary and functional landscape of lasso peptides, revealing their unexpected diversification and cross-phylum distribution.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

We found that Anxa1+ DANs have a unique functional profile, as they do not signal reward or reinforce actions, and they are not necessary for motivated behavior. Instead, activity of Anxa1+ DAN axons correlates with vigorous movements during self-paced exploration, yet their silencing only disrupts a subset of action sequences that mirror a PD bradykinesia profile.

An example of an important social association is that between breeding partners - a key social connection in monogamously breeding species. The selection of a breeding partner begins well before reproduction for many species, and this process can have consequences for subsequent reproductive success. Thus, the non-breeding season can shape behaviour during the breeding season. However, it is currently unknown how outcomes in the breeding season can impact associate choice during the non-breeding season, as studying this has been limited due to requiring high volumes of individual social data across both contexts. This study used three years of wild great tit social data from Wytham Woods, Oxford, UK, to examine social associations between pairs classified with respect to prior and future relationship status. We found a distinct behavioural pattern in divorced pairs, which was present from early in the winter, suggesting that the act of divorce occurs soon after the completion of the breeding season. Pairs forming for the first time behaved similarly to divorced pairs earlier in the season, but became similar to faithful pairs throughout the winter. On a finer spatiotemporal scale the behaviour of faithful and divorced birds diverged over the winter. These results provide the first evidence of when divorce occurs in paired great tits, while suggesting that different behaviours may drive behavioural divorce at different times.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

In wheat (Triticum aestivum), the lanceolate-shaped inflorescence (spike) is defined by rudimentary spikelets at the base which initiate first but subsequently lag in development compared with central spikelets. While previous studies identified gene expression differences between central and basal inflorescence sections, the spatio-temporal dynamics and gradients along the apical-basal axis remain poorly resolved due to bulk tissue-level techniques. Here, using spatial transcriptomics, we profiled 200 genes across four stages of wheat inflorescence development to cellular resolution. Cell segmentation and unsupervised clustering identified 18 expression domains and their enriched genes, revealing dynamic spatio-temporal organisation along the apical-basal axis of the inflorescence. Along this axis, we uncovered distinct and spatially coordinated gene expression gradients patterning meristems prior to the visible delay in basal spikelet development. This study demonstrates the potential for spatial transcriptomics time-series to advance plant developmental biology.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

More critically, several red-fluorescent GECIs exhibit photoswitching when exposed to blue light, thereby limiting their applicability in all- optical experimental approaches. Here, we present the development of PinkyCaMP, the first mScarlet-based Ca2+ sensor that outperforms current red fluorescent sensors in brightness, photostability, signal-to-noise ratio, and compatibility with optogenetics and neurotransmitter imaging. PinkyCaMP is well-tolerated by neurons, showing no toxicity or aggregation, both in vitro and in vivo. All imaging approaches, including single-photon excitation methods such as fiber photometry, widefield imaging, miniscope imaging, as well as two-photon imaging in awake mice, are fully compatible with PinkyCaMP.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

However, most existing genetic studies have been based on short-read sequencing methods, which capture fewer than half of the SVs present in any one individual. Long-read sequencing (LRS) enhances our ability to detect disease-associated and functionally relevant structural variants (SVs); however, its application in large-scale genomic studies has been limited by challenges in sample preparation and high costs. Here, we leverage a new scalable wet-lab protocol and computational pipeline for whole-genome Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing and apply it to neurologically normal control samples from the North American Brain Expression Consortium (NABEC) (European ancestry) and Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC) (African or African admixed ancestry) cohorts. Through this work, we present a publicly available long-read resource from 351 human brain samples (median N50: 27 Kbp and at an average depth of [~]40x genome coverage). We discover approximately 234,905 SVs and produce locally phased assemblies that cover 95% of all protein-coding genes in GRCh38. Utilizing matched expression datasets for these samples, we apply quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses and identify SVs that impact gene expression in post-mortem frontal cortex brain tissue. Further, we determine haplotype- specific methylation signatures at millions of CpGs and, with this data, identify cis-acting SVs. In summary, these results highlight that large-scale LRS can identify complex regulatory mechanisms in the brain that were inaccessible using previous approaches. We believe this new resource provides a critical step toward understanding the biological effects of genetic variation in the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

Such a research paradigm has recently shown considerable promise in the analysis of single-cell sequencing data, while to date, efforts have centered on transcriptome. In contrast to gene expression, chromatin accessibility provides more decisive insights into cell states, shaping the chromatin regulatory landscapes that control transcription in distinct cell types. Yet, challenges also persist due to the abundance of features, high data sparsity, and the quasi-binary nature of these data. Here, we introduce EpiAgent, the first foundation model for single-cell epigenomic data, pretrained on a large-scale Human-scATAC-Corpus comprising approximately 5 million cells and 35 billion tokens. EpiAgent encodes chromatin accessibility patterns of cells as concise ""cell sentences,"" and employs bidirectional attention to capture cellular heterogeneity behind regulatory networks. With comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate that EpiAgent excels in typical downstream tasks, including unsupervised feature extraction, supervised cell annotation, and data imputation. By incorporating external embeddings, EpiAgent facilitates the prediction of cellular responses to both out-of-sample stimulated and unseen genetic perturbations, as well as reference data integration and query data mapping. By simulating the knockout of key cis-regulatory elements, EpiAgent enables in-silico treatment for cancer analysis. We further extended zero-shot capabilities of EpiAgent, allowing direct cell type annotation on newly sequenced datasets without additional training.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

High sequence variability among viral xrRNAs raises questions about the shared molecular features that characterize this functional RNA class. Here, we present the first structure of a plant-virus xrRNA in its active exoribonuclease-resistant conformation. The xrRNA forms a 9 base pair pseudoknot that creates a knot-like topology similar to that of flavivirus xrRNAs, despite lacking sequence similarity.

Despite its clinical success, the mechanism through which daptomycin exerts its antibacterial properties has remained controversial. Much of the debate is focused around daptomycin's ability to depolarise the cytoplasmic membrane, potential formation of large membrane pores, and its more recently discovered capability to inhibit cell wall synthesis and disturb membrane lipid domain organisation through interactions with cell wall precursor lipids. Here we show that, rather than representing different facets of a single underlying activity, daptomycin exhibits two independent antibacterial mechanisms of action: (i) targeting of cell wall precursor lipids that leads to cell wall synthesis inhibition and (ii) membrane depolarisation that does not rely on interactions with cell wall precursor lipids. This dual mechanism of action provides an explanation for the frequently disagreeing findings obtained through in vivo and in vitro studies and explains why resistance development towards daptomycin is slow and multifactorial. In a broader context, this demonstrates that dual mechanism antibiotics can be clinically successful and exhibit favourable characteristics in terms of real-world, clinically relevant resistance development.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

These latter mechanisms are mediated by defence systems, including DNA-degrading systems such as Restriction- Modification (RM) and CRISPR-Cas, as well as abortive infection systems that induce cell death or dormancy. Computational studies suggest that bacterial genomes encode several defence systems, which may act synergistically to enhance phage resistance. However, the regulation, interactions, and ecological roles of these systems in native hosts remain poorly understood. This study explored the role of eight predicted defence systems in the clinical isolate NILS69 of E. coli by testing its susceptibility to 93 phages. Infectivity and adsorption assays using mutants defective in these systems revealed that only PD-T4-3 and RM systems restricted phages able to adsorb. The RM system acted via a predicted Type IV endonuclease and was also able to limit plasmid conjugation if the plasmid was transferred from a donor strain lacking a methylase, which is the hallmark of Type I, II or III RM systems. Other defence systems showed no detectable activity, likely due to phage specificity, environmental regulation, or cofactor requirements. These findings underscore the need for further studies to investigate the regulation and ecological roles of bacterial defence systems in their native host contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

Nonlinear Hawkes process models can capture a large range of spiking dynamics, but remain difficult to interpret, due to their discontinuous and stochastic nature. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework based on a piecewise deterministic Markov process representation of the nonlinear Hawkes process (NH-PDMP) followed by a diffusion approximation. We analytically derive stability conditions and dynamical properties of the obtained diffusion processes for single-neuron and network models. We established the accuracy of the diffusion approximation framework by comparing it with exact continuous-time simulations of the original neuronal NH-PDMP models. Our framework offers an analytical and geometric account of the neuronal dynamics repertoire captured by nonlinear Hawkes process models, both for the canonical responses of single-neurons and neuronal-network dynamics, such as winner-take-all and traveling wave phenomena. Applied to human and nonhuman primate recordings of neuronal spiking activity during speech processing and motor tasks, respectively, our approach revealed that task features can be retrieved from the dynamical landscape of the fitted models. The combination of NH-PDMP representations and diffusion approximations thus provides a novel dynamical analysis framework to reveal single-neuron and neuronal-population dynamics directly from models fitted to spiking data.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) isolate genes and their regulatory elements within the same topological neighborhood, avoiding crosstalk between regulatory elements. Perturbation of domain boundaries causes aberrant genomic contacts and gene expression misregulation. Architectural proteins such as CTCF and the cohesin complex are critical to form boundaries. However, we still lack a complete understanding of what makes a boundary more effective at insulating genomic contacts than others. To understand how domains are structured, we experimentally classified boundaries according to their chromatin accessibility as a proxy of protein occupancy in K562 human cells. We found that highly accessible boundaries are occupied by more proteins, are more robust contact insulators, have a more conserved CTCF DNA-binding motif and are more conserved across cell types in contrast to less accessible ones. By exploring the proteins enriched at boundaries with different accessibility, we found that CTCF and cohesin, together with REST, form a module, and ZFN316, together with EMSY, form another module, and both modules occupy boundaries very frequently. Finally, by using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genetic edition of ZNF316 DNA-binding motif at a robust domain boundary, we demonstrate that ZNF316 can block chromatin contacts in the absence of CTCF. Our results emphasize the importance of protein combination and abundance to support boundary strength and propose ZNF316 as a novel architectural protein.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803

Our results imply that CD4+ T-cell TCRs experience significantly lower forces than previously estimated, with only a small fraction of ligand-engaged TCRs being subjected to these forces during antigen scanning.

Although these methods are conceptually similar, we show by analyzing association studies of 209 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank that they systematically prioritize different genes. This raises the question of how genes should ideally be prioritized. We propose two prioritization criteria: 1) trait importance -- how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and 2) trait specificity -- a genes importance for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, while burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, while burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation. Our results illustrate that burden tests and GWAS reveal different aspects of trait biology and suggest ways to improve their interpretation and usage.","NA","biorxiv",1735250959803
