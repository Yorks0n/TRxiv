Even though many proteins of the kinetochore are highly conserved, centromeres are among the fastest evolving regions within a genome, showing extensive variation even on short evolutionary timescales. Here, we sought to understand how new types of centromeres emerge and reach fixation by mapping centromere evolution across 138 budding yeast species and over 2,500 natural strain isolates. We show that new centromeres spread progressively via drift and subsequent selection, and that the kinetochore interface, which is evolving slowly in relative terms, determines which new centromere variants are tolerated. Together, our findings provide insight into the evolutionary constraints and trajectories shaping centromere evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

While highly processed food like packaged products, processed meat, and sweetened soft drinks have been increasingly associated with unhealthy diet, information on the degree of processing characterizing an item in a store is not straightforward to obtain, limiting the ability of individuals to make informed choices. Here we introduce GroceryDB, a database with over 50,000 food items sold by Walmart, Target, and Wholefoods, unveiling how big data can be harnessed to empower consumers and policymakers with systematic access to the degree of processing of the foods they select, and the potential alternatives in the surrounding food environment. The extensive data gathered on ingredient lists and nutrition facts enables a large-scale analysis of ingredient patterns and degrees of processing, categorized by store, food category, and price range. Our findings reveal that the degree of food processing varies significantly across different food categories and grocery stores. Furthermore, this data allows us to quantify the individual contribution of over 1,000 ingredients to ultra-processing. GroceryDB and the associated http://TrueFood.Tech/ website make this information accessible, guiding consumers toward less processed food choices while assisting policymakers in reforming the food supply.","NA","medrxiv",1737151677958

Genomic defenses have evolved to counteract TE proliferation through silencing mechanisms operating at the epigenetic or transcript level. In fungi, repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) targets TEs by recognizing repetitive sequences and inducing mutagenesis. However, the prevalence of RIP across the fungal kingdom and the fidelity of the canonical C-to-T mutation signatures remain unclear. In this study, we address these gaps by tracking shifts in genome architecture across the fungal kingdom. We show that the loss of RIP components is associated with an 80% ([~]30 Mb) increase in genome size in ascomycetes (class of Leotiomycetes). To track the impact of genome defenses, we designed a quantitative screen for RIP-like mutation signatures. The phylum of ascomycetes was unique in showing enrichment in mutation signatures in non-coding and repetitive sequences, consistent with a phylogenetically restricted occurrence of RIP-like genome defense systems. Then, we gene functions associated in a phylogenetic context with RIP-like mutation signatures. We identified a zinc-finger protein as the strongest candidate underpinning a novel mechanism of genome defenses. Our findings reveal the multifaceted drivers of genome defense systems and their close ties to genome size evolution in fungi, highlighting how proximate molecular mechanisms can shape genome evolution on deep phylogenetic scales.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

We find that the looped state is generally rare, with a mean probability of 2.3% and a maximum of 26% across the quantified loops. On average, CTCF-CTCF loops are stronger than loops between cis-regulatory elements (3.2% vs. 1.1%).

Overall, we establish an approach for genome-wide absolute loop quantification and report that loops generally occur with low probabilities, generalizing recent live imaging results to the whole genome.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

Whether super-enhancers constitute a separate regulatory paradigm remains unclear, largely due to the difficulty of dissecting the contributions and interactions of individual elements within their natural chromosomal context. To address this challenge, we developed enhancer scrambling, a high-throughput strategy to generate stochastic inversions and deletions of targeted enhancer regions by combining CRISPR prime editing insertion of symmetrical loxP sites with Cre recombinase-induced rearrangements. We applied our approach to dissect a distal super-enhancer of the OTX2 gene, generating up to 134 alternative regulatory configurations in a single experiment, and establishing how they drive gene expression and chromatin accessibility, as well as the individual contributions of its elements to this activity. Surprisingly, the presence of the sequence containing a single DNase I hypersensitive site predominantly controls OTX2 expression. Our findings highlight that enhancer-driven regulation of some highly expressed, cell-type-specific genes can rely on an individual element within a cluster of non-interacting, dispensable components, and suggest a simple functional core to a subset of super-enhancers. The targeted randomisation method to scramble enhancers can scale to resolve many super-enhancers and human gene regulatory landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

Hence, cryo-EM holds the potential of one of the most sensitive analytical methods that deliver a high-resolution protein structure as a readout. In practice, more than a million times more starting biological material is required to prepare cryo-EM grids. To close the gap, we developed a micro isolation (MISO) method that combines microfluidics-based protein purification with cryo-EM grid preparation. We validated the method on soluble bacterial and eukaryotic membrane proteins. We showed that MISO enables protein structure determination starting from below one microgram of a target protein and going from cells to cryo-EM grids within a few hours. This scales down the purification by a factor of a few hundred to a few thousand and opens possibilities for the structural characterization of hitherto inaccessible proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

In this work, we first 'complete' the peripheral sensory map through the identification of a previously uncharacterized antennal sensory neuron population expressing Or46aB, and the definition of an exceptional 'hybrid' olfactory neuron class comprising functional Or and Ir receptors. Second, we survey developmental, anatomical, connectomic, functional and evolutionary studies to generate an integrated dataset of these sensory neuron pathways -- and associated visualizations -- creating an unprecedented comprehensive resource. Third, we illustrate the utility of the dataset to reveal relationships between different organizational properties of this sensory system, and the new questions these stimulate.

Experimental work in simple communities suggests ecological factors can determine when specific defence systems are most beneficial, but applying these findings to complex communities has been challenging. Here, we use a comprehensive and environmentally balanced collection of metagenomes to survey the defence landscape across complex microbial communities. We also assess the association between the viral community and the prevalence of defence systems. We identify strong environmental effects in predicting overall defence abundance, with animal-host-associated environments and hot environments harbouring more defences overall. We also find a positive correlation between the density and diversity of viruses in the community and the abundance of defence systems. This study provides insights into the ecological factors that influence the composition and distribution of bacterial defence systems in complex microbial environments and outlines future directions for the study of defence system ecology.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

Processing bodies (P-bodies) are dynamic ribonucleoprotein condensates formed by phase separation in the cytosol. P-bodies are involved in translational arrest and mRNA decay and regulate several developmental processes and stress responses. Pathogens have evolved strategies to exploit host degradation pathways for their own benefit, however little is known about how they impact translation. Here we show that upon infection with pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato (Pst), P-body assembly is enhanced in an effector-dependent manner. Moreover, a P-body-defective mutant is more tolerant to bacterial infection due to altered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses, suggesting a role of P-bodies as novel susceptibility hubs. Pst infection is accompanied by a general host translation attenuation, which is both effector-dependent, and deregulated in the P-body-defective mutant. This indicates that P-bodies are required for the bacterial modulation of the plant translation, probably to hinder the defense responses. Additionally, host autophagy is also exploited by the bacteria to modulate P-body dynamics and its subsequent translation attenuation, revealing a complex interplay between P-body formation and disassembly during infection. Altogether, our discoveries provide novel insights on how host translation is targeted by bacteria via effector-triggered P-body formation to promote disease and uncover unknown connections between ER stress responses and autophagy with P-body dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1737151677958

However, the role of nsp1 in other host species remains elusive, especially in bats which are natural reservoirs of sarbecoviruses and possess a markedly different innate immune system than humans. Here, we reveal that SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 potently inhibits translation in bat cells from Rhinolophus lepidus, belonging to the same genus as known sarbecovirus reservoirs hosts. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 bound to the Rhinolophus lepidus 40S ribosome and show that it blocks the mRNA entry channel via targeting a highly conserved site among mammals. Accordingly, we found that nsp1 blocked protein translation in mammalian cell lines from several species, underscoring its broadly inhibitory activity and conserved role in numerous SARS-CoV-2 hosts. Our findings illuminate the arms race between coronaviruses and mammalian host immunity (including bats), providing a foundation for understanding the determinants of viral maintenance in bat hosts and spillovers.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

Antibodies often originate in the lymph node (LN), specifically at the extrafollicular border of B cell follicles, where T and B lymphocytes physically interact to drive B cell maturation into antibody-secreting plasmablasts. In vitro models of this process are sorely needed to predict aspects of the human immune response. Microphysiological systems (MPSs) offer the opportunity to approximate the lymphoid environment, but so far have focused primarily on memory recall responses to antigens previously encountered by donor cells. To date, no 3D culture system has replicated the engagement between T cells and B cells (T--B interaction) that leads to antibody production when starting with naive cells. Here, we developed a LN-MPS to model early T--B interactions at the extrafollicular border built from primary, naive human lymphocytes encapsulated within a collagen-based 3D matrix. Within the MPS, naive T cells exhibited CCL21-dependent chemotaxis and chemokinesis as predicted. Naive T and B cells were successfully skewed on chip to an early T follicular helper (pre-Tfh) and activated state, respectively, and co-culture of the latter cells led to CD38+ plasmablast cells and T cell dependent production of IgM. These responses required differentiation of the T cells into pre-Tfhs, physical cell-cell contact, and were sensitive to the ratio at which pre-Tfh and activated B cells were seeded on-chip. Dependence on T cell engagement was greatest at a 1:5 T:B ratio, while cell proliferation and CD38+ signal was greatest at a 1:1 T:B ratio. Furthermore, plasmablast formation was established starting from naive T and B cells on-chip. We envision that this MPS model of primary lymphocyte physiology will enable new mechanistic analyses of human humoral immunity in vitro.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

After two weeks of daily stimulation, networks of three organoids showed significantly higher stimulus decoding capability compared to the simpler one- or two-organoid networks. Long-term stimulation induced pronounced changes in the three-organoid network's response patterns, spontaneous activity, and inter- and intra-organoid functional connectivity.

Cardiovascular and renal consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have been studied intensively in high-risk groups, but the consequences of mild infection for the general population, particularly beyond the acute phase of infection, remain unclear. Objective. To examine long-term associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiovascular and kidney disease (CVD, KD) in the general population, with emphasis on age and vaccination status at the time of infection, mild infection, and SARS-CoV-2 variant. Design. Register-based cohort study. Setting. Denmark Participants. All Danish residents with [&ge;]1 PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, March 2020-December 2022. Exposure. Positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcomes. Hazard ratios for 15 CVD outcomes and six KD outcomes, comparing persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and persons who only ever tested negative for infection. Results. The cohort for CVD analyses included 4,508,489 persons without pre-existing CVD (median follow-up 25.2 months/person, interquartile range [IQR] 21.7-27.5 months); 2,698,261 persons (59.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period. The cohort for the KD analyses included 5,150,480 persons without pre-existing KD (median follow-up 25.1 months, IQR 21.7-27.4 months), 2,983,233 (57.9%) of whom tested positive for infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with slight increases in the risks of pulmonary embolism, venous embolism/thrombosis, arrhythmias, chronic renal failure, unspecified renal failure, and other/unspecified KD up to a year after infection; infection was not associated with the other disease groups tested. The strongest associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and CVD and KD were observed among unvaccinated persons and persons infected with earlier (pre-omicron) variants. Conclusions and Relevance. We found little evidence that infection with SARS-CoV-2 was associated with increased long-term risks of CVD or KD in the general population. Increased CVD risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared limited to three outcomes (pulmonary embolism, venous embolism/thrombosis, arrhythmias) and the potential increases in risk were small. Our KD results also suggested that any persistent risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were minimal; however, these findings need to be confirmed in other populations. Most importantly, in a largely vaccinated population, long-term CVD and KD risks differed little for omicron-infected and uninfected persons.","NA","medrxiv",1737151677958

Male-killing is a convergently evolved trait, with microbes evolving diverse male-killing mechanisms across host species with widely divergent sex determination pathways. A common evolutionary response to MK presence is the spread of suppressor mutations that restore male survival. In this study, we demonstrate evolution of a novel male-killing mechanism that is insensitive to an existing male-killing suppressor. Hypolimnas bolina butterflies from Yogyakarta, Indonesia, showed extreme female biased population sex ratio associated with high prevalence of a male-killing Wolbachia. This strain, wBol1Y, shared a very recent common ancestor with the previously characterized  suppressed male-killing strain in the species, wBol1, but retained its male-killing ability in the presence of the male-killing suppressor. The genome of wBol1Y differed from the suppressed wBol1 in carrying an additional prophage that included strong candidate genes for male-killing. In vitro and in vivo data demonstrated that wBol1Y feminized splicing and expression of lepidopteran sex determination pathway genes, and that the gene Hb-oscar - present on wBol1Ys unique prophage insert - was sufficient to disrupt the male sex determination pathway. Our study demonstrates the diversity of male-killing mechanisms is a product both of interaction with varying insect sex determination systems and evolution of male-killing within a host species. Our data indicate male-killer and host may be involved in escalating arms races, where spread male-killing suppression drives evolution of additional systems that reestablish male killing by the symbiont.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

In this study, we deciphered FaRIFs transcriptional regulatory network by combining ChIP-seq-based identification of its direct targets with an analysis of FaRIF-RNAi transcriptome data. These analyses revealed FaRIFs direct role in multiple aspects of strawberry fruit ripening, including the regulation of ripening-related transcription factors, phytohormone content and signaling, primary and secondary metabolism, and cell wall degradation. Additionally, using the TurboID-based proximity labeling approach, we have identified FaRIF interactors, including proteins involved in mRNA and protein homeostasis, as well as several NAC transcription factors. Among these, FaNAC034 was found to synergistically enhance FaRIFs transcriptional activity.

This integrative analysis, combining transcriptome analysis, in vivo ChIP-seq, and proximity labeling, broadens our knowledge of FaRIF-mediated transcriptional networks and interaction partners, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying strawberry fruit ripening regulation by this transcription factor.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

The lack of data on disease burden poses a significant barrier to adopting effective interventions such as vaccination programs. We developed a novel colorimetric assay for the detection of S. Typhi-specific bacteriophages (phages) in environmental water samples, providing an indirect indicator of S. Typhi contamination and insights into typhoid burden. We collected surface water samples from Brazil, Cote dIvoire, Nepal, and Niger, covering urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. We evaluated the colorimetric assay efficiency against agar overlay plaque assay. Isolated phages were tested against various bacteria to assess their host range. The colorimetric assay demonstrated high sensitivity (100% concordance with double agar overlay) with a detection limit of 28 plaque-forming units per milliliter (PFU/mL), and results were obtained in 5.5 hours. Phage detection rates were highest in densely populated areas with poor sanitation, particularly in Kathmandu, Nepal (96.6% positivity in river samples) and Abidjan, Cote dIvoire (35.1% positivity in drainage samples). The detection of S. Typhi phages in Cote dIvoire is particularly important, as the burden of typhoid in the region was previously undocumented. Phages were not detected in rural and drinking water sources. Host range analyses demonstrated that the isolated phages were specific to S. Typhi, with a small minority of phages (4/30) isolated also capable of infecting S. Paratyphi A. The novel colorimetric assay offers a rapid and sensitive method for detecting S. Typhi bacteriophages in environmental water. The scalability, low cost ([~]$2.40 USD per sample), and minimal equipment requirements, suggest that this could be effective tool for typhoid surveillance in resource-limited settings.

IMPORTANCETyphoid fever, caused by Salmonella Typhi, remains a significant global health threat, particularly in low-resource settings with inadequate sanitation. Effective control measures, such as vaccines, require precise data on where typhoid is most prevalent, yet current surveillance methods are expensive and limited in scope. This study introduces a rapid, low-cost, and scalable colorimetric assay for detecting S. Typhi bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) in environmental water samples. Unlike traditional methods, this test detects the presence of S. Typhi indirectly by identifying associated phages, offering a specific and sensitive approach for monitoring typhoid fever circulation. The assay was validated in diverse settings across four countries and demonstrated high accuracy and cost efficiency. By reducing reliance on expensive laboratory equipment and complex procedures, this tool makes typhoid surveillance more accessible, especially in low-income regions, helping prioritize vaccination campaigns and improve public health interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1737151677958

While tissue patterning has been viewed as the transition from initially identical un-patterned cells to an arrangement of different cell types, recent evidence suggests that initial heterogeneities between cells modulate tissue-scale pattern formation. Yet, how such heterogeneities arise and, thereafter, regulate cell type emergence in a population of cells is poorly understood. Using in vivo and in vitro mouse regenerative systems, we identify a critical tissue density that is required to induce heterogeneous inactivation of the mechanosensor YAP1. Experimental and biophysical approaches demonstrate that YAP1 cell-to-cell heterogeneity pre-patterns the first cell fate decision, via both chromatin remodelling and a supracellular feedback between FOXA1 and Delta-Notch signalling. This feedback motif induces cell fate bistability endowing memory to the system and the maintenance of patterns during homeostasis. These findings reveal a generalisable framework in which transient cell-to-cell heterogeneity, regulated by tissue-scale properties, serves as a critical control parameter for the emergence of cell fate and stable patterning during regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

However, their presence remains poorly recognized, and their lifestyle and functionality remain largely unknown. Our analysis demonstrates that, in contrast to AMF, FRE colonize plants during the winter season, when photosynthesis is more challenging. It is also noteworthy that FRE was unable to colonize the roots of spring-sown crops. The results of our laboratory pot experiments demonstrated that low temperatures are not sufficient for FRE colonization. Furthermore, we observed that FRE, in contrast to AMF, exhibited increased colonization in soils containing metabolically inactive plants. Our results suggest that FRE does not contribute to the increase of ecosystem biomass through direct photosynthesis in summer, but may play an overlooked role in the formation of mycorrhiza-based soil ecosystems in winter. However, this winter ecosystem can be disrupted by conventional bare fallow management of the field, interrupting the annual cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

Here, we reveal that intrinsic excitability deficits and seizure phenotypes in heterozygous Syngap1 knockout (KO) mice are differentially dependent on Syngap1 GAP activity. Cortical excitatory neurons in heterozy-gous KO mice displayed reduced intrinsic excitability, including lower input resistance, and in-creased rheobase, a phenotype recapitulated in GAP-deficient Syngap1 mutants. However, seizure severity and susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures were significantly elevated in heterozygous KO mice but unaffected in GAP-deficient mutants, implicating the structural rather than enzymatic role of Syngap1 in seizure regulation.

The OT-I mouse TCR is widely used to study anti-gen discrimination utilising many pMHCs, including foreign and self antigens. Previous studies sug-gested that OT-I T cells achieve near-perfect discrimination between higher and lower affinity antigens. Moreover, these 3D affinities measured in solution did not correlate with the 2D membrane affinities, suggesting a complex relationship between 3D and 2D affinities. In contrast, other TCRs have shown imperfect antigen discrimination and strong correlations between 3D and 2D affinities. To resolve these discrepancies, we extended a protocol for measuring ultra-low TCR/pMHC affinities to accurately de-termine the 3D affinities of the OT-I TCR binding 19 pMHC complexes. These revised 3D affinities now strongly correlate with the 2D affinities, and accurately predict functional responses. Importantly, we now find that the OT-I TCR exhibits enhanced yet imperfect antigen discrimination, similar to other TCRs, allowing it to detect abnormally high levels of low-affinity self-antigens. Finally, we show that discrimination is highest with low-affinity pMHC ligands, a finding predicted by the kinetic-proofreading model of antigen discrimination. This work underscores the ability of T cells to effectively gauge prox-ies for 3D affinity within the 2D cell-cell interface, with significant implications for the mechanisms underlying antigen discrimination.

Lay abstractT cells protect the body from infection by distinguishing between foreign and self molecules. They do this using a specialized receptor called the T cell receptor (TCR), which senses differences in how strongly it binds to foreign versus self molecules. Scientists have used a mouse TCR called OT-I to understand this process, concluding that OT-I T cells exhibit near perfect discrimination between foreign and self antigens based on a sharp affinity threshold. However, conflicting results from experiments on other TCRs hinted at a more complicated picture. In this study, we used an improved method to accurately measure OT-I TCR binding affinity to 19 peptides, including foreign and self antigens. In contrast to previous results and like other TCRs, we found that OT-I T cells display enhanced but im-perfect discrimination, enabling them to be activated by high levels of self antigen. The new data also revealed that the ability of T cells to discriminate antigens is particularly high at low affinities. These findings reconcile apparent discrepancies between the OT-I TCR and other TCRs, and have implications for understanding diseases where T cells often respond to self antigen, such as autoimmunity and cancer.

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty.

ObservationsWe aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted (1 death averted per 5,400 vaccine doses administered). Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (1 life-year saved per 900 vaccine doses administered). Sensitivity range was 7.4-23.6 million life-years. Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit.

Conclusions and relevanceBased on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still clearly demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1737151677958

Understanding these states is essential for modulating protein function. Although X-ray crystallography has enabled revolutionary advances in protein structure prediction by machine learning, this connection was made at the level of atomic models, not the underlying data. This lack of connection to crystallographic data limits the potential for further advances in both the accuracy of protein structure prediction and the application of machine learning to experimental structure determination. Here, we present SFCalculator, a differentiable pipeline that generates crystallographic observables from atomistic molecular structures with bulk solvent correction, bridging crystallographic data and neural network-based molecular modeling. We validate SFCalculator against conventional methods and demonstrate its utility by establishing three important proof-of-concept applications. First, SFCalculator enables accurate placement of molecular models relative to crystal lattices (known as phasing). Second, SFCalculator enables the search of the latent space of generative models for conformations that fit crystallographic data and are, therefore, also implicitly constrained by the information encoded by the model. Finally, SFCalculator enables the use of crystallographic data during training of generative models, enabling these models to generate an ensemble of conformations consistent with crystallographic data. SFCalculator, therefore, enables a new generation of analytical paradigms integrating crystallographic data and machine learning.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

Upregulated intestinal proteolysis and PAR2-signaling are implicated in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). To identify potential bacterial regulators of PAR2 activity, we developed a functional assay for PAR2 processing and used it to screen conditioned media from a library of diverse gut commensal microbes. We found that multiple bacteria secrete proteases that cleave host PAR2. Using chemoproteomic profiling with a covalent irreversible inhibitor, we identified a previously uncharacterized Bacteroides fragilis serine protease Bfp1, and showed that it cleaves and activates PAR2 in multicellular and murine models. PAR2 cleavage by Bfp1 disrupts the intestinal barrier, sensitizes nociceptors, and triggers colonic inflammation and abdominal pain. Collectively, our findings uncover Bfp1-mediated PAR2-processing as a new axis of host-commensal-interaction in the gut that has the potential to be targeted for therapeutic intervention in IBD or IBS.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

Here we develop the PARTI workflow and apply it to understand three recent observations related to the cellular incorporation of non-alpha-amino acid monomers into protein: (1) the origins of the apparent selectivity of translation with respect to beta2-hydroxy acid enantiomers; (2) the activity of PylRS variants for benzyl derivatives of malonic acid; and (3) the apparent inability of N-Me amino acids to function as ribosome substrates in living cells. Using the PARTI assay, we also provide direct evidence for the cellular production of 2',3'-diacylated tRNA in certain cases. The ease and simplicity of the PARTI workflow should benefit ongoing efforts to study and improve the cellular incorporation of non-alpha-amino acid monomers into proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

We studied this paradox in the Drosophila olfactory system by establishing a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of all developing antennal sensory lineages, including latent neural populations that normally undergo programmed cell death (PCD). This atlas reveals that transcriptional control is robust, but imperfect, in defining selective sensory receptor expression. A second layer of precision is afforded by the intersection of expression of functionally-interacting receptor subunits. A third layer is defined by stereotyped PCD patterning, which masks promiscuous receptor expression in neurons fated to die and removes 'empty' neurons lacking receptors. Like receptor choice, PCD is under lineage-specific transcriptional control; promiscuity in this regulation leads to previously-unappreciated heterogeneity in neuronal numbers. Thus functional precision in the mature olfactory system belies developmental noise that might facilitate the evolution of sensory pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

We developed a Millifluidic Continuous Culture Device (MCCD) to culture bacteria under precisely controlled nutrient conditions, including very low concentrations, in a manner suitable for proteomic analysis. Using the MCCD, we cultured Escherichia coli with a mixture of amino acids as the sole carbon source at three concentrations supporting growth rates spanning a fivefold range. Surprisingly, at the lowest concentration, cells exhibited proteomic signatures of iron shortage despite constant iron levels across conditions. Uptake of labeled iron-histidine and iron-cysteine complexes demonstrated that amino-acid-bound iron is bioavailable to E. coli. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of bacterial iron acquisition that emerged under the flow imposed by the MCCD, which diluted the siderophore pool and reduced their efficacy. This work highlights the importance of studying bacterial physiology under low nutrient concentrations and demonstrates how physical conditions, such as flow, shape microbial nutrient acquisition strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

In mice, reducing dietary levels of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) recapitulates many of the benefits of a low protein diet; BCAA-restricted diets extend lifespan, reduce frailty, and improve metabolic health, while BCAA supplementation shortens lifespan, promotes obesity, and impairs glycemic control. Recently, high protein diets have been shown to promote cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging implicated in many age-related diseases, in the liver of mice. Here, we test the hypothesis that the effects of high protein diets on metabolic health and on cell senescence are mediated by BCAAs. We find that reducing dietary levels of BCAAs protects male and female mice from the negative metabolic consequences of both normal and high protein diets. Further, we identify tissue-specific effects of BCAAs on cellular senescence, with restriction of all three BCAAs - but not individual BCAAs - protecting from hepatic cellular senescence while potentiating cell senescence in white adipose tissue. We find that the effects of BCAAs on hepatic cellular senescence are cell-autonomous, with lower levels of BCAAs protecting cultured cells from antimycin-A induced senescence. Our results demonstrate a direct effect of a specific dietary component on a hallmark of aging and suggest that cellular senescence may be highly susceptible to dietary interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

Results suggest that long-term outcomes depend mainly on the variance in epistasis, which determines the ruggedness of the fitness landscape, but without affecting the heterosis.

The T. cruzi life cycle includes transitions between epimastigote, metacyclic trypomastigote, amastigote, and blood trypomastigote stages, each marked by distinct morphological and molecular adaptations to different hosts and environments. Unlike other trypanosomatids, T. cruzi does not employ antigenic variation but instead relies on a diverse array of cell-surface-associated proteins encoded by large multi-copy gene families (multigene families), essential for infectivity and immune evasion. This study analyzes cell-specific transcriptomes using single-cell RNA sequencing of amastigote and trypomastigote cells to characterize stage-specific surface protein expression during mammalian infection. Through clustering and identification of cell-specific markers, we assigned cells to distinct parasite developmental forms. Analysis of individual cells revealed that surface protein-coding genes, especially members of the trans-sialidase TcS superfamily (TcS), are expressed with greater heterogeneity than single-copy genes. Additionally, no recurrent combinations of TcS genes were observed between individual cells in the population. Our findings thus reveal transcriptomic heterogeneity within trypomastigote populations where each cell displays unique TcS expression profiles.

The marginal epistasis framework is a powerful approach because it estimates the likelihood of a SNP being involved in any interaction, thereby reducing the multiple testing burden. Current implementations of this approach have failed to scale to large human studies. To address this, we present the sparse marginal epistasis (SME) test, which concentrates the scans for epistasis to regions of the genome that have known functional enrichment for a trait of interest. By leveraging the sparse nature of this modeling setup, we develop a novel statistical algorithm that allows SME to run 10 to 90 times faster than state-of-the-art epistatic mapping methods. In a study of blood traits measured in 349,411 individuals from the UK Biobank, we show that reducing searches of epistasis to variants in accessible chromatin regions facilitates the identification of genetic interactions associated with regulatory genomic elements.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

We used SC-specific reconstitution of the essential clock gene Bmal1 to elucidate the role of the local SC clock and its interplay with the central clock in the mouse brain and found that daily transcriptional control of metabolic processes in SCs depend on central clock input, independent of the SC clock. Central clock-driven genes were involved in lipid metabolism, functionally important for SC-mediated muscle repair, and autophagy was required for their oscillation.

Although the organellar genomes are considerably smaller compared to the nuclear genome, they are nonetheless essential for survival of the organism. A common feature of many chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes is the presence of large repeated sequences longer than 1 kb. These can be either in inverted or direct orientation, and recombination between them leads to structural heteroplasmy. To understand the intraspecific evolution of organellar genomes, we assembled chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of 143 A. thaliana accessions from PacBio HiFi sequencing data. We find large repeats to be associated with heteroplasmy and structural variation. Our extensive genome annotation identifies novel open reading frames (ORFs) in those accessions that lost large repeats, potentially introduced via horizontal gene transfer, illuminating additional paths for diversification of plant organelles. The loss of large repeats correlates with geography and phenotypes, pointing to their adaptive importance.

Memory B cells (MBCs), pivotal to adaptive immunity, generate high-affinity antibodies upon antigen re-encounter. While single-cell high-throughput sequencing has revolutionized antibody repertoire studies, it has critical limitations: the inability to simultaneously determine antigen-binding specificities and immunoglobulin gene sequences, and high resource demands that limit accessibility in low-resource settings. Here, we present a cost-effective single-cell culture (SCC) platform enabling comprehensive analysis of human MBC repertoires, including epitope-specific responses, cross-reactivity studies, and mAb isolation. Using SARS-CoV-2 convalescent and vaccinated donor samples, we optimized MBC SCCs with NB21 feeder cells, R848, and IL-2 stimulation, achieving high cloning efficiency and a 30-fold enrichment of antigen-specific MBCs compared to bulk cultures. Among 592 isolated mAbs, 52.7% exhibited specificity to the Wuhan strain Spike protein, with 27.9% targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD), 15.4% the N-terminal domain (NTD), and 56.7% other regions, likely the S2 domain. Comparative analysis revealed distinct cross-reactivity patterns: 40.5% of all anti-Spike mAbs recognized all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants (Wuhan, Beta, Delta, Gamma and Omicron BA.2), while 29.6% showed recognition of only four variants, the majority not including Omicron BA.2; 56 single strain reactive mAbs (14.9%) were also identified. Notably, all screening and neutralization assays were performed directly with culture supernatants, eliminating the need for large-scale sequencing and transfection. Desired clones were selected for recombinant mAb production. The SCC platform also enabled unbiased immunoglobulin repertoire profiling, revealing convergent V-region rearrangements, including public V3-30 and V3-53/V3-66 antibodies consistent with prior SARS-CoV-2 studies. Two public RBD-targeting clones with broad neutralization potential were validated in pseudovirus neutralization assays. This streamlined platform delivers simultaneous antigen-specific mAb isolation, V-region sequencing, and functional studies within seven days, empowering researchers in low-resource settings to address global health inequities and enhance preparedness for future pandemics.","NA","medrxiv",1737151677958

Microbial community composition has been shown to impact disease progression in these models. Despite this, the maturation of the early-life murine microbiome has not been well-characterized. We address this gap by characterizing the assembly of the bacterial microbiota of C57BL/6 and BALB/c litters from birth to adulthood across multiple independent litters.

ResultsThe fecal microbiome of young pups is simple, dominated by only a few pioneering bacterial taxa. These taxa are present at low levels in the microbiota of multiple maternal body sites, precluding a clear identification of maternal source. The pup microbiota begins diversifying after fourteen days, coinciding with the beginning of coprophagy and the consumption of solid foods. Pup stool bacterial community composition and diversity are not significantly different from dams from day 21 onwards. Short-read shotgun sequencing-based metagenomic profiling of young pups enabled the assembly of metagenome-assembled genomes for strain-level analysis of these pioneer Ligilactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Proteus species.

ConclusionsAssembly of the murine microbiome occurs over the first weeks of postnatal life and is largely complete by day 21. This detailed view of bacterial community development across multiple commonly employed mouse strains informs experimental design, allowing researchers to better target interventions before, during, or after the maturation of the bacterial microbiota. The source of pioneer bacterial strains appears heterogeneous, as the most abundant taxa identified in young pup stool were found at low levels across multiple maternal body sites, suggesting diverse routes for seeding of the murine microbiome.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

Existing methods for elucidating the ancestry-specific structures generally rely on frequency-based estimates of genetic relationship matrix (GRM) among admixed individuals after masking segments from ancestry components not being targeted for investigation. However, these approaches disregard linkage information between markers, potentially limiting their resolution in revealing structure within an ancestry component. We introduce ancestry-specific expected GRM (as-eGRM), a novel framework for elucidating the relatedness within ancestry components between admixed individuals. The key design of as-eGRM consists of defining ancestry-specific pairwise relatedness between individuals based on genealogical trees encoded in the Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG) and local ancestry calls and computing the expectation of the ancestry-specific relatedness across the genome. Comprehensive evaluations using both simulated stepping-stone models of population structure and empirical datasets based on three-way admixed Latino cohorts showed that analysis based on as-eGRM robustly outperforms existing methods in revealing the structure in admixed populations with diverse demographic histories. Taken together, as-eGRM has the promise to better reveal the fine-scale structure within an ancestry component of admixed individuals, which can help improve the robustness and interpretation of findings from association studies of disease or complex traits for these understudied populations.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

Their genomes evolve from genetically diverse germlines in complex and dynamic environments, including exposure to potential carcinogens. This heterogeneity of humans, our environmental exposures, and subsequent tumours makes it challenging to understand the extent to which cancer evolution is predictable. Addressing this limitation, we re-ran early tumour evolution hundreds of times in diverse, inbred mouse strains, capturing genetic variation comparable to and beyond that found in human populations. The sex, environment, and carcinogenic exposures were all controlled and tumours comprehensively profiled with whole genome and transcriptome sequencing. Within a strain, there was a high degree of consistency in the mutational landscape, a limited range of driver mutations, and all strains converged on the acquisition of a MAPK activating mutation with similar transcriptional disruption of that pathway. Despite these similarities in the phenotypic state of tumours, different strains took markedly divergent paths to reach that state. This included pronounced biases in the precise driver mutations, the strain specific occurrence of whole genome duplication, and differences in subclonal selection that reflected both cancer susceptibility and tumour growth rate. These results show that interactions between the germline genome and the environment are highly deterministic for the trajectory of tumour genome evolution, and even modest genetic divergence can substantially alter selection pressures during cancer development, influencing both cancer risk and the biology of the tumour that develops.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

However, the mechanisms underlying ENS plasticity and resilience remain poorly understood. Organoid technology has revolutionized in vitro modeling by accurately replicating epithelial structures and enabling significant advancements in understanding gastrointestinal biology. However, traditional organoids are limited in their ability to study the ENS, as they lack the multicellular composition and functional architecture necessary to model complex interactions between neurons, glia, mesenchymal, smooth muscle, and epithelial cells. To address these limitations, we developed murine ENS-Rich Assembloids (ERAs) that self-organize to replicate the cellular diversity, including the epithelial structure, and functional architecture of native colonic tissue. These assembloids recreate neuron-glia interactions, reflect regenerative processes, and provide a novel platform for studying ENS dynamics under controlled conditions. Integrating findings from assembloids and an in vivo murine model, we demonstrate that inflammation induces coordinated reorganization of S100b+ glial cells, TUJ1+ neurons, PDGFRA+ mesenchymal cells, and epithelial cells, revealing conserved mechanisms of ENS plasticity. We identify pleiotrophin (PTN) signaling via Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type Z1 (PTPRZ1) as a key pathway facilitating neural elongation and enhancing neuron-glia interactions. Moreover, we show that activated neurons transfer lipids to glial cells, revealing a novel support mechanism during inflammation. These findings position enteric glia as protective hubs for neurons, fostering ENS adaptability and tissue regeneration. By building on the foundational success of organoid technology and addressing its limitations for studying the ENS, ENS-rich assembloids establish a transformative tool for investigating ENS responses in health, disease, and tissue repair.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

We introduce SHAPES (Structural and Hierarchical Assessment of Proteins with Embedding Similarity) to evaluate five state-of-the-art generative models of protein structures. Using structural embeddings across multiple structural hierarchies, ranging from local geometries to global protein architectures, we reveal substantial undersampling of the observed protein structure space by these models. We use Frechet Protein Distance (FPD) to quantify distributional coverage. Different models are distinct in their coverage behavior across different sampling noise scales and temperatures; the frequency of TERtiary Motifs (TERMs) further supports the observations. More robust sequence design and structure prediction methods are likely crucial in guiding the development of models with improved coverage of the designable protein space.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

While a large variety of anti- phage defense mechanisms has been characterized, how expression of these systems is distributed across individual cells and how their combined activities translate into protection from phages has not been studied. Using bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing, we profiled the transcriptomes of [~]50,000 cells from cultures of a human pathobiont, Bacteroides fragilis, infected with a lytic bacteriophage. We quantified the asynchronous progression of phage infection in single bacterial cells and reconstructed the infection timeline, characterizing both host and phage transcriptomic changes as infection unfolded. We discovered a subpopulation of bacteria that remained uninfected and determined the heterogeneously expressed host factors associated with protection. Each cells vulnerability to phage infection was defined by combinatorial phase-variable expression of multiple genetic loci, including capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis pathways, restriction-modification systems (RM), and a previously uncharacterized operon likely encoding fimbrial genes. By acting together, these heterogeneously expressed phase-variable systems and anti-phage defense mechanisms create a phenotypic landscape where distinct protective combinations enable the survival and re-growth of bacteria expressing these phenotypes without acquiring additional mutations. The emerging model of complementary action of multiple protective mechanisms heterogeneously expressed across an isogenic bacterial population showcases the potent role of phase variation and stochasticity in bacterial anti-phage defenses.

One Sentence SummaryCombinatorial phenotypic states with differential vulnerability to phage infection across a Bacteroides fragilis population enable a small number of super-resistant bacterial cells to evade the phage without the need for acquiring mutations.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

However, the ubiquity of this trend over geological timescales remains unclear. One reason for this uncertainty is that palaeobiologists need Global Plate Models (GPMs) to estimate the latitudinal position of organisms remains at time of deposition. However, as GPMs constitute hypotheses for how tectonic plates have moved over Earths history, reconstructions of the latitudinal biodiversity gradient (LBG) might also vary based on the GPM used. Here, using the fossil record of five major marine invertebrate groups, we evaluate the impact of GPM choice on reconstructions of the LBG over the Phanerozoic. Our results show that GPM choice can lead to different conclusions about the shape and strength of LBGs in deep time, even at a coarse spatial scale. These findings suggest additional caution is needed when reconstructing deep-time biogeographic patterns and macroevolutionary events, such as the origin of the present-day LBG. We therefore advocate for future palaeobiogeographic studies to conduct sensitivity analyses investigating the impact of GPM choice on their conclusions, and for greater interdisciplinary collaboration between palaeobiologists and palaeogeographic modellers to avoid common issues in the use of GPMs.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

In plants, different types of ROS perform useful biological functions in the extracellular space (apoplast) supporting processes such as polymerisation and cell wall remodelling. In addition, increased formation of extracellular superoxide and hydrogen peroxide occurs during immune responses. Our current knowledge of apoplastic ROS dynamics is based on luminescence assays, ROS staining methods and indirect evidence via changes to intracellular redox balance. However, dynamic monitoring of extracellular redox processes in vivo remains difficult.

Using two evolutionary distant land plant model species, the moss Physcomitrium patens and the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we test whether the genetically encoded redox biosensor roGFP-Orp1 can be used to assess extracellular redox dynamics. We found that secreted roGFP-Orp1 can inform about local diffusion barriers, as well as protein cysteinyl oxidation rate in the apoplast after pre-reduction. Observed re-oxidation rates were surprisingly slow within the range of hours. Comparing A. thaliana to P. patens, we found faster sensor re-oxidation that increased after triggering an immune response. Our data indicate differences in extracellular oxidative processes between species and within a species, depending on immune signalling.","NA","biorxiv",1737151677958

We found that TCR signals suppressed characteristic features of IL-15-induced CD8+ T-cell activation, including increased NKG2D expression and upregulation of genes related to NK cytotoxicity and IFN response. Moreover, ionomycin suppressed IL-15-induced bystander activation and NK-like cytotoxicity, indicating that Ca2+-calcineurin signaling is responsible for TCR-mediated suppression of IL-15-induced bystander activation. In detail, NFATc1 suppressed IL-15- induced bystander activation via binding to AP-1 that is necessary for the IL-15-induced upregulation of NK cytotoxicity-related genes. Consistent with these results, calcineurin inhibitors enhanced IL-15-induced NKG2D expression in the presence of TCR signals. Additionally, we defined genes upregulated by IL-15 and downregulated by concurrent TCR signals as an IL-15-induced bystander activation gene set, and found that this gene signature was upregulated in bystander CD8+ T cells from patients with hepatitis A virus infection. This study paves the way for further investigation of bystander CD8+ T-cell activation in various pathological conditions, and its regulation.

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1737151677958
"Covid-19 vaccination decisions and impacts of vaccine mandates: A cross sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia, Canada.","10.1101/2024.12.09.24318733","medrxiv",98.14999999999992,0,0,0,94.89999999999993,"Chaufan, C.; Hemsing, N.; Moncrieffe, R.","Claudia Chaufan","York University","2024-12-10","1","PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","cc_by_nc_nd","health policy","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2024/12/10/2024.12.09.24318733.source.xml","BackgroundSince vaccination mandates in the healthcare sector were introduced across Canada, public health authorities in the province of British Columbia implemented among the strongest ones in the country. While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1737151677958
