This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1744582124635

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1744582124635

Real-word data on relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) between mRNA- and protein-based vaccines are limited, and more data are needed on disease outcomes in this age group. Methods: The K-COV-N database, COVID-19 vaccine registry, and health insurance claims were retrospectively reviewed to identify adolescents (12-18-year-olds) in South Korea who received a homologous primary series of NVX-CoV2373 or BNT162b2 and a heterologous or homologous third vaccine dose. Vaccine recipients were propensity score matched to reduce confounding baseline factors. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for any medically attended COVID-19 post vaccination (starting 14 days post primary series and 7 days post third dose) were calculated to assess rVE every 30 days through a 180-day risk window. Results: From February to December 2022, 3174 and 6253 doses of NVX-CoV2373 and BNT162b2, respectively, were administered to South Korean adolescents. Individuals who received NVX-CoV2373 tended to be older, have a disability, and/or have a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Propensity score matching resulted in 107 individuals in each primary series group and 701 and 1417 individuals in the NVX-CoV2373 and BNT162b2 third-dose groups, respectively. The aHR (95% CI) for NVX-CoV2373 compared with BNT162b2 for medically attended COVID-19 in the 180-day risk window was 0.57 (0.31-1.05) for the primary series and 0.68 (0.54-0.84) for the third dose. Discussion: These results suggest that NVX-CoV2373 may provide more robust protection against medically attended COVID-19, compared to BNT162b2, both as a homologous primary series and as a homologous or heterologous third dose.","NA","medrxiv",1744582124635

While some lateralized functions are evident in other species, the human brain displays a strong, species-wide bias. Despite the evolutionary and functional significance of these asymmetries, their molecular and cellular foundations remain poorly understood. Here, we identify key neurochemical and cellular asymmetries that underpin cortical lateralization. Specifically, we demonstrate lateralized gradients in neurotransmitter receptor densities, particularly along the acetylcholine-norepinephrine axis, as well as asymmetries in mitochondrial distribution and the spatial prevalence of microglia and glutamatergic excitatory neurons. Using a multimodal approach that integrates in vivo functional MRI, PET imaging, and post-mortem transcriptomic and cellular data, we delineate two distinct cortical clusters: a left-lateralized network centered on language processing and a right-lateralized network supporting visuospatial attention. These results highlight a biologically embedded substrate for lateralized cognition that may inform both evolutionary theory and our mechanistic understanding of neuropsychiatric illnesses characterized by disrupted lateralization.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

We performed a GWAS meta-analysis for 249 circulating metabolic traits in the Estonian Biobank and the UK Biobank in up to 619,372 individuals, identifying 88,604 significant locus-metabolite associations and 8,774 independent lead variants, including 987 lead variants with a minor allele frequency less than 1%.

We used Mendelian randomisation (MR) to explore putative causal links between metabolic traits, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Surprisingly, up to 85% of the tested metabolite-disease pairs had statistically significant genome-wide MR estimates, likely reflecting complex indirect effects driven by horisontal pleiotropy. To avoid these pleiotropic effects, we used cis-MR to test the phenotypic impact of inhibiting specific drug targets. We found that although plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have been associated with T2D in both observational and genome-wide MR studies, inhibiting the BCAA catabolism pathway to lower BCAA levels is unlikely to reduce T2D risk.

We previously showed that the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus evolves resistance to the dual-targeting fluoroquinolone delafloxacin (DLX) that inhibits both the DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV via gene amplifications of an efflux pump encoding gene sdrM. However, the pathways that control the formation or selection of gene amplifications, and consequently adaptive trajectories, remain understudied, especially in gram-positive bacteria like S. aureus. Here, we show that specific DNA repair and chromosomal separation pathways alter the frequency of formation and selection of gene amplifications in S. aureus. Through a screen of 36 mutants deficient in various DNA processes, we found that while sdrM amplification was still the almost universal path to DLX resistance, other mutations that increased sdrM expression reduced the selection frequency of sdrM amplifications, demonstrating the critical role of sdrM in DLX resistance. We found that similar to other bacteria, the formation and loss of sdrM amplifications required a functional RecA recombinase, but multiple other mutants in pathways required for amplifications in other species still exhibited frequent sdrM amplifications, suggesting that S. aureus may have alternate routes of amplification formation. Finally, mutants in the tyrosine recombinase XerC that is involved in chromosomal separation were deficient for sdrM amplifications, indicating that XerC is a novel modulator of amplification formation, maintenance, or selection. Thus, our work sheds light on genetic factors that alter gene amplification-mediated evolutionary trajectories to antibiotic resistance in S. aureus and can potentially unlock mechanisms by which such evolution of resistance can be inhibited.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

Despite their importance, our understanding of the cell biology of sporozoite formation and salivary gland invasion is limited. Here, we apply a technique called Mosquito Tissue Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (MoTissU-ExM), which physically expands infected mosquito tissues while preserving both host and parasite ultrastructure. Using MoTissU-ExM we are able to observe a range of parasite structures and organelles including features previously seen only by electron microscopy as well as structures not observed before. We leverage MoTissU-ExM to investigate a number of cell biology events during sporozoite formation and salivary gland invasion. In particular we focus on the rhoptries, a secretory organelle important for host cell invasion. We establish a timeline for sporozoite rhoptry biogenesis, show that two rhoptries are used up during salivary gland invasion, and provide the first evidence that rhoptry pairs are specialized for different invasion events. Building on this new knowledge, we characterize the rhoptry protein RON11 and identify it as the first protein involved in sporozoite rhoptry biogenesis. Disruption of RON11 led to the production of sporozoites that specifically fail to invade the salivary gland epithelial cell, thereby blocking transmission of these parasites.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

Many recent studies have quantified their adverse events with a focus on gastrointestinal adverse events.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone.

Translation is often modulated at the initiation stage by RNA binding proteins through either promotion or repression of ribosome recruitment to the mRNA. However, it largely remains unknown how the kinetics of mRNA ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) assembly on untranslated regions (UTRs) relates to its translation regulation activity. Using Sex-lethal (Sxl)-mediated translation repression of msl-2 in female fly dosage compensation as a model system, we show that different mechanisms in mRNP assembly synergistically achieve tight translation repression. Using multi-color single-molecule fluorescence microscopy we show that 1) Sxl targets its binding sites via sliding and double-binding, 2) that Unr recruitment is accelerated over 500-fold by RNA-bound Sxl and 3) that Hrp48 further stabilizes RNA-bound Sxl indirectly via ATP-independent RNA remodeling. Overall, we provide a framework to study how multiple RBPs dynamically cooperate with RNA to achieve function.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

A hallmark of the co-translational folding (coTF) of many proteins are highly stable folding intermediates that are absent or only transiently populated off the ribosome, yet persist during translation well-beyond complete emergence of the domain from the ribosome exit tunnel. Intermediates are important for folding fidelity; however, their structures have remained elusive. Here, we have structurally characterised two coTF intermediates of an immunoglobulin-like domain by developing comprehensive 19F NMR analyses using chemical shifts, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), and protein engineering. We integrated these experimental data with extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to obtain atomistic structures of the folding intermediates on the ribosome. The resulting structures are distinguished by native-like folds initiated from either their N- or C-termini, and reveal multiple parallel folding pathways, which are structurally conserved within the protein domain family, in contrast to their in vitro refolding mechanisms. By redirecting proteins to fold along hierarchical, parallel routes, the ribosome may promote efficient folding by avoiding kinetic traps, and regulate nascent chain assembly and targeting by auxiliary factors to maintain cellular proteostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

Depending on cell state, cell type, and cell fate, a cells mitochondrial phenotype might range from relatively isolated mitochondrial segments to complex branching networks, and from stationary mitochondria to highly motile structures. While isolated mitochondrial phenotypes have been described for a subset of cell states, types, and fates, an integrated map of how mitochondrial phenotypes change over the full course of tissue development has so far been lacking. Here, we identify the mitochondrial phenotypes that appear throughout the course of lung and intestinal epithelial development from stem cells to differentiated tissue. Using human stem cell-derived intestinal and branching lung organoids that mimic developing human organs as model systems, we extract and analyze key mitochondrial biophysical phenotypes in human development. To achieve this, we employ lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM), which enables high-resolution, 4D (x, y, z, time) imaging of mitochondria in organoid tissues with minimal damage to the sample. We image at key developmental time points from stem cell differentiation into mature organoid tissue. For data processing, we utilize the MitoGraph and MitoTNT software packages along with our developed custom computational tools. These tools allow for automated 4D organoid to single cell image processing and quantitative 4D single cell mitochondrial temporal network tracking. This work represents the first 4D high spatiotemporal-resolution quantification of live human organoid tissues at the single-cell level through development. We identified distinct mitochondrial phenotypes unique to each organoid type and found correlations between mitochondrial phenotypes, cellular age, and cell type. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mitochondrial network characteristics can predict both organoid type and cell age. Our findings reveal fundamental aspects of mitochondrial biology that were previously unobservable, offering new insights into cell-type-specific mitochondrial dynamics and enabling new findings in relevant human model systems. We believe that our findings and methods will be essential for advancing 4D cell biology, providing a powerful framework for characterizing organelles in organoid tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

These two aspects of meaning are traditionally studied separately, resulting in two large, multi-method literatures, which we sought to bring together in this study. Not only would this address basic cognitive questions of how semantic cognition operates but also because, despite their distinct focuses, both literatures ascribe a critical role to the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in each aspect of semantics. Given these considerations, we explored the notion that these systems rely on common underlying computational principles when activating conceptual semantic representations via single words, vs. building a coherent semantic representation across sequences of words. The present study used magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography to track brain activity in participants reading nouns and adjective-noun phrases, whilst integrating conceptual variables from both literatures: the concreteness of nouns (e.g., ""lettuce"" vs. ""fiction"") and the denotational semantics of adjectives (subsective vs. privative; e.g., ""bad"" vs. ""fake""). Region-of-interest analyses show that the left, and to a lesser extent the right, ATLs responded more strongly to phrases at different timepoints, irrespective of concreteness, suggesting a unified ATL function for semantic memory and composition. Decoding analyses further revealed a time-varying representational format for adjective semantics, whereas representations of noun concreteness were more stable and maintained for around 300 ms. Further, the neural representation of noun concreteness was modulated by the preceding adjectives: decoders learning concreteness signals in single words generalized better to subsective relative to privative phrases.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

Here, we used single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate the developmental trajectories of Nestin-expressing progenitors (NEPs) in the neonatal mouse cerebellum. We identified FOXO1 as a key regulator of NEP-to-inhibitory neuron differentiation, acting directly downstream of ASCL1. Genome occupancy and functional experiments using primary NEPs showed that both ASCL1 and FOXO1 regulate neurogenesis genes during differentiation while independently regulating proliferation and survival, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated that WNT signalling promotes the transition from an ASCL1+ to a FOXO1+ cellular state. Finally, we showed that the role of WNT signalling in promoting neuron production via FOXO1 is conserved in primary human NEPs.

We recently demonstrated that group I CEPs coordinate cell surface immunity with the nitrogen status in Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter Arabidopsis). To mount full group I CEP responsiveness, the three phylogenetically related CEP RECEPTOR 1 (CEPR1), CEPR2 and RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 7 (RLK7) are required.

SR-vCLEM is based on in-resin fluorescence (IRF), where fluorophores are preserved through processing into resin. The easyIRF protocol reported here reduces the requirement for complex costly sample preparation equipment and toxic chemicals compared to standard IRF protocols. easyIRF blocks are cut into ultrathin sections that are imaged using  tomoSTORM, a new modular and cost-effective openFrame-based light microscope controlled by the open-source software package Micro-Manager that provides serial single molecule localisation microscopy in array tomography format.

Their main purpose is to catch and interact with pollen, to mediate compatibility responses, to regulate pollen germination, and to guide pollen tubes to the transmitting tract so that the sperm cells carried in the pollen can be delivered to the female gametophyte to achieve double fertilization. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the stigma consists of single-celled stigma papillae that emerge from the apex of the fused carpels. Despite their critical function in plant reproduction, the molecular mechanisms that govern growth and maturation of stigma papillae remain poorly understood. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) have been implicated in stigma receptivity, but their roles in papillae development are less explored. Here we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) also play different roles in stigma papillae development, with superoxide accumulating during the initiation and growth phase and hydrogen peroxide accumulating in mature papillae that are receptive to pollen. Reducing superoxide levels in the stigma by pharmacological treatments or over-expressing superoxide dismutase enzymes under an early stigma promoter inhibited stigma papillae growth, suggesting that ROS homeostasis is critical to papillae growth and differentiation for optimal pollination.

Applying this pipeline to 11 diverse natural peptides and synthetic peptidomimetics uncovered shared antibacterial activities, but with different kinetics that categorized them into two classes: class I, where inner membrane permeabilization predominantly correlates with growth inhibition, and class II, where it does not. With the class I peptides, intracellular ribosome and DNA reorganization, along with growth inhibition, occurred abruptly and was coupled with inner membrane permeabilization. However, this coupling led to rapid peptide absorption by the first exposed cells and poor antibacterial activity against dense cell populations. With the class II peptides, ribosome/DNA reorganization and growth inhibition occurred more gradually, as inner membrane permeabilization was either absent or delayed. This was offset by slower intracellular uptake and greater efficacy against high cell densities. These kinetic differences reveal functional trade-offs between classes that have immunological and therapeutic implications.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

Silencing occurs with both randomly integrated transgenes, introduced via transposase or lentiviral methods, and with transgenes targeted to specific genomic sites, including at commonly used safe harbor loci. The challenge to robustly express experimental transgenes in differentiated pluripotent stem cells is a major bottleneck in the field for applications such as CRISPR screening. Here, we conducted a comparative analysis to systematically evaluate the impact of various promoters, transcriptional regulatory elements, insulators, and genomic integration sites on transgene silencing during neuronal differentiation. Our findings reveal that specific combinations of promoters and transcriptional stability elements are able to prevent transgene silencing during differentiation, whereas chromatin insulators had less impact on silencing and three novel safe harbor integration sites performed similarly to the CLYBL locus. Guided by these insights we developed the PiggyBac vector TK4, which showed complete resistance to transgene silencing across various neuronal and microglial differentiation protocols from six different pluripotent stem cell lines, as independently confirmed by seven different laboratories. This construct will be highly useful for assays requiring stable transgene expression during differentiation, and holds the potential for broad applications in various research fields.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1744582124635

Three neurological disease-linked de novo TOP3B point mutations outside of the active site have been identified but their impact on TOP3B activity in cells remains poorly understood. Upon establishing a new Neuro2A-cell based TOP3B activity assay, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that the autism-linked C666R mutation causes accumulation of unresolved TOP3B-mRNA covalent intermediates by directly disrupting metal coordination via a unique D1C3-type metal binding motif within the zinc finger domain. Furthermore, we show that primary neurons are sensitive to high levels of TOP3B-mRNA covalent intermediates and that such adducts are capable of causing ribosome collisions. Together, these data identify a previously underappreciated role of the zinc finger domain and how non-active site disease-linked mutations affect TOP3B activity.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

The recent evolutionary rescue of the cereal crop sorghum via RMES1 aphid resistance is among a few known in situ cases, but its pangenomic origins and molecular basis is not yet known. Here, we describe the behavioral effects, molecular endophenotypes, and pangenomic evolution underlying this evolutionary rescue. Analysis of near-isogenic lines show that RMES1 disrupts phloem feeding via global immunity activation of conserved defense networks. A growth-to-defense transition is evidenced by extensive transcriptome remodeling (>15% of expressed genes) and mediated by salicylic acid signaling. Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptor genes at the RMES1 locus harbored on a large tandem duplication have extensive copy number variation across the sorghum pangenome. The likely causative NLRs (RMES1A and RMES1B) were inferred from expression and structural variation. The NLRs encoded at RMES1 lack an N-terminal signaling domain and have nucleotide-binding domain sequence variation expected to result in a loss of ATP binding, suggesting RMES1 NLRs function via a noncanonical mechanism. The RMES1 NLR family is shared across the grass super-pangenome and includes the brown planthopper resistance gene BPH40 in Oryza sativa, which is syntenic to RMES1. Finally, k-mer analysis of RMES1 haplotypes in the sorghum pangenome established the East African origin of rare standing variation for resistance. Thus, the birth-and-death process at an ancient gene cluster generated pangenomic variation that was recruited to activate coordinated defense pathways and provide evolutionary rescue.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 255 3T MRIs from MS patients, each including post-contrast 3DT1TSE and 3DT1TFE sequences. Two blinded readers independently assessed enhancing lesions per sequence. A consensus review, incorporating longitudinal imaging and additional sequences, served as the reference standard. Results: The consensus identified 70 enhancing lesions in 31 patients. All 70 were visible on 3DT1TSE, while 64 (91%) were detectable on 3DT1TFE. Reader sensitivity was higher for 3DT1TSE (84% and 90%) than 3DT1TFE (45% and 40%) (p < 0.01). Inter-reader agreement was excellent for 3DT1TSE (ICC = 0.90) and moderate for 3DT1TFE (ICC = 0.69). Although false positives were more common with 3DT1TSE, they were readily excluded during consensus reading. In six patients, enhancing lesions were detected only on 3DT1TSE, with treatment escalation in two. Conclusion: 3DT1TSE outperformed 3DT1TFE in sensitivity and reader agreement for enhancing lesion detection in MS. Incorporating 3DT1TSE into standard MRI protocols may improve disease activity assessment and clinical decision-making.","NA","medrxiv",1744582124635

To date, various sepsis subtypes were proposed, but therapeutic options addressing the molecular changes of sepsis were not identified. With the aim of a future individualized therapy, we used machine learning (ML) to identify clinical phenotypes and their temporal development in a prospective, multicenter sepsis cohort and characterized them using plasma proteomics. Methods: Routine clinical data and blood samples were collected from 384 patients. Sepsis phenotypes were identified based on clinical measurements and plasma samples from 301 patients were analyzed using mass spectrometry. The obtained data were evaluated in relation to the phenotypes, and supervised ML models were developed enabling prospective phenotype classification and determination of key features distinguishing the phenotypes. Results: Three phenotypes and their progression across four time points in sepsis were identified. Cluster C was characterized by the highest disease severity and multi-organ failure with leading liver failure. Cluster B showed relevant organ failure, with renal damage being particularly prominent in comparison to cluster A. Time course analysis showed a strong association of cluster C with mortality and dynamic properties of cluster B. The plasma proteome reflected the clinical features of the phenotypes and revealed excessive consumption of complement and coagulation factors in severe sepsis. Supervised ML models allow the assignment of patients based on only seven widely available features. Conclusions: The identified clinical phenotypes reflected varying degrees of sepsis severity and were mirrored in the plasma proteome. Proteomic profiling offered novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sepsis and enabled a deeper characterization of the identified phenotypes. This integrative approach may serve as a blueprint for uncovering molecular signatures of sepsis subgroups and holds promise for the development of future targeted therapies.","NA","medrxiv",1744582124635

Much of the qualitative research on Long Covid has been based on people attending specialist clinical services or who have accessed support groups. We describe the varied ways in which a diverse group of people in a community sample experience, recognise and manage persistent symptoms following COVID-19. Methods: Qualitative interview study nested within the large, community-based REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study in England. Participants reporting persistent symptoms following COVID-19 were asked for consent to be contacted about a follow-up interview. We then purposively sampled by age, gender, ethnicity and symptom severity and conducted 60 interviews. Analysis was carried out using a reflexive thematic analysis approach. Results: Participants were an ethnically diverse group aged between 18 and 80 years who reported symptoms following COVID-19 for between a few months and more than two years. Many had not accessed clinical care or specific Long Covid support, and some did not identify with the category of long covid, rendering their experiences largely invisible. Participants highlighted the ways in which they self-manage symptoms within this context, and the varied burden of coping with ongoing health problems. Conclusion: This diverse sample of people with Long Covid report a range of challenges managing this emerging and contested condition, with uncertainty affecting their own understanding and the validation they receive from professionals, family and friends. These challenges intersect with others such as racism, and are compounded by a lack of specific resources for Long Covid as well as over-stretched health services in the UK. Nevertheless, people show resilience in their self-management, seeking information and support from a range of sources.

Prior work has determined that these DMVs have characteristic pores formed from the non-structural viral proteins nsp3 and nsp4, which facilitate export of newly synthesized viral RNA. Yet how the replication machinery, which is minimally comprised of the non-structural proteins nsp7 to nsp16, is recruited to the DMV remains a mystery. Working from AlphaFold and previously determined structures, we constructed a series of models that link formation of the DMV pore to nsp5 protease processing of the polyprotein and trapping of the cleaved products within the DMV itself. We argue that the initial pore is formed from twelve subunits of nsp3 and six subunits each of the intermediate uncleaved polyproteins pp1a' (nsp4-nsp10) and pp1ab' (nsp4-nsp16). Formation of this initial structure activates the protease function of alternating nsp5 subunits within a close-packed ring, facilitating the initial trans-cleavage of the nsp4-nsp5 linkage. Maturation of the pore follows, as does formation of canonical nsp5 dimers, which can process the remainder of the polyproteins. When protease activation occurs subsequent to closure of the DMV, the cleavage products, whose stoichiometry is consistent with the previously proposed nsp15-centered hexameric replication complex, will be trapped inside.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

Here, we introduce a comprehensive suite of methodologies for imaging, profiling, quantifying, and exploring the biological functions of specific surface RNAs. Utilizing these techniques, we have identified diverse non-coding RNAs present on mammalian cell surfaces. We confirm the membrane anchorage and quantify the abundance of several representative RNAs on human primary cells. Notably, we discover a significant prevalence of Y RNAs on the surfaces of human monocytes and B cells. We find that these Y RNAs on human monocyte surfaces enrich extracellular histones, regulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene expression and subsequent protein secretion upon histone stimulation via NF-{kappa}B and AP-1 activation. Our study not only presents effective approaches for investigating surface RNAs, but also uncovers a previously unrecognized immune activation pathway mediated by surface Y RNAs on monocytes.

Consequently, bacterial metabolites such as quorum sensing (QS) signaling molecules are transferred along with the phage lysate to recipient bacterial cells. Here, we show that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa QS molecules 3OC12-HSL and C4-HSL are rapidly degraded in phage lysates. In contrast, the hydrophobic QS molecule PQS is remarkably stable, for at least one year, due to its binding within outer membrane vesicles. Strikingly, we find that PQS exceeds concentrations of 10 M in standard phage lysate preparations. We show that PQS carried over from phage lysates induces QS-controlled production of the virulence factor pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa. This PQS carryover does not oppose previous conclusions of phage infection-induced PQS production, as we show here, that this response is also triggered by PQS-free phage lysates. Since other bacterial species, including Paracoccus and Vibrio harveyi, also produce hydrophobic QS molecules that are bound within outer membrane vesicles, it is likely that phage lysates from these bacteria may similarly contain stable QS molecules. Collectively, we demonstrate that membrane-bound QS molecules may significantly confound QS-related physiological outcomes of phage-host interaction studies. This can be avoided by using QS synthase mutants for phage propagation or by purifying phage particles from lysates to eliminate QS molecule carryover.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

Urban environments have been associated with a higher prevalence of these diseases, and beneficial immunological and microbiological changes have been observed when contact with microbiologically diverse materials has been re-established in intervention studies. Methods: The current study is the first large, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the effect of biodiversity intervention on atopic dermatitis. The study involved 142 atopic dermatitis patients divided into two groups: the experimental group used a topical lotion with an inactivated, diverse microbial extract as nature exposure material, and the control group used the same lotion without the microbial extract. The use of atopy medications was not restricted, but it was carefully recorded. Atopy severity was monitored using validated EASI, POEM and NRS itch scales. Skin condition was evaluated by TEWL and erythema measurements, and medicine use was recorded with questionnaires. Results: There were fewer atopy medication users and fewer atopy medication days in the experimental group compared to the control group, despite the similarity in eczema severity between the groups. Inactivated microbial extract prevented the deterioration of barrier integrity and the increase in erythema observed during the winter in the control group. There was no difference in adverse effects between the groups.

Yet, existing bioinformatics tools are often hindered by fragmented data structures, steep technical barriers, and limited capacity to incorporate SDoH variables-challenges that disproportionately affect underserved populations. To address this, we developed AI-HOPE-PM (Artificial Intelligence agent for High-Optimization and Precision mEdicine in Population Metrics), a conversational AI platform that allows users to conduct multi-dimensional cancer analyses through natural language interaction. By unifying large-scale clinical, genomic, and SDoH data within a dynamic and accessible interface, AI-HOPE-PM lowers the barrier to integrative research and supports inclusive, hypothesis-driven investigation. Methods: AI-HOPE-PM leverages large language models (LLMs), structured natural language processing, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and an internal Python-based workflow engine to automate data ingestion, filtering, cohort stratification, and statistical analysis. The platform operates on harmonized datasets from TCGA, cBioPortal, and AACR GENIE, enriched with simulated SDoH variables such as financial strain, food insecurity, and healthcare access. Free-text queries (e.g., Compare survival outcomes in CRC patients with TP53 mutations and limited access to care) are parsed into executable scripts aligned with biomedical ontologies. The system performs survival modeling, odds ratio testing, and case-control comparisons, generating interpretable visualizations and narrative reports in real time. Benchmarking against platforms like cBioPortal and UCSC Xena demonstrated 92.5% query interpretation accuracy and efficient performance across both CPU and GPU cloud environments. Results: AI-HOPE-PM successfully translated diverse user queries into real-time, executable analyses across colorectal cancer (CRC) datasets, enabling integration of clinical, genomic, and SDoH data. In one case study, the platform identified significantly worse survival in FOLFOX-treated CRC patients with TP53 mutations experiencing financial strain (p = 0.0481). Another analysis revealed poorer progression-free survival in APC wild-type patients with good healthcare access (p = 0.0233). Additional findings highlighted the influence of social support (p = 0.0220), food insecurity (p = 0.0162), and health literacy on outcomes and treatment access. Odds ratio analyses revealed disparities in chemotherapy exposure (OR = 0.356 for food-insecure patients) and KRAS mutation prevalence by sex and literacy status. AI-HOPE-PM also surfaced racial and ethnic differences in progression-free survival, emphasizing the importance of SDoH integration in population-level cancer research. All analyses were completed in under one minute, significantly reducing manual workload and improving scalability. Conclusions: AI-HOPE-PM marks a significant leap forward in the field of precision oncology by uniting clinical, genomic, and SDoH data within a single, conversational AI framework. Instead of relying on traditional, code-heavy approaches, the platform enables users to perform complex, multi-layered analyses through simple natural language interactions. This functionality not only democratizes access to integrative cancer research but also enhances the ability to uncover disparities in outcomes linked to genetic, clinical, and social variables. By contextualizing molecular insights within real-world social environments, AI-HOPE-PM delivers a more comprehensive understanding of cancer biology and care inequities. Its high performance, interpretability, and scalability position it as a powerful tool for accelerating hypothesis generation, guiding biomarker discovery, and informing equity-driven treatment strategies. As a flexible and user-centered platform, AI-HOPE-PM lays the groundwork for a new paradigm in AI-assisted, health equity-focused translational research.","NA","medrxiv",1744582124635

In this study, we systematically investigated gut microbial differences between the Han Chinese and non-Chinese populations using the Human Gut Microbiome Reference Genome Catalog (HGMRGC). HGMRGC includes 271,480 non-redundant genomes from 5,785 prokaryotic species, which was generated by metagenomic sequencing data from 9,320 publicly available samples across 22 countries and 3,584 newly sequenced samples from Han Chinese individuals across 29 provinces and regions in China. We observed geography was the primary driver of microbial variation of abundance and SNPs. We identified 625 novel population-specific genome clusters from HGMRGC with functional differences in carbohydrate utilization and 126 species exhibiting distinct prevalence related to vitamin biosynthesis, antibiotic resistance, and carbohydrate metabolism. Beta diversity analysis highlighted significant inter-population differences in both microbial abundance and SNPs, while alpha diversity analysis revealed that non-Chinese populations exhibited higher diversity in microbial abundance, and Han Chinese populations displayed greater diversity in SNPs. These results provide valuable insights into population-specific microbial diversity, laying the groundwork for future research on its functional and health implications.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

In this study, we theoretically identify the evolutionary pressures that may have driven this divergence in genome length. We use a parameter-free model to study genome length evolution under selection pressure to minimize replication time and maximize information storage capacity. We show that prokaryotes tend to reduce genome length, constrained by a single replication origin, while eukaryotes expand their genomes by incorporating multiple replication origins. We propose a connection between genome length and cellular energetics, suggesting that endosymbiotic organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts, evolutionarily regulate the number of replication origins, thereby influencing genome length in eukaryotes. We show that the above two selection pressures also lead to strict equalization of the number of purines and their corresponding base-pairing pyrimidines within a single DNA strand, known as Chagraff's second parity rule, a hitherto unexplained observation in genomes of nearly all known species. This arises from the symmetrization of replichore length, another observation that has been shown to hold across species, which our model reproduces. The model also reproduces other experimentally observed phenomena, such as a general preference for deletions over insertions, and elongation and high variance of genome lengths under reduced selection pressure for replication rate, termed the C-value paradox. We highlight the possibility of regulation of the firing of latent replication origins in response to cues from the extracellular environment leading to the regulation of cell cycle rates in multicellular eukaryotes.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

Various brain atrophy measures are essential in research of Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias. This study aims to forecast future annual percentage changes in hippocampal, ventricular, and total gray matter (TGM) volumes in individuals with varying cognitive statuses, from healthy to dementia. We developed a machine learning model using elastic net linear regression and tested two approaches: (1) a baseline model using predictors from a single-time-point and (2) a longitudinal model using predictors derived from longitudinal MRI. Both approaches were evaluated with MRI-only models and models that combined MRI with additional risk fac- tors (age, sex, APOE4, and baseline diagnosis). Cross-validated Pearson correlation scores between predicted and actual annual percentage changes were 0.62 for the hippocampus, 0.51 for the ventricles, and 0.41 for TGM, using the longitudinal MRI + risk factor model. Longitudinal models consistently outperformed baseline models, and models including risk factors outperformed the MRI only model. Validation using an external dataset confirmed these findings, highlighting the value of predictors derived based on longitudinal data. We further studied the value of the predicted atrophy/enlargement rates for clinical status progression prediction across three different datasets. Predicted atrophy was a consistently better indicator of progression to mild cognitive impairment and dementia than present-day regional volumes, with the longitudinal atrophy prediction model typically outperforming the baseline model in terms of clinical status prediction. Future atrophy prediction has significant potential for assessing the risk of cognitive decline, even in cognitively unimpaired individuals, and can aid in selecting participants for clinical trials of disease-modifying drugs for AD.","NA","medrxiv",1744582124635

A{beta}o are believed to contribute to dementia in AD, and more than a dozen have been identified. While some oligomers are associated with amyloid plaques, others--such as A{beta}*56--are not. It remains unclear whether these plaque-independent oligomers contribute to dementia. A{beta}*56 is a non-fibrillar, sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable, brain-derived type of A{beta}o that impairs memory in mice. We recently confirmed and extended the characterization of A{beta}*56 in AD mouse models and identified two variants, namely A{beta}(40)*56 and A{beta}(42)*56 containing canonical A{beta}(1-40) and A{beta}(1-42), respectively. To examine the role of A{beta}*56 in dementia, we measured A{beta}*56 in elderly individuals--selected for equivalent levels of amyloid plaques--with no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia. Using immunoprecipitation (IP), western blotting (WB), size exclusion chromatography, and conformation-sensitive antibodies, we confirmed the presence of A{beta}(40)*56 and A{beta}(42)*56 in human brains. Using IP/WB coupled with densitometry-based semi-quantitative analysis, we found that levels of both A{beta}*56 variants were elevated in AD dementia compared to NCI and MCI and correlated inversely with various measures of memory and cognition. Furthermore, mediation analyses showed that these associations were mediated by phosphorylated tau at serine 202 and threonine 205 (ptau 202/205)-containing neurofibrillary tangles. These findings support an association between A{beta}*56 and AD dementia independently of amyloid pathology. The results are significant because they suggest that targeting A{beta}*56 in patients could provide additional cognitive benefits beyond those achieved by current anti-A{beta} therapies that focus on removing amyloid plaques.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

However, these powerful algorithms present an intriguing paradox regarding image resolution: contrary to intuition, lower-resolution images can yield superior performance for specific image analysis carried out by deep learning. This phenomenon is particularly significant in microscopy imaging, where high-resolution acquisitions come with substantial costs in throughput, data storage requirements, and potential photodamage to specimens. Through systematic experimentation, we evaluate how varying image resolution impacts deep learning performance in cellular image segmentation tasks. We trained popular architectures on datasets downsampled to 6-50% of their original resolution, mimicking acquisitions at lower image magnification, and compared their performance against models trained on native-resolution images. Our results show that segmentation accuracy either improves (by up to 25% of mean Intersection over Union (IoU)) or experiences only minimal degradation (< 5% of mean IoU) when using images downsampled by up to a factor of 4 (25% of the original resolution). This downsampling proportionally increases information throughput while reducing data storage requirements and inference time. With these findings, we contribute systematic guidelines to deep learning practitioners in creating efficient experimental pipelines for image-driven discoveries. This approach improves the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of bioimaging studies by reducing data and computing needs while optimising microscopy techniques.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

An essential transmembrane beta-barrel protein, LptD, and a cognate lipoprotein, LptE, translocate LPS selectively into the OM external leaflet via a poorly understood mechanism. Here, we characterize two additional translocon subunits, the lipoproteins LptM and LptY (formerly YedD). We use single-particle cryo-EM analysis, functional assays and molecular dynamics simulations to visualize the roles of LptM and LptY at the translocon holo-complex LptDEMY, uncovering their impact on LptD conformational dynamics. Whereas LptY binds and stabilizes the periplasmic LptD beta-taco domain that functions as LPS receptor, LptM intercalates the lateral gate of the beta-barrel domain, promoting its opening and access by LPS. Remarkably, we demonstrate a conformational switch of the LptD beta-taco/beta-barrel interface alternating between contracted and extended states. The LptD beta-strand 1, which defines the mobile side of the lateral gate, binds LPS and performs a stroke movement toward the external leaflet during the contracted-to-extended state transition. Our findings establish a detailed mechanistic framework explaining the selective transport of LPS to the membrane external leaflet.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

In canonical miRNA biogenesis, primary miRNAs are transcribed from intergenic loci or intronic regions by RNA polymerase II, sequentially cleaved by the Microprocessor complex and Dicer, and resulting mature miRNAs are loaded into Argonaute to repress target mRNAs. A minority of miRNAs are generated via noncanonical biogenesis pathways that bypass the Microprocessor and/or Dicer. Here, we describe a new Pol III-dependent, Microprocessor-independent, and Dicer-dependent biogenesis pathway exemplified by the mir-1829 family in C. elegans. The mir-1829 family is germline enriched and resides in unusually long introns of three host genes that have no apparent overlapping functions. Using multiple approaches, we determined that the mir-1829 family is derived from independent Pol III transcripts with consistent transcription start sites. Unlike other Pol III-dependent miRNAs, the mir-1829 family small RNAs are the dominant species derived from their loci, rather than fragments of a larger functional noncoding RNA. We extend these findings, identifying additional Pol III-transcribed and noncanonical miRNAs in C. elegans and human datasets. These young, noncanonical miRNAs may represent an early snapshot in the evolution of de novo miRNA genes.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

The Movile Cave, isolated from external influences 5.5 million years, offers a unique opportunity to explore microbial evolution under prolonged environmental stability. Here, we analyzed metagenome-assembled genomes from this cave, revealing that prokaryotes exhibit lower gene diversity and higher levels of pseudogenization compared to those from non-isolated environments, mainly affecting housekeeping functions involved in translation. Functional redundancy across genomes remained comparable to related habitats. Our results suggest that pseudogenization may serve as a fine-tuning mechanism to reduce excess redundancy. Although horizontal gene transfer is limited overall, the cave virome seems to contribute to microbial adaptation through the transfer of auxiliary metabolic genes. Movile microorganisms harbor fewer phage-defense systems than counterparts in related environments, suggesting a long-term adaptation to a relatively stable virosphere. Our findings indicate that prolonged isolation under stable selective pressures does not necessarily lead to major genomic divergence, but rather promotes adaptive gene loss. This study provides key insights into how long-term stability shapes microbial genome evolution and ecosystem function.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

We present PROXICLUST, which strategically combines smaller combinatorial mutagenesis experiments to enable accurate predictions across larger combinatorial spaces. Our approach leverages the spatial proximity of amino acid residues to identify potential epistatic interactions, using these relationships to optimize the design of manageable-sized combinatorial experiments. By combining just two small combinatorial datasets, we achieve accurate binding affinity predictions across substantially larger mutation spaces (R2 {approx} 0.8), with performance strongly correlated with capture of high-order epistatic effects. We validated our method in five different protein-protein interaction datasets, including binding of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) to various antibodies and cellular receptors, as well as influenza RBD-antibody interactions.

This represents the most extensive and highest level of homology observed to date between a viral protein and an Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecule. Molecular modeling of the S9 and HLA-A proteins and subsequent structural comparison confirmed significant similarity, including the antigen-presenting region. Although cytomegalovirus exhibits high host specificity, the presence of the S9 protein in this virus warrants immunological caution in the event of cross-species transmission. Phylogenetic analysis of MHC class I-like gene sequences corresponding to primate HLA-A and SBHV4 suggested that SBHV4-S9 was likely acquired via LINE-1-mediated horizontal gene transfer from the African Old World monkey Papio anubis or a closely related ancestral species approximately 12.9 to 22.2 million years ago. SBHV4-S9 displayed evidence of strong negative selection following its divergence from Papio anubis. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the SBHV4-S1 gene and primate SLAMF6-like genes indicated that this gene was acquired after the divergence from the New World monkey Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis. Evaluation of the overall genetic similarity between the SBHV4 genome and cDNAs from individual primate species using hierarchical clustering based on Levenshtein distance and Wasserstein distance revealed a higher degree of similarity between the SBHV4 genome and Papio anubis cDNA compared to that with Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis cDNA. Taken together, these findings suggest that Papio anubis has a longer co-evolutionary history with SBHV4 than squirrel monkeys, and that SBHV4 likely spread from Africa to South America, acquiring novel genomic elements in new hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

To achieve such cognitive flexibility, the brain is wired by plastic synapses that are hotspots of energy consumption. Supplying energy to distant synapses is challenging as they are distributed throughout dendrites and axons, spanning hundreds of microns from their cell body. Synapses, therefore, require an instant and local energy supply provided by mitochondria stabilized near dendritic spines. However, the mechanisms by which synapses communicate their energy demands to locally stable mitochondria to drive local energy production and sustain synaptic plasticity is unknown. Using highly sensitive spine- and mitochondrial ATP reporters and two-photon glutamate uncaging to stimulate individual spines, we find that synaptic plasticity input drives instant and sustained increase in spine ATP levels, provided by local ATP synthesis in [~]10-20 m spatially confined compartments within mitochondria. This spatially localized mitochondrial ATP generation is driven by a spatially localized mitochondrial calcium influx independent of the endoplasmic reticulum. Notably, the initial spine ATP increase, supported by local mitochondrial ATP synthesis, is independent of CaMKII and the energy demands of spine structural plasticity. Without local calcium signaling and mitochondrial stabilization, synapses do not meet their instant and sustained energy needs, resulting in synaptic plasticity defects, as observed in neurological disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

RNU4-2 is a non-protein-coding gene that is transcribed into the U4 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of the major spliceosome. ReNU syndrome variants disrupt spliceosome function and alter 5' splice site selection. Here, we performed saturation genome editing (SGE) of RNU4-2 to identify the functional and clinical impact of variants across the entire gene. The resulting SGE function scores, derived from variants' effects on cell fitness, discriminate ReNU syndrome variants from those observed in the population and dramatically outperform in silico variant effect prediction. Using these data, we redefine the ReNU syndrome critical region at single nucleotide resolution, resolve variant pathogenicity for variants of uncertain significance, and show that SGE function scores delineate variants by phenotypic severity. Further, we identify variants impacting function in regions of RNU4-2 that are critical for interactions with other spliceosome components. We show that these variants cause a novel recessive NDD that is clinically distinct from ReNU syndrome.

Highly active enzymes have been designed starting from such descriptions using the generative AI method RFdiffusion, but there are two current methodological limitations. First, the geometry of the active site can only be specified at the residue level, so for each catalytic residue functional group placed around the reaction transition state, the possible locations of the residue backbone must be enumerated by building side chain rotamers back from the functional group. Second, the location of the catalytic residues along the sequence must be specified in advance, which considerably limits the space of solutions which can be sampled. Here we describe a new deep generative method, RoseTTAFold diffusion 2 (RFdiffusion2), that solves both problems, enabling enzymes to be designed from sequence agnostic descriptions of functional group locations without inverse rotamer generation. We first evaluate RFdiffusion2 on an in silico enzyme design benchmark of 41 diverse active sites and find that it is able to successfully build proteins scaffolding all 41 sites, compared to 16/41 with prior state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Next, we design enzymes around three diverse catalytic sites and characterize the designs experimentally; in each case we identify active catalysts in testing less than 96 sequences. RFdiffusion2 demonstrates the potential of atomic resolution generative models for the design of de novo enzymes directly from their reaction mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

In less studied organisms without annotated genomes, it can seem impossible to perform proteomic analysis. In this study we sought to answer the question - does enough information exist to do proteomics on any organism we want? As a case study we started with material available due to an infestation of a home with black widow spiders. Thanks to the recent publication of an annotated genome for one species of black widow spider, we were able to identify 5502 protein groups and assign putative annotations using ortholog mapping. We also demonstrate that had we not had this resource, over 2000 proteins could be identified using other available spider genome annotations, despite their unrelatedness. Moreover, regardless of spider proteome used, proteins annotated as toxins were almost exclusively observed in the main body of the mature female black widow spider. Overall, these results provide a draft proteome map for the black widow spider and valuable data for validating machine learning models, while also suggesting that the door to insightful quantitative proteomics may already be open for millions of less studied organisms.

To address this gap, we developed Altair-LSFM, a high-resolution, open-source, sample-scanning light-sheet microscope specifically designed for sub-cellular imaging. By optimizing the optical pathway in silico, we created a custom baseplate with precisely positioned dowel pins to simplify alignment and assembly. The system integrates streamlined optoelectronics and optomechanics with seamless operation through our open-source software, navigate. Altair-LSFM achieves lateral and axial resolutions of approximately 235 nm and 350 nm, respectively, across a 266-micron field of view after deconvolution.

These breaks are scheduled to maintain tolerably high levels of tumor burden, employing competitive suppression of treatment-resistant sub-populations by treatment-sensitive sub-populations. AT has been integrated into several ongoing or planned clinical trials, including treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and BRAF-mutant melanoma, with initial clinical results suggesting that it can offer significant extensions in the time to progression over the standard of care.

However, these clinical protocols may be sub-optimal, as they fail to account for variation in tumor dynamics between patients, and result in significant heterogeneity in patient outcomes. Mathematical modeling and analysis have been proposed to optimize adaptive protocols, but they do not account for clinical restrictions, most notably the discrete time intervals between the clinical appointments where a patients tumor burden is measured and their treatment schedule is re-evaluated. We present a general framework for deriving optimal treatment protocols which account for these discrete time intervals, and derive optimal schedules for a number of models to avoid model-specific personalization. We identify a trade-off between the frequency of patient monitoring and the time to progression attainable, and propose an AT protocol based on a single treatment threshold. Finally, we identify a subset of patients with qualitatively different dynamics that instead require a novel AT protocol based on a threshold that changes over the course of treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1744582124635

Here, we show that the neurodevelopmental disorder-associated ubiquitin ligase UBE3C regulates the cellular composition of the murine cerebral cortex and human brain organoids, with its loss favoring neurogenesis and suppressing glial fate. Using genetic complementation, we demonstrate that disease-associated UBE3C mutations alter its autoubiquitination activity and disrupt cortical lamination. Proteomic profiling of UBE3C-deficient forebrains and organoids identifies Cbll1 as a UBE3C substrate, and we show that the UBE3C-Cbll1 duo drives N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA methylation. Hyperactivation of m6A writers in UBE3C-deficient neural progenitors impairs cell cycle exit, a defect reversible in vivo by the METTL3 inhibitor STM2457.

This sensing is done by redistribution of charged membrane proteins on the cells surface (""sensors"") via electrophoresis and electroosmotic flow. If membrane proteins have to physically rearrange on the cells surface, how quickly can a cell respond to an applied signal? What limits the cells ability to respond? Are galvanotaxing cells, like chemotaxing cells, limited by stochasticity from the finite number of molecules? Here, we develop a model for the response dynamics of galvanotaxing cells and show that, for weak enough field strengths, two relevant timescales emerge: the time for the cells sensors to rearrange, which depends on their diffusion across the cell, and the time for the cells orientation to respond to an applied field, which may be very different. We fit this model to experimental measurements on the recently-identified sensor galvanin (TMEM154) in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells, finding that given the dynamics of a cell responding to an applied field, we can predict the dynamics of the cell after the field is turned off. This fit constrains the noise of the galvanotaxis process, demonstrating that HL-60 is not limited by the stochasticity of finite sensor number. Our model also allows us to explain the effect of media viscosity on cell dynamics, and predict how cells respond to pulsed DC fields. These results place constraints on the ability to guide cells with pulsed fields, predicting that a field on half of the time is no better than a field that is always on with half the magnitude.","NA","biorxiv",1744582124635

Passive diffusive mitochondrial dynamics are parameterized using stochastic reaction-diffusion simulations in ReaDDy, while active transport is modeled explicitly by incorporating motor-driven transport along a diffusing, polarized microtubule network.

Traditional bulk eQTL methods rely on averaged gene expression across a possibly heterogeneous mixture of cells, which can obscure underlying regulatory heterogeneity. Single-cell eQTL methods circumvent the averaging artifacts, providing an immense opportunity to interrogate transcriptional regulation at a much finer resolution. Recent developments in metric space regression methods allow the use of full empirical distributions as response objects instead of simple summary statistics such as mean. Here, we leverage Frechet regression to identify distribution QTLs (distQTLs) using population-scale single-cell RNA sequencing data. We apply distQTL to the OneK1K cohort, consisting of scRNA-seq data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 982 donors, and compare results to various eQTL approaches based on summary statistics and mixed effects modeling.

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1744582124635

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1744582124635
