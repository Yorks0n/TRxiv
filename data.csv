Here we draw on drug checking results from around the United States to report a rapid shift in the illicit drug supply with important implications for public health. Bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl) sebacate, or ''BTMPS'' is a hindered amine light stabilizer with various industrial applications. Animal studies indicate multiple kinds of adverse health effects. Methods: Drug samples collected by community-based drug checking programs in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, along with drug residue samples from other jurisdictions in California, Delaware, Maryland, and Washington, were submitted to the National Institute on Standards and Technology. Samples were qualitatively tested with Direct Analysis in Real Time mass spectrometry, with reflex to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) for confirmatory testing. Quantitation - percent by mass - was performed using LCMS. At both sites where drug samples were collected, participants were asked to respond to a survey that included questions about what the substance was sold as and any unexpected effects. Results: Between June 1, 2024 and August 31, 2024, a total of 178 samples sold as fentanyl were tested. Of these, 43 (24%) contained BTMPS, with the proportion per month rising from 0% in June to more than a third in August. An additional 23 residue samples from sites doing residue testing contained BTMPS. Fentanyl samples with BTMPS also contained many other compounds, including local anesthetics and alpha-2 agonists. Average fentanyl purity was significantly lower in samples with BTMPS compared to samples without. Conclusions: The introduction of an industrial chemical to the illicit drug supply at this speed and scale is unprecedented and concerning. Further research is urgently needed to determine why it is present in the fentanyl supply and characterize effects on human health.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347
"A systematic review of psychological factors influencing attitudes and intentions toward, and uptake of, Covid-19 vaccines in adolescents","10.1101/2024.09.17.24313392","medrxiv",2,2,2,2,2,"Pitt, A.; Amlot, R.; Heffernan, C.; Rubin, G.

Low vaccine uptake reduces the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns and threatens global public health. Understanding why adolescents are hesitant to accept new vaccines is therefore crucial to support the development of novel vaccine uptake interventions. Prior reviews have included far fewer citations, excluded qualitative data, studies after 2022 and have not mapped adolescent Covid-19 vaccine behaviour onto psychological models. This systematic review investigates psychological factors influencing attitudes and intentions toward and uptake of Covid-19 vaccines in adolescents aged 10 to 19 years globally. Next, we mapped results onto the COM-B framework to inform future interventions. Our search identified 25,354 citations, and included 77 in this review. The quality of studies was mixed, predominantly cross-sectional in design. According to our review, key influences on adolescent Covid-19 vaccine behaviour were: i) Reflective motivation (safety concerns, perceived susceptibility to/severity of Covid-19, perceived vaccine effectiveness, ii) Social opportunity (social norms, autonomy and prosocial attitudes), iii) Psychological capability (attitude and knowledge about vaccines). To improve vaccine uptake, interventions should help adolescents critically weigh vaccine pros and cons and consider external influences on their decisions. IMPLICATIONS AND CONTRIBUTION Our review provides new insights into psychological factors influencing adolescent Covid-19 vaccine behaviour, and maps factors to the COM-B model of behaviour change. To improve vaccine uptake, future vaccine interventions should support adolescents to think critically about the pros and cons of vaccines and consider external influences on their decisions.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

Yet the mechanisms that allow host regulation of intracellular symbionts, a pre-requisite for stable endosymbiosis and subsequent organelle evolution, are largely unknown. Here, we describe an immune-like glycan-sensing/processing network, partly assembled through horizontal gene-transfers (HGTs), that enables Paramecium bursaria to control its green algal endosymbionts. Using phylogenetics, RNA-interference (RNAi), and metabolite exposure experiments, we show that P. bursaria regulates endosymbiont destruction using glycan-sensing/processing - a system that includes a eukaryotic-wide chitin-binding chitinase-like protein (CLP) localized to the host phago-lysosome. RNAi of CLP alters expression of eight host glycan-processing genes, including two prokaryote-derived HGTs, during endosymbiont destruction. Furthermore, glycan-sensing/processing dynamically regulates endosymbiont number in P. bursaria, plasticity crucial to maximize host fitness across ecological conditions. CLP is homologous to a human phagocyte-associated innate immune factor, revealing how immune functions can be alternatively adapted and expanded, partly through HGT, enabling endosymbiotic control.

Menopausal hot flashes typically persist for years. For a sizeable minority of women, hot flashes are severe and substantially impairing. It is worthwhile to further investigate the genetic underpinnings of hot flashes.

MethodWe conducted the largest trans-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) of hot flashes available to date (N=149,560). We used self-assessment of hot flashes in the Nurses Health Study, Nurses Health Study II, Womens Health Initiative, and Queensland Institute of Medical Research samples (total n=42,489). In one sample (UK Biobank, n=107,071) direct assessment of hot flashes was not available, so menopausal hormone therapy was used as a proxy variable. We estimated the heritability of hot flashes and genetic correlations with psychiatric phenotypes using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSR).

ResultsIn component analyses and our trans-ancestry meta-analysis, the top locus was on chromosome 4 in the neurokinin 3 receptor gene (TACR3, position 104,556,732, trans-ancestry p=7.2x10-41). A second novel locus was identified (LINC02428, p=3.5x10-8). Gene results implicated TACR3, GRID1, NUDT4, and PHF21B. Using the hot flash GWAS meta-analysis (n=42,489; i.e., no proxy variable), SNP heritability was estimated: h2liab=.08 (h2SNP=.04, se=.02). Genetic correlations were statistically significant between hot flashes and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD, rg=0.25, p=0.01), schizophrenia (rg=0.17, p=0.02), and depression (rg=0.21, p=0.01).

DiscussionThese genomic findings are consistent with independent, robust basic science research which led to a novel treatment for hot flashes, namely, neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists. This new class of hot flash drugs blocks the receptor (neurokinin 3 receptor) coded for by the top locus for hot flashes (TACR3). This GWAS of hot flashes provides an uncommonly clear example of how GWAS findings can point to potent treatment targets for complex brain phenotypes. We also found that the proxy variable (menopausal hormone therapy) pointed to the same target (TACR3), and that exclusively intronic and intergenic variants signaled this target.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

Limited research exists on the impact of School Distress on the parents/carers supporting these CYP. Using a case-control, concurrent embedded mixed-method design, we explored this lived experience. 947 parents of CYP with School Distress completed a bespoke online questionnaire, alongside two control parent groups (n=149, n=25) and one professional group (n=19). Findings revealed a devastating impact on the mental health of parents, with parents displaying significantly heightened daily anxiety and significantly lower mood during, but not before, their children's school attendance difficulties. In addition, parents with children experiencing School Distress reported significantly more negative emotion states and significantly fewer positive emotion states. Parents also reported overwhelmingly negative treatment from professionals, including being disbelieved or blamed for their children's difficulties, threatened with fines and court action, and disempowered by the actions of professionals surrounding their child. Significant, deleterious impacts were also evident across all aspects of their lives, including their careers, finances, and other children. Perhaps unsurprisingly, half of these parents reported developing a new mental health condition since their child's difficulties began, with the experience itself rated as the second most threatening potential life event, superseded only by the death of a first-degree relative (including a child or spouse). On the other hand, professionals working with CYP with School Distress did not experience these deleterious mental health or wider life consequences. Despite understanding how threatening the experience is for parents, they were often quick to blame parents for their children's difficulties. Professionals, like parents, expressed frustration with the lack of help available for these CYP and their families. This study highlights a bleak, adversarial, and lonely picture for parents of CYP struggling to attend school. More specifically, the findings depict a system rife with parental blame; a system that appears to isolate parents through hostile, threatening, and punitive actions. A wider lack of societal understanding of the experience of School Distress further compounds this dearth of support for parents, placing parental mental health in further peril.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

We conducted a systematic review of 311 published papers that included a mechanistic, population-level model of co-circulating human pathogens. We identified the types of pathogens represented in this literature, techniques used, and motivations for conducting these studies. We also created a complexity index to quantify the degree to which co-circulating pathogen models diverged from single-pathogen models. We found that the emergence of new pathogens, such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2, precipitated modeling activity of the emerging pathogen with established pathogens. Pathogen characteristics also tended to drive modeling activity; for example, HIV suppresses the immune response, eliciting interesting dynamics when it is modeled with other pathogens. The motivations driving these studies were varied but could be divided into two major categories: exploration of dynamics and evaluation of interventions. Finally, we found that model complexity quickly increases as additional pathogens are added. Future potential avenues of research we identified include investigating the effects of misdiagnosis of clinically similar co-circulating pathogens and characterizing the impacts of one pathogen on public health resources available to curtail the spread of other pathogens.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

Subjective cognitive impairment reports may offer valuable and early insights into individuals' cognitive functioning and serve as indicators of early stages of cognitive decline. Objective: To investigate the associations of the item-level response to Cognitive Function Index (CFI) by participant and study partner with tau pathology and adjusted hippocampal volume (HVa). Method: Participants were 339 cognitively unimpaired, A{beta} positive, individuals enrolled in the Anti-Amyloid Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) Study who underwent tau-PET imaging. Participants and their study partners assessed subjective changes in cognition and function over the past year using the 15-item CFI questionnaire. For each CFI item, the relationship among tau, HVa, and CFI reports was investigated. Result: Participants were on average 72.38 (SD = 4.87) years old, 58.1% were female, and 23.6% were tau positive. Higher tauMTL was significantly associated with participant report of decline on three CFI items including depending on written notes, seeing a doctor for memory concern, and feeling lost while navigating. Higher tauMTL was associated with study partner report of decline on two different items: needing help from others to remember appointments/occasions and asking same questions. Additionally, HVa was linked to challenges with driving for participants and noticeable memory decline for study partners. Conclusion: We showed that early changes reported on specific items of the CFI are associated with higher tauMTL and lower HVa in A{beta}+ participants. Different CFI items were associated with tau and hippocampal volume for participants and study partners, highlighting the importance of both perspective.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

Clinically relevant preconception information and clinical practice guidelines have since been developed to aid health professionals in preconception care delivery. This systematic review aimed to 1) synthesise recent literature (past five years) describing health professionals beliefs and attitudes towards preconception care services or programmes and 2) determine if the experience of health professionals providing preconception care has changed compared to literature reviews conducted more than five years ago. Methods Five databases were searched between 27/01/2016 and 27/01/2022. Primary quantitative and qualitative research studies were included if they examined health professionals beliefs and attitudes towards delivering preconception care services or programmes. Study quality was assessed using the CASP Checklist (qualitative studies) and AXIS tool (quantitative studies). Data synthesis used thematic categorisation adapted from the framework approach. Results Twenty-one studies were included (n=8 qualitative, n=11 quantitative, n=2 mixed-methods studies). Methodological quality was generally good for qualitative studies but varied for quantitative studies. The results covered three categories: 1) addressing preconception care health literacy (i.e. lack of knowledge, awareness, training and resources), 2) clinical practicalities of preconception care (i.e. need for coordination of care and clarity on role responsibility), and 3) the role of the patient (i.e. need for public health education to support patient-led conversations). Conclusions Little has changed regarding the barriers and facilitators to providing preconception care reported by health professionals. To improve the provision of preconception care, there is a need to co-develop professional and public preconception health education, clinical resources, and a coordinated preconception healthcare service model.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

The Study of Asian Women and their Offspring's Development and Environmental Exposures (SAWASDEE) enrolled pregnant farmworkers from Thailand (n=248), who were primarily exposed to organophosphate (OP) and pyrethroid pesticides. We measured maternal urinary levels of six non-specific OP metabolites expressed as three summary measures (dimethylalkylphosphates (DMAP), diethylalkylphosphates (DEAP), and dialkylphosphates (DAP) and three pyrethroid metabolites (3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), cis- and trans-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid (Cis-DCCA, Trans-DCCA) during early, middle, and late pregnancy, and adjusted for urine dilution using creatinine. RNA-sequencing was used to profile the placental transcriptome from which 21 co-expression network modules were identified by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis. Quantile g-computation analysis identified an average pregnancy positive mixture exposure effect on the E2f Target Module ({beta}=0.013, p=0.012) and a negative mixture exposure effect ({beta}=-0.016, p=0.008) on the Myogenesis Module. The pesticide metabolites driving the associations differed for each module, highlighting differential susceptibilities within the placental transcriptome to various pesticides. When stratifying by infant sex, the average pregnancy mixture exhibited a significant negative effect ({beta}=-0.018, P=0.016) on the Myogenesis Module only in females; other modules, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, though not demonstrating an overall mixture effect, did demonstrate differential impacts of the mixture by sex. Pesticide mixtures in both the second trimester ({beta}=-0.013, p=0.015) and the third trimester ({beta} =-0.012, p=0.028) exhibited consistently significant negative associations with the Myogenesis module. These findings underscore the importance of considering the prenatal environment more holistically, understanding the placenta's susceptibility to contaminants, and incorporating sex-specific analyses to understand differential impacts.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

In this study, we analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from the Yale-Penn cohort, comprising 2,100 participants of European ancestry (EUR; 1,321 OD cases) and 1,790 of African ancestry (AFR; 864 cases). A novel low-frequency variant (rs746301110) in the RUVBL2 gene was identified in EUR (p=6.59*10-10).

However, the number of HIV infections is unevenly distributed with two thirds of global infections confined to Sub-Saharan Africa. Due to viral drug resistance, the most effective treatment requires a triple drug combination thereby adding to the complexity and cost of therapy. As such, many people living with HIV or at risk of infection do not have access to prevention or treatment of this potentially fatal disease. There is no cure for HIV [1]. Tucaresol is an orally active clinical stage drug which functions as a host targeted antiviral agent by controlled stimulation of CD4+ T helper immune cells. We report herein that Tucaresol also displays in-vitro activity against HIV. Although this antiviral activity is not potent, the excellent safety profile and bioavailability of Tucaresol, along with its low Molecular Weight, support attainment of relevant drug concentrations in man to achieve significant in-vivo activity. This is demonstrated by previously reported stabilization of viremia in a prior proof of concept phase 1b/2a HIV clinical trial [2]. It is possible that the significant in-vivo activity of Tucaresol arises from synergy between co-stimulation of CD4+ T helper cells and the direct activity against virally infected cells. A pan in-vitro viral screen of Tucaresol further revealed a weak, direct antiviral activity against human herpes virus 6B, human papillomavirus 11, measles virus and hepatitis B virus.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

Recent work has turned to brain stimulation methods to help rectify hypofrontality and dopamine reward system changes often observed in individuals with CUD. Preliminary studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have demonstrated promising results, but there is room for optimization of the stimulation site, stimulation pattern, and identification of relevant biomarkers of TMS effects. The current pilot study aimed to test the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effects of a double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over, acute design using intermittent theta burst stimulation to dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) on electroencephalogram (EEG) as intermediate outcome assessment in CUD patients. This small pilot enrolled five individuals with moderate-to-severe CUD for feasibility and proof-of-concept. Participants completed safety, psychometric, and EEG measures before and after receiving two sessions of active or sham TMS to dmPFC on two separate days. All five participants completed all the study tasks and found the TMS to be tolerable. The side effects were minimal and consistent with an acute TMS design. Visible changes were observed in the electrical activity of the brain during a monetary guessing task, while minimal changes in psychometric measures were observed. These results indicate the feasibility and safety of the current approach and suggest that dmPFC is a viable target for treating CUD. Future work should expand upon these findings in a randomized controlled clinical trial.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

One of the fine-mapped SNPs, rs13303160 (r2=0.93 in 1000G EUR samples, OR=1.23, P value=2.74x10-9) demonstrated allele-preferential gene regulatory activity in vitro and allele-preferential binding of JunB and JunD in vitro and in vivo.

Proteomic analysis identified KLHL17 as a member of the Cullin-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex in PDAC-derived cells. In silico differential gene expression analysis of the GTExv8 pancreas data suggested an association between lower KLHL17 (risk associated) and pro-inflammatory pathways.

In most cases, HPV DNA is integrated into the human genome. We found that tumor-specific, HPV-human DNA junctions are detectable in serum cell-free DNA of cervical cancer patients at initial treatment. Retrospective analysis revealed these junctions were more frequently detectable in women in whom the cancer later recurred. We also found that cervical cancers caused by HPV types outside of phylogenetic clade 9 had a higher recurrence frequency than those caused by 9 types in both our study and The Cancer Genome Atlas cervical cancer database, despite the higher prevalence of non-9 types including HPV16 in cervical cancer. Thus, HPV-human DNA junction detection in serum cell-free DNA and HPV type determination in tumor tissue may help predict recurrence risk. Screening serum cell-free DNA for junctions may also offer an unambiguous, non-invasive means to monitor absence of recurrence following treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

Strongyloides stercoralis is a potentially fatal skin-penetrating human parasite that is endemic to tropical and subtropical regions around the world. The complex life cycle of Strongyloides species is unique among human-parasitic nematodes in that it includes a single free-living generation featuring soil-dwelling, bacterivorous adults whose progeny all develop into infective larvae. The sensory behaviors that enable free-living Strongyloides adults to navigate and survive soil environments are unknown. S. stercoralis infective larvae display parasite-specific sensory-driven behaviors, including robust attraction to mammalian body heat. In contrast, the free-living model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans displays thermosensory behaviors that guide adult worms to stay within a physiologically permissive range of environmental temperatures. Do S. stercoralis and C. elegans free-living adults, which experience similar environmental stressors, display common thermal preferences? Here, we characterize the thermosensory behaviors of the free-living adults of S. stercoralis as well as those of the closely related rat parasite, Strongyloides ratti. We find that Strongyloides free-living adults are exclusively attracted to near-tropical temperatures, despite their inability to infect mammalian hosts. We further show that lifespan is shorter at higher temperatures for free-living Strongyloides adults, similar to the effect of temperature on C. elegans lifespan. However, we also find that the reproductive potential of the free-living life stage is enhanced at warmer temperatures, particularly for S. stercoralis. Together, our results reveal a novel role for thermotaxis to maximize the infectious capacity of obligate parasites and provide insight into the biological adaptations that may contribute to their endemicity in tropical climates.

Author SummarySoil-transmitted parasitic nematodes infect over 1 billion people and are a major source of neglected disease, particularly in the worlds most resource-limited communities. For most parasitic nematode species, reproductive adults exclusively reside within host animals. Species in the genus Strongyloides have a unique step in their life cycle that features soil-dwelling, non-parasitic adults. Previous studies of the free-living model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have identified temperature as an important factor in ability of free-living nematodes to survive and reproduce in the environment. Our study investigates how the thermosensory behaviors of Strongyloides free-living adults contribute to their survival as well as their role in amplifying the quantity of infective larvae in the soil. We show that Strongyloides free-living adults display broad thermophilic preferences that are highly distinct from those of C. elegans adults. We also present the first evidence that thermotaxis acts as a robust mechanism for maximizing the infectious capacity of Strongyloides species located in tropical climates.","NA","biorxiv",1726697305347

Methods We did a multicenter, partially randomized, platform trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a booster dose of an aerosolized or intramuscular adenovirus type 5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (Ad5-nCoV) in adults, after the national-wide omicron circulating at the end of year 2022 in China. Participants who were willing to receive a COVID-19 booster dose were randomly assigned to receive one of the booster doses. While, those participants who refused to take a booster dose but consented to participate COVID-19 surveillance were included in a control group. Both participants receiving a booster dose or not were monitored for symptomatic COVID-19 during a six-month surveillance period. Results Between May 23, 2023, and August 28, 2023, 4089 eligible participants were equally randomized to receive a booster dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV through oral inhalation at 0.1mL (IH Ad5-nCoV, n=2039) or intramuscular injection of Ad5-nCoV at 0.5 mL (IM Ad5-nCoV, n=2050). While, 2008 participants were enrolled in the blank-control group. A total of 79 COVID-19 cases were confirmed, with 22 (0.006%) in the IH Ad5-nCoV group, 23 (0.007%) in the IM Ad5-nCoV group, and 34 (0.01%) in the control group. Adjusted effectiveness of IH Ad5-nCoV and IM Ad5-nCoV from 14 days after the vaccination were 51.6% (95% CI 9.0 to 74.3) and 38.1% (95% CI -9.6 to 65.1), respectively. Interpretation Significant protection against symptomatic COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant, during the ongoing pandemic of evolving COVID-19 variants, was found to be provided by boosting with the ancestral strain-containing vaccine IH Ad5-nCoV, but not by boosting with IM Ad5-nCoV.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

The importance of the second process, de novo build-up, has not been investigated systematically over a range of species and may be underestimated as a result. To investigate the DNA mutation patterns accompanying the de novo antibiotic resistance acquisition process, six bacterial species encountered in the food chain were exposed to step-wise increasing sublethal concentrations of six antibiotics to develop high levels of resistance. Phenotypic and mutational landscapes were constructed based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) sequencing at two time points of the evolutionary trajectory. In this study, we found: 1) all of the six strains can develop high levels of resistance against most antibiotics. 2) increased resistance is accompanied by different mutations for each bacterium-antibiotic combination. 3) the number of mutations varies widely, with Y. enterocolitica having by far the most. 4) in the case of fluoroquinolone resistance, a mutational pattern of gyrA combined with parC is conserved in five of six species. 5) mutations in genes coding for efflux pumps are widely encountered in gram-negative species. The overall conclusion is that very similar phenotypic outcomes are instigated by very different genetic changes.

IMPORTANCEThe significance of this study lies in the comparison of how six species of distinct genomic background under uniform conditions develop high levels of antibiotic resistance against six antibiotics. The mutational patterns in these six species of bacteria identify common target mutations and reveal how they acquire mutations from various pathways to survive and grow when exposed to sub-lethal levels of antibiotics. In addition to providing insights in microbial genetics, outcome of this study will assist policymakers when formulating practical strategies to prevent development of antimicrobial resistance in human and veterinary health care.","NA","biorxiv",1726697305347

Within communities the social environment may promote individual risk of infection for the school-aged children. There will also be demographic groups who are not targeted or reached by preventive chemotherapy campaigns. The behaviours of these other groups will interact with those of school-aged children, resulting in further infection risk through exposure-related behaviours. Furthermore, the perception of the disease may significantly influence the schoolchildren's lived experience of the infection and associated disease. It is therefore crucial to document the daily experiences of schoolchildren living in schistosomiasis high transmission areas. Methods: An ethnographic study explored schoolchildren's perspectives and daily life organisations that shape their risk of schistosomiasis and their perceptions of the disease. The study was conducted between November 2022 and August 2023 along Lake Albert, Hoima District. it involved in-depth interviews with schoolchildren and their parents, key informant interviews, focus group discussions with schoolchildren, and participant observations. Data was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Code reported were generated inductively using ATLAS.ti (version 7). Results: The study revealed a significant level of knowledge and awareness about schistosomiasis among schoolchildren. They had understanding of the risk factors, continued exposure, and experiences of illness, though they had little autonomy to address these through their own behaviour as they were influenced by the behaviour of others and macro-factors such as WASH provision and economic need. Study participants experienced individual-level effects of schistosomiasis such as educational impacts and isolation as a significant form of stigma. Conclusions: There is a need for continued community sensitisation and awareness campaigns to address social stigma, educational impact, and the contamination and exposure-related behaviours. National and regional policies and programmes on WASH, livelihood and poverty eradication programmes need to be revisited in schistosomiasis high transmission areas to help provide alternatives and improve schoolchildren's lived experiences.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

Many barriers to scholarship have been identified, but there are limited data on which are most important. A rank-order of barriers from learners perspectives would better enable programs to address perceived barriers. Methods: Given that learners are experts in their own perceptions, we applied the Delphi method of generating consensus expert opinion to construct ranked lists of physician-perceived barriers to scholarly activity at various sites. The survey was conducted within three separate health systems. Respondents were asked to identify their perceived barriers via free text and the listed barriers were consolidated by the research team. In the second round, respondents were presented with the consolidated lists and asked to rank them. In the third and final round, each respondent was shown a comparison of their own rankings to that of their peers and given an opportunity to make changes. Ranking differences between programs were compared using Rank Biased Overlap (RBO). Results: The Delphi method is a straightforward method to obtain a ranked list of perceived learner barriers to scholarly activity; its primary limitation is learner engagement and, of note in our study, high dropout rates. RBO is an effective method of ranking differences between programs and specialties. Top barriers across programs included time, overwhelm with the research process, and lack of interest or energy. Discussion: Several of the identified barriers may be addressed with enthusiastic mentors, streamlined administrative processes, and education. This could be done within a hospital system or on a national level through specialty organizations.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

However, there are concerns regarding a potential association between ICP and atrial fibrillation (AF). This study evaluated the incidence of AF onset between ICP and DHA/EPA when used as adjuvant therapy with statins. Methods and Results: This retrospective study utilized administrative healthcare claims to analyze adult AF-naive patients from one year preceding their first prescription for ICP or DHA/EPA. These patients were followed for two years, spanning from2013-2021. AF incidence was assessed during active treatment with either ICP or DHA/EPA as adjunct statin therapy. A propensity score (PS) matched cohort controlled for baseline characteristics and the effect of calendar year on the use of ICP or DHA/EPA. The cumulative incidence of AF was estimated using a product-limit estimator and compared between groups using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. The PS-matched cohort included 17,638 participants with a mean age 56 years, predominantly male (65.7% ICP vs. 64.5% DHA/EPA). Over two years, the cumulative incidence of AF from ICP and DHA/EPA was 5.32% and 3.99% respectively, resulting in a HR of 1.242 (95% CI: 1.061 to 1.455). Conclusions: In adult AF-naive patients, ICP, when compared to DHA/EPA in conjunction with statin therapy, was associated with a significantly higher significant risk of developing AF.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

Rift Valley Fever (RVF), Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) and Brucellosis are circulating in Uganda causing frequent outbreaks, but gaps exist in the understanding of transmission dynamics, community perspectives and effective mitigation strategies of these diseases. With increasing human-livestock-wildlife interaction in Uganda's biodiverse cattle corridor, this study protocol outlines an integrated One Health model to determine the burden of RVF, CCHF and Brucellosis, identify key vectors and reservoirs and assesses the impact of social and policy factors on disease distribution. Methods A series of mixed-methods cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys across six conservation areas experiencing high human-livestock-wildlife interaction spanning Uganda's Cattle Corridor: Queen Elizabeth National Park, Bwindi-Mgahinga Impenetrable Forest, Lake Mburo-Nakivaale, Murchison Falls, Kidepo Valley and Pian Upe Game Reserve. In selected villages household surveys comprise questionnaires, focus-group discussions and in-depth interviews to determine drivers of disease risk with blood-sampling of human population. Questionnaires provide detail on livestock practices and blood-sampling is conducted on cattle, sheep, pigs and goats. Targeted sampling of vectors in these localities including mosquitos, ticks and small mammals using environmental traps and on-host collection. Specimens taken from nearby large wildlife include blood sampling and nasal swabs. Serological testing using indirect ELISA and molecular testing using real-time PCR was conducted to determine disease status of RVF, CCHF and Brucellosis across humans, livestock and wildlife with eco-epi modelling and qualitative analyses used to inform risks and drivers of disease. Results Baseline survey data and blood specimens were obtained from 2894 humans residing in 1602 households across 96 villages in 6 conservation areas of Uganda.

Methods: We conducted an analysis of data from 8,215 U.S. adults aged 20 years and older, utilizing the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2007 to 2018. Based on LE8 scores, Cardiovascular Health (CVH) was stratified into three levels--low, moderate, and high--while AIP was categorized into four risk levels: extremely low (AIP<-0.3), low (-0.3[&le;]AIP<0.1), medium (0.1[&le;]AIP<0.24), and high (AIP[&le;]0.24). Weighted ordinal logistic regression analysis was utilized to examine the association between CVH scores and AIP risk levels, adjusting for potential confounding variables. Results: A significant inverse correlation exists between CVH scores and AIP risk levels (OR=0.51, 95%CI: 0.49-0.54, P<0.001). Higher CVH scores were associated with lower AIP risk levels, while lower CVH scores corresponded to elevated AIP risk levels. Notably, improvements in specific CVH components such as Body Mass Index and Blood Lipids exhibited a strong relationship with reductions in AIP risk levels. Conclusions: Enhancing CVH is vital for effectively reducing AIP risk levels, thus underscoring the critical importance of health management strategies in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

However, most research has focused on high-income countries, leaving a gap in knowledge regarding the relationship between depression and CHF in low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aimed to delineate depressive symptom trajectories and identify potential risk factors for poor outcomes among CHF patients. Methods: Longitudinal data from 783 patients with CHF from public hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan was analyzed. Depressive symptom severity was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Baseline and 6-month follow-up BDI scores were clustered through Gaussian Mixture Modeling to identify distinct depressive symptom subgroups and extract trajectory labels. Further, a random forest algorithm was utilized to determine baseline demographic, clinical, and behavioral predictors for each trajectory. Results: Four depressive symptom trajectories were identified: 'good prognosis,' 'remitting course,' 'clinical worsening,' and 'persistent course.' Risk factors associated with persistent depressive symptoms included lower quality of life and the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3 classification of CHF. Protective factors linked to a good prognosis included less disability and a non-NYHA class 3 classification of CHF. Conclusions: By identifying key characteristics of patients at heightened risk of depression, clinicians can be aware of risk factors and better identify patients who may need greater monitoring and appropriate follow-up care.

Online auditory testing has received interest since the Covid-19 pandemic. A number of web-based developments have improved the range of auditory tasks during remote participation. Most of these studies have been conducted in young, motivated individuals who are comfortable with technology. Such studies have also used stimuli testing auditory perceptual abilities. Research on auditory cognitive abilities in real-world older adults is lacking. In this study, we assess the reproducibility of a range of auditory cognitive abilities in older adults, with a range of hearing abilities, who took part in in-person and online experiments. Participants performed a questionnaire-based assessment and were asked to complete two verbal speech-in-noise perception tasks, for digits and sentences, and two auditory memory tasks, for different sound features. In the first part of the study, 58 Participants performed these tests in-person and online in order to test the reproducibility of the tasks. In the second part, 147 participants conducted all the tasks online in order to test if previously published findings from in-person research were reproducible. We found that older adults under the age of 70 and those with a better hearing were more likely to take part in online testing. The questionnaire-based test had significantly better reproducibility than the behavioural auditory tests but there were no differences in reproducibility between in-person and online auditory cognitive metrics. Relationships between relationships with age and hearing thresholds in an in-person or online setting were not significantly different. Furthermore, important relationships between auditory metrics, evidenced in literature previously, were reproducible online. This study suggests that auditory cognitive testing may be reliably conducted online.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

A Search Prognosis calculator can estimate the likelihood. Objective: To determine if using a search algorithm based on donor search prognosis can result in similar incidence of transplant between patients Very Likely (>90%) vs Very Unlikely (<10%) to have a matched unrelated donor. Design: This interventional trial utilized a Search Prognosis-based biologic assignment algorithm to guide donor selection. Trial enrollment from June 13, 2019-May 13, 2022; analysis of data as of September 7, 2023 with median follow-up post-evaluability of 14.5 months. Settings: National multi-center Blood and Marrow Transplantation Clinical Trials Network 1702 study of US participating transplant centers. Participants: Acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphomas, severe aplastic anemia, and sickle cell disease patients referred to participating transplant centers were invited to participate. 2225 patients were enrolled and 1751 were declared evaluable for this study. Patients were declared evaluable once it was determined no suitable HLA-matched related donor was available. Intervention: Patients assigned to the Very Likely arm were to proceed with matched unrelated donor, while Very Unlikely were to utilize alternative donors. A third stratum, Less Likely (~25%) to find a matched unrelated donor, were observed under standard center practices, but were not part of the primary objective. Main Outcome: Cumulative incidence of transplantation by Search Prognosis arm Results: Evaluable patients included 1751 of which 413 (24%) were from racial/ethnic minorities. Search prognosis was 958 (55%) Very Likely, 517 (30%) Less Likely and 276 (16%) Very Unlikely. 1171 (67%) received HCT, 384 (22%) died without HCT, and 196 (11%) remained alive without HCT. Among the 1,234 patients, the adjusted cumulative incidence (95% CI) of HCT at 6-months was 59.8% (56.7-62.8) in the Very Likely group versus 52.3% (46.1-58.5) in the Very Unlikely (P=0.113). Conclusions: A prospective Search Prognosis-based algorithm can be effectively implemented in a national multicenter clinical trial.

This approach confuses the identification of the real efficacy of the studied treatment. To solve this problem, CONSORT guidelines recommend using confidence intervals, which offer a more complete view of possible effects. However, authors' conclusions often remain based on a binary approach, confusing the absence of evidence with the evidence of absence. This error can influence clinical practice and future research, leading to the identification of 'negative' treatments based on 'statistical insignificance', which reflects a lack of evidence of absence, not the absence of evidence. Objectives To assess the prevalence of misinterpretation of non-statistically significant results, both in the abstract and in the article, in a sample of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with non-statistically significant primary outcomes published in 5 rehabilitation journals with the highest impact factor (IF) published between 2019 and 2023 and to assess whether the primary outcome result is reported according to CONSORT guidelines. Methods We will conduct a cross-sectional analysis of all Rcts with non-statistically significant primary outcomes in 5 general rehabilitation journals with the highest IF published between 2019 and 2023. We will determine the prevalence of trials in which non-significance is interpreted as absence of evidence, evidence of absence, or advice to use the intervention in clinical practice in the abstract and article conclusions, and the prevalence of trials that adhered to CONSORT guidelines for reporting the primary outcome.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

Lesions damaging these neural pathways result in weakness of key muscles causing dysarthria and dysphagia, leading to profound social isolation and risk of aspiration and suffocation. Here we show that Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the motor thalamus improved speech and swallowing functions in two participants with dysarthria and dysphagia. First, we proved that DBS increased excitation of the face motor cortex, augmenting motor evoked potentials, and range and speed of motion of orofacial articulators in n=10 volunteers with intact neural pathways. Then, we demonstrated that this potentiation led to immediate improvement in swallowing functions in a patient with moderate dysphagia and profound dysarthria as a consequence of a traumatic brain lesion. In this subject and in another with mild dysarthria, we showed that DBS immediately ameliorated impairments of respiratory, phonatory, resonatory, and articulatory control thus resulting in a clinically significant improvement in speech intelligibility. Our data provide first-in-human evidence that DBS can be used to treat dysphagia and dysarthria in people with cerebral lesions.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

The coding of transcripts is a critical step for information extraction and preliminary analysis. However, manual coding is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), supported by Large Language Models (LLMs), presents new opportunities to understand human languages, which may significantly facilitate the coding process. This study aims to build a computational coding framework that uses GenAI to automatically detect and extract themes from in-depth interview transcripts. Methods: We conducted an experiment using transcripts of in-depth interviews with maternity care providers in South Carolina. We leveraged ChatGPT to perform two tasks automatically: (1) deductive coding, which involves applying a predefined set of codes to dialogues; and (2) inductive coding, which can generate codes from dialogues without any preconceptions or assumptions. We fine-tuned ChatGPT to understand the content of the interview transcripts, enabling it to detect and summarize codes. We then evaluated the performance of the proposed approach by comparing the codes generated by ChatGPT with those generated manually by human coders, involving human-in-the-loop evaluation. Results: The results demonstrated the potential of GenAI in detecting and summarizing codes from in-depth interview transcripts. ChatGPT could be utilized for both deductive and inductive coding processes. The overall accuracy of GenAI is higher than 80% and the codes it generated showed high positive associations with those generated manually. More impressively, GenAI reduced the time required for coding by 81%, demonstrating its efficiency compared to traditional methods. Discussion: GenAI models like ChatGPT show high generalizability, scalability and efficiency in handling large datasets, and are proficient in multi-level semantic structure identification. They demonstrate promising results in qualitative coding, making it a valuable tool for supporting people in public health research. However, challenges such as inaccuracy, systematic biases, and privacy concerns must be addressed when using them in practice. GenAI-based coding results should be handled with caution and reviewed by human coders to ensure accuracy and reliability.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

Objectives: 1) To comprehensively examine gut microbiome and metabolome changes after laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) in adolescents and 2) to assess whether the microbiome/metabolome changes observed with VSG influence phenotype using germ-free murine models. Design: 1) A longitudinal observational study in adolescents undergoing VSG with serial stool samples undergoing shotgun metagenomic microbiome sequencing and metabolomics (polar metabolites, bile acids and short chain fatty acids) and 2) a human-to-mouse fecal transplant study. Results: We show adolescents exhibit significant gut microbiome and metabolome shifts several months after VSG, with increased alpha diversity and notably with enrichment of oral-associated taxa. To assess causality of the microbiome/metabolome changes in phenotype, pre-VSG and post-VSG stool was transplanted into germ-free mice. Post-VSG stool was not associated with any beneficial outcomes such as adiposity reduction compared pre-VSG stool. However, post-VSG stool exhibited an inflammatory phenotype with increased intestinal Th17 and decreased regulatory T cells. Concomitantly, we found elevated fecal calprotectin and an enrichment of proinflammatory pathways in a subset of adolescents post-VSG. Conclusion: We show that in some adolescents, microbiome changes post-VSG may have inflammatory potential, which may be of importance considering the increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease post-VSG.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

The resulting optimized protocol uses the kit-provided reagents and lateral flow assay (LFA) while replacing the kit's pharyngeal swab with the CandyCollect device, reducing the elution solution volume, and substituting the tube used for elution to accommodate the CandyCollect device. Positive test results were detected by eye with bacterial concentrations as low as the manufacturer's ''minimal detection limit'' - 1.5x105 CFU/mL. LFA strips were also scanned and quantified with image analysis software to determine the signal-to-baseline ratio (SBR) and categorize positive test results without human bias.

Current evaluations have primarily focused on the financial and temporal aspects of litigation, leaving a gap in understanding the experiences of plaintiffs within the adversarial system. This study aims to fill this gap by critically exploring the experiences of those affected by medical negligence and the ensuing legal process. Methods A qualitative descriptive approach was employed to explore the experiences of plaintiffs following patient safety incidents and their interactions with the legal process. Semi-structured, open-ended interviews were conducted with participants who had been involved in medical negligence litigation in Ireland. Participants were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 18 years or over and were involved in medical negligence litigation in Ireland (as a plaintiff), whether the case was resolved by negotiated settlement, a form of alternative dispute resolution (e.g. mediation), or trial hearing. Maximum variation sampling was used to capture a diverse range of experiences, with sample size determined by the concept of information power. Recruitment was facilitated by the Health Service Executive (HSE) through invitations sent by The National Open Disclosure Office. Interviews were conducted in-person or online, recorded, transcribed, and analysed thematically. Ethical approval was obtained from the Social Research Ethics Committee of University College Cork. Findings This research presents the views and experiences of fifteen participants; eleven participants shared their experiences relating to an adverse event which impacted a family member (one participant spoke about two family members), nine of whom were children (including both minors and adult children), and three were a spouse. Of the twelve individuals discussed, eight were deceased. Five main themes were identified from the analysis: i) Navigating the aftermath of a patient safety event: Communication, Support and Abandonment; ii) The pathway from adverse event to litigation; iii) Experiences of the Legal System; iv) Emotional and Mental Health Impact of Litigation on Plaintiffs; v) Advocating for Change: Participant Recommendations. Discussion This research highlights the profound impact of actions taken after a patient safety event on patients, families, healthcare professionals, and organisations, and the importance of Open Disclosure in meeting ethical obligations and ensuring healthcare accountability. It explores the complex relationships between financial compensation, justice-seeking, and the healthcare and legal systems. The findings contribute significant insights to the discourse on medical negligence in Ireland.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

This has important implications for early cognitive deficits as these nuclei are sources of ascending neuromodulators (i.e., dopamine and noradrenaline) that support various cognitive functions like learning, memory, and executive function. However, because most studies of the relationship between patterns of degeneration and cognition have either studied these neuromodulator systems in isolation or studied specific cognitive domains in isolation, it is unknown if degeneration in the substantia nigra and degeneration in the locus coeruleus independently and selectively contribute to different cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease. To address this gap, we tested people with Parkinson's disease and older adults on tasks of positive reinforcement learning, attention/working memory, executive function, and memory to measure performance in domains of cognition specifically thought to be related to dopaminergic and noradrenergic function. Participants also underwent neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging which provides a measure of degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. Brain-behaviour relationships were evaluated by separate linear regressions predicting cognitive performance in each domain from substantia nigra and locus coeruleus neuromelanin signal intensities controlling for age, sex, and education. As expected, Parkinson's disease patients had significantly slower learning from positive feedback and lower performance on tests of attention/working memory, executive function, and memory than controls. Parkinson's patients also had lower neuromelanin signal intensity in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. Examining brain-behaviour relationships, we found that reduced neuromelanin signal in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease patients was independently associated with impaired positive reinforcement learning, controlling for changes in the locus coeruleus, but was not associated with other domains of cognition. In contrast, reduced neuromelanin signal in the locus coeruleus was independently associated with impairments in attention/working memory and executive function, controlling for changes in the substantia nigra, but not with reinforcement learning performance. These results show that substantia nigra degeneration and locus coeruleus degeneration independently and selectively contribute to cognitive deficits and therefore suggests that individual differences in the degree of neurodegeneration in these nuclei could explain the significant heterogeneity that exists in the cognitive and behavioural manifestations of Parkinson's disease. These findings also highlight the potential value of leveraging known brain-behaviour relationships to develop performance-based measures of cognition that reflect underlying patterns of neurodegeneration.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods.

The frequency and pace of these major genome structural changes are unknown, and it remains unclear whether or how they impact long-term genome evolution. Here, we compare whole chromosomal sequences of 3,631 genomes from 2,291 species spanning all major animal clades and show that animal karyotypes evolve primarily via karyotype contraction, associated with increased rates of chromosomal fusion-with-mixing and dispersion that largely obey chromosomal algebra1, or karyotype expansion, which breaks up ancestral linkage groups and forms new chromosomal elements via non-algebraic changes. We show that chromosomal changes can be associated with major extinction events. Using a multi-scale encoding of pan-animal genome homology and a manifold representation of genomic changes, we find that genome evolution is not only driven by changes at the chromosomal level, but that subchromosomal mixing and irreversibility define clade-specific evolution. Using this  evolutionary genome topology approach, we calculate extrema of irreversible genomic configurations and identify species that occupy intermediate manifold positions, providing evidence for distinct macro-evolutionary trajectories. We propose that investigation of mixed state accumulation around important gene loci (such as Hox) will be crucial in capturing and further study of clade-specific regulatory innovations.","NA","biorxiv",1726697305347

The unique insights from a genome-level perspective have revealed a striking pattern of conserved macrosynteny within chromosomes across huge evolutionary distances in animals, yet progress in many lineages has been hampered by the absence of genome-level data. Here, we show that the tectonics of genome evolution in clitellates, a clade composed of most freshwater and all terrestrial species of the phylum Annelida, is characterised by extensive genome-wide scrambling that resulted in a massive loss of macrosynteny between marine annelids and clitellates, to the point that ancient bilaterian linkage groups (ie, groups of genes inherited as a block in most bilaterian phyla) are fully disrupted. These massive rearrangements included the formation of putative neocentromeres with newly-acquired transposable elements, and preceded a further period of genome-wide reshaping events including whole-genome duplications and massive macrosyntenic reshuffling between clitellate lineages, potentially triggered by the loss of genes involved in genome stability or homeostasis of cell division. Notably, while these rearrangements broke short-range interactions observed between genes in marine annelids (including Hox), they were reformed as long-range interactions in clitellates. These genomic rearrangements gave rise to new genetic elements that may have facilitated the adaptation to freshwater and terrestrial environments in clitellates. Our findings provide evidence of a massive genomic reshaping through genome-wide chromosome scrambling in clitellates consistent with the punctuated equilibrium model, which sharply contrasts with the highly conserved chromosomal architecture observed in most animal taxa. Our study thus suggests that the genomic landscape of this animal lineage resulted from a rare burst of genomic changes that ended a long period of stability that persists across large evolutionary distances.","NA","biorxiv",1726697305347

In line with the age-related neural dedifferentiation hypothesis, we predicted that middle-aged adults show less distinct cortical representations of phonemes and acoustic-phonetic features relative to younger adults. In addition to an extensive audiological, auditory electrophysiological, and speech perceptual test battery, we measured electroencephalographic responses time-locked to phoneme instances (phoneme-related potential; PRP) in naturalistic, continuous speech and trained neural network classifiers to predict phonemes from these responses. Consistent with age-related neural dedifferentiation, phoneme predictions were less accurate, more uncertain, and involved a broader network for middle-aged adults compared with younger adults. Representational similarity analysis revealed that the featural relationship between phonemes was less robust in middle-age. Electrophysiological and behavioral measures revealed signatures of cochlear neural degeneration (CND) and speech perceptual deficits in middle-aged adults relative to younger adults. Consistent with prior work in animal models, signatures of CND were associated with greater cortical dedifferentiation, explaining nearly a third of the variance in PRP prediction accuracy together with measures of acoustic neural processing. Notably, even after controlling for CND signatures and acoustic processing abilities, age-group differences in PRP prediction accuracy remained. Overall, our results reveal ""fuzzier"" phonemic representations, suggesting that age-related cortical neural dedifferentiation can occur even in middle-age and may underlie speech perceptual challenges, despite a normal audiogram.","NA","biorxiv",1726697305347

We aimed to examine if a diverse set of biomarkers in the REHAB-HF trial would predict improvement in physical function following a 12-week tailored physical therapy rehabilitation intervention compared to attention control. Methods: The study population consisted of participants [&ge;]60 years of age who were hospitalized with acute HF and randomized to a subsequent multidomain outpatient physical rehabilitation intervention vs. attention control with outcomes of 12-week functional change including the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and six-minute walk distance (6MWD). Blood was collected prior to randomization and at 12-weeks for cardiac, renal, and inflammatory biomarkers. Linear trends across progressively higher biomarker values versus improvement in functional outcomes based on treatment assignment were evaluated. Classification and regression trees (CART) were created to estimate optimal biomarker levels associated with differential improvement in the two functional outcomes. Results: A total of 242 of 349 participants (69%) had baseline biomarkers measured. In an adjusted regression model, higher baseline cardiac troponin (cTn) I and T were associated with greater gains in SPPB and 6MWD respectively with the rehabilitation intervention (P=0.04 and 0.03 for interaction) versus attention control. In the CART analysis of the physical rehabilitation and attention control participants, those with baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) [&ge;]9.9 mg/L and hs-cTnT [&ge;]36 ng/L receiving the rehabilitation intervention had a 129 m (95% CI 78-180m) greater 12-week 6MWD increase vs attention control. In contrast, for participants with CRP<9.9 mg/L there was no significant incremental 6MWD difference (30m, 95% CI -0.5m, 60.2m). For SPPB, a CRP [&ge;]9.9 mg/L and creatinine [&ge;]1.4 mg/dL optimally identified a differential improvement with the rehabilitation intervention versus attention control. The biomarkers (except for creatinine) decreased by 12 weeks post hospitalization but with no differences based on treatment assignment. Conclusion: Higher baseline levels of biomarkers of inflammation, cardiac injury, and renal dysfunction identified older adults after a HF hospitalization with the greatest differential improvement in physical function with a rehabilitation intervention. Biomarkers may help clinicians predict the benefits of this treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

In this updated systematic review, we evaluate new evidence since our 2019 systematic review on the effect of outdoor air pollution exposure on childhood and adolescent brain structure and function as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

MethodsUsing PubMed and Web of Science, we conducted an updated literature search and systematic review of articles published through March 2024, using key terms for air pollution and functional and/or structural MRI. Two raters independently screened all articles using Covidence and implemented the risk of bias instrument for systematic reviews informing the World Health Organization Global Air Quality Guidelines.

ResultsWe identified 222 relevant papers, and 14 new studies met our inclusion criteria. Including six studies from our 2019 review, the 20 publications to date include study populations from the United States, Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom. Studies investigated exposure periods spanning pregnancy through early adolescence, and estimated air pollutant exposure levels via personal monitoring, geospatial residential estimates, or school courtyard monitors. Brain MRI occurred when children were on average 6-14.7 years old; however, one study assessed newborns. Several MRI modalities were leveraged, including structural morphology, diffusion tensor imaging, restriction spectrum imaging, arterial spin labeling, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as resting-state and task-based functional MRI. Air pollutants were associated with widespread brain differences, although the magnitude and direction of findings are largely inconsistent, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions.

ConclusionPrenatal and childhood exposure to outdoor air pollution is associated with structural and functional brain variations. Compared to our initial 2019 review, publications doubled--an increase that testifies to the importance of this public health issue. Further research is needed to clarify the effects of developmental timing, along with the downstream implications of outdoor air pollution exposure on childrens cognitive and mental health.

Pathogen exposure led to an array of architectural changes including faster nest growth, increased spacing between entrances, transmission-inhibitory changes in overall nest network topology, and reduced chamber centrality.

This study aimed to estimate the extent to which genetic pathways that are direct (via child genotype) and indirect (e.g., via parental phenotype) explain the well-established association between parent and child emotional problems. We leveraged data from seven European cohort studies with a combined population of Ntrios=15,475. Polygenic scores were calculated for parental and offspring neuroticism, as it represents a dispositional trait underlying emotional problems. Emotional problems in offspring were measured using validated scales across various developmental stages from early childhood to adulthood. We used neuroticism polygenic scores within a structural equation modelling framework to distinguish between direct genetic pathways from parental genotype to offspring outcome (acting through offspring genotype), and indirect genetic pathways (acting through parental phenotype and associated environment). Standard errors for direct genetic, indirect genetic and total effects were bootstrapped and meta-analyses pooled effect estimates at three developmental stages (childhood: 3-4 years, adolescence: 11-13 years, adulthood: 18+ years). We found evidence suggesting an indirect genetic pathway between mothers and child emotional problems during early childhood (pooled estimate, mean difference in standardised child emotional problems score per 1SD increase in maternal PGS for neuroticism=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07). This association attenuated over child development, while direct genetic pathways strengthened. High attrition rates, measurement error and low variance explained by polygenic scores may have altered precision of the estimates, influencing the interpretation of the results. However, we provide the first multi-cohort study to provide evidence for an indirect genetic pathway from maternal neuroticism to early child emotional problems. This suggests that there are likely processes other than direct genetic pathways involved in the intergenerational transmission of emotional problems, highlighting the importance of timely support to prevent and reduce emotional issues in mothers as a preventative strategy for emotional difficulties.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1726697305347

PINK1 is activated upon mitochondrial damage to phosphorylate Ubiquitin and Parkin to trigger removal of damaged mitochondria by autophagy (mitophagy). PINK1 also indirectly phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases including Rab8A. We have performed an siRNA screen targeting all human Ser/Thr kinases in HeLa cells and discovered that knockdown of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 1 (EIF2AK1), also known as heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase, a branch of the integrated stress response (ISR), selectively enhances mitochondrial depolarization-induced stabilization of PINK1 and increased phosphorylation of ubiquitin and Rab8A. We confirm our findings in multiple human cell lines, including SK-OV-3, U2OS and ARPE-19 cells. Knockdown of the upstream mitochondrial-cytosol relay component, DELE1, enhanced PINK1 stabilisation and activation similar to EIF2AK1 knockdown. Strikingly, we demonstrate that the small molecule ISR inhibitor, ISRIB, also enhances PINK1 activation and signaling under conditions of mitochondrial damage. Using the mito-QC mitophagy reporter in human cells, we observe that EIF2AK1 knockdown or ISRIB treatment significantly enhances PINK1-dependent mitophagy but does not alter deferiprone-induced mitophagy. Our findings indicate that the DELE1-EIF2AK1 ISR signaling relay is a negative regulator of PINK1-dependent mitophagy and suggest that inhibitors of DELE1-EIF2AK1 and/or ISRIB analogues could have therapeutic benefits in PD and related disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1726697305347

The aging ovary assumes a fibro-inflammatory milieu which negatively impacts gamete quantity and quality as well as ovulation. Here we tested whether the systemic delivery of anti-inflammatory (Etanercept) or anti-fibrotic (Pirfenidone) drugs attenuates ovarian aging in mice. We first evaluated the ability of these drugs to decrease the expression of fibro-inflammatory genes in primary ovarian stromal cells. Whereas Etanercept did not block Tnf expression in ovarian stromal cells, Pirfenidone significantly reduced Col1a1 expression. We then tested Pirfenidone in vivo where the drug was delivered systemically via mini-osmotic pumps for 6-weeks. Pirfenidone mitigated the age-dependent increase in ovarian fibrosis without impacting overall health parameters. Ovarian function was improved in Pirfenidone-treated mice as evidenced by increased follicle and corpora lutea number, AMH levels, and improved estrous cyclicity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Pirfenidone treatment resulted in an upregulation of reproductive function-related genes at 8.5 months and a downregulation of inflammatory genes at 12 months of age. These findings demonstrate that reducing the fibroinflammatory ovarian microenvironment improves ovarian function, thereby supporting modulating the ovarian environment as a therapeutic avenue to extend reproductive longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1726697305347

These fatty acids (FFAs) enhanced cytokine-mediated apoptosis in cultured insulin-producing cells by downregulating the production of nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) via its salvage pathway, as well as deregulated central carbon metabolism and impaired levels of ATP.

DesignRetrospective cross-sectional study.

Participants5,351 patients (9,564 eyes) who underwent macular OCT imaging and Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) tests (24-2 or 10-2 test patterns) at a university hospital from 2006 to 2023. The dataset included 47,653 paired OCT-VF data points, including various ocular conditions.

MethodsWe trained a segmentation-free 3DCNN model based on the EfficientNet3D-b0 architecture on a comprehensive OCT dataset to estimate VF. We evaluated the models performance using Pearsons correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. We assessed residual variability using a jackknife resampling approach and compared OCT-VF and HFA datasets using generalized estimating equations (GEE), adjusting the number of VF tests, follow-up duration, age, and clustering by eye and patient.

Main Outcome MeasuresCorrelations between estimated and measured VF thresholds and mean deviations (MDs), and residual variability of OCT-VF and HFA.

ResultsWe observed strong correlations between the estimated and measured VF parameters (Pearsons r: 24-2 thresholds 0.893, MD 0.932; 10-2 thresholds 0.902, MD 0.945; all p < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between the estimated and measured MD, with a slight proportional bias. GEE analysis demonstrated significantly lower residual variability for OCT-VF than for HFA (24-2 thresholds: 1.10 vs. 2.48 dB; 10-2 thresholds: 1.20 vs. 2.48 dB; all p < 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected), with lower variability across all test points, severities, and ages, thus highlighting the robustness of the segmentation-free 3DCNN approach in a heterogeneous clinical sample.

ConclusionsA segmentation-free 3DCNN model objectively estimated VF from OCT images with high accuracy and significantly lower residual variability than subjective HFA measurements in a heterogeneous clinical sample, including patients with glaucoma and individuals with other ocular diseases. The improved reliability, lower variability, and objective nature of OCT-VF highlight its value for enhancing VF assessment and monitoring of various ocular conditions, potentially facilitating earlier detection of progression and more efficient disease management.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305347

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of COVID-19 articles that had corrections made and reported in the NYT ""corrections page"". We categorized authors in a NYT COVID-19 article as a NYT reporter, NYT other, or independent author. We calculated the number and type of corrections by author type (NYT reporter, NYT other, and independent author) and number and percentage of corrections indicating an over- or under-statement of the COVID-19 situation.

ResultsThere were 576 total corrections for the included 486 articles. Forty-three percent (n=245) corrections specifically pertained to COVID-19. Compared to corrections not pertaining to COVID-19, corrections pertaining to COVID-19 were less likely to be about spelling (0% vs 23.6%), locations (1.2% vs 16.3%), or title/degree (0% vs 10.6%), and more likely to be about a vaccine/vaccination (21.2% vs 0.3%), incidence/cases of conditions (12.2% vs 0.3%), or disease testing (7.8% vs 0.3%; p<0.001).

Compared to corrections not pertaining to COVID-19, corrections pertaining to COVID-19 were less likely to result in an equivocal tone (16.7% vs 88.8%), but they were more likely to both overstate (54.7% vs 8.5%) and understate (23.7% vs 2.4%) the situation in the original text (p<0.001). Ten reporters (of 346) accounted for 24% of the corrections. The reporter with the single most corrections accounted for 7% of the corrections.

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1726697305347

Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305348

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1726697305348

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1726697305348
