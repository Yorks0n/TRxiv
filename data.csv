ObjectiveAssess the duration and severity of autonomic dysfunction in adults with Long COVID and evaluate its impact on function and quality of life.

DesignA follow-up survey of a subset of participants from a cross-sectional online survey of adults with Long COVID. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction.

Participants526 adults (ages 20-65) with a history of Long COVID

Main measuresThe Composite Autonomic Symptom 31 (COMPASS-31) score, the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, the prevalence of new postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and predictors of autonomic dysfunction, including POTS

Key results71.9% of Long COVID patients had a COMPASS-31 score >20, suggestive of moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction. The median symptom duration was 36 [30-40] months, reaching up to 3.5 years after SARS-CoV-2 infection. 37.5% of Long COVID patients could no longer work or had to drop out of school due to their Long COVID illness. 40.5% were newly diagnosed with POTS following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ConclusionsEvidence of persistent moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction was seen in 71.9% of Long COVID patients in our study, with a 36-month median symptom duration, suggesting that enduring autonomic dysfunction is highly prevalent in the Long COVID population. Moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction was significantly correlated with impaired function and capacity, highlighting the need to address POTS and other manifestations of autonomic dysfunction as a key component of Long COVID management.","NA","medrxiv",1729634990535

Owing to its use of the StripedHyena architecture, LoRNASH handles extremely long sequence inputs (~65 kilobase pairs), allowing for quantitative, zero-shot prediction of all aspects of transcriptome architecture, including isoform abundance, isoform structure, and the impact of DNA sequence variants on transcript structure and abundance. We anticipate that our public data release and proof-of-concept model will accelerate varying aspects of RNA biotechnology. More broadly, we envision the use of LoRNASH as a foundation for fine-tuning of any transcriptome-related downstream prediction task, including cell-type specific gene expression, splicing, and general RNA processing.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Chromatin in the cell varies greatly, from euchromatin to heterochromatin, in its genome functions. It is important to understand how heterochromatin is physically different from euchromatin. However, their specific labeling methods in living cells are limited. To address this, we have developed replication-dependent histone labeling (Repli-Histo labeling) to label nucleosomes in euchromatin and heterochromatin based on DNA replication timing. We investigated local nucleosome motion in the four chromatin classes from euchromatin to heterochromatin of living human and mouse cells. We found that more euchromatic regions (earlier replicated regions) show greater nucleosome motion. Notably, the motion profile in each chromatin class persists throughout interphase. Genome chromatin is essentially replicated from regions with greater nucleosome motions, even though the replication timing program is perturbed. Our findings, combined with computational modeling, suggest that earlier replicated regions have more accessibility and local chromatin motion can be a major determinant of genome-wide replication timing.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

We show that uniaxial compression induces clonal multicellularity in haloarchaea, forming tissue-like structures. These archaeal tissues are mechanically and molecularly distinct from their unicellular lifestyle, mimicking several eukaryotic features. Notably, archaeal tissues undergo a coenocytic stage followed by a tubulin-independent cellularization, orchestrated by active membrane tension at a critical cell size. Past cellularization, tissues are organized into two cell types - apical and basal scutoids - with junction elasticity akin to animal tissues, with actin and protein glycosylation as fiducial polarity markers.

Our understanding of their function is informed by the study of ciliopathies, hereditary diseases linked to cilia dysfunction. These disorders present a wide array of symptoms, highlighting the tissue-specific roles of cilia. However, cell-state and cell-type specific functions remain poorly understood due to limited tools for analyzing individual ciliary protein composition. Here, we utilize antibody-based spatial proteomics to expand the Human Protein Atlas with a dedicated section for primary cilia. We identify the subciliary locations of 654 proteins across three cell lines, analyzing 218,412 individual cilia. Our findings reveal that 67% of the ciliary proteins are cell-type specific and that 78% of ciliary proteins show heterogeneous localization patterns within cell populations, suggesting that the functional tuning of individual cilia is substantially driven by protein trafficking rather than gene expression. Our atlas portrays the cilium as a dynamic sensory organelle, suggesting that individual cells can fine-tune their ciliary structure - both in terms of receptors and signaling components - to sense and integrate diverse signals, computing a response to relay to the cell body. We identify 71 novel cilia proteins, establish CFAP300 as a specific and broad marker for cilia, and suggest multiple potential ciliopathy genes including CREB3, where we show that a coding genetic variant can be linked to blindness and skeletal abnormalities. In summary, our spatially resolved cilia atlas paves new avenues for basic and clinical research on cilia and ciliopathies.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

However, any suppressive intervention will inevitably exert an evolutionary pressure for resistance. Here, we present a pipeline for the accelerated discovery, engineering, and testing of both natural and drive-induced variants that could reverse gene drive spread. We applied our method to stress-test a highly effective gene drive that has evaded resistance in all laboratory-contained releases to date, known as Ag(QFS)1. We showed that previously undetected resistant alleles can arise at low frequency, and discovered novel, partially resistant alleles that can perturb drive-invasion dynamics. We then engineered next-generation gene drives that can actively remove resistant alleles by targeting several highly conserved and non-overlapping sites in the female-specific exon of the doublesex gene. Our models predict that such gene drive designs could suppress large, natural populations of the malaria mosquito in the field.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Additionally, there is growing interest in animal social traditions, which appear crucial for social interaction and group cohesion. We have previously documented such a tradition, in which chimpanzees copied inserting blades of grass in their ears from one persistent inventor4. Now, over a decade later, we have observed an unrelated group of chimpanzees where 5/8 individuals began wearing grass in their ears and 6/8 from their rectums. As of 2024, one newly introduced chimpanzee has adopted the grass-in-ear behavior. Given that the behaviors were not observed in seven other groups in the same sanctuary (N=148), we conclude that social learning of arbitrary behavior occurred and discuss our findings considering the larger scope of animal culture.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

These cellular interactions can be considered to be representative of evolutionary steps in plastid acquisition in eukaryotes, but the underlying cellular mechanisms and dynamics are not fully understood. Here, we studied a kleptoplastidic dinoflagellate (RSD: Ross Sea Dinoflagellate), which is known to steal plastids of the microalga Phaeocystis antarctica. We tracked the morphology and activity of stolen plastids over several months by combining multimodal subcellular imaging and photophysiology. Upon integration inside a host vacuole, the volume of plastids and pyrenoids significantly increased and photosynthetic activity was boosted along with carbon fixation and transfer to the host. This may be supported by the retention of a 50-fold larger algal nucleus for ~1 week. Once the algal nucleus was lost, there was a decrease in plastid volume and photosynthesis, but plastids were still beneficial for the host after > 2 months. Unlike other kleptoplastidic interactions, we showed that the algal mitochondrion was also stolen and retained for several months, transforming into an extensive network in close proximity with plastids. This highlights a new strategy in plankton along the continuum of plastid symbioses where both the energy-producing plastid and mitochondrion of a microalga are hijacked for several months by a host. This symbiosis that we found to be widely-distributed in polar regions suggests that plastid-mitochondrion interaction may have played a role in the evolution of plastid acquisition.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

We go on to show that polygenic variation can contribute to expressivity within a single family with a shared large-effect causal variant, and that common and rare variation converge on a shared set of genes implicated in telomere maintenance. By elucidating the role of common genetic variation in rare disease expressivity in TBDs, these results provide a framework for understanding phenotypic variability in other presumed monogenic disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1729634990535

Better-preserved gray matter, especially in the striatum, correlated with consciousness improvement.

Stimulation was most effective when electric fields extended into parafascicular and subparafascicular nuclei--ventral to the centromedian nucleus, near the midbrain-- and when it engaged projection pathways of the ascending arousal network, including the hypothalamus, brainstem, and frontal lobe. Moreover, effective DBS sites were connected to networks similar to those underlying impaired consciousness due to generalized absence seizures and acquired lesions.

In this study, we used SARS-CoV-2 as a model system to explore whether the intrahost diversity of viral infections could provide clues on the relative fitness of single amino acid variants (SAVs). To do so, we analysed ~15 million complete genomes and nearly ~8000 sequencing libraries generated from SARS-CoV-2 infections, which were collected at various timepoints during the COVID-19 pandemic. Across timepoints, we found that many successful SAVs were detected in the intrahost diversity of samples collected prior, with a median of 6-40 months between the initial collection dates of samples and the highest frequency seen for these SAVs. Additionally, we found that the co-occurrence of intrahost SAVs significantly captures genetic linkage patterns observed at the interhost level (Pearson's r=0.28-0.45, all p<0.0001). Further, we show that machine learning models can learn highly generalisable intrahost, physiochemical and phenotypic patterns to forecast the future fitness of intrahost SAVs (r2=0.48-0.63). Most of these models performed significantly better when considering genetic linkage (r2=0.53-0.68).

Here, we tested this proposal based on the viewing and recall of a narrative movie, which we assessed through fMRI, deep learning-based gaze prediction, and language modeling of spoken recall. In line with key predictions, gaze behavior adhered to the same principles as neural activity; it was event-specific, robust across individuals, and generalized across viewing and recall. Additionally, gaze-dependent brain activity overlapped substantially across tasks. Collectively, these results suggest that retrieval engages mechanisms that direct our eyes during natural vision, reflecting common constraints within the functional organization of the nervous system. Moreover, they highlight the importance of considering behavioral and neural reinstatement together in our understanding of remembering.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

We lack global and temporally continuous coverage on tree mortality data. Ground-based observations on tree mortality, e.g., derived from national inventories, are very sparse, not standardized and not spatially explicit. Earth observation data, combined with supervised machine learning, offer a promising approach to map tree mortality over time. However, global-scale machine learning requires broad training data covering a wide range of environmental settings and forest types. Drones provide a cost-effective source of training data by capturing high-resolution orthophotos of tree mortality events at sub-centimeter resolution.

This community-sourced and rigorously curated dataset shall serve as a foundation for a global initiative to gather comprehensive reference data. In concert with Earth observation data and machine learning it will serve to uncover tree mortality patterns from local to global scales. This will provide the foundation to attribute tree mortality patterns to environmental changes or project tree mortality dynamics to the future. Thus, the open and interactive nature of deadtrees.earth together with the collective effort of the community is meant to continuously increase our capacity to uncover and understand tree mortality patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Crossovers are typically constrained to 1-3 events per chromosome pair, and their distribution is shaped by chromatin accessibility and DNA polymorphisms. Genome-wide crossover maps can be generated in plants by high-throughput short-read sequencing or linked-read sequencing. Here, we use long-read nanopore sequencing technology to develop a crossover mapping pipeline, COmapper, for high-resolution mapping of genome-wide crossovers from pooled DNA of F1 hybrid pollen and F2 recombinant seedlings derived from a cross between Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col and Ler. We validate the high accuracy of COmapper by applying nanopore long-read sequencing to pooled DNA of Arabidopsis F2 individuals with crossovers mapped by short-read sequencing. Using the COmapper, we constructed high-resolution genomic maps of crossovers using F1 hybrid pollen and F2 seedlings in wild type and crossover-elevated recq4a recq4b mutant, showing results comparable to short-read sequencing. Crossovers were enriched at gene-proximal promoters in wild type and increased but reshaped by high polymorphism density in recq4a recq4b. We propose that COmapper will be widely applicable for exploring the effects of genetic, epigenetic and environmental changes on the crossover patterns across diverse plant species.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

However, there is a lack of reliable large-scale predictive frameworks to quantify how much genetic diversity has already been lost, let alone to quantitatively predict future losses under different conservation scenarios in the 21st century. Combining spatio-temporal population genetic theory with population genomic data of 18 plant and animal species, we studied the dynamics of genetic diversity after habitat area losses. We show genetic diversity reacts slowly to habitat area and population declines, but lagged losses will continue for many decades even after habitats are fully protected. To understand the magnitude of this problem, we combined our predictive method with species' habitat area and population monitoring reported in the Living Planet Index, the Red List, and new GBF indicators. We then project genetic diversity loss in 13,808 species with a short-term genetic diversity loss of 13-22% and long-term loss of 42-48% with substantial deviations depending on the level of habitat fragmentation. These results highlight that protection of only current habitats is insufficient to ensure the genetic health of species and that continuous genetic monitoring alone likely underestimates long term impacts. We provide an area-based spatio-temporal predictive framework to develop quantitative scenarios of global genetic biodiversity.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

PRMT5 is a type II protein arginine methyltransferase that regulates several tumorigenic events in many cancer types. However, the regulation of PRMT5 and its direct implication on aberrant alternative splicing under hypoxia remains unexplored. In this study, we observed hypoxia induced upregulation of PRMT5 via the CCCTC binding factor, CTCF. Further, PRMT5-mediated symmetric arginine dimethylation H4R3me2s and H3R8me2s directly regulated the alternative splicing of Transcription Factor 3 (TCF3). Under hypoxia, PRMT5-mediated histone dimethylation at the intronic conserved region (ICR) present between TCF3 exon 18a and exon 18b recruits DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), resulting in DNA methylation. DNA methylation at the TCF3-ICR is recognized and bound by Methyl CpG binding protein (MECP2) resulting in RNA-Pol II pausing, promoting the recruitment of the negative splicing factor PTBP1 to the splicing locus of TCF3 mRNA. PTBP1 promotes the exclusion of exon 18a which results in the production of the pro-invasive TCF3-18B (E47) isoform which promotes EMT and invasion of breast cancer cells under hypoxia. Collectively, our results indicate PRMT5-mediated symmetric arginine dimethylation of histones regulates alternative splicing of TCF3 gene thereby enhancing EMT and invasion in breast cancer hypoxia.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

However, the reconstitution of mtDNA deletions responsible for severe mitochondrial myopathies and age-related diseases has not yet been achieved in human cells. Here, we developed a method to engineer specific mtDNA deletions in human cells by co-expressing end-joining (EJ) machinery and targeted endonucleases. As a proof-of-concept, we used mito-EJ and mito-ScaI to generate a panel of clonal cell lines harboring a [~]3.5 kb mtDNA deletion with the full spectrum of heteroplasmy. Investigating these isogenic cells revealed a critical threshold of [~]75% deleted genomes, beyond which cells exhibited depletion of OXPHOS proteins, severe metabolic disruption, and impaired growth in galactose-containing media. Single-cell multiomic analysis revealed two distinct patterns of nuclear gene deregulation in response to mtDNA deletion accumulation; one triggered at the deletion threshold and another progressively responding to increasing heteroplasmy. In summary, the co-expression of mito-EJ and programable nucleases provides a powerful tool to model disease-associated mtDNA deletions in different cell types. Establishing a panel of cell lines with a large-scale deletion at varying levels of heteroplasmy is a valuable resource for understanding the impact of mtDNA deletions on diseases and guiding the development of potential therapeutic strategies.

Connecting genomic alterations to health outcomes requires extensive computational analysis using accurate algorithms. Over the years, these algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated, but the lack of gold-standard datasets presents a fundamental challenge. Since genomic data is considered personal health information, only a limited number of deeply sequenced cancer genomes are available for distribution. As a result, tool benchmarking is often conducted on a small set of genomes with uncertain ground truths, which makes it difficult to measure the accuracy of analytic workflows. To address this issue, we developed a novel generative AI tool called OncoGAN to generate synthetic cancer genomes based on training sets derived from large-scale genomic projects by employing generative adversarial networks and tabular variational autoencoders. Our results demonstrate that this approach accurately reproduces the number and frequency of mutations and their characteristics. Furthermore, it captures the genomic position of the mutations following the patterns specifically found for each tumor, and it enables us to replicate tumor-specific mutational signatures. To evaluate the fidelity of the simulations, we tested the synthetic genomes using DeepTumour, a software capable of identifying tumor types based on mutational patterns, and demonstrated a high level of concordance between the synthetic genome tumor type and DeepTumour's prediction of the type. This tool will allow the generation of a large realistic training and testing set of cancer genomes containing known genome alterations. This represents an advance for computational biologists, who will now have access to a publicly available set of realistic synthetic genomes with no privacy concerns, which can be used to develop new algorithms, improve the accuracy of existing tools, and benchmarking.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Perturbations in the activity or abundance of epigenetic factors can lead to tumorigenesis. Remarkably, several metabolites influence the epigenetic landscape in cells. Here, we investigated the interplay between a highly expressed epigenetic factor, YEATS2, and a metabolic enzyme, GCDH, in regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in head and neck cancer. We report that the histone reader YEATS2 is responsible for increased invasive potential in head and neck cancer in an SP1-dependent manner. YEATS2 functions by maintaining histone crotonylation, and its abrogation leads to a global decrease in the H3K27Cr mark. Mechanistically, we report that YEATS2 maintains high H3K27Cr levels at the promoter of the EMT-promoting gene SPARC. Further, we found that the addition of the H3K27Cr mark is also dependent on the crotonyl-CoA-producing enzyme GCDH. Overall, we describe a novel mechanism of interplay between epigenetics and metabolism in head and neck tumorigenesis, which results in the enhanced expression of EMT-related genes in a histone crotonylation-dependent manner.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

All components of the translation machinery, including the ribosomes, translation factors and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, are made of proteins and are therefore involved in their own synthesis, posing a unique challenge for self-biogenesis. Here, we created physicochemical conditions for autonomous biogenesis of all the translation machinery, excluding the ribosome. We surface-immobilized synthetic genes coding for all thirty components as densely packed DNA brushes forming a reaction center that localizes, concentrates and catalyzes their simultaneous synthesis. To demonstrate their activity, we first determined empirically the minimal critical concentration of each translation protein required to initiate its own self-biogenesis in bulk solution. We then assembled a minimal gene expression reaction with all translation proteins at their critical concentrations. Under these dilute conditions, reporter proteins were not synthesized unless the DNA brushes encoded all the translation proteins, thereby demonstrating their co-synthesis, functionality and engagement in their own synthesis. This scenario of a complex biochemical process that amplifies itself can be generalized and extended to impact our understanding toward the design of autonomous self-replicating biological system.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Elucidating the structural mechanisms underlying phosphorylation is crucial for understanding its regulatory roles. Here, we conducted a comparative structural analysis of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated proteins taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Our study systematically evaluates how phosphorylation affects backbone conformation, protein dynamics, and mechanical strain. We found that phosphorylation commonly induces small, stabilizing conformational changes through conformational selection and frequently modulates local residue fluctuations, influencing overall protein motion. Notably, a small but significant subset of phosphosites shows mechanical coupling with functional sites, aligning with the domino model of allosteric signal transduction. This work provides a foundation for studying phosphorylation and other PTMs in their structural context, which will guide the rational design of synthetic phosphosites and enable the engineering of PTM-driven regulatory circuits in synthetic biology.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Rates of OA publications continue to grow, including for research carried out by pharmaceutical companies. To help drive more openness in the pharmaceutical industry, we aimed to compare the OA publication rates of pharmaceutical companies with those of academic institutions.

MethodsWe assessed OA publication rates from the 40 largest pharmaceutical companies by earnings and 40 comparator academic institutions that publish the largest number of medical research articles in their geographical region. Using the Lens, we built a live public dashboard that presents the OA publication rates for articles with authors affiliated to the pharmaceutical companies and comparator academic institutions of interest, detailed by OA model and licence, and by medical therapy area. We performed further analysis on data downloaded from the dashboard.

ResultsIn our primary analysis of articles 12-24 months since publication date, 76.6% of pharmaceutical company (pharma) and 69.5% of academic institution (academia) publications were OA. The most common OA models were gold (pharma, 37%; academia, 41%) and hybrid (pharma, 22%; academia, 11%). Oncology had lower rates of OA publications than other therapy areas. Growth in the OA publication rate was generally more rapid for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions, regardless of field.

ConclusionsThe OA publication rate was higher for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions and continues to increase. With the pharmaceutical industry focused on encouraging authors to publish OA and increasingly aware of the different types of OA licences, we expect and welcome further changes. Our new report provides data on pharmaceutical company and academic institution publications that are updated every 2 weeks. We encourage others to use this open resource and report their results.

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSOpen access (OA) publication rates for pharmaceutical companies have been steadily growing. However, previous methods for analysing pharmaceutical company OA publication rates have not been conducive to automation and have not facilitated easy comparison between pharmaceutical companies and other research-intensive environments, such as academic institutions.

What this study addsWe built an online dashboard that presents continually and automatically updated OA publication rates for articles with authors affiliated to several large pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. We found that the OA publication rate was higher for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions and that growth in OA publications was generally more rapid for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyOur dashboard allows ongoing monitoring, and we encourage the use of this free tool to capture evolving OA publishing behaviours and the disclosure of these results to help drive greater adoption of OA publishing practices.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIAs expected with large-scale bibliometrics sampling, there are various points at which error and/or information loss may have entered this analysis, for example, during the parsing of author affiliations or categorisation of topics and article types.
C_LIO_LIThe comparator set (a globally representative group of research-intensive academic institutions) may not represent academic institutions in general because it includes only the largest academic institutions (in terms of publication counts) from each global region.
C_LIO_LIThere is overlap between the pharmaceutical company and academic institution analysis sets because first, pharmaceutical company publications often include academic authors, and second, academic institution publications may include pharmaceutical company authors. Hence, some individual publications may have been included in both analysis sets.
C_LIO_LIThe analysis does not account for studies that are led by authors at academic institutions but funded by pharmaceutical companies. These investigator-sponsored studies typically do not have pharmaceutical company authors, and pharmaceutical companies have no influence over decisions relating to publications resulting from these studies, including target journal, OA status and license type.

Plain Language SummaryBiotechnology and pharmaceutical companies develop and deliver most of the worlds new medicines. To ensure important information about these medicines is shared transparently with audiences across the world, more and more often, pharmaceutical companies are choosing to publish their research open access. Open access publishing allows anyone to read and, in some cases, reuse the contents of research publications for free. In medical journals, an increasing proportion of articles are published open access every year. However, at the moment, we dont understand how the open access publication rates of medical publications from pharmaceutical companies compare with those of medical publications from academic institutions. Understanding this could help the scientific community assess how open access publication practices are changing over time.

We made an online platform that provides a free, live report of the open access publication rates for pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. We found that 77% of pharmaceutical company research publications and 70% of academic institution research publications were published open access. Open access publication rates increased each year for both pharmaceutical company and academic institution research publications, but the rates were increasing faster for pharmaceutical companies.

Our results are similar to those from other studies of open access publication rates. We encourage users to explore our free online live report and share their results publicly.

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched between May 2020 (previous search) and April 2024. No language restrictions were imposed. Double-blind RCTs supplementing vitamin D for any duration, with placebo or low-dose vitamin D control, were eligible if approved by Research Ethics Committee and if ARI incidence was collected prospectively and pre-specified as an efficacy outcome. Aggregate data, stratified by baseline 25(OH)D concentration and age, were obtained from study authors. The study was registered with PROSPERO (no. CRD42024527191).

FindingsWe identified 6 new RCTs (19,337 participants). Data were obtained for 16,086 (83.2%) participants in 3 new RCTs and combined with data from 48,488 participants in 43 previously identified RCTs. For the primary comparison of any vitamin D vs. placebo, the intervention did not significantly affect overall ARI risk (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00, P=0.057; 40 studies; I2 26.4%). Pre-specified subgroup analysis did not reveal evidence of effect modification by age, baseline vitamin D status, or dosing regimen. Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.04; 38 studies; I2 0.0%). A funnel plot showed left-sided asymmetry (P=0.002, Eggers test).

InterpretationThis updated meta-analysis yielded a similar point estimate for the overall effect of vitamin D supplementation on ARI risk to that obtained previously, but the 95% CI for this effect estimate now spans 1.00, indicating no statistically significant protection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry from 1st May 2020 (date of our previous search) to 30th April 2024 for randomised Controlled Trials and meta-analyses of randomised Controlled Trials evaluating effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of acute respiratory infections. Our previous meta-analysis of 43 randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation for prevention of acute respiratory infections (ARI) conducted in 2021 revealed a statistically significant protective effect of the intervention (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99). A further 6 eligible RCTs, contributing data from 19,337 participants have now completed, including one large trial (n=15,804).

Added value of this studyOur meta-analysis of aggregate data from 64,086 participants in 46 randomised controlled trials, stratified by baseline 25(OH)D concentration and age, provides an updated estimate of the protective effects of vitamin D against acute respiratory infection overall (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00), and in sub-groups defined by baseline vitamin D status, age, and dosing frequency, amount and duration.

Implications of all the available evidenceUpdated meta-analysis including the latest available RCT data shows no statistically significant protective effect of vitamin D supplementation against ARI, either overall or in sub-group analyses.","NA","medrxiv",1729634990535

The mechanisms driving lesion expansion, however, remain poorly understood. Here, using a multi-omics approach, we identified foamy microglia as primary contributors to the molecular profile of lesions and disease progression in secondary progressive MS. Lesions with foamy microglia are marked by the accumulation of cholesterol esters, bismonoacylglycerolphosphates (BMP), and oxylipins, along with high B-cell infiltration, increased levels of immunoglobulin G1, and elevated expression of Fcgamma- and complement receptors. Lesions with foamy GPNMB+-microglia display markers of enhanced phagocytosis, lipid metabolism, lysosomal dysfunction, and antigen presentation, but lack classical pro-inflammatory markers. Our data suggest that sustained phagocytosis of myelin overwhelms microglial endo-lysosomal capacity, leading to lipid droplet and oxylipin formation. This microglial phenotype may induce further recruitment of adaptive immune cells, axonal damage, drive lesion expansion and prevent remyelination. Monoacylglycerol lipase, involved in producing oxylipin precursors, was identified as a potential therapeutic target to disrupt this cycle and prevent chronic lesion expansion.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Yet, despite its essential role, the technology remains bound by the inherent limitations of quadrupole filters, which throw away up to 99% of the useful ion signal and caps the speed at which fragmentation data can be generated. These deficiencies often force compromises in data depth and accuracy, hindering breakthroughs that tie genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics together. A new technology is poised to break through these performance barriers, unlocking unprecedented capabilities in precision, sensitivity and throughput. This step-change in how mass spectrometry fragmentation analysis is performed will reshape the future of scientific discovery, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. The solution is high resolution ion mobility (HRIM), which offers a means to quickly and efficiently isolate ions prior to fragmentation and detection by a high resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) while also resolving challenging isomeric and isobaric compounds that lead to chimeric MS/MS spectra. HRIM isolates ions in time as a result of a high speed separation rather than acting as a filter that discards ion signal like the pervasive quadrupole mass analyzer, allowing higher sensitivity analysis to be achieved. Also, since HRIM eliminates the need to hop or sweep electronics control parameters, as is the case with a quadrupole, fragmentation spectral generation can occur at a much faster rate, upwards of 500 Hz. This whitepaper describes an IM/MS methodology first contemplated over twenty years ago and today being positioned as the fastest method for high resolution fragmentation analysis. Revisiting this concept using the latest generation ion mobility technology based on structures for lossless ion manipulation (SLIM), which is the only HRIM technology that delivers similar resolution and range of analysis as a quadrupole, realizes the full potential of this approach to deliver benefits in both speed and sensitivity for high performance MS/MS measurements. This new way of achieving ion fragmentation in complex samples is set to revolutionize the mass spectrometry space, starting in the growing field of proteomics where all researchers are seeking faster methods to achieve more comprehensive proteomic coverage. Due to the advantages of HRIM physics, we predict this will set the bar for high throughput -omics within the coming years and will eventually be as ubiquitous as the quadrupole is today.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Accordingly, studies of perceptual decision-making have historically relied on tasks with fixed choice-response mappings, in which choice and motor response are inextricably linked. Although several studies have since dissociated choice and response, they have typically involved dynamic switching of the choice-response mapping on a trial-by-trial basis. Thus, it remains unclear if abstract choice representations arise specifically when choice-response relationships change dynamically, or if they reflect a more general property of the decision-making process. Here, we show that in the human brain, choices are represented abstractly, even when the association between choice and motor response remains stable over time. We measured neural activity in humans using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while participants performed a motion discrimination task. Importantly, the associations between perceptual choice and motor response were balanced across experimental conditions and remained stable over many trials. We found neural information about the participants perceptual choice, independent of both the motor response and the visual stimulus. This abstract choice information increased during the stimulus period and peaked after the response had been made. Furthermore, choice and response information showed distinct cortical distributions, with strongest choice information in frontoparietal regions. Our results suggest that abstract choice representations are not restricted to action-independent contexts or those with dynamic choice-response associations and may therefore reflect a general role in perceptual decision-making.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

In virtually all cases, these features consist of arrays of microvilli: micron-scale, actin bundle-supported protrusions that mediate biochemical and physical interactions with the external environment. Despite their importance for epithelial physiology, how microvilli grow during cellular differentiation remains poorly understood. Using genetic and small molecule perturbations, we found that an epithelial cell[&prime]s potential for growing microvilli of normal size is limited by an adjacent actin-dependent process: apical clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Timelapse imaging of individual microvillar growth events revealed tight spatial and temporal coupling to sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Finally, ultrastructural analysis of undifferentiated epithelial monolayers showed that most nascent microvilli are immediately adjacent to or in contact with an apical endocytic pit. Based on these discoveries, we conclude that clathrin-mediated endocytosis controls the timing and location of microvillar growth, as well as the dimensions of the resulting protrusions.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Current measurement technologies for various neuromodulators (such as dopamine and serotonin) do not bridge timescales of fluctuations, limiting the ability to define the behavioral significance, regulation, and relationship between fast (phasic) and slow (tonic) dynamics. To help resolve longstanding debates about the behavioral significance of dopamine across timescales, we developed a novel quantification strategy, augmenting extensively used carbon-fiber Fast Scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FSCV). We iteratively engineered the FSCV scan sequence to rapidly modify electrode sensitivity within a sampling window and applied ratiometric analysis for wideband dopamine measurement. This allowed us to selectively eliminate artifacts unrelated to electrochemical detection (i.e., baseline drift), overcoming previous limitations that precluded wideband dopamine detection from milliseconds to hours. We extensively characterize this approach in vitro, validate performance in vivo with simultaneous microdialysis, and deploy this technique to measure wideband dopamine changes across striatal regions under pharmacological, optogenetic, and behavioral manipulations. We demonstrate that our approach can extend to additional analytes, including serotonin and pH, providing a robust platform to assess the contributions of multi-timescale neuromodulator fluctuations to cognition, learning, and motivation.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

In this study, we conduct a systematic review of vector competence experiments with Oropouche virus (OROV, Orthobunyavirus) that were published prior to the 2023-24 epidemic season. Only seven studies were published by September 2024, highlighting the chronic neglect that Oropouche virus (like many other orthobunyaviruses) has been subjected to since its discovery in 1954. Two species of midge (Culicoides paraensis and C. sonorensis) consistently demonstrate a high competence to transmit OROV, while mosquitoes (including both Aedes and Culex spp.) exhibited an infection rate consistently below [~]20%, and showed limited OROV transmission. Further research is needed to establish which vectors are involved in the ongoing outbreak in Cuba, and whether local vectors create any risk of establishment in regions with frequent travel to Latin America and the Caribbean.

Author SummaryOropouche virus has recently become a major threat to public health in Central and South America. While OROV is mainly transmitted by biting midges, some public health agencies and scientific sources note that some mosquito species may also transmit the virus. We conducted a systematic review of literature prior to the current epidemic, and identified seven studies that experimentally tested the ability of vectors to become infected with, and transmit OROV (i.e., that assessed their vector competence). These studies have consistently found that biting midges become infected at higher rates than mosquitoes, which rarely transmit the virus. It is unclear which vectors are responsible for transmitting OROV in the current outbreak. Existing published data support the observation that biting midges are likely to be significant vectors compared to mosquitoes, which are comparatively incompetent. However, increased vector surveillance and pathogen testing, and additional vector competence experiments using current OROV strains, are urgently needed.","NA","medrxiv",1729634990535

Using national-register data from Denmark and Sweden (1972-2016), we analyzed clinical diagnoses for over 67,000 individuals with eating disorders, their first-degree relatives, and matched controls from populations totaling 17 million. Heritability estimates were moderate, h2AN = 36%, h2BN = 39%, and h2OED = 30% and genetic correlations revealed substantial overlap between AN and obsessive-compulsive disorder (rg = 0.65) and moderate correlations with other mental health disorders such as autism (rg = 0.36). Significant genetic associations were also identified between eating disorders and CMDs, showing strong replication across both countries.

Similar to AM symbiosis, multiple other intracellular symbiotic interactions have evolved in a variety of land plants. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis contrasts with these relationships as there is no intracellular accommodation of the symbiont inside the plant cell, but only intercellular colonization. This symbiotic relationship is common in a variety of seed plants, mostly trees and shrubs such as pines, willows and oaks. Although it is known which plant lineages are involved in ECM symbiosis, there has been little investigation into the evolutionary origin of ECM symbiosis in these lineages. Furthermore, the genetic innovations and transcriptomic response related to this symbiosis have been studied largely in a genus or species-specific context, which hinders the study of their evolutionary origins. In this study, we reconstruct the origin of ECM in the rosid clade, showing at least 16 independent origins, resulting in the 17 known extant ECM rosid lineages. Moreover, comparative genomics of these lineages highlight genes involved in cell wall remodeling which underwent duplications in a convergent manner across ectomycorrhizal lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Key properties, such as potency, selectivity, bioavailability, and safety must be jointly optimized to deliver an effective clinical candidate. We present COATI-LDM, a novel application of latent diffusion models to the conditional generation of property-optimized, drug-like small molecules. Diffusive generation of latent molecular encodings, rather than direct diffusive generation of molecular structures, offers an appealing way to handle the small and mismatched datasets that are common for molecular properties. We benchmark various diffusion guidance schemes and sampling methods against a pre-trained autoregressive transformer and genetic algorithms to evaluate control over potency, expert preference, and various physicochemical properties. We show that conditional diffusion allows control over the properties of generated molecules, with practical and performance advantages over competing methods. We also apply the recently introduced idea of particle guidance to enhance sample diversity. We prospectively survey a panel of medicinal chemists and determine that we can conditionally generate molecules that align with their preferences via a learned preference score. Finally, we present a partial diffusion method for the local optimization of molecular properties starting from a seed molecule. Conditional generation of small molecules using latent diffusion models on molecular encodings provides a highly practical and flexible alternative to prior molecular generation schemes.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Patients with MCT8 mutations suffer from a severe neurodevelopmental and metabolic disorder, however, the molecular mechanism underlying thyroid hormone transport is unknown. Using cryogenic-sample electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined the ligand-free and thyroxine-bound human MCT8 structures in the outward-open state and the thyroxine-bound human MCT10 in the inward-facing state. Our structural analysis revealed a network of conserved gate residues involved in conformational changes upon thyroxine binding, triggering ligand release on the opposite compartment. We then determined the structure of a folded, but inactive patient-derived MCT8 mutant, indicating a subtle conformational change which explains its reduced transport activity. In addition, we determined the structure of MCT8 bound to its inhibitor silychristin, revealing an interaction with residues essential to drive transition to the inward-facing state, thereby locking the protein in the outward-facing state.

To understand the forces that shape the plant microbiome we need to characterize the microbial traits that contribute to plant colonization. We used barcoded mutant libraries to identify bacterial genes that contribute to the colonization of a monocot and a eudicot host. We show that plant colonization is influenced by dozens of genes. While some of these colonization genes were shared between the two host plant species, most were highly specific, benefiting the colonization of a single host and organ. We characterized an efflux pump that specifically contributes to Arabidopsis shoot colonization. This efflux pump is prevalent across Pseudomonadota genomes, yet benefits the bacterial association with only a small subset of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Leveraging genomic diversity within Arabidopsis thaliana, we confirmed that specific glucosinolate breakdown products are detoxified by this family of efflux pumps. The broad prevalence of this efflux pump family suggests that its members contribute to protection of commensal bacteria from collateral damage of plant glucosinolate-based defense responses to herbivores and necrotrophic pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Our findings reveal that cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility and motif syntax are key determinants for TF binding. While Neurog2 binding primarily leads to chromatin opening, DNA demethylation and increased chromatin interactions, we also uncovered strong indirect, cell-type-specific effects, which ultimately result in vastly different epigenetic landscape. Furthermore, we identify shared and cell-type-specific Neurog2 interactors, including the SWI/SNF and NuRD complexes.

Our analysis reveals early-stage GRNs shared across multiple lineages, followed by the emergence of lineage-specific regulatory programs during later stages.

Using in silico genetic perturbations, we highlight the dynamic role of TFs in driving cell fate decisions, emphasizing the gradual specialization of regulatory circuits.

Chronic respiratory infections are among the hallmark complications associated with CF lung disease, and these infections are often due to polymicrobial communities that colonize the airways of persons with CF (pwCF). Such infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, with studies indicating that pwCF who are co-infected with more than one organism experience more frequent pulmonary exacerbations, leading to a faster decline in lung function. Previous work established an in vitro CF-relevant polymicrobial community model composed of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. sanguinis, and P. melaninogenica. P. melaninogenica cannot survive in monoculture in this model. In this study, we leverage this model to investigate the interactions between P. aeruginosa and P. melaninogenica, allowing us to understand the mechanisms by which the two microbes interact to support the growth of P. melaninogenica specifically in the context of the polymicrobial community.

Here, we use live embryo light-sheet imaging, single-molecule tracking, and genomics to overcome these limitations and investigate how hubs are localized to target genes to drive TF occupancy and transcription. By examining mutants of a hub-forming TF, Zelda, in Drosophila embryos, we find that hub formation propensity, spatial distributions, and temporal stabilities are differentially regulated by DNA binding and disordered protein domains. We show that hub localization to genomic targets is driven by a finely-tuned kinetic balance of interactions between proteins and chromatin, and hubs can be redirected to new genomic sites when this balance is perturbed.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

They are analogous of commonly used MemBright probes family, where two zwitterionic anchor groups are replaced with anionic sulfonates with dodecyl chains. The developed probes provide selective wash-free staining of plasma membranes of live cells in vitro, featuring improved brightness and slower internalization inside the cells. In comparison to protein-based (wheat germ agglutinin) membrane markers, new membrane probes provide better staining in poorly assessable cell-cell contacts. A key challenge is to stain cell plasma membranes directly in vivo. During in vivo brain tissue imaging in living mice by two-photon microscopy, the anionic cyanine probes allowed us to visualize in detail the pyramidal neurons with high image quality, clearly resolving neuron soma, dendrites with dendritic spines and axons with axonal boutons. The developed anionic cyanine-based plasma membrane probes constitute an important extension of the toolbox of fluorescent probes for plasma membrane research.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

However, the translational potential of spatial transcriptomics is still limited by its high cost, hindering the assembly of large patient cohorts needed for robust biomarker discovery. Here we present Path2Space, a deep learning model trained on spatial transcriptomics data to predict spatial gene expression directly from histopathology slides. Studying breast cancer, the model was first trained on one ST breast cancer patients cohort and further independently tested and validated on two other ST cohorts. Path2Space identifies 4,500 genes whose spatial expression is robustly predicted in all three cohorts, markedly more accurate than existing ST predictors. Second, we show that based on the inferred ST, Path2Space accurately infers cell-type abundances in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Thirdly, Applying Path2Space to the TCGA breast cancer cohort we identify three TME spatially grounded subsets of patients that have markedly different survival rates. Fourth, analyzing two large breast cancer patients cohorts treated with trastuzumab, we show that the heterogeneity of the inferred HER2 levels across the tumor microenvironment is predictive of response, concordant with the bystander hypothesis. Finally, we developed a spatially interpretable model for predicting trastuzumab response directly from the H&E-slides. This models performance surpasses that of existing response prediction models that use measured bulk multi-omics data. Path2Space is the first approach capable of robustly delineating the tumor microenvironment on an unprecedented scale directly from the tumor slides. It heralds the upcoming development of robust spatially grounded biomarkers of patients survival and treatment that promises to transform precision oncology in both the developed and developing worlds.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Their abundance and diversity have enlarged significantly in the human brain, contributing to the expanded cognitive capacity of humans. However, the developmental mechanism of the extended production of GABAergic neurons in the human brain remains elusive. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics, bioinformatics, and histological analyses to uncover microglial regulation of the sustained proliferation of GABAergic progenitors and neuroblasts in the human medial ganglionic eminence (hMGE). We show that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and its receptor IGR1R as the top ligand-receptor pair underlying microglia-progenitor communication in the prenatal human brain. Using our newly developed neuroimmune hMGE organoids, which mimics hMGE cytoarchitecture and developmental trajectory, we demonstrate that microglia-derived IGF1 promotes progenitor proliferation and the production of GABAergic neurons. Conversely, IGF1-neutralizing antibodies and IGF1 knockout human embryonic stem cells (hESC)-induced microglia (iMG) completely abolished iMG-mediated progenitor proliferation. Together, these findings reveal a previously unappreciated role of microglia-derived IGF1 in promoting proliferation of neural progenitors and the development of GABAergic neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Its spatially and temporally regulated activity within cells is essential for maintaining proper redox balance, and disruptions in these patterns can lead to oxidative stress and various related pathologies. Redox proteomics, which examines the impact of H2O2 at the proteome level, typically focuses only on thiol oxidation, overlooking broader proteomic alterations and the significance of subcellular localization in these redox processes. In this study, we address these open questions by combining chemogenetics with Thermal Proteome Profiling (TPP) to map global proteome response to compartmentalized H2O2 production. We identified hundreds of proteins with altered thermostability and/or abundance upon localized H2O2 generation in the cytosol, nucleus, and the ER lumen, highlighting their roles in cellular responses to localized H2O2. We identified proteins such as MAP2K1, PARK7, TRAP1, and UBA2 to be highly sensitive to localized H2O2 production. Furthermore, we validated their altered thermostability and found that these changes are controlled via dysregulated protein-protein interactions. This study provides a valuable resource for researchers exploring redox-mediated signal transduction and offers novel insights that could be harnessed in treating oxidative stress-induced pathologies.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

From the analysis of [~]1 million bacterial genomes and >20,000 metagenomes, we developed random forest models that could reliably predict horizontal ARG transfer between bacteria. Our results suggest that genetic incompatibility, measured as nucleotide composition dissimilarity, negatively influences the likelihood of transfer of ARGs between evolutionarily divergent bacteria.

However, the contribution of endoreplication to hair cell growth is currently unclear. Here, we determined ploidy levels within the root hair cell file from the proximal meristem to the elongation zone and correlated them with cellular parameters. Our data show that cells in the basal meristem reach a 4C level prior to rapid elongation, whereas in the elongation zone a 16C level is reached prior to the onset of tip growth, suggesting that endoreplication is a prerequisite for rapid volume increase. Consistently, we show that mutants in SIAMESE (SIM) and CELL CYCLE SWITCH52 A1 (CCS52A1), key endocycle regulators expressed in hair cells, display a decrease in cell volume and hair tip length. Interestingly, SIM and CCS52A1 affect cell width and length, respectively. In addition, CCS52A1 controls the growth rate of the root hair tip. Given the common association between cell expansion and cell wall modifications, we performed immunolabeling on wild-type and mutant roots, which revealed a reduced level of pectin methylesterification in the mutant backgrounds, suggesting that SIM and CCS52A1 may modulate root hair cell growth by affecting cell wall modifications.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

A classic example is the perception of unfairness operationalized in the Ultimatum Game where humans readily sacrifice personal gains to punish those who violate fairness norms. While the emotional mechanism underlying costly punishments has been widely acknowledged, the distinct contributions of moral emotions (anger or disgust) remain debated, partly due to methodological limitations of the conventional experiments. Here, we capitalize on a quantitative neurofunctional dissection approach by combining recent developments in neuroimaging meta-analyses, behavioral-level, network-level, and neurochemical-level decoding and data from 3,266 participants from functional neuroimaging studies to determine the common and distinct neural representations between unfairness and the two moral emotions. Experience of unfairness engaged a widespread bilateral network encompassing insular, cingulate, and frontal regions, with dorsal striatal regions mediating the decision to reject unfair offers. Disgust engaged a defensive-avoidance circuit encompassing amygdalar, occipital, and frontal regions, while anger engaged non-overlapping systems including mid-cingulate, thalamic, and frontal regions. Unfairness and anger or disgust respectively commonly engaged the anterior and mid-insula, while the latter additionally showed common recruitment of ventrolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices. Multimodal network, behavioral, and serotonergic decoding provided a more granular and convincing dissection of these results. Findings indicate a shared neuroaffective basis underlying the impact of emotions on unfairness-induced punishment behavior and suggest a common brain circuit has been evolutionarily shaped to protect individuals from personal harm and enforce societal norms.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

A major factor responsible for such seamless assembly are the preferential interactions between the constituent macromolecules, either associative or segregative, that can drive de-mixing to produce co-existing phases, and thus provide a dynamic intracellular compartmentalization. But how these two types of interactions, occurring simultaneously within the cytoplasmic space, influence each other is still largely unknown. This makes understanding and applying the molecular interactions that interfere with each other in such crowded environments crucial when engineering increasingly complex synthetic cells. Here, we show that the interplay between segregative and associative phase separation within cell-mimicking vesicles can lead to rich dynamics between them. Using on-chip microfluidic systems, we encapsulate the associative and segregative components in cell-sized containers and trigger their phase separations to create hierarchical structures that act as molecular recruiters, membrane targeting agents, and initiators of condensation. The obtained multiphase architecture provides an isolated microenvironment for condensates, restricting their molecular communication as well as diffusive motion, and leading to budding-like behaviour at the lipid membrane. In conclusion, we propose segregative phase separation as a universal condensate regulation strategy in managing molecular distribution, condensate location, as well as membrane interaction. We believe our approach will facilitate controlling the behaviour of membraneless organelles within synthetic cells.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

While typically considered an intracellular antioxidant with tumor-promoting capabilities, glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide of cysteine, glutamate, and glycine that can be catabolized, yielding amino acids. The extent to which GSH-derived amino acids are essential to cancers is unclear. Here, we find that GSH catabolism promotes tumor growth. We show that depletion of intracellular GSH does not perturb tumor growth, and extracellular GSH is highly abundant in the tumor microenvironment, highlighting the potential importance of GSH outside of tumors. We find supplementation with GSH can rescue cancer cell survival and growth in cystine-deficient conditions, and this rescue is dependent on the catabolic activity of {gamma}-glutamyltransferases (GGTs). Finally, pharmacologic targeting of GGTs activity prevents the breakdown of circulating GSH, lowers tumor cysteine levels, and slows tumor growth. Our findings indicate a non-canonical role for GSH in supporting tumors by acting as a reservoir of amino acids. Depriving tumors of extracellular GSH or inhibiting its breakdown is potentially a therapeutically tractable approach for patients with cancer.

Recent access to whole-genome sequencing data have made it more feasible to detect hybrid lineages. Here we report the discovery of a European hybrid butterfly lineage, a finding that can be considered surprising given the intense and long-term study of European butterflies. The lineage we describe is mainly inhabiting an island in the Baltic Sea and was previously designated as a subspecies (horkei) of one of the parental species (Aricia artaxerxes). By analysing whole-genome resequencing data, we determine that horkei originated by hybridization between the non-sister species A. artaxerxes and A. agestis. This hybridization event occurred approximately 54,000 years ago, predating the last glaciation of the current distribution range. Horkei must therefore have persisted long enough to be able to colonize its current range, despite that this area lies between the current distributions of the parental species. The hybrid origin, the maintenance of genomic integrity across times of dramatic climate change and the expression of a combination of parental traits suggest that horkei could be in the process of hybrid speciation.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

The Target Of Rapamycin (TOR) complex 2 is a protein kinase that acts as a central regulator of PM homeostasis, but the mechanisms by which it monitors and reacts to membrane stresses are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we characterized a family of amphiphilic molecules that physically perturb PM organization and in doing so inhibit TORC2 in yeast and mammalian cells. Using fluorescent lipid associated reporters in budding yeast, we show that these small molecules first cause a transient increase in the amount of biochemically accessible ergosterol at the PM. Contemporaneous TORC2 inhibition stimulates a rapid removal of accessible ergosterol from the PM by the PM-ER sterol transporters Lam2 and Lam4, necessary for TORC2 reactivation. Thus, we show that TORC2 acts in a feedback loop to control active sterol levels at the PM and introduce sterols as possible TORC2 signalling modulators.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

By leveraging regulatory mechanisms at either transcriptional or translational levels, synthetic responsive systems have been engineered to recognize diverse signals, such as small molecules (e.g., tetracycline) or physical stimuli (e.g., light). However, these approaches have limitations: small-molecule signals often require high concentrations to be effective, and sophisticated engineering is needed to generate responsive effectors. Here, we establish a simple, versatile gene activation system in which short single-stranded DNAs trigger RNA or protein production by complementing defective single-stranded promoters upstream of target genes. We demonstrate selective gene activation with orthogonal promoters, and logic-gate operations with signal pairs. The signaling system operates in compartmentalized nanoliter droplets scaffolded by bilayers. Signal delivery is controlled by selectively disrupting bilayers or applying transmembrane potential to move signals through protein pores, thereby activating genes within the receiver compartments. This work expands the toolset for engineering multifunctional, responsive materials to meet biotechnological and medical needs, enabling gene activation in response to specific cues.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Building on recent formalizations of this phenomenon, we tackle the computational challenge of exhaustively detecting autocatalytic cycles in reactions networks, and further evaluate the impact of thermodynamic constraints on their realization under mass action kinetics. We first characterize the complexity of the detection problem by proving its NP-completeness. This justifies the use of constraint solvers to list all autocatalytic cycles in a given reaction network, and also to group them into compatible sets, composed of cycles whose stoichiometric requirements are not contradictory. Crucially, we show that the introduction of thermodynamic realism does constrain the composition of these sets. Compatibility relationships among cycles can indeed be disrupted when the reaction kinetics obey thermodynamic consistency throughout the network. On the contrary, these constraints have no impact on the realizability of isolated cycles, unless upper or lower bounds are imposed on the concentrations of the reactants. Overall, by better characterizing the conditions of autocatalysis in complex reaction systems, this work brings us a step closer to assessing the contribution of this collective chemical behavior to the emergence of natural selection in the primordial soup.

Significance StatementDescribing the processes behind the origin of life requires us to better understand self-amplifying dynamics in complex chemical systems. Detecting autocatalytic cycles is a critical but difficult step in this endeavor. After characterizing the computational complexity of this problem, we investigate the impact of thermodynamic realism on autocatalysis. We demonstrate that individual cycles, regardless of thermodynamic parameters, can be activated as long as entities may occur at any required concentration. In contrast, two cycles can become mutually incompatible due to thermodynamic constraints, and will thus never run simultaneously. These results clarify the implications of physical realism on the realization of autocatalysis.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

CRISPRi screens in iPSC-derived neurons and glia have already been successful in relating gene function to neurological related phenotypes; however, loss of dCas9-KRAB expression after differentiation has been observed by many labs and has limited applicability for post-differentiation gene perturbations. This loss of expression is largely ascribed to transgene silencing after differentiation. Here, we investigated the expression levels of different CRISPR enzymes in iPSC and Ngn2-derived neurons using piggybac delivery. We found that the commonly used dCas9-KRAB (using the KOX1 domain) displayed dramatic reduction in protein expression levels following neuronal differentiation, yet surprisingly, nCas9 constructs retained comparable protein expression between iPSCs and neurons. We further found that CRISPR constructs, primarily relying on the SV40 Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), fail to efficiently localize to the nuclei of neurons, despite having robust nuclear levels in iPSCs, leading to KRAB-specific cytoplasmic degradation. By adding a neuronal-specific NLS, we were able to correct neuronal nuclear localization and protein expression, confirming the contribution of mislocalization to the instability of dCas9-KRAB in neurons. As the lack of nuclear localization can have a profound impact on editing and gene perturbation efficiency, we suggest further investigation across both cultured and in-vivo postmitotic cell models.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

However, the molecular determinants and functional impact of this additional system of inheritance are poorly characterized. Through comprehensive analyses of severe DNA methylation loss over TEs in an experimental population and in >700 natural strains of Arabidopsis thaliana, we uncovered hundreds of TE epivariants in nature, most of which can be inherited independently of DNA sequence changes and thus are true epialleles. Furthermore, natural epivariants are enriched near genes and we uncovered a novel role for the Paf1 complex as a major facilitator of their prevalence. Conversely, related TE copies limit epiallelic variation, by producing the small RNAs that guide DNA methylation in trans. Crucially, natural epivariants mainly affect stress-responsive genes, making them unique targets for selection. Our findings therefore demonstrate that TEs are important mediators of transgenerational epigenetic variation in nature, with singular properties for plant adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

For example, YfmR was recently identified as a protein that prevents ribosome stalling at proline-containing sequences in the absence of EF-P. Here, we show that the YebC-family protein YebC2 (formerly YeeI) functions as a translation factor in B. subtilis that resolves ribosome stalling at polyprolines. We demonstrate that YebC2, EF-P and YfmR act independently to support cellular fitness. Moreover, we show that YebC2 interacts directly with the 70S ribosome, supporting a direct role for YebC2 in translation. Finally, we assess the evolutionary relationship between YebC2 and other characterized YebC family proteins, and present evidence that transcription and translation factors within the YebC family have evolved separately. Altogether our work identifies YebC2 as a translation factor that resolves ribosome stalling and provides crucial insight into the relationship between YebC2, EF-P, and YfmR, three factors that prevent ribosome stalling at prolines.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

We previously showed that LCFA degradation impedes oxidative protein folding in the Escherichia coli envelope, an issue that arises due to the insufficiency of ubiquinone, a lipid-soluble electron carrier in the electron transport chain (ETC). To maintain redox homeostasis, E. coli activates the CpxAR two-component system; however, the nature of feedback imparted by this envelope stress response (ESR) remained unknown. Here, we show that contrary to the well-recognized remedial mode of Cpx restoring envelope integrity by upregulating protein quality control factors, in LCFA-grown cells, it uses a preventive measure to maintain homeostasis. Cpx increases ubiquinone availability for oxidative protein folding by suppressing LCFA metabolism and directly increasing ubiquinone levels. Further, rather than using its conventional mode of imparting regulation via CpxR working as a transcriptional regulator, during LCFA metabolism, Cpx mainly uses its non-coding arm to counteract envelope redox stress. The Cpx-regulated small RNA CpxQ represses fad genes involved in LCFA transport and {beta}-oxidation, downregulates components of glyoxylate shunt, gluconeogenesis, and ETC, and increases ubiquinone content. Corroborating with its role in repressing LCFA metabolism and maintaining redox homeostasis, CpxQ overexpression impairs growth of E. coli in LCFAs and CpxQ deletion renders LCFA-grown E. coli hypersensitive to a thiol agent. Our foremost work studying the interconnection between LCFA metabolism, redox stress, and ESR in E. coli provides a rationale for investigating similar networks in other LCFA-utilizing bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that functions to activate interferon response upon detecting viral DNA in the cytoplasm. cGAS contributes to inflammaging by responding to endogenous signals such as damaged DNA or LINE1 (L1) cDNA which forms in aged cells. While cGAS knockout mice are viable their aging has not been examined. Unexpectedly, we found that cGAS knockout mice exhibit accelerated aging phenotype associated with induction of inflammation. Transcription of L1 elements was increased in both cGAS knockout mice and in cGAS siRNA knockdown cells associated with high levels of cytoplasmic L1 DNA and expression of ORF1 protein. Cells from cGAS knockout mice showed increased chromatin accessibility and decreased DNA methylation on L1 transposons. Stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) showed that cGAS forms nuclear condensates that co-localize with H3K9me3 heterochromatin marks, and H3K9me3 pattern is disrupted in cGAS knockout cells. Taken together these results suggest a previously undescribed role for cGAS in maintaining heterochromatin on transposable elements. We propose that loss of cGAS leads to loss of chromatin organization, de-repression of transposable elements and induction of inflammation resulting in accelerated aging.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Sema4ab is expressed by macrophages and gene ablation doubles the rate of regenerative neurogenesis. Disruption of the sema4ab receptor plxnb1a/b, expressed by spinal progenitor cells, also moderately increases regenerative neurogenesis. In addition, single cell transcriptomics reveals altered interactions between macrophages and multiple additional cell types after sema4ab disruption.

This heterogeneity highlights limitations in currently applied methodological approaches, which has stagnated our understanding of fundamental skeletal muscle biology in both healthy and myopathic contexts.

Most transcriptome analyses to date have focused on leaf-derived galls. To better understand gall formation mechanisms, we investigated stem-derived galls induced by the weevil Smicronyx madaranus on the parasitic plant Cuscuta campestris at gene expression, cellular, and physiological levels. RNA-seq across four developmental stages identified differentially expressed genes and associated gene ontology terms. Consistent with histological observations, genes related to cell division and the cell cycle were upregulated early but decreased as the gall matured. Similar to leaf-derived galls, we found high expression of PLETHORA and meristem-related homeobox genes in early gall development, suggesting that stem cell induction and maintenance are involved in various gall types. Like leaf- derived galls, the expression of genes related to floral organ development increased through the gall development. However, their expression patterns were dramatically different: downstream genes in the flowering pathway were highly expressed at the initial gall stage, whereas upstream genes were highly expressed later. This suggests that the weevil might activate the flowering pathway at unconventional stages, potentially rerouting the typical flowering cascade to influence gall development. Unlike the decrease in photosynthesis-related genes in leaf-derived galls, we observed an increase in these genes in galls formed on the stem of the holoparasitic plant. Shading experiments confirmed that photosynthesis is crucial for both gall growth and the weevil. This study highlights how gall-inducers can co-opt host resources and genetic pathways, offering new insights into the complexity of plant-insect interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

However, the mechanisms of evolving antimicrobial resistance in such polymicrobial environments are poorly understood. We previously reported that Mg2+ depletion caused by the fungus Candida albicans can enable Pseudomonas aeruginosa to acquire significant resistance to colistin, a last-resort antibiotic targeting bacterial membrane. Here, we dissect the genetic and biochemical basis of this increased colistin resistance. We show that P. aeruginosa cells can acquire colistin resistance using three distinct evolutionary trajectories involving mutations in genes involved in lipid A biosynthesis, lipid A modifications that are dependent on low Mg2+, and a putative Mg2+ transporter, PA4824. These mutations confer colistin resistance by altering acyl chains, hydroxylation, and aminoarabinose modification of lipid A moieties on the bacterial outer membrane. In all cases, enhanced colistin resistance initially depends on the low Mg2+-responsive PhoPQ pathway, which potentiates the evolution of resistance mutations and lipid A modifications that do not occur without Mg2+ depletion. However, the PhoPQ pathway is not required to maintain high colistin resistance in all cases. In most cases, the genetic and biochemical changes associated with these novel forms of colistin resistance also impair bacterial membrane integrity, leading to fitness costs. Our findings provide molecular insights into how nutritional competition drives a novel antibiotic resistance mechanism and its ensuing fitness tradeoffs.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Pausing also contributes to the formation of nucleosome-free regions with the help of chromatin remodellers. However, if these nucleosome-free regions engage with transcription factors to stimulate the transcription potential of paused promoters is not known. In this study, we demonstrate that ligand-induced estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) binding is stabilized at Pol II-paused sites. This stabilization results from an increased dwell time of ERalpha on chromatin, as revealed by single molecule tracking (SMT) experiments. Notably, short chromatin-associated RNAs generated by the paused Pol II contribute to enhancing ERalpha binding at paused promoters. We also observe that pausing increases histone H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) levels, which primes paused promoters for robust transcriptional activation upon release. Collectively, these findings suggest that paused Pol II plays a central role in enhancing transcription factor binding through an RNA-dependent mechanism. This, in turn, results in a more vigorous transcriptional response following pausing release, thus contributing to the fine-tuning of ERalpha-mediated gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990535

Predicting BBBP often involves in silico assessment of molecular properties such as lipophilicity (logP) and polar surface area (PSA) using the CNS multiparameter optimization (MPO) method. This study curated an open-source dataset to benchmark rigorously machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) models with each other and with MPO for predicting BBBP. Our analysis demonstrated that AI models, especially attentive NNs using stereochemical features, significantly outperform MPO in predicting BBBP. An attentive graph neural network (GNN), we refer to as CANDID-CNS, achieved a 0.23-0.26 higher AUROC score than MPO on full test sets, and a 0.17-0.19 higher score on stereoisomers filtered subsets. Regarding stereoisomers that differ in BBBP, which MPO cannot distinguish, attentive GNNs correctly classify these with AURPC, AUROC, and MCC metrics comparable to or better than those of MPO on less difficult test molecules.

Evolution has woven the LC into wide-ranging neural circuits that influence functions as broad as autonomic systems, the stress response, nociception, sleep, and high-level cognition among others. Given this conservation, there is a strong possibility that LC activity is inherently similar across species, and furthermore that age, sex, and brain state influence LC activity similarly across species. The degree to which LC activity is homogenous across these factors, however, has never been assessed due to the small sample size of individual studies. Here, we pool data from 20 laboratories (1,855 neurons) and show diversity across both intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as species, age, sex and brain state. We use a negative binomial regression model to compare activity from male monkeys, and rats and mice of both sexes that were recorded across brain states from brain slices ex vivo or under different anesthetics or during wakefulness in vivo. LC activity differed due to complex interactions of species, sex, and brain state. The LC became more active during aging, independent of sex. Finally, in contrast to the foundational principle that all species express two distinct LC firing modes (""tonic"" or ""phasic""), we discovered great diversity within spontaneous LC firing patterns. Different factors were associated with higher incidence of some firing modes. We conclude that the activity of the evolutionarily-ancient LC is not conserved. Inherent differences due to age and species-sex-brain state interactions have implications for understanding the role of LC in species-specific naturalistic behavior, as well as in psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease, immunology, and metabolic disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990536

In contrast, in vitro glutamatergic neurons showed decreased expression of identity-defining genes, reduced diversity and alterations in canonical cortical connectivity. Cellular identity and diversity were restored towards in vivo values in organotypic slice cultures. These findings reveal cell population-specific responses to environmental conditions and highlight the role of extracellular context in shaping cell diversity in the maturing neocortex.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990536

Yet, what features of the environment are represented in the activity patterns of vCA1 neurons, and whether the positive or negative meaning of a stimulus is present at this stage, remains unclear. Here, using 2-photon calcium imaging across six different experimental paradigms, we consistently found that vCA1 ensembles encode the identity, sensory features, and intensity of learned and innately salient stimuli, but not their overall valence. These results offer a reappraisal of vCA1 function, wherein information corresponding to individual stimulus features and their behavioral saliency predominates, while valence-related information is attached elsewhere.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990536

Here we show through in situ monitoring and ex situ manipulations that methane is rapidly produced by archaea in frequently oxygenated sandy sediments. By combining biogeochemical, metagenomic, and culture-based experiments, we show this activity is driven by aerotolerant methylotrophic methanogens (Methanococcoides spp.) broadly distributed in surface layers of sandy sediments, providing evidence of a hidden process contributing to marine methane emissions. Moreover, we show that methane emissions are driven by methylated seaweed and seagrass metabolites, revealing an unexpected feedback loop between eutrophication-driven algal blooms and greenhouse gas emissions.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990536

Here, we performed intravital imaging of microglia mitochondria, revealing that microglial processes diverge, with some containing multiple mitochondria while others are completely void. Microglial processes that engage in minute-to-minute surveillance typically do not have mitochondria. Moreover, unlike process surveillance, mitochondrial motility does not change with animal anesthesia. Likewise, the processes that acutely chemoattract to a lesion site or initially engage with a neuron undergoing programmed cell death do not contain mitochondria. Rather, microglia mitochondria have a delayed arrival into the responding cell processes. Thus, there is subcellular heterogeneity of mitochondrial partitioning and asymmetry between mitochondrial localization and cell process motility or acute damage responses.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990536

Despite extensive research, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 replication remain unclear. To address this, we developed a single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) assay to directly visualize and analyse in vitro RNA synthesis by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We purified the minimal replication complex, comprising nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8, and combined it with fluorescently labelled RNA substrates, enabling real-time monitoring of RNA primer elongation at the single-molecule level. This platform allowed us to investigate the mechanisms of action of key inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication. In particular, our data provides evidence for remdesivirs mechanism of action, which involves polymerase stalling and subsequent chain termination dependent on the concentration of competing nucleotide triphosphates. Our study demonstrates the power of smFRET to provide dynamic insights into SARS-CoV-2 replication, offering a valuable tool for antiviral screening and mechanistic studies of viral RdRp activity.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990536

A better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms could help future development of adjunctive therapies, yet limitations in current experimental models have hindered our knowledge of the disease. We developed a 3D blood-brain barrier model with enhanced barrier properties using primary brain endothelial cells, astrocytes and pericytes. Exposure to parasite egress products increased microvascular permeability, likely due to transcriptional downregulation of junctional and vascular development genes in endothelial cells. In addition, it increased the expression of ferroptosis markers, antigen presentation and type I interferon genes across all BBB cell types. Incubation with cytoadherent schizont-stage P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes induced a similar, but highly localized transcriptional shift, along with inter-endothelial gaps at sites of parasite egress, significantly increasing permeability. These findings provide key insights into the parasite-mediated mechanisms driving brain microvascular pathogenesis in cerebral malaria.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990536

However, recent and heavily disputed debates on data quality have raised questions on the accuracy of demographic data at older ages. Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1729634990536

We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark.

MethodsA cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza.

ResultsAmong 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80).

ConclusionCOVID-19 represented a greater disease burden than influenza, with more hospitalisations and deaths, and more severe disease primarily among non-vaccinated and comorbid patients.

The results indicate that Omicron BA.1.1 and its pure reverse mutants were widely distributed throughout the United States from the early days of their emergence, showing a statistically significant difference compared to other major variants, which spread from a small number of sources. The peak emergence of BA.1.1 and BA.1.1.18 pure reverse mutants occurred a few weeks before the peak of all collected samples, whereas the peak of pure reverse mutants in major BA.1 variants and BA.2 coincides with the overall sampling peak. Although the peaks of BA.1.x collections are not all synchronous, the peaks of pure reverse mutants in the BA.1 lineage completely overlap, with the number of such mutants declining abruptly after the peak. These regional and temporal anomalies in the Omicron BA.1 lineage, especially in the BA.1.1 lineage, are virtually impossible to explain by current theories of natural mutation and spread by human-to-human infection.","NA","medrxiv",1729634990536

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1729634990536

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","10.1186/s40168-024-01916-8","biorxiv",1729634990536
