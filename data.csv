Persistently elevated autoantibodies have been found in some individuals with long COVID (LC). Using a >21,000 human protein array, we identified diverse AAB targets in LC patients that correlated with their symptoms. Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness. Our findings suggest that targeting AABs could benefit some LC patients.","NA","medrxiv",1719007735747

The need for improvements to its scalability has been driven home by successes with personalized phage therapy requiring large phage libraries and rapid sensitivity testing. Using a robotic pinning platform, we miniaturized plaque assays from bacterial lawns to micro-colonies from 100 nl of inoculant, increasing throughput by >1000 fold without compromising sensitivity. A comparable manual workflow with one quarter the throughput maintained the same sensitivity. These micro-plaque assays can replace plaque assays as a new gold standard in phage biology. As proof of principle, we used our technique to isolate and de-replicate 21 unique Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages from a single environmental sample. We then demonstrated - using the same assay - that of 17 multi-drug resistant clinical P. aeruginosa strains, 15 were susceptible to infection by one or more of the 21 phages tested. Our method allows rapid isolation and de-replication of phages, as well as enabling screening of large phage libraries against bacterial isolates of interest.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

Neonatal research offers a pivotal opportunity to address this long-standing debate. Given that postnatal environmental influences (e.g., gender socialisation) are minimal at birth, any sex differences observed at this stage can be more readily attributed to prenatal influences. Here, we assessed on-average sex differences in global and regional brain volumes in 514 newborns (236 birth-assigned females and 278 birth-assigned males) using data from the developing Human Connectome Project. On average, males had significantly larger intracranial and total brain volumes, even after controlling for birth weight. After controlling for total brain volume, females showed higher total cortical gray matter volumes, whilst males showed higher total white matter volumes. After controlling for total brain volume in regional comparisons, females had increased white matter volumes in the corpus callosum and increased gray matter volumes in the bilateral parahippocampal gyri (posterior parts), left anterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral parietal lobes, and right caudate nucleus. Males had increased gray matter volumes in the right medial and inferior temporal gyrus (posterior part) and right subthalamic nucleus. Effect sizes ranged from small for regional comparisons to large for global comparisons. While postnatal experiences likely amplify sex differences in the brain, our findings demonstrate that several global and regional on-average sex differences are already present at birth.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

We hypothesized that sex-specific immune dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of LC. To investigate the immunologic underpinnings of LC development and persistence, we used single-cell transcriptomics, single-cell proteomics, and plasma proteomics on blood samples obtained during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and at 3 and 12 months post-infection in a cohort of 45 patients who either developed LC or recovered. Several sex-specific immune pathways were associated with LC. Specifically, males who would develop LC at 3 months had widespread increases in TGF-{beta} signaling during acute infection in proliferating NK cells. Females who would develop LC demonstrated increased expression of XIST, an RNA gene implicated in autoimmunity, and increased IL1 signaling in monocytes at 12 months post infection. Several immune features of LC were also conserved across sexes. Both males and females with LC had reduced co-stimulatory signaling from monocytes and broad upregulation of NF-{kappa}B transcription factors. In both sexes, those with persistent LC demonstrated increased LAG3, a marker of T cell exhaustion, reduced ETS1 transcription factor expression across lymphocyte subsets, and elevated intracellular IL-4 levels in T cell subsets, suggesting that ETS1 alterations may drive an aberrantly elevated Th2-like response in LC. Altogether, this study describes multiple innate and adaptive immune correlates of LC, some of which differ by sex, and offers insights toward the pursuit of tailored therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

The structure of the resting state of NbNRC2 was recently revealed to be a homodimer. However, the sensor-activated state has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we used cryo-EM to determine the structure of sensor-activated NbNRC2, which forms a hexameric inflammasome-like structure known as resistosome. To confirm the functional significance of the hexamer, we mutagenized the interfaces involved in oligomerization and found that mutations in three nucleotide-binding domain interface residues abolish oligomerization and immune signalling. Comparative structural analyses between the resting state NbNRC2 homodimer and the sensor-activated homohexamer revealed significant structural rearrangements before and after activation, providing insights into NLR activation mechanisms. Furthermore, structural comparisons between the NbNRC2 hexamer and previously reported CC-NLR pentameric assemblies revealed features in NbNRC2 that allow for the integration of an additional protomer. We also used the NbNRC2 hexamer structure to assess the recently released AlphaFold 3 for the prediction of activated CC-NLR oligomers. This revealed that AlphaFold 3 allows for high-confidence modelling of the N-terminal alpha1-helices of NbNRC2 and other CC-NLRs, a region that has proven difficult to fully resolve using structural approaches. Overall, our work sheds light on the structural and biochemical mechanisms underpinning NLR activation and expands our understanding of NLR structural diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1719007735747

Here, we aimed to establish a chemical-only strategy to induce cellular plasticity and generate embryo founder-like cells. Within 60 hours, chemical-induced pluripotent stem cells activated early lineage specifiers, Cdx2 and Gata6, while maintaining Oct4/ Pou5f1 expression. Following a second 36-hour chemical treatment, founder-like cells developed into all blastocyst fates and self-assembled into embryo-like structures. These progressed into high-fidelity late-streak gastrulation stages within 4.5 days, displaying primitive streak formation via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, along with germ-layer tissues, amnion, and ectoplacental cone. Fate trajectories and molecular signatures from founder-like cells to chemically-induced embryo model (ci-MO) were defined, revealing remarkable similarity up to Embryonic day (E) 7.5 embryo. Summarily, ci-MO offers a straightforward, rapid, small-molecule-only, and high-fidelity approach to study embryonic development and cell fate specification.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

This is exemplified by repressive chromatin domains frequently contacting nuclear lamina or nucleoli. The nucleolus undergoes structural changes in response to various cellular states, potentially impacting genome organization. However, how the 3D-genome organization responds to nucleolar states has remained underinvestigated due to the lack of methods able to identify nucleolar associated domains (NADs) in single cells and under nucleolar stress. To address this, we developed NoLMseq, a method combining laser-capture microdissection and DNA sequencing to map NADs in single cells. NoLMseq identified many unexplored features of chromosome organization around single nucleoli such as NAD heterogeneity among ESCs, culminating in two major populations with distinct chromatin states. The data also revealed that NADs prevalently contact nucleoli in a monoallelic manner and allelic nucleolar contact frequency sets gene expression and chromatin states. NoLMseq also revealed how chromosomes reorganise around nucleoli under nucleolar stress conditions, highlighting the importance of nucleolus integrity in genome organization and 3D-genome response to nucleolar stress. The results demonstrated that NoLMseq accurately measures chromosome contacts around single healthy and stressed nucleoli and it will be a critical tool to study NADs within biological populations and determine how the 3D-genome responds to nucleolar stress in healthy and disease states.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3, which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 and KP.2.3, which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

Emerging research suggests that ME/CFS and Long COVID exhibit overlapping metabolic symptoms, indicating possible shared metabolic dysfunctions. This study aims to systematically explore these shared metabolic disturbances and their potential treatments. Utilizing our novel metabolic modeling method, GPMM, we identified the key metabolic irregularities in patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID, notably the downregulation of the alanine and aspartate metabolism pathway, and the arginine and proline metabolism pathway. Genome-wide knockout analyses indicated that supplementation with aspartate (ASP) or asparagine (ASN) could potentially ameliorate these metabolic deficiencies. Further metabolic assessments in Long COVID patients highlighted the significant downregulation of ASP in both blood and muscle, supporting our predictions. Consequently, we propose that the combination of l-ornithine and l-aspartate (LOLA) offers a promising approach to alleviate metabolic symptoms in both ME/CFS and Long COVID patients. This study not only elucidates the shared metabolic pathways in ME/CFS and Long COVID but also positions LOLA as a viable candidate for future clinical trials.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

We developed a new pipeline, panREPET, for such data. It compares TE copies between each pair of individuals then identifies copies shared by a group of individuals.

The affective disorders group also showed slower learning rates across conditions (Cohen's d=.52, p=.003), suggesting more persistent uncertainty. These findings highlight a complex interplay between trait anxiety and state anxiety. Specifically, while elevated trait anxiety is associated with persistent uncertainty, acute somatic anxiety can paradoxically curtail exploratory behaviors, potentially reinforcing maladaptive decision-making patterns in affective disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1719007735747

The method is implemented in two stages: first, the pre-training stage that generates 3028 generic pathway aging models by integrating age-related genome-wide DNA methylation data with gene ontology and signaling pathway; second, the fine-tuning stage that produces 30280 disease-specific pathway aging models using DNA methylation profiling from 3263 samples across 10 age-related diseases. The Next Generation Aging Clock Models have demonstrated exceptional performance in predicting diseases. For example, the aging index of blood vessel endothelial cell migration can predict Atherosclerosis with an odds ratio of 80. Alzheimer's disease can be predicted by the aging index of response to DNA damage stimulus, with an odds ratio of 3.1. Major Depressive Disorder can be predicted by the organization of the mitochondrion, with an odds ratio of 4.4. Breast cancer can be predicted by DNA repair, with an odds ratio of 3.4, and the severity of COVID-19 can be predicted by neutrophil degranulation, with an odds ratio of 8.5. Furthermore, the models have allowed the categorization of diseases into nucleus aging and cytoplasm aging types. The former includes Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, breast cancer, colon cancer, and osteoporosis. The latter includes Parkinson's disease, depression, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and COVID-19 severity. This innovative approach is expected to be a valuable tool for research into aging-related diseases and for personalized aging interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

For this purpose, numerous detergents, amphipols, polymers and membrane scaffold proteins are available. The choice of the specific membrane substitute can strongly affect the protein's specific activity, stability and conformational spectrum, potentially leading to errors or misinterpretation during analysis. The bacterial ATP-binding cassette transporter MsbA is a prominent example of such environment-specific bias, resulting in apparent conformational and activity responses. Here, we present a systematic analysis of the conformational spectrum of MsbA, stabilized in a dozen environments, using cryo-EM. Our data show pronounced structural feedback of the ABC transporter to the respective membrane mimetics. Detergents generally favour a conformation with wide separation of the nucleotide-binding domains, while nanodiscs induce the narrow conformation. Notably, only three of the dozen tested environments allow MsbA to sample the functional conformational spectrum, enabling full movement of the nucleotide-binding domains between narrow and wide inward-facing conformations. We expect this study to serve as a blueprint for other membrane proteins, even where the structural reaction to the hydrophobic environment is not directly visible but still critical for the proteins' function.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

Here we show that, in male and female mice, while KD protects against weight gain and induces weight loss, over long-term, mice develop hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and severe glucose intolerance. Unlike high fat diet-fed mice, KD mice are not insulin resistant and have low levels of insulin. Hyperglycemic clamp and ex vivo GSIS revealed cell-autonomous and whole-body impairments in insulin secretion. Major ER/Golgi stress and disrupted ER-Golgi protein trafficking was indicated by transcriptomic profiling of KD islets and confirmed by electron micrographs showing a dilated Golgi network likely responsible for impaired insulin granule trafficking and secretion. Overall, our results suggest long-term KD leads to multiple aberrations of metabolic parameters that caution its systematic use as a health promoting dietary intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

Conflicting models have proposed either a fluid-like or solid-like nature for the intranuclear microenvironment. To reconcile this discrepancy, we investigated the 3D structure and properties of the nuclear interior using experiments and computer simulations. We reveal a novel mechanism where newly synthesized RNA interacts with SAF-A (scaffold attachment factor A, or HNRNPU), forming interconnected microgels degraded by the exonuclease XRN2, leading to dynamic cycles of gelation and fluidization. This emergent microgel network depends on transcription, and is disrupted by SAF-A depletion. It also decreases protein mobility and regulates chromatin compaction by modulating microphase separation, thereby opening transcriptionally active regions. This tunable intranuclear network exhibits scale-dependent fluid- and solid-like features, that we suggest may regulate transcription by controlling access to regulatory proteins and polymerases.

While the TMEs impact on immunotherapy has been extensively studied, its role in chemotherapy response remains less explored. To address this, we developed DECODEM (DEcoupling Cell-type-specific Outcomes using DEconvolution and Machine learning), a generic computational framework leveraging cellular deconvolution of bulk transcriptomics to associate the gene expression of individual cell types in the TME with clinical response. Employing DECODEM to analyze the gene expression of breast cancer (BC) patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we find that the gene expression of specific immune cells (myeloid, plasmablasts, B-cells) and stromal cells (endothelial, normal epithelial, CAFs) are highly predictive of chemotherapy response, going beyond that of the malignant cells. These findings are further tested and validated in a single-cell cohort of triple negative breast cancer. To investigate the possible role of immune cell-cell interactions (CCIs) in mediating chemotherapy response, we extended DECODEM to DECODEMi to identify such CCIs, validated in single-cell data. Our findings highlight the importance of active pre-treatment immune infiltration for chemotherapy success.

As of 2024, 23andMe has approximately 15 million individuals with genotype and phenotype data, of which ~80% consent to participation in research. In this work, we explore how both the scale of the genetic data and improved methods to link genetic associations to putative causal genes impact the prediction of clinical success. Comparing the total number of target-indication pairs that have reached at least phase I that are also supported by genetic evidence, the number of target-indication pairs with support from 23andMe is 60% greater than that with support from all GWAS datasets in the public domain. Including 23andMe genetic evidence approximately doubles the number of target-indication pairs in the clinic that are supported by human genetics. Furthermore, we show that genetic associations derived from entirely self-reported phenotypes are 2-3x enriched for clinical success, just as for clinically derived phenotypes. In contrast to conclusions from the recent publication of Minikel et al., we found that minor allele frequencies and effect sizes from GWAS influence the relative success estimates for program approvals, and that drug programs supported by rare and large effect associations have greater (3-4x) likelihood to be approved compared to common variant associations with small effects. Finally, improved gene mapping to identify the likely causal genes underlying genetic associations can result in up to 4-5x enrichment for trial success.

A Treg subtype specialized in controlling Th1-cell responses and another known to control responses in B-cell follicles were substantial components of this compartment, foretelling that punctual Treg-cell ablation rapidly unleashed interferon-gamma production by meningeal lymphocytes, unlocked their access to the brain parenchyma, and altered meningeal B-cell profiles. Distally, the hippocampus assumed a reactive state, with morphological and transcriptional changes in multiple glial-cell types; within the dentate gyrus, neural stem cells showed exacerbated death and desisted from further differentiation, associated with inhibition of spatial-reference memory.

Most strikingly, our data reveal an unexpected property of syntax: it is encoded independent of neural activity levels. We propose that this ""low-activity coding"" scheme represents a novel mechanism for encoding information, reserved for higher-order cognition more broadly.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

To this end, photoactivatable fluorophores are adapted as they can be turned on upon light irradiation. Here we present a concept called Self-Triggered Photooxidation Cascade (STPC) based on the photooxidation of a plasma membrane targeted leuco-rhodamine (LRhod-PM), a non-fluorescent reduced form of a rhodamine probe. Upon visible light irradiation the small number of oxidized rhodamines, Rhod-PM, acts as a photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen capable to oxidize the OFF state LRhod-PM. We showed that this phenomenon is kinetically favored by a high local concentration and propagates quickly when the probe is embedded in membrane bilayers. In addition, we showed that the close proximity of the dyes favors the photobleaching. At the single-molecule level, the concomitant activation/bleaching phenomena allow reaching a single-molecule blinking regime enabling single-molecule localization microscopy for super-resolution of live cellular membranes.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

To solve this ambiguity, animals form hierarchical associations in which the context acts as a gatekeeper in the retrieval of the appropriate cue-evoked memory, ensuring context-appropriate behavior. These hierarchical associative structures also influence future learning by promoting the formation of new context-dependent associations (leading to the inference of context-dependency for new associations). The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the dorsal hippocampus (DH) are both proposed to encode a ""cognitive map"" that includes the representation of hierarchical, context-dependent, associations. However the causal role of the OFC and DH in the different functional properties of hierarchical associations remains controversial. Here we used chemogenetic inactivations, in rats, to examine the role of OFC and DH in 1) the contextual regulation of performance, and 2) the contextual learning bias conferred by hierarchical associations. We show that OFC is required for both manifestations of hierarchical associations. In contrast, DH contribution appears limited to the contextual learning bias. This study provides novel insight into the different functional properties of context-dependent hierarchical associations, and establishes the OFC as a critical orchestrator of these different contextual effects.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

To produce the contractile forces required for the controlled excision of cell-like compartments such as giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), reconstituted cytokinetic rings made of actin are considered to be among the most promising structures of a potential synthetic division machinery. Although the targeting of actin rings to GUV membranes and their myosin-induced constriction have been previously demonstrated, large-scale vesicle deformation has been precluded due to the lacking spatial control of these contractile structures. Here, we show the combined in vitro reconstitution of actomyosin rings and the bacterial MinDE protein system, effective in targeting E.coli Z-rings to mid-cell, within GUVs. Incorporating this spatial positioning tool, which induces active transport of any diffusible molecule on membranes, yields self-organized assembly of actomyosin rings at the equatorial plane of vesicles. Remarkably, the synergistic effect of Min oscillations and the contractile nature of actomyosin bundles induces mid-vesicle membrane deformation and striking bleb-like protrusions, leading to shape remodeling and symmetry breaking. Our system showcases how functional machineries from various organisms may be synergistically combined in vitro, leading to the emergence of new functionality towards a synthetic division system.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

Extensive research in rodents, along with some evidence in humans, suggests that single-neuron activity at specific phases of theta oscillations plays a crucial role in memory processes. Our fundamental understanding of such theta-phase locking in humans and its dependency on basic electrophysiological properties of the local field potential is still limited, however. Here, using single-neuron recordings in epilepsy patients performing a spatial memory task, we thus aimed at improving our understanding of factors modulating theta-phase locking in the human brain. Combining a generalized-phase approach for frequency-adaptive theta-phase estimation with time-resolved spectral parameterization, our results show that theta-phase locking is a strong and prevalent phenomenon across human medial temporal lobe regions, both during spatial memory encoding and retrieval. Neuronal theta-phase locking increased during periods of elevated theta power, when clear theta oscillations were present, and when aperiodic activity exhibited steeper slopes. Theta-phase locking was similarly strong during successful and unsuccessful memory, and most neurons activated at similar theta phases between encoding and retrieval. Some neurons changed their preferred theta phases between encoding and retrieval, in line with the idea that different memory processes are separated within the theta cycle. Together, these results help disentangle how different properties of local field potentials and memory states influence theta-phase locking of human single neurons. This contributes to a better understanding of how interactions between single neurons and local field potentials may support human spatial memory.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

Here, we leveraged unbiased single-nucleus transcriptional profiling to identify expression of the secreted glycoprotein Reelin (encoded by the Reln gene) as a marker of cocaine-activated neuronal ensembles within the rat NAc. Multiplexed in situ detection confirmed selective expression of the immediate early gene Fos in Reln+ neurons after cocaine experience, and also revealed enrichment of Reln mRNA in Drd1+ medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in both the rat and human brain. Using a novel CRISPR interference strategy enabling selective Reln knockdown in the adult NAc, we observed altered expression of genes linked to calcium signaling, emergence of a transcriptional trajectory consistent with loss of cocaine sensitivity, and a striking decrease in MSN intrinsic excitability. At the behavioral level, loss of Reln prevented cocaine locomotor sensitization, abolished cocaine place preference memory, and decreased cocaine self-administration behavior.

Finally, comparing gene expression profiles between AD individuals with high-versus low-WMH burden showed an increased expression of pathways associated with immune function.

Nonetheless, most methods for spliced/unspliced inference (such as RNA velocity tools) focus on individual samples, and rarely allow comparisons between groups of samples (e.g., healthy vs. diseased). Furthermore, this kind of inference is challenging, because spliced and unspliced mRNA abundance is characterized by a high degree of quantification uncertainty, due to the prevalence of multi-mapping reads, i.e., reads compatible with multiple transcripts (or genes), and/or with both their spliced and unspliced versions.

ResultsHere, we present DifferentialRegulation, a Bayesian hierarchical method to discover changes between experimental conditions with respect to the relative abundance of unspliced mRNA (over the total mRNA). We model the quantification uncertainty via a latent variable approach, where reads are allocated to their gene/transcript of origin, and to the respective splice version. We designed several benchmarks where our approach shows good performance, in terms of sensitivity and error control, versus state-of-the-art competitors. Importantly, our tool is flexible, and works with both bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data.

Ulva-associated bacteria exhibit high turnover across environmental gradients, leading to the hypothesis that bacteria contribute to the acclimation potential of the host. Yet little is known about the variation in the functional profile of Ulva-associated bacteria in relation to environmental changes. To test which microbial functions shift alongside a strong environmental gradient, we analysed microbial communities of 91 Ulva samples across a 2,000 km Atlantic-Baltic Sea salinity gradient using metagenomic sequencing. Metabolic reconstruction of 639 metagenome-assembled genomes revealed widespread potential for carbon, sulphur, nitrogen, and vitamin metabolism, including amino acid and vitamin B biosynthesis. While salinity explained 70% of taxonomic variation, it only accounted for 17% of functional variation, indicating extensive functional stability. The limited variation was attributed to typical high-salinity bacteria exhibiting enrichment in genes for thiamine, pyridoxal, and betaine biosynthesis. These metabolic modules likely contribute to oxidative stress mitigation, cellular osmotic homeostasis, and membrane stabilization in response to salinity variations. Our results emphasise the importance of functional profiling to understand the seaweed holobiont and its collective response to environmental change.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

However, the specific effects that they have on brain health are still poorly understood, preventing its implementation in clinical practice. For instance, the association between such risk factors and cortical thickness (CT) has been primarily explored using univariate/bivariate methods and global/lobar measures of CT and has yielded inconsistent results. In this work, we aim to study the relationship between risk factors for non-communicable diseases and CT. In addition, we adopt a systems-level perspective to understand such relationship, by integrating several brain features including brain structure and function as well as neurotransmitter systems.

Here, we analyzed latent dimensions linking a broad set of risk factors for non-communicable diseases to parcel-wise CT across the whole cortex (including raw, proportional, and brain size- corrected measures). We used a multivariate approach (regularized canonical correlation analysis (RCCA)) embedded in a machine learning framework that allows to capture inter- individual variability and to assess the generalizability of the model. The brain patterns (captured in association with risk factors) were characterized from a multi-level perspective, by comparing them with patterns of brain structure, function, and neurotransmitter systems. Analyses were performed separately in women (n=3685, 46-81 years) and in age-matched men (n=3685, 46-81 years) to avoid sex-bias on the results.

We found one significant latent dimension (women: rrange=0.25-0.30, p=0.005-0.005; men: rrange=0.31-0.34, p=0.005-0.005), capturing variability in cardiometabolic health, including physical activity, body morphology/composition, basal metabolic rate, and blood pressure. This cardiometabolic health dimension was linked to a CT axis of inter-individual variability from the insula and cingulate cortex to occipital and parietal areas. Interestingly, this brain pattern was associated with the binding potentials of several neurotransmitter systems, including serotoninergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic systems. Of note, this latent dimension was similar across sexes and across CT measures (raw, proportional, and brain-size corrected).

We observed a robust, multi-level and multivariate link between cardiometabolic health, CT, and neurotransmitter systems. These findings support the urgency of further investigation into the interaction between brain health and physical health and contributes to the challenge to the classical conceptualization of neuropsychiatric and physical illnesses as categorical entities. Therefore, regular monitoring of cardiometabolic risk factors may reduce their adverse effects on brain health and prevent the development of brain diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a multi-domain protein containing both a kinase and a GTPase, are a leading cause of the familial form of PD. Pathogenic LRRK2 mutations increase LRRK2 kinase activity. While the bulk of LRRK2 is found in the cytosol, the protein associates with membranes, where its Rab GTPase substrates are found, and, under certain conditions, with microtubules. Integrative structural studies using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have revealed the architecture of microtubule-associated LRRK2 filaments, and that formation of these filaments required LRRK2's kinase to be in the active-like conformation. Whether LRRK2 can interact with and form filaments on microtubules in its autoinhibited state, where the kinase domain conformation is inactive and the N-terminal LRR domain covers the kinase catalytic site, was not known. Using cryo-ET, we showed that full-length LRRK2 can oligomerize on microtubules in its autoinhibited state. Both WT-LRRK2 and PD-linked LRRK2 mutants formed filaments on microtubules. While these filaments are stabilized by the same interfaces seen in the active-LRRK2 filaments, we observed a new interface involving the N-terminal repeats that were disordered in the active-LRRK2 filaments. The helical parameters of the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are different from those reported for the active-LRRK2 filaments.

During the last two millennia, genetic exchange in Africa has resulted in a complex tapestry of taurine-indicine ancestry, with most cattle populations exhibiting varying levels of admixture. Similarly, there are several Southern European cattle populations that also show evidence for historical gene flow from indicine cattle, the highest levels of which are found in the Central Italian White breeds. Here we use two different software tools (MOSAIC and ELAI) for local ancestry inference (LAI) with genome-wide high- and low-density SNP array data sets in hybrid African and Italian cattle populations and obtained broadly similar results despite critical differences in the two LAI methodologies used. Our analyses identified genomic regions with elevated levels of retained or introgressed ancestry from the African taurine, European taurine, Asian indicine lineages. Functional enrichment of genes underlying these ancestry peaks highlighted biological processes relating to immunobiology and olfaction, some of which may relate to differing susceptibilities to infectious diseases, including bovine tuberculosis, East Coast fever, and tropical theileriosis. Notably, for retained African taurine ancestry in admixed trypanotolerant cattle we observed enrichment of genes associated with haemoglobin and oxygen transport.

We hypothesized that a genomic comparison of mutations in pre-treated versus treatment-naive tumors would serve to identify genes that confer resistance. A challenge in such an analysis is that therapy alters mutation burdens and signatures, confounding association studies and complicating identifying causal, selected mutations. We developed DiffInvex, a framework for identifying changes in selection acting on individual genes in somatic genomes. Crucially, DiffInvex draws on a mutation rate baseline that accounts for these shifts in neutral mutagenesis during cancer evolution. We applied DiffInvex to 9,953 cancer whole-genomes from 29 cancer types from 8 studies, containing both WGS of treatment-naive tumors and tumors pre-treated by various drugs, identifying genes where point mutations are under conditional positive or negative selection for a certain chemotherapeutic, suggesting resistance mechanisms occurring via point mutation. DiffInvex confirmed well-known chemoresistance-driver mutations in EGFR, ESR1, KIT and AR genes as being under conditional positive selection, with additional cancer types identified for EGFR and KIT. Additionally, DiffInvex identified 11 genes with treatment-associated selection for different classes of therapeutics. In most cases, these genes were common cancer genes including PIK3CA, APC, MAP2K4 and MAP3K1. This suggests that tumor resistance to therapy via mutation often occurs via selective advantages conferred by known driver genes, rather than via mutations in specialized resistance genes. Various gene-chemotherapy associations were further supported in tests for functional impact of mutations, again implemented in a conditional selection setting, as well as replicating in independent panel or exome sequencing data. In addition to nominating drug resistance genes that could be targeted by future therapeutics, DiffInvex can also be applied to diverse analysis in cancer evolution, such as comparing normal and tumoral tissues, or analyzing subclonal evolution, identifying changes in selection over time.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

We do not know what caused the unprecedented appearance of pan-drug resistant (PDR) Candida auris strains in a hospitalized patient in New York; the initial report highlighted both known and unique mutations in the prominent gene targets of azoles, amphotericin B, echinocandins, and flucytosine antifungal drugs. However, the factors that allow C. auris to acquire multi-drug resistance and pan-drug resistance are not known. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic, and phenomic analysis to better understand PDR C. auris. Among 1,570 genetic variants in drug-resistant C. auris, 299 were unique to PDR strains. The whole genome sequencing results suggested perturbations in genes associated with nucleotide biosynthesis, mRNA processing, and nuclear export of mRNA. Whole transcriptome sequencing of PDR C. auris revealed two genes to be significantly differentially expressed - a DNA repair protein and DNA replication-dependent chromatin assembly factor 1. Of 59 novel transcripts, 12 candidate transcripts had no known homology among expressed transcripts found in other organisms. We observed no fitness defects among multi-drug resistant (MDR) and PDR C. auris strains grown in nutrient-deficient or - enriched media at different temperatures. Phenotypic profiling revealed wider adaptability to nitrogenous nutrients with an uptick in the utilization of substrates critical in upper glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle. Structural modelling of 33-amino acid deletion in the gene for uracil phosphoribosyl transferase suggested an alternate route in C. auris to generate uracil monophosphate that does not accommodate 5-fluorouracil as a substrate. Overall, we find evidence of metabolic adaptations in MDR and PDR C. auris in response to antifungal drug lethality without deleterious fitness costs.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735747

Genetic variation around the LRRK2 gene affects risk of both familial and sporadic Parkinsons disease (PD). The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) protein has been implicated in peripheral immune signaling, however, the effects of an aging immune system on LRRK2 function have been neglected to be considered. We demonstrate here that the R1441C mutation induces a hyper-responsive phenotype in macrophages from young female mice, characterized by increased effector functions, including stimulation-dependent antigen presentation, cytokine release, phagocytosis, and lysosomal function. This is followed by age-acquired immune cell exhaustion in a Lrrk2-kinase-dependent manner. Immune-exhausted macrophages exhibit suppressed antigen presentation and hypophagocytosis, which is also demonstrated in myeloid cells from R1441C and Y1699C-PD patients. Our novel findings that LRRK2 mutations confer immunological advantage at a young age but may predispose the carrier to age-acquired immune cell exhaustion have significant implications for LRRK2 biology and therapeutic development. Indeed, LRRK2 has become an appealing target in PD, but our findings suggest that more research is required to understand the cell-type specific consequences and optimal timing of LRRK2-targeting therapeutics.

However, limited genomic data has left questions about the timing and origin of the mpox virus (MPXV) emergence. Here we generated 112 MPXV genomes from Nigeria from 2021 to 2023. We identify the closest zoonotic outgroup to the human epidemic in southern Nigeria, and estimate that the lineage transmitting from human-to-human emerged around July 2014, circulating cryptically until detected in September 2017. The epidemic originated in Southern Nigeria, particularly Rivers State, which also acted as a persistent and dominant source of viral dissemination to other states. We show that APOBEC3 activity increased MPXV's evolutionary rate twenty-fold during human-to-human transmission. We also show how Delphy, a tool for near-real-time Bayesian phylogenetics, can aid rapid outbreak analytics.

While individual nontarget binding events may be low affinity, the sheer number of such interactions could present a challenge for gene regulation by degrading its precision or possibly leading to an erroneous induction state. Chromatin can prevent nontarget binding by rendering DNA physically inaccessible to TFs, at the cost of energy-consuming remodeling orchestrated by pioneer factors (PFs). Under what conditions and by how much can chromatin reduce regulatory errors on a global scale? We use a theoretical approach to compare two scenarios for gene regulation: one that relies on TF binding to free DNA alone, and one that uses a combination of TFs and chromatin-regulating PFs to achieve desired gene expression patterns. We find, first, that chromatin effectively silences groups of genes that should be simultaneously OFF, thereby allowing more accurate graded control of expression for the remaining ON genes. Second, chromatin buffers the deleterious consequences of nontarget binding as the number of OFF genes grows, permitting a substantial expansion in regulatory complexity. Third, chromatin-based regulation productively co-opts nontarget TF binding for ON genes in order to establish a ""leaky"" baseline expression level, which targeted activator or repressor binding subsequently up- or down-modulates. Thus, on a global scale, using chromatin simultaneously alleviates pressure for high specificity of regulatory interactions and enables an increase in genome size with minimal impact on global expression error.

Significance StatementReliably keeping a gene off is as important as controlling its expression level when the gene is on. Yet both tasks become challenging in the packed nuclear environment of a eukaryotic cell, where the numerous and diverse regulatory proteins that are present cannot bind enhancers for target genes with perfect specificity. While regulatory schemes based on prokaryotic models would be overwhelmed by errors in such conditions, we show that chromatin-based regulation, an evolutionary innovation of eukaryotic cells, successfully rescues precise gene expression control by reliably keeping desired genes off. Our systems-level computational analysis demonstrates that this result is nontrivial, because chromatin opening must itself be correctly regulated. We furthermore identify when and how chromatin-based regulation outperforms alternative schemes.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

Although the exact mechanisms underlying its maturation remain elusive, spontaneous activity patterns in the retina, known as retinal waves, have been shown to contribute to this developmental process. Retinal waves exhibit complex spatio-temporal statistics and contribute to the establishment of circuit connectivity and function in the visual system, including the formation of retinotopic maps and the refinement of receptive fields in downstream areas such as the thalamus and visual cortex. Recent work in mice has shown that retinal waves have statistical features matching those of natural visual stimuli, such as optic flow, suggesting that they could prime the visual system for motion processing upon vision onset. Motivated by these findings, we examined whether artificial neural network (ANN) models trained on natural movies show improved performance if pre-trained with retinal waves. We employed the spatio-temporally complex task of next-frame prediction, in which the ANN was trained to predict the next frame based on preceding input frames of a movie. We found that pre-training ANNs with retinal waves enhances the processing of real-world visual stimuli and accelerates learning. Strikingly, even when matching the total training time by merely replacing initial training epochs on naturalistic stimuli with exposure to retinal waves, an ANN trained on retinal waves temporarily outperforms one trained solely on natural movies. Similar to observations made in biological systems, we also found that pre-training with spontaneous activity refines the receptive field of ANN neurons. Overall, our work sheds light on the functional role of spatio-temporally patterned spontaneous activity in the processing of motion in natural scenes, suggesting it acts as a training signal to prepare the developing visual system for adult visual processing.

Author summaryBefore the onset of vision, the retina generates its own spontaneous activity, referred to as retinal waves. This activity is crucial for establishing neural connections and, hence, ensuring the proper functionality of the visual system. Recent research has shown that retinal waves exhibit statistical properties similar to those of natural visual stimuli, such as the optic flow of objects in the environment during forward motion. We investigate whether retinal waves can prepare the visual system for motion processing by pre-training artificial neural network (ANN) models with retinal waves. We tested the ANNs on next-frame prediction tasks, where the model predicts the next frame of a video based on previous frames. Our results showed that ANNs pre-trained with retinal waves exhibit faster learning on movies featuring naturalistic stimuli. Additionally, pre-training with retinal waves refined the receptive fields of ANN neurons, similar to processes seen in biological systems. Our work highlights the importance of spatio-temporally patterned spontaneous activity in preparing the visual system for motion processing in natural scenes.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

This deficit limits the ability to accurately type patients, especially as serological testing is not available for all described blood groups, and targeted genotyping panels may lack rare or population-specific variants. Here, we perform serological assays across 24 antigens and whole genome sequencing on 100 Omanis, a population underrepresented in genomic databases. We inferred blood group phenotypes using the most commonly typed genetic variants. The comparison of serological to inferred phenotypes resulted in an average concordance of 96.9%. Among the 22 discordances, we identify seven known variants in four blood groups that, to our knowledge, have not been previously reported in Omanis. Incorporating these variants for phenotype inference, concordance increases to 98.8%. Additionally, we describe five candidate variants in the Lewis, Lutheran, MNS, and P1 blood groups that may affect antigenic expression, although further functional confirmation is required. Notably, we identify several blood group alleles most common in African populations, likely introduced to Oman by gene flow over the last thousand years. These findings highlight the need to evaluate individual populations and their population history when considering variants to include in genotype panels for blood group typing.

Here, we explore the relationship between task-induced increases and decreases in activity from a geometric perspective. Using a technique known as kriging, developed in earth sciences, we examined whether the spatial organisation of brain regions showing positive activity could be predicted based on the spatial layout of regions showing activity decreases (and vice versa). Consistent with this hypothesis we established the spatial distribution of regions showing reductions in activity could predict (i) regions showing task-relevant increases in activity in both groups of humans and single individuals; (ii) patterns of neural activity captured by calcium imaging in mice; and, (iii) showed a high degree of generalisability across task contexts. Our analysis, therefore, establishes that antagonistic relationships between brain regions are topographically determined, a spatial analog for the well documented anti-correlation between brain systems over time.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

In response, we highlight the need to explicitly model spatial processes, including non-stationarity, for more accurate statistical inference. We illustrate how a Bayesian spatial regression approach can be applied to compare functional and structural cortical brain maps, even in the presence of heterogeneity. By explicitly modelling spatial processes underlying the data, a much wider and more sophisticated range of neurobiological questions can be answered about the relationship between brain maps than with current approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

Inhibition of PCSK9 (PCSK9i) blocks MHC-I degradation. Evolocumab is a PCSK9i monoclonal antibody (mAb) indicated for hyperlipidemia. However, mAbs have limited penetrance across the blood brain/tumor barrier (BBB/BTB). We conducted a non-randomized surgical window-of-opportunity study to evaluate if peripheral evolocumab penetrates the BBB/BTB and effects tumor (PesKE; NCT04937413). 32 patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent glioma were enrolled (M: 16, F: 16; average age of controls: 51.85, evolocumab: 53).

We aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 serological responses to primary infection and vaccination in people who developed PCC versus those with an acute infection only. Methods: Participants (n=2,010) were a sub-cohort of the Virus Watch community cohort study in England who experienced mild-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infections, completed surveys on persistent symptoms, and provided monthly finger-prick blood samples for serology. We compared the likelihood of post-infection seroconversion using logistic mixed models and the trajectories of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) and anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies using linear mixed models. Results: Participants who developed PCC (n=394) had 1.8x the odds of post-infection seroconversion for anti-N antibodies compared to those with an acute infection only (n=1616) (adjusted odds ratio= 1.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-2.90). Post-infection anti-N levels were persistently elevated in people with PCC (final log anti-N titres at 365 days 0.97, 95% CI 0.76-1.18) compared to those without (0.47, 95% CI 0.31-0.62). No differences were found in post-vaccination anti-S levels or trajectories before or after primary infection between participants with and without PCC; pre-vaccination anti-S responses could not be evaluated. Conclusion: People with PCC demonstrated greater and more persistent anti-N antibody responses following primary infection compared to those with an acute infection only. Vaccination response pre- or post-infection did not systematically differ between groups.

In Great Britain (GB), AI VI currently requires two passages in EFEs; the initial passage lasts two days, followed by a second of up to four days, potentially keeping premises restricted for six days. Investigations into shorter AIV isolation periods aimed to minimize the duration of official restrictions on businesses while ensuring AI infection is safely ruled out and test sensitivity is preserved. Experimental inoculations of EFEs and VI analyses from high pathogenicity (HP) AI incidents in GB since 2016 revealed that HP viruses were isolated during the first passage, whereas for low pathogenicity AI events, the second passage could be shortened to two days. Power analysis indicated that the advantages of reducing the isolation period surpass the risks of missing a positive case. This method will significantly cut costs for the government and industry by lifting restrictions at least two days sooner when samples test negative for viral nucleic acid.

Boundaries between events were associated with discrete shifts in state space, suggesting that LEC dynamics directly reflect event segmentation. During tasks with a recurring temporal structure, activity traveled additionally in directions orthogonal to the flow of drift, enabling the LEC population to multiplex event information across different timescales. Taken together, these results identify a hierarchically organized neural coding scheme for segmenting and organizing events in time.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

Such discordance has hampered interpretation and convergence of research findings across the field. To address this problem, we have developed the Network Correspondence Toolbox (NCT) to permit researchers to examine and report spatial correspondence between their novel neuroimaging results and sixteen widely used functional brain atlases, consistent with recommended reporting standards developed by the Organization for Human Brain Mapping. The atlases included in the toolbox show some topographical convergence for specific networks, such as those labeled as default or visual. Network naming varies across atlases, particularly for networks spanning frontoparietal association cortices. For this reason, quantitative comparison with multiple atlases is recommended to benchmark novel neuroimaging findings. We provide several exemplar demonstrations using the Human Connectome Project task fMRI results and UK Biobank independent component analysis maps to illustrate how researchers can use the NCT to report their own findings through quantitative evaluation against multiple published atlases. The NCT provides a convenient means for computing Dice coefficients with spin test permutations to determine the magnitude and statistical significance of correspondence among user-defined maps and existing atlas labels. The NCT also includes functionality to incorporate additional atlases in the future. The adoption of the NCT will make it easier for network neuroscience researchers to report their findings in a standardized manner, thus aiding reproducibility and facilitating comparisons between studies to produce interdisciplinary insights.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

BiomiX incorporates diverse omics data. DESeq2/Limma packages analyze transcriptomics data, while statistical tests determine metabolomics peaks. The metabolomics annotation uses the mass-to-charge ratio in the CEU Mass Mediator database and fragmentation spectra in the TidyMass package while Methylomics analysis is performed using the ChAMP R package. Multiomics Factor Analysis (MOFA) integration and interpretation identifies common sources of variations among omics. BiomiX provides comprehensive outputs, including statistics and report figures, also integrating EnrichR and GSEA for biological process exploration. Subgroup analysis based on user gene panels enhances comparisons. BiomiX implements MOFA automatically, selecting the optimal MOFA model to discriminate the two cohorts being compared while providing interpretation tools for the discriminant MOFA factors. The interpretation relies on innovative bibliography research on Pubmed, which provides the articles most related to the discriminant factor contributors. The interpretation is also supported by clinical data correlation with the discriminant MOFA factors and pathways analyses of the top factor contributors. The integration of single and multi-omics analysis in a standalone tool, together with the implementation of MOFA and its interpretability by literature, constitute a step forward in the multi-omics landscape in line with the FAIR data principles.

Despite being modular, composed of multiple zooids and supporting tissues, colonies function as a single physiological unit. A major question in the biology of colonies is the cellular mechanism of generating structurally and functionally distinct colony parts. The cnidarian Hydractinia establishes colonies with different types of zooids (polyps), interconnected by a gastrovascular system that is attached to the substrate and known as stolons. We obtained single cell transcriptomic profiles of ~200K Hydractinia cells, including isolated stolons and two polyp types. We characterised the major Hydractinia cell types and quantified their abundance across colony parts. Overall, we find that distinct colony parts are characterised primarily by distinct combinations of shared cell types and to a lesser extent by part-specific cell types. Therefore, we propose that both cell type combinations, as well as rarer cell type innovations, have been the main mechanism in the evolution of coloniality in cnidarians. We identified cell type-specific transcription factors (TFs) and gene networks expressed within these cell types. Notably, we discovered a previously unidentified, stolon-specific cell type, which expresses enzymes related to biomineralization and chitin synthesis, reminiscent of molluscan shell matrix proteins that may represent a crucial adaptation to the animal's habitat. In summary, the Hydractinia cell atlas elucidates the fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying coloniality.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

The brains capacity to enact this sequence over decades indicates that it relies on intrinsic mechanisms to regulate inter-regional differences in the timing of cortical maturation, yet regulators of human developmental chronology are not well understood. Given evidence from animal models that thalamic axons modulate windows of cortical plasticity7-12, here we evaluate the overarching hypothesis that structural connections between the thalamus and cortex help to coordinate cortical maturational heterochronicity during youth. We first introduce, cortically annotate, and anatomically validate a new atlas of human thalamocortical connections using diffusion tractography. By applying this atlas to three independent youth datasets (ages 8-23 years; total N = 2,676), we reproducibly demonstrate that thalamocortical connections develop along a maturational gradient that aligns with the cortexs sensorimotor-association axis. Associative cortical regions with thalamic connections that take longest to mature exhibit protracted expression of neurochemical, structural, and functional markers indicative of higher circuit plasticity as well as heightened environmental sensitivity. This work highlights a central role for the thalamus in the orchestration of hierarchically organized and environmentally sensitive windows of cortical developmental malleability.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1719007735748

This has led to the evolution of numerous phage defensive systems in bacteria that are still being discovered, as well as numerous ways of interference or circumvention on the part of phages. Here, we identify a unique molecular battle between the classical biotype of Vibrio cholerae and virulent phages ICP1, ICP2, and ICP3. We show that classical biotype strains resist almost all isolates of these phages due to a 25-kb genomic island harboring several putative anti-phage systems. We observed that one of these systems, Nezha, encoding SIR2-like and helicase proteins, inhibited the replication of all three phages. Bacterial SIR2-like enzymes degrade the essential metabolic coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), thereby preventing replication of the invading phage. In support of this mechanism, we identified one phage isolate, ICP1_2001, which circumvents Nezha by encoding two putative NAD+ regeneration enzymes. By restoring the NAD+ pool, we hypothesize that this system antagonizes Nezha without directly interacting with either protein and should be able to antagonize other anti-phage systems that deplete NAD+.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

Obtaining targets at sufficient purity and scale typically requires the screening of several protein variants and expression hosts. Existing cloning strategies allow to produce constructs for co-expression of proteins, but are often time-consuming, labour-intensive, host-specific, or involving error-prone assembly steps. Here we present a unique set of vectors together with a novel assembly strategy designed to overcome these limitations. It allows for the generation of expression constructs for multi-subunit protein complexes for various hosts in a single cloning step. Its modular nature allows the system to be easily extended to target additional expression hosts or to include new tags or regulatory sequences. As a proof of principle, we present the parallel construction of expression vectors for several Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes, allowing us to devise strategies for the recombinant production of these targets in bacteria, insect cells, and human cells, respectively.

The power to detect a trait-associated variant in GWAS is a function of frequency and effect size --- but for traits under selection, the effect size of a variant determines the strength of selection against it, constraining its frequency. To account for GWAS ascertainment, we propose studying the joint distribution of allele frequencies across populations, conditional on the frequencies in the GWAS cohort. Before considering these conditional frequency spectra, we first characterized the impact of selection and non-equilibrium demography on allele frequency dynamics forwards and backwards in time. We then used these results to understand conditional frequency spectra under realistic human demography. Finally, we investigated empirical conditional frequency spectra for GWAS variants associated with 106 complex traits, finding compelling evidence for either stabilizing or purifying selection. Our results provide insight into polygenic score portability and other properties of variants ascertained with GWAS, highlighting the utility of conditional frequency spectra.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

Here, we generated an ancient DNA time transect consisting of 219 individuals with genome-wide data from 47 sites in this region, supplemented by 97 new radiocarbon dates. Spanning from the Early Bronze Age 5000 years ago to the so-called  Migration Period that followed the fall of the Western Roman Empire, we document a largely persisting local gene pool that continuously assimilated migrants from Anatolia/Levant and the populations of the adjacent Eurasian steppe. More specifically, we observe these admixture events as early as the Middle Bronze Age. Starting with Late Antiquity (late first century AD), we also detect an increasing number of individuals with more southern ancestry, more frequently associated with urban centers - landmarks of the early Christianization in eastern Georgia. Finally, in the Early Medieval Period starting 400 AD, we observe genetic outlier individuals with ancestry from the Central Eurasian steppe, with artificial cranial deformations (ACD) in several cases.

Despite years of study, however, how Notch induces the transcription of its target genes remains unclear. Here, we comprehensively examined the response to human Notch1 across a time course of activation using genomic assays of nascent RNA and chromatin accessibility. These data revealed that Notch induces target gene transcription primarily by releasing paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), in contrast to prevailing models suggesting that Notch acts by promoting chromatin accessibility. Indeed, we found that open chromatin is established at Notch-responsive regulatory elements prior to Notch signaling, through SWI/SNF-mediated remodeling. Notch activation, however, elicited no further chromatin opening at these loci. Together, these studies reveal that the nuclear response to Notch signaling is dictated by the pre-existing chromatin state and RNAPII distribution at time of signal activation.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

Control of gene expression by GPCRs has been studied almost exclusively at the transcriptional level, neglecting an extensive amount of regulation that takes place translationally. Hence, little is known about the nature and mechanisms of gene-specific post-transcriptional regulation downstream of receptor activation. Here, we apply an unbiased multiomics approach to delineate an extensive translational regulatory program initiated by the prototypical beta2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2-AR) and provide mechanistic insights into how these processes are orchestrated. Using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), we identify nearly 120 novel gene targets of adrenergic receptor activity which expression is exclusively regulated at the level of translation. We next show that all translational changes are induced selectively by endosomal {beta}2-ARs. We further report that this proceeds through activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Specifically, within the set of translational GPCR targets we discover significant enrichment of genes with 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, a gene class classically known to be translationally regulated by mTOR. We then demonstrate that endosomal {beta}2-ARs are required for mTOR activation and subsequent mTOR-dependent TOP mRNA translation. Together, this comprehensive analysis of drug-induced translational regulation establishes a critical role for location-biased GPCR signaling in fine-tuning the cellular protein landscape.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

One molecule consistently referenced as a delineator of a putative immunosuppressive  M2 state is the surface protein CD206. We thus made a novel conditional CD206 (Mrc1) knock-in mouse to specifically visualize and/or deplete CD206+  M2-like TAMs and assess their correspondence with pro-tumoral immunity. Early, but not late depletion of CD206+ macrophages and monocytes (here,  Mono/Macs) led to an indirect loss of a key anti-tumor network of NK cells, conventional type I dendritic cells (cDC1) and CD8 T cells. Among myeloid cells, we found that the CD206+ TAMs are the primary producers of CXCL9, and able to differentially attract activated CD8 T cells. In contrast, a population of stress-responsive TAMs (""Hypoxic"" or Spp1+) and immature monocytes, which lack CD206 expression and become prominent following early depletion, expressed markedly diminished levels of CXCL9. Those NK and CD8 T cells which enter CD206- depleted tumors express vastly reduced levels of the corresponding receptor Cxcr3, the cDC1- attracting chemokine Xcl1 and cDC1 growth factor Flt3l transcripts. Consistent with the loss of this critical network, early CD206+ TAM depletion decreased tumor control by antigen specific CD8 T cells in mice. Likewise, in humans, the CD206Replete, but not the CD206Depleted Mono/Mac gene signature correlated robustly with CD8 T cell, NK cell and stimulatory cDC1 gene signatures and transcriptomic signatures skewed towards CD206Replete Mono/Macs associated with better survival. Together, these findings negate the unqualified classification of CD206+  M2-like macrophages as immunosuppressive by illuminating contexts for their role in organizing a critical tumor-reactive archetype of immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

Therefore, the abundance variation of regulatory proteins across unstimulated single cells can be associatively linked with their response to stimulation. Here we developed an approach that leverages this association across individual cells and nuclei to systematically identify potential regulators of biological processes, followed by targeted validation. Specifically, we applied this approach to identify regulators of nucleocytoplasmic protein transport in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To this end, we quantified the proteomes of 3,412 individual nuclei, sampling the dynamic response to LPS treatment, and linking functional variability to proteomic variability. Minutes after the stimulation, the protein transport in individual nuclei correlated strongly with the abundance of known protein transport regulators, thus revealing the impact of natural protein variability on functional cellular response. We found that simple biophysical constraints, such as the quantity of nuclear pores, partially explain the variability in LPS-induced nucleocytoplasmic transport. Among the many proteins newly identified to be associated with the response, we selected 16 for targeted validation by knockdown. The knockdown phenotypes confirmed the inferences derived from natural protein and functional variation of single nuclei, thus demonstrating the potential of (sub-)single-cell proteomics to infer functional regulation. We expect this approach to generalize to broad applications and enhance the functional interpretability of single-cell omics data.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

Responses to sub-lethal abiotic stress combinations are complex and often distinct from responses to individual stresses and remain poorly understood. Investigating traits and molecular factors mediating acclimation to stress combinations is essential for the development of climate change-resilient field crops. Here, we studied the morphological, physiological, and molecular responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to i) co-occurring high temperature and drought and ii) flooding sequentially followed by drought, both of which have increased in frequency due to climate change. A set of 15 physiological and morphological traits were assessed during single and combined stresses. By combining these comprehensive trait analyses with transcriptome characterization, we established the generally additive effects of simultaneous or sequential stresses on plant morphology and physiology compared to the corresponding individual stresses. Although drought had a mild effect in both stress combinations, a unique transcriptome signature emerged upon combination with high temperature simultaneously or flooding sequentially. Molecular processes identified as important for multi-stress resilience included plastid-nucleus communication, ABA signaling and photo-acclimation. Based on the RNA-seq data, a set of 39 genes was identified as potential multi-stress response regulators. Mutants were tested to validate their contribution to plant survival and phenotypic acclimation under combined stress. We confirmed the involvement of several genes in regulating phenotypic acclimation traits.

Here, we used a whole genome alignment between two maize genotypes to identify polymorphic structural variants and then genotyped a large maize diversity panel for these variants using short-read sequencing data. We characterized variation of SVs within the panel and identified SV polymorphisms that are associated with life history traits and genotype-by-environment interactions. While most of the SVs associated with traits contained TEs, only one of the SV's boundaries clearly matched TE breakpoints indicative of a TE insertion, whereas the other polymorphisms were likely caused by deletions.

Despite significant progress in understanding these individual processes, the mechanism orchestrating these two fates and their effects on root architecture and secondary growth remain unclear. Here we combined lineage tracing with molecular genetics to study the fate dynamics of XPP cells. We showed that developmentally arrested lateral root primordia (LRP) that fail to emerge as lateral roots, gradually obtain cambium identity thus contributing to secondary growth. Conversely, pre-established procambium identity within XPP cells can be reverted to LR identity when simulated by auxin, an important player in LR development. This competence for auxin-induced LR formation from XPP cells, termed LR potency, however, decreases as the root matures. We found key cambium regulators play essential roles in shaping LR potency by promoting cambium activation and inhibiting LR development. Consistently, corresponding mutants with impaired cambium activity display broader LR potency. Moreover, cytokinins, essential players in cambium development, facilitate the identity transition of LRPs to cambium and reduce LR potency through key cambium regulators. Overall, our findings highlight the inherent cellular plasticity of XPP cells and elucidate how plant hormones influence root architecture and secondary growth through balancing the two cell fates of XPP cells.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

Here, we developed an individualized in vivo marker of regional excitation-inhibition balance in human adolescents, estimated using large-scale simulations of biophysical network models fitted to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from two independent cross-sectional (N = 752) and longitudinal (N = 149) cohorts. We found a widespread relative increase of inhibition in association cortices paralleled by a relative age-related increase of excitation, or lack of change, in sensorimotor areas across both datasets. This developmental pattern co-aligned with multiscale markers of sensorimotor-association differentiation. The spatial pattern of excitation-inhibition development in adolescence was robust to inter-individual variability of structural connectomes and modeling configurations. Notably, we found that alternative simulation-based markers of excitation-inhibition balance show a variable sensitivity to maturational change. Taken together, our study highlights an increase of inhibition during adolescence in association areas using cross sectional and longitudinal data, and provides a robust computational framework to estimate microcircuit maturation in vivo at the individual level.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

The mitotic spindle, the self-organized microtubule structure driving chromosome segregation, scales in size with the available cytoplasm. Yet, the relationship between spindle size and chromosome movement remains poorly understood. Here, we address how the movement of chromosomes changes during the cleavage divisions of the Drosophila blastoderm. We show that the speed of chromosome separation gradually decreases during the 4 nuclear divisions of the blastoderm. This reduction in speed is accompanied by a similar reduction in the length of the spindle, thus ensuring that these two quantities are tightly linked. Using a combination of genetic and quantitative imaging approaches, we find that two processes contribute to controlling the speed at which chromosomes move at mitotic exit: the activity of molecular motors important for microtubule depolymerization and the cell cycle oscillator. Specifically, we found that the levels of Klp10A, Klp67A, and Klp59C, three kinesin-like proteins important for microtubule depolymerization, contribute to setting the speed of chromosome separation. This observation is supported by quantification of microtubule dynamics indicating that poleward flux rate scales with the length of the spindle. Perturbations of the cell cycle oscillator using heterozygous mutants of mitotic kinases and phosphatases revealed that the duration of anaphase increases during the blastoderm cycles and is the major regulator of chromosome velocity. Thus, our work suggests a potential link between the biochemical rate of mitotic exit and the forces exerted by the spindle.

Defects in endothelial mechanoresponses can perturb tissue remodelling and functions leading to cardiovascular disease progression. In this context, the precise mechanisms of endothelial mechanoresponses contributing to normal and diseased tissue functioning remain elusive. Here, we sought to uncover how flow-mediated transcriptional regulation drives endothelial mechanoresponses in healthy and atherosclerotic-prone tissues. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we identify novel mechanosensitive genes in response to healthy unidirectional flow (UF) and athero-prone disturbed flow (DF). We find that the transcription as well as protein expression of Four-and-a-half LIM protein 2 (FHL2) are enriched in athero-prone DF both in vitro and in vivo. We then demonstrate that the exogenous expression of FHL2 is necessary and sufficient to drive discontinuous adherens junction morphology and increased tissue permeability. This athero-prone phenotype requires the force-sensitive binding of FHL2 to actin. In turn, the force-dependent localisation of FHL2 to stress fibres promotes microtubule dynamics to release the RhoGEF, GEF-H1, and activate the Rho-ROCK pathway. Thus, we unravelled a novel mechanochemical feedback wherein force-dependent FHL2 localisation promotes hypercontractility. This misregulated mechanoresponse creates highly permeable tissues, depicting classic hallmarks of atherosclerosis progression.

Here, we explored the potential of Type III Secretion System (T3SS)-mediated delivery to study the activity of pathogen effectors in spinach. We identified the Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (DC3000) polymutant D36E, which lacks 36 known T3SS effectors (T3Es), as a promising T3SS-dependent effector delivery system in spinach. Unlike DC3000, which causes visual disease symptoms on spinach, D36E did not induce visible disease symptoms. Using D36E effector delivery, we screened 28 known DC3000 T3Es individually on spinach for effects on disease symptom development, bacterial proliferation reflecting bacterial virulence, and ROS bursts as a proxy for early immune responses. All three assays identified T3Es AvrE1 and HopM1 as crucial determinants of DC3000-like infection on spinach.

Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) is an analysis paradigm that aims to address this challenge. dFC consists of a time-varying matrix (dFC matrix) expressing how pairwise interactions across brain areas change with time. However, the main dFC approaches have been developed and applied mostly empirically, lacking a unifying theoretical frame-work, a general interpretation, and a common set of measures to quantify the dFC matrices properties. Moreover, the dFC field has been lacking ad-hoc algorithms to compute and process the matrices efficiently. This has prevented the field to show its full potential with high-dimensional datasets and/or real time applications.

With this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Symmetric Connectivity Matrix analysis framework (DySCo), with its associated repository. DySCo is a unifying approach that allows the study brain signals at different spatio-temporal scales, down to voxel level, that is computationally ultrafast. DySCo unifies in a single theoretical framework the most employed dFC matrices, which share a common mathematical structure. Doing so it allows:

O_LIA new interpretation of dFC that further justifies its use to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of data interactions in a form that is easily translatable across different imaging modalities.
C_LIO_LIThe introduction of the the Recurrence Matrix EVD to compute and store the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of all types of dFC matrices in an efficent manner that is orders of magnitude faster than naive algorithms, and without loss of information.
C_LIO_LITo simply define quantities of interest for the dynamic analyses such as: the amount of connectivity (norm of a matrix) the similarity between matrices, their informational complexity.
C_LI

The methodology developed here is validated on both a synthetic dataset and a rest/N-back task experimental paradigm - the fMRI Human Connectome Project dataset. We demonstrate that all the measures proposed are highly sensitive to changes in brain configurations. To illustrate the computational efficiency of the DySCo toolbox, we perform the analysis at the voxel-level, a computationally very demanding task which is easily afforded by the RMEVD algorithm.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

Low education is frequently pointed to as a potential key factor, due to its robust relationship with dementia risk. Impact of education is notoriously difficult to assess, however, because of associations with multiple other risk and protective factors, and large population-representative samples are required to tease the relationships apart. Here, we studied 207,814 Norwegian men born between 1950 and 1959 who underwent compulsory cognitive testing during military conscription as young adults, to systematically test associations of education, cognition, and other potentially important factors. While low education was associated with increased risk for dementia diagnosis (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37, CI: 1.17-1.60), this association was fully explained by earlier cognitive test scores (HR = 1.08, CI: .91-1.28). In contrast, low cognitive score was associated with double risk of later dementia diagnosis, even when taking education into account (HR = 2.00, CI: 1.65-2.42). This relationship survived controlling for early-life socioeconomic status and was replicated within pairs of brothers. The latter finding suggests that genetic and environmental factors shared within families, such as common genetics, parental education, childhood socioeconomic status, or other shared experiences, cannot account for the association. Rather, independent, non-familial factors are more important. In contrast, within-family factors accounted for the relationship between low education and diagnosis risk. In conclusion, implementing measures to increase cognitive function in childhood and adolescence appears to be a more promising strategy for reducing dementia burden.","NA","medrxiv",1719007735748

It is driven by membrane-bound autophagy receptors that display cytoplasmic intrinsically disordered modules (IDRs) engaging Atg8/LC3/GABARAP (LC3). Studies on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-phagy receptors of the FAM134 family revealed the importance of sequential FAM134 proteins phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and clustering for execution of the ER-phagy programs. In this model, ER fragmentation is promoted/facilitated by the membrane-remodeling function of FAM134 reticulon homology domains (RHDs). However, RHDs are not conserved in ER-phagy receptors. The question that we tackle in this work is if activation of ER-phagy receptors anchored at the ER membrane with conventional membrane spanning domains, i.e., most of the ER-phagy receptors known to date, eventually trigger ER remodeling and fragmentation, and how. Here, we show that the membrane-tethering modules of ER-phagy receptors (RHDs for FAM134B, single/multi spanning transmembrane domains for TEX264 and SEC62) determine the sub-compartmental distribution of the receptors but are dispensable for ER fragmentation, regardless of their propensity to remodel the ER membrane. Rather, ER fragmentation is promoted by the ER-phagy receptors intrinsically disordered region (IDR) modules that are a conserved feature of all ER-phagy receptors exposed at the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane. Since cytoplasmic IDRs with net negative charge are conserved in autophagy receptors at the limiting membrane of other organelles, we anticipate that conserved mechanisms of organelle fragmentation driven by cytoplasmic exposed IDRs could operate in eukaryotic cells.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

It has recently been found that odour representations in the piriform cortex (PCx) can also contain information about their spatial context. However, the precise origins of this information within the brain and its subsequent integration into the microcircuitry of the PCx remains unknown. In this study, we focus on the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) as a candidate for carrying spatial contextual information to the PCx, to investigate how it affects the PCx microcircuit and its response to olfactory inputs. Utilising mice brain slices, we performed patch clamp recordings targeting both superficial (SP) and deep (DP) pyramidal neurons, as well as parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) inhibitory interneurons. Concurrently, we optogenetically stimulated excitatory LEC projections to study their impact on PCx activity. We found that LEC inputs are heterogeneously distributed in the PCx microcircuit, evoking larger excitatory currents in SP and PV neurons compared to DP and SOM neurons, respectively, due to their higher monosynaptic connectivity. Moreover, LEC inputs exert a differential effect on the inhibitory circuits, activating PV while suppressing SOM interneurons. We further studied the interaction among LEC inputs and the sensory afferent signals originating from the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) onto the PCx. Our findings demonstrated that both SP and DP neurons show a general increase in their spiking response when LEC and LOT are simultaneously activated. Notably, DP neurons exhibit a sharpening of their response attributable to LEC-induced inhibition that effectively suppresses the delayed spikes evoked by LOT stimulation. These observations suggest a regulatory mechanism whereby LEC inputs inhibit recurrent activity by activating PV interneurons. Our results show that LEC afferents reconfigure PCx activity and contribute to the understanding of how odour objects are formed within the PCx integrating both olfactory and contextual information.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

With no current treatments or reliable diagnostic markers, there is an urgent need to define the molecular underpinnings of these conditions. By studying bioenergetic characteristics of peripheral blood lymphocytes in over 16 healthy controls, 15 ME/CFS, and 15 LC, we find both ME/CFS and LC donors exhibit signs of elevated oxidative stress, relative to healthy controls, especially in the memory subset. Using a combination of flow cytometry, bulk RNA-seq analysis, mass spectrometry, and systems chemistry analysis, we also observed aberrations in ROS clearance pathways including elevated glutathione levels, decreases in mitochondrial superoxide dismutase levels, and glutathione peroxidase 4 mediated lipid oxidative damage. Critically, these changes in redox pathways show striking sex-specific trends. While females diagnosed with ME/CFS exhibit higher total ROS and mitochondrial calcium levels, males with an ME/CFS diagnosis have normal ROS levels, but larger changes in lipid oxidative damage. Further analyses show that higher ROS levels correlates with hyperproliferation of T cells in females, consistent with the known role of elevated ROS levels in the initiation of proliferation. This hyperproliferation of T cells can be attenuated by metformin, suggesting this FDA-approved drug as a possible treatment, as also suggested by a recent clinical study of LC patients. Thus, we report that both ME/CFS and LC are mechanistically related and could be diagnosed with quantitative blood cell measurements. We also suggest that effective, patient tailored drugs might be discovered using standard lymphocyte stimulation assays.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

The complexity of carotenoid-based color evolution in nature remains poorly characterized. Here, we examine the long-tailed finch Poephila acuticauda, an Australian songbird with two hybridizing subspecies that differ in bill coloration: yellow in western subspecies acuticauda and red in eastern subspecies hecki. We characterize the carotenoid composition of each subspecies and find that yellow bills can be explained by the loss of C(4)-oxidation, thus blocking yellow dietary pigments from being metabolized to red. Combining linked-read genomic sequencing and reflectance spectrophotometry measurements of bill color collected from wild-sampled finches and laboratory crosses, we identify four loci that together explain 53% of variance in this trait. The two loci of largest effect contain the genes CYP2J19, an essential enzyme for the ketolation via C(4)-oxidation of dietary carotenoids, and TTC39B, an enhancer of ketocarotenoid production. Evolutionary genealogy reconstruction indicates that the red-billed phenotype is ancestral and that yellow alleles at both CYP2J19 and TTC39B arose and fixed in acuticauda approximately 100 kya. Yellow alleles then introgressed into hecki less than 5 kya. Across all four loci, acuticauda derived variants show evidence of selective sweeps, implying that yellow bill coloration has been favored by natural selection. Our study suggests that the frequent adaptive evolutionary transitions between red and yellow ornamentation in nature can have a simple genetic basis.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

Early drug discovery campaigns focused on STING activation as a promising platform for cancer immunotherapy yet failed in multiple clinical trials due to lack of efficacy thus far. Current research and development activities concentrate on STING inhibition for treating autoimmune disease and neuroinflammation. While the progression of STING activators into the clinic has been successful, the discovery and clinical progression of STING inhibitors remain elusive. Questions persist about the molecular properties needed to distinguish between a STING activator and inhibitor, particularly within SAVI disease, a monogenic autoinflammatory disease that renders STING constitutively active. Here we leverage an orthosteric STING activator and inhibitor from the same chemical series to discover that STING M271 is a critical residue for molecular activation. The M271CH3 NMR chemical shifts reveal a unique molecular signature for pharmacological or genetically driven activation and inhibition that is not captured by x-ray crystallography. Additionally, M271 directly interacts with the most common SAVI mutation, V155M, and using an orthosteric STING inhibitor, we show partial rescue and molecular correction of STING V155M. Finally, these data present insights into therapeutic STING molecular correction for treating SAVI patients. Our results elucidate an unappreciated structural interaction critical for STING modulation that could be utilized as a molecular diagnostic tool for drug discovery. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time how the therapeutic requirements of a molecular corrector differ from an orthosteric STING inhibitor, and why this is important for the SAVI disease population.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

The types and levels of glycans on one cell can be sensed by other cells using carbohydrate-specific binding proteins such as lectins, enabling glycans to regulate cell-cell interactions. Glycans are covalently assembled onto proteins and lipids as they traverse the secretory pathway, a tightly regulated process known as glycosylation and carried out by Golgi-resident enzymes. Errors in glycosylation due to the dysfunctional trafficking of enzymes and substrates in the Golgi are implicated in human diseases. Here we ask how much information about Golgi dysfunction is encoded by surface glycans in single cells. This task is challenging due to high cell-to-cell variability in glycan levels. We exploited the loss-of-adhesion driven disorganization of the Golgi in mouse fibroblasts to generate a highly reproducible gradient of Golgi morphology phenotypes, by titrating the Arf1 inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA). We measured the resulting distribution of cell-surface glycans in single cells using two fluorescently tagged lectin probes (ConA and WGA). A mathematical model of intracellular traffic, parameterized against measurements of Golgi fragmentation and endocytosis, quantitatively explains cell-surface lectin levels across time and BFA concentrations. We used this model to construct an optimal Bayesian decoder and showed that singlecell lectin measurements predict Golgi phenotypes with accuracy far greater than chance. By combining signals from two lectins we further improved prediction accuracy and speed. Such multi-lectin information may be exploited during natural cell-cell communication, and in the development of single-cell diagnostics.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

Applying this blueprint to Canadas extensive coastline, we find kelp forests store an estimated 1.4 Tg C in short-term biomass and produce 3.1 Tg C yr-1 with modest carbon fluxes to the deep ocean.

We evaluated how green jackfruit flour (JF) prevents MASH and progression to HCC and its underlying mechanisms. The study utilized two murine models that mimicked human MASLD disease: (i) a diet-induced MASH model; (ii) a MASH-HCC model induced by diet and a very low dose of CCl4. C57Bl/6 mice were fed with chow (CD) or western diet (WD) with normal (NW) or sugar water (SW) for 12 weeks, then randomized to receive either 5 kcal% green jackfruit flour (JF) or an equal volume of placebo flour (PB). The biochemical, histological, and molecular analyses were assessed. JF significantly reduced body weight, liver injury, insulin resistance, and alleviated obesity, steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor development in WDSW or WDSW/CCl4 mice compared to placebo groups. Furthermore, JF activated AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and inhibited MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways in MASH and MASH-HCC experimental models, respectively. This was supported by sodium propionate treatment, the primary short-chain fatty acid entering the liver from JFs soluble fiber microbial fermentation, which also regulated AMPK and MAPK signaling in cellular models of MASH and HCC, respectively. Hence, our findings present strong evidence of JFs therapeutic potential in the prevention of MASH and MASH-HCC, warranting further investigation of JFs efficacy as a dietary intervention in clinical trials.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models.

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

Here, we report chronic neurological dysfunction in mice infected with a virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 that does not infect the brain. Long after recovery from nasal infection, we observed loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in olfactory bulb glomeruli and neurotransmitter levels in the substantia nigra (SN) persisted. Vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in these brain areas was accompanied by increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and neurobehavioral changes. RNAseq analysis unveiled persistent microglia activation, as found in human neurodegenerative diseases. Early treatment with antivirals (nirmatrelvir and molnupiravir) reduced virus titers and lung inflammation but failed to prevent neurological abnormalities, as observed in patients. Together these results show that chronic deficiencies in neuronal function in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice are not directly linked to ongoing olfactory epithelium dysfunction. Rather, they bear similarity with neurodegenerative disease, the vulnerability of which is exacerbated by chronic inflammation.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded.

The central biological question about HD pathogenesis has been how the disease-causing DNA repeat expansion (CAGn) in the huntingtin (HTT) gene leads to neurodegeneration after decades of apparent latency. Inherited HTT alleles with a longer CAG repeat hasten disease onset; the length of this repeat also changes over time, generating somatic mosaicism, and genes that regulate DNA-repeat stability can influence HD age-at-onset. To understand the relationship between a cells CAG-repeat length and its biological state, we developed a single-cell method for measuring CAG-repeat length together with genome-wide RNA expression. We found that the HTT CAG repeat expands from 40-45 CAGs to 100-500+ CAGs in HD-vulnerable SPNs but not in other striatal cell types, with these long DNA-repeat expansions acquired at different times by individual SPNs. Surprisingly, somatic expansion from 40 to 150 CAGs had no apparent effect upon gene expression - but neurons with 150-500+ CAGs shared profound gene-expression changes. These expression changes involved hundreds of genes, escalated alongside further CAG-repeat expansion, eroded positive and then negative features of neuronal identity, and culminated in expression of senescence/apoptosis genes. Rates of striatal neuron loss across HD stages reflected the rates at which neurons entered this biologically distorted state. Our results suggest that HTT CAG repeats in striatal neurons undergo decades of biologically quiet expansion, then, as they asynchronously cross a high threshold, cause SPNs to degenerate quickly and asynchronously. We conclude that, at any moment in the course of HD, most neurons have an innocuous (but unstable) huntingtin gene, and that HD pathogenesis is a DNA process for almost all of a neurons life.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1719007735748

These ruminants were presumed not to be hosts for IAVs. Previously, IAV-positive mammalian species were hunters and scavengers, possibly getting infected while feeding on infected birds. It is now presumed that H5N1 viruses that circulate in US dairy cattle transmit through a mammary gland route, in contrast to transmission by aerosols via the respiratory tract, although the latter cannot be excluded. The receptor display in the mammary and respiratory tract in cows for IAVs is unknown. Here, we used recombinant HA proteins representing current circulating and classical H5 viruses to determine the distribution of IAV receptors in the respiratory and mammary tract tissues of cows and goats. Most of the sialome of the cow and goat respiratory tract is lined with sialic acid modifications such as N-glycolyl and O-acetyl, which are not bound by IAV. Interestingly, the H5 protein representing the cow isolates bound significantly in the mammary gland, whereas classical H5 proteins failed to do so. Furthermore, whereas the 9-O-acetyl modification is prominent in all tissues tested, the 5-N-glycolyl modification is not, resulting in the display of receptors for avian IAV hemagglutinins. This could explain the high levels of virus found in these tissues and milk, adding supporting data to this possible virus transmission route.","NA","biorxiv",1719007735748

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1719007735748

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.
