Engineered gut bacteria offer a promising alternative due to their ability to persist in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and sense and respond to specific environmental signals. However, probiotics that have previously been engineered to report on inflammatory and other disease biomarkers in the Gl tract rely on fluorescent or bioluminescent reporters, whose signals cannot be resolved in situ due to the poor penetration of light in tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce probiotic biosensors that can be imaged in situ using ultrasound - a widely available, inexpensive imaging modality providing sub-mm spatial resolution deep inside the body. These biosensors are based on the clinically approved probiotic bacterium E. coli Nissle, which we engineered to transiently colonize the GI tract, sense inflammatory biomarkers, and respond by expressing air-filled sound-scattering protein nanostructures called gas vesicles. After optimizing biomolecular signaling circuits to respond sensitively to the biomarkers thiosulfate and tetrathionate and produce strong and stable ultrasound contrast, we validated our living biosensors in vivo by noninvasively imaging antibiotic-induced inflammation in mice. By connecting cell-based diagnostic agents to ultrasound, this ""diagnostic yogurt"" will make it easier, cheaper, and less painful to diagnose and monitor IBD or other GI conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

This module demonstrated significant overlap with genes implicated in fatigue, cognitive disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Our pathway analysis revealed potential associations between ME/CFS and conditions such as COVID-19, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, neurodegenerative diseases, and pathways involved in cortisol synthesis and secretion, supporting the hypothesis that ME/CFS is a neuroimmune disorder. Additionally, our findings underscore a potential link between ME/CFS and estrogen signaling pathways, which may elucidate the higher prevalence of ME/CFS in females. These findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of ME/CFS from a network medicine perspective and highlight potential therapeutic targets. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore their implications for improving diagnosis and treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1727561316986

Mitigation of arboviral outbreaks relies largely on the use of insecticides, but the effectiveness of such responses is threatened by the evolution of insecticide resistance. Monitoring mosquito susceptibility to different insecticides is therefore vital for informed decisions regarding outbreak responses. In this study, we elucidate the patterns of resistance to two insecticide classes within the primary vectors of West Nile virus in the northeast and midwestern regions of the continental United States, Culex pipiens and Culex restuans.

Methodology/Principal FindingsEgg collections were performed throughout Illinois from 2018-2020, and adults were tested for insecticide resistance to permethrin and malathion. Individuals from each sampling location were sequenced to determine the presence of kdr target-site mutations, and biochemical assays were performed to determine increases in detoxification enzymes and insensitive acetylcholinesterase. Results from the bottle assays indicate variable resistance rates in Illinois, however lowered mortality was found in most of the regions that were tested. The kdr mutation (L1014F) was present in 50% of Culex pipiens sequenced, and more prevalent in southern Illinois compared with northern and central (p < 0.001). Different mechanisms were predictive of resistance by species and insecticide, with permethrin resistance being affected by kdr-allele frequency and oxidase levels and malathion resistance by - and {beta}-esterases in Cx. pipiens. For Cx. restuans -esterase and oxidase levels were predictive of permethrin resistance while {beta}-esterase and insensitive acetylcholinesterase levels were predictive of malathion resistance.

Conclusions/SignificanceWe documented variation in insecticide resistance levels that appear to be driven by population differences in kdr mutation rates and metabolic resistance mechanisms. The presence of different mechanisms in species and regions has implications for approaches to resistance management and highlights the need to implement and maintain insecticide resistance monitoring practices.

Author SummaryMosquitoes are the vectors of many major diseases including malaria, dengue, yellow fever, zika, and West Nile virus. Insecticides are often used to control mosquitoes and the outbreaks they cause. However, evidence has shown that populations of different mosquito species worldwide have developed resistance to our most common insecticides. This study shows that West Nile virus vectors in Illinois, (Culex pipiens and Culex restuans) are no exception to this trend. Egg collections were made throughout the state during the 2018-2020 field seasons and the resulting adults were tested for resistance to two common insecticides using the CDCs bottle bioassay protocol. The results indicate that rates of resistance vary throughout the state and population differences in resistance mechanisms are driving this variation.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Here, we investigate how extracellular pH changes with age and its impact on longevity, using fly and mouse models. We find that extracellular acidification occurs in flies during aging and correlates to mortality rate. With age, flies also become more susceptible to die from acidotic stress, which can be prevented by alkalotic treatment. Acidification is caused by insufficient acid elimination, linked to downregulation of genes in the fly excretory tract that control pH and ATP production, essential for active secretion initiation. In mice, we show that lymph-drained interstitial fluids acidify with age. Expression of genes, whose pathogenic loss-of-function variants cause tubular acidosis in humans, is decreased in the kidneys of aging mice. Overall, this study sheds light on dysregulated systemic acid-base balance as a conserved pathophysiological mechanism of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Duplicated genes expanded uniquely in the human lineage likely contributed to brain evolution, including the increased complexity of synaptic connections between neurons and the dramatic expansion of the neocortex. Discovering duplicate genes is challenging because the similarity of paralogs makes them prone to sequence-assembly errors. To mitigate this issue, we analyzed a complete telomere-to-telomere human genome sequence (T2T-CHM13) and identified 213 duplicated gene families likely containing human-specific paralogs (>98% identity). Positing that genes important in universal human brain features should exist with at least one copy in all modern humans and exhibit expression in the brain, we narrowed in on 362 paralogs with at least one copy across thousands of ancestrally diverse genomes and present in human brain transcriptomes. Of these, 38 paralogs co-express in gene modules enriched for autism-associated genes and potentially contribute to human language and cognition. We narrowed in on 13 duplicate gene families with human-specific paralogs that are fixed among modern humans and show convincing brain expression patterns. Using long-read DNA sequencing revealed hidden variation across 200 modern humans of diverse ancestries, uncovering signatures of selection not previously identified, including possible balancing selection of CD8B. To understand the roles of duplicated genes in brain development, we generated zebrafish CRISPR ""knockout"" models of nine orthologs and transiently introduced mRNA-encoding paralogs, effectively ""humanizing"" the larvae. Morphometric, behavioral, and single-cell RNA-seq screening highlighted, for the first time, a possible role for GPR89B in dosage-mediated brain expansion and FRMPD2B function in altered synaptic signaling, both hallmark features of the human brain. Our holistic approach provides important insights into human brain evolution as well as a resource to the community for studying additional gene expansion drivers of human brain evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

However, our understanding of how sequence variation impacts the functional activity of RDs is limited. To address this gap, we generated a high-throughput mutational scanning dataset measuring the repressor activity of 115,000 variant sequences spanning more than 50 RDs in human cells. We identified thousands of clinical variants with loss or gain of repressor function, including TWIST1 HLH variants associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and MECP2 domain variants associated with Rett syndrome. We also leveraged these data to annotate short linear interacting motifs (SLiMs) that are critical for repression in disordered RDs. Then, we designed a deep learning model called TENet (Transcriptional Effector Network) that integrates sequence, structure and biochemical representations of sequence variants to accurately predict repressor activity. We systematically tested generalization within and across domains with varying homology using the mutational scanning dataset. Finally, we employed TENet within a directed evolution sequence editing framework to tune the activity of both structured and disordered RDs and experimentally test thousands of designs. Our work highlights critical considerations for future dataset design and model training strategies to improve functional variant prioritization and precision design of synthetic regulatory proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

However, the contribution of lysogenic phages to the incidence of AMR is poorly understood. Here, in a set of 187 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from 82 patients with CF, we evaluate the links between prophages and both genomic and phenotypic resistance to five anti-pseudomonal antibiotics: tobramycin, colistin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, aztreonam, and tazobactam. We find that P. aeruginosa isolates contain on average 3.06 +/-1.84 (SD) predicted prophages. We find no significant association between the number of prophages per isolate and the mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) for any of these antibiotics. We then investigate the relationship between particular prophages and AMR. We identify a single lysogenic phage that is associated with phenotypic resistance to the antibiotic tobramycin. Consistent with this association, we identify AMR genes associated with resistance to tobramycin in these strains and find that they are not encoded directly on prophage sequences.

Their significance is highlighted by peroxisome biogenesis disorders; severe childhood diseases marked by disrupted lipid metabolism. One mechanism regulating peroxisome abundance is through selective ubiquitylation of peroxisomal membrane proteins that triggers peroxisome degradation via selective autophagy (pexophagy). However, the mechanisms regulating pexophagy remain poorly understood in mammalian cells. Here we show that the evolutionarily conserved AAA-ATPase p97 and its membrane embedded adaptor UBXD8 are essential for maintaining peroxisome abundance. From quantitative proteomic studies we reveal that loss of UBXD8 affects many peroxisomal proteins. We find depletion of UBXD8 results in a loss of peroxisomes in a manner that is independent of the known role of UBXD8 in ER associated degradation (ERAD). Loss of UBXD8 or inhibition of p97 increases peroxisomal turnover through autophagy and can be rescued by depleting key autophagy proteins or overexpressing the deubiquitylating enzyme USP30. Furthermore, we find increased ubiquitylation of the peroxisomal membrane protein PMP70 in cells lacking UBXD8 or p97.

We reasoned that while residue level descriptions of biomolecules are efficient for de novo structure prediction, for probing heterogeneity of interactions with small molecules in the folded state an entirely atomic level description could have advantages in speed and generality. We developed a graph neural network called ChemNet trained to recapitulate correct atomic positions from partially corrupted input structures from the Cambridge Structural Database and the Protein Data Bank; the nodes of the graph are the atoms in the system. ChemNet accurately generates structures of diverse organic small molecules given knowledge of their atom composition and bonding, and given a description of the larger protein context, and builds up structures of small molecules and protein side chains for protein-small molecule docking. Because ChemNet is rapid and stochastic, ensembles of predictions can be readily generated to map conformational heterogeneity. In enzyme design efforts described here and elsewhere, we find that using ChemNet to assess the accuracy and pre-organization of the designed active sites results in higher success rates and higher activities; we obtain a preorganized retroaldolase with a kcat/KM of 11000 M-1min- 1, considerably higher than any pre-deep learning design for this reaction. We anticipate that ChemNet will be widely useful for rapidly generating conformational ensembles of small molecule and small molecule-protein systems, and for designing higher activity preorganized enzymes.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

The in vitro enzymatic activity of nsp14 ExoN is enhanced in the presence of the cofactor nsp10. We introduced alanine substitutions in nsp14 of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) at the nsp14-10 interface and recovered mutant viruses with a range of impairments in replication and in vitro biochemical exonuclease activity.

In stark contrast to the amassed knowledge concerning the epidermal growth factor receptors themselves, the extracellular dynamics of individual EGFRLs remain elusive. Here, employing fluorescent probes and a tool for triggering ectodomain shedding of EGFRLs, we show that EREG, a low-affinity EGFRL, exhibits the most rapid and efficient activation of EGFR in confluent epithelial cells and mouse epidermis. In Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) renal epithelial cells, EGFR- and ERK-activation waves propagate during collective cell migration in an ADAM17 sheddase- and EGFRL-dependent manner. Upon induction of EGFRL shedding, radial ERK activation waves were observed in the surrounding receiver cells. Notably, the low-affinity ligands EREG and AREG mediated faster and broader ERK waves than the high-affinity ligands. The integrity of tight/adherens junctions was essential for the propagation of ERK activation, implying that the tight intercellular spaces prefer the low-affinity EGFRL to the high-affinity ligands for efficient signal transmission. To validate this observation in vivo, we generated EREG-deficient mice expressing the ERK biosensor and found that ERK wave propagation and cell migration were impaired during skin wound repair. In conclusion, we have quantitatively demonstrated the distinctions among EGFRLs in shedding, diffusion, and target cell activation in physiological contexts. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of low-affinity EGFRLs in rapid intercellular signal transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

ME/CFS diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME/CFS patients' low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n<100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME/CFS cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME/CFS status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME/CFS cases' restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME/CFS status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME/CFS status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the 'healthy volunteer' selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME/CFS diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1727561316986

Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods.

In Escherichia coli, the gene encoding RF2, prfB, contains an in-frame premature RF2-specific stop codon. Therefore, a programmed ribosomal frameshift is required to translate full-length RF2. Here, we investigate the diversity of prfB frameshifting through bioinformatic analyses of >12,000 genomes. We present evidence that prfB frameshifting autoregulates RF2 levels throughout the bacterial domain since (i) the prfB in-frame stop codon is always TGA or TAA, both of which are recognized by RF2, and never the RF1-specific TAG stop codon, and (ii) species that lack the autoregulatory programmed frameshift likely need higher RF2 levels since, on average, they have significantly higher RF2-specific stop codon usage. Overexpression of prfB without the autoregulatory frameshift motif is toxic to Bacillus subtilis, an organism with intermediate RF2-specific stop codon usage. We did not detect the programmed frameshift in any Actinobacteriota. Consistent with this finding, we observed very low frameshift efficiency at the prfB frameshift motif in the Actinobacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis. Our work provides a more complete picture of the evolution of the RF2 programmed frameshifting motif, and its usage to prevent toxic overexpression of RF2.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

This study investigated this concept using a psoriasis humanized mouse model.

MethodsHealthy human skin was grafted onto SCID/beige mice (n=25), and one month later, psoriatic lesions were induced by intradermal injection of autologous, in vitro IL-2- preactivated PBMCs. Following lesion development, topical dexamethasone (DEX) was applied to induce lesion remission. After lesions disappeared, the mice were exposed to either sonic or sham stress for 24 hours.

ResultsSonic stress led to the relapse of psoriatic lesions in all human skin xenografts within 14 days. This relapse was associated with significant changes in psoriasis-related skin characteristics: increased epidermal thickness, K16 expression, keratinocyte proliferation, antimicrobial peptide expression (S100A7, h{beta}2-defensin), and immune activation markers (HLA-DR, ICAM-1, CD1d, MICA-NKG2D). Additionally, epidermal and dermal immune cells (CD3+, CD8+, CD11c+, CD56+, ILC3, c-KIT+ or tryptase+ cells) and psoriasis-associated pro-inflammatory mediators (CXCL10, IL-22, IL-15, IL-17A/F, IFN-{gamma}, and TNF) were found to be increased. Neurogenic inflammation biomarkers (NGF, NK1-R, and substance P) were also significantly upregulated in stressed mice. Treatment with the FDA-approved neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, aprepitant, prevented stress-induced psoriatic relapses in 4 out of 5 mice and normalized most inflammatory and neurobiological markers.

ConclusionsThese findings provide novel, conclusive evidence that perceived stress can trigger psoriatic lesions in human skin xenografts in vivo and highlight the role of substance P-dependent neurogenic inflammation in this process.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Here we show that during KSHV infection, kaposin acts in cis as an architectural RNA to rebuild cellular nuclear speckles (NSs) to sites proximal to the viral genome to optimize viral gene expression. We show kaposin RNA is both necessary and sufficient for NS remodelling, and ablating kaposin colocalization with NSs using kaposin-deficient recombinant viruses impairs viral gene expression. This is the first example of an RNA (cellular or viral) capable of scaffolding NS and the first study to define kaposin as an important regulator of KSHV gene expression and, by extension, KSHV-associated disease.

Based on re-analysis of three pre-existing perceptual choice datasets, the authors claim that application of a deconvolution method designed to account for the overlap of stimulus- and response-aligned components, eliminates key signatures of evidence accumulation from the CPP measured in response-aligned average waveforms. From this the authors conclude that these apparent signatures were an artifact of component overlap and that the CPP may not trace evidence accumulation. Here, we argue that the analysis and interpretation of these perceptual choice data are critically flawed. First, we demonstrate with simple simulations that the deconvolution method used by the authors is categorically not designed to correctly capture evidence accumulation signals and, consequently, cannot reliably determine their presence or absence. Second, even within the parameters of their approach, we highlight that the results presented do not in fact support their claim that deconvolution eliminates evidence accumulation signatures from the CPP. Lastly, we list numerous signatures of evidence accumulation identified in the CPP in previous research, other than the response-aligned average waveform criteria on which the present work narrowly focused.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Understanding the divergence of laboratory-mouse gut microbiota (LGM) from wild-mouse gut microbiota (WGM) is critical, because LGM and WGM have been previously shown to differentially affect mouse immune-cell proliferation2,3, infection resistance4, cancer progression2, and ability to model drug outcomes for humans5. Here, we show that laboratory mice have retained gut bacterial symbiont lineages that diversified in parallel (co-diversified) with rodent species for > 25 million years, but that LGM strains of these ancestral symbionts have experienced accelerated accumulation of genetic load during the past [~] 120 years of captivity. Compared to closely related WGM strains, co-diversified LGM strains displayed significantly faster genome-wide rates of fixation of nonsynonymous mutations, indicating elevated genetic drift, a difference that was absent in non-co-diversified symbiont clades. Competition experiments in germ-free mice further indicated that LGM strains within co-diversified clades displayed significantly reduced fitness in vivo compared to WGM relatives to an extent not observed within non-co-diversified clades. Thus, stochastic processes (e.g., bottlenecks), not natural selection in the laboratory, have been the predominant evolutionary forces underlying divergence of co-diversified symbiont strains between laboratory and wild house mice. Our results show that gut bacterial lineages conserved in diverse rodent species have acquired novel mutational burdens in laboratory mice, providing an evolutionary rationale for restoring laboratory mice with wild gut bacterial strain diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Beyond the plasma membrane, GPCRs can initiate unique signaling cascades from various subcellular locations, a phenomenon known as ""location bias"". Here, we investigate how beta-arrestins direct location-biased signaling of the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R). Using novel bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) conformational biosensors and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity reporters, we reveal that in response to the endogenous agonist Angiotensin II and the beta-arrestin-biased agonist TRV023, beta-arrestin 1 and beta-arrestin 2 adopt distinct conformations across different subcellular locations, which are intricately linked to differential ERK activation profiles. We also uncover a population of receptor-free catalytically activated beta-arrestins in the plasma membrane that exhibits insensitivity to different agonists and promotes ERK activation on the plasma membrane independent of G proteins. These findings deepen our understanding of GPCR signaling complexity and also highlight the nuanced roles of beta-arrestins beyond traditional G protein pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Considerable efforts have identified shared and tissue-specific gene programs for macrophages across organs during homeostasis. This information has dramatically enhanced our understanding of tissue-restricted macrophage programming and function. However, few studies have addressed the overlapping and tissue-specific responses of macrophage subsets following inflammatory responses. One subset of macrophages that has been observed across several studies, lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs), have gained interest due to their unique role in lipid metabolism and potential as a therapeutic target. LAMs have been associated with regulating disease outcomes in metabolically related disorders including atherosclerosis, obesity, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data to profile LAMs across multiple tissues and sterile inflammatory conditions in mice and humans. Integration of data from various disease models revealed that LAMs share a set of conserved transcriptional profiles, including Trem2 and Lpl, but also identified key sets of tissue-specific LAM gene programs. Importantly, the shared LAM markers were highly conserved with human LAM populations that also emerge in chronic inflammatory settings. Overall, this analysis provides a detailed transcriptional landscape of tissue-restricted and shared LAM gene programs and offers insights into their roles in metabolic and chronic inflammatory diseases. These data may help instruct appropriate targets for broad or tissue-restricted therapeutic interventions to modulate LAM populations in disease.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Skin contains diverse immune cell types and is critically dependent on calcium signaling for homeostasis and repair, yet the dynamics and functions of calcium in skin immune cells remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize calcium activity in Langerhans cells, skin-resident macrophages responsible for surveillance and clearance of cellular debris after tissue damage. Langerhans cells reside in the epidermis and extend dynamic dendrites in close proximity to adjacent keratinocytes and somatosensory peripheral axons. We find that homeostatic Langerhans cells exhibit spontaneous and transient changes in calcium activity, with calcium flux occurring primarily in the cell body and rarely in the dendrites. Triggering somatosensory axon degeneration increases the frequency of calcium activity in Langerhans cell dendrites. By contrast, we show that Langerhans cells exhibit a sustained increase in intracellular calcium following engulfment of damaged keratinocytes. Altering intracellular calcium activity leads to a decrease in engulfment efficiency of keratinocyte debris. Our findings demonstrate that Langerhans cells exhibit context-specific changes in calcium activity and highlight the utility of skin as an accessible model for imaging calcium dynamics in tissue-resident macrophages.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

The functionality of these anchors is influenced by the residence time of CTCF on chromatin, which is determined by its binding affinity and its interactions with nucleosomes and other chromatin-associated factors. In this study, we demonstrate that CTCF occupancy is driven by CTCF motifs strategically positioned at the entry sites of a well-positioned nucleosome, such that, upon binding, the N-terminus of CTCF is oriented towards the nucleosome. We refer to this nucleosome as the CTCF priming nucleosome (CpN). CTCF recognizes its binding sites if they are not methylated. It can then displace the CpN, provided the nucleosome is not marked by CpG methylation or repressive histone modifications. Under these permissive conditions, the N-terminus of CTCF recruits SMARCA5 to reposition the CpN downstream, thereby creating nucleosome-free regions that enhance CTCF occupancy and cohesin stalling. In contrast, when CpNs carry repressive epigenetic marks, CTCF binding is transient, without nucleosome displacement or chromatin opening. In such cases, cohesin is not effectively retained at CTCF binding sites. We propose that the epigenetic status of CpNs governs cell-specific CTCF binding patterns, ensuring the maintenance of chromatin architecture throughout the cell cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Despite their growing application, a significant challenge remains in ensuring the reproducibility of GEMs, primarily due to inconsistent reporting and inadequate model documentation of model results. Addressing this gap, we introduce FROG analysis, a community driven initiative aimed at standardizing reproducibility assessments of CBMs and GEMs. The FROG framework encompasses four key analyses including Flux variability, Reaction deletion, Objective function, and Gene deletion to produce standardized, numerically reproducible FROG reports. These reports serve as reference datasets, enabling model evaluators, curators, and independent researchers to verify the reproducibility of GEMs systematically. BioModels, a leading repository of systems biology models, has integrated FROG analysis into its curation workflow, enhancing the reproducibility and reusability of submitted GEMs. In our study evaluating 65 GEM submissions from the community, approximately 40% reproduced without intervention, 28% requiring minor adjustments, and 32% needing input from authors. The standardization introduced by FROG analysis facilitated the detection and resolution of issues, ultimately leading to the successful reproduction of all models. By establishing a standardized and comprehensive approach to evaluating GEM reproducibility, FROG analysis significantly contributes to making CBMs and GEMs more transparent, reusable, and reliable for the broader scientific community.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Here, we couple stable isotope pulse-labeling and mass spectrometry to quantify and kinetically model proteome dynamics following mTOR inhibition in cultured human cells.

Using established sequence-to-structure relationships, it is possible to generate various coiled-coil assemblies with predictable numbers and orientations of helices. Here we target new assemblies, namely A3B3 heterohexamer alpha-helical barrels. These designs are based on pairs of sequences with 3-heptad repeats (abcdefg) programmed with a = Leu, d = Ile, e = Ala, and g = Ser, and b = c = Glu to make the acidic (A) chains and b = c = Lys in the basic (B) chains. These design rules ensure that the desired oligomeric state and stoichiometry are readily achieved. However, controlling the orientation of neighboring helices (parallel or anti- parallel) is less straightforward. Surprisingly, we find that assembly and helix orientation are sensitive to the starting position of the heptad repeats (the register) in the peptide sequences. Peptides starting at g (g-register) form a parallel 6-helix barrel in solution and in an X-ray crystal structure, whereas the b- and c-register peptides form an antiparallel complex. In lieu of experimental X-ray structures for b- and c-register peptides, AlphaFold-Multimer is used to predict atomistic models. However, considerably more sampling than the default value is required to match the models and the experimental data, as many confidently predicted and plausible models are generated with incorrect helix orientations.

By incrementally adding more dimensions of brain organization (via functional gradients), we were able to show that increasing amounts of variance in the map of brain energy expenditure could be accounted for. In particular, the brain organization dimensions that explained a large amount of the variance in intrinsic brain function also explained a large amount of the regional variance in the energy expenditure maps. This was particularly true for brain organization maps based on the strongest connections, suggesting that ""weak"" connections may not explain as much energy variance. Notably, our topological model was more effective than random brain organization configurations, suggesting that brain organization may be specifically associated with energy optimization. Finally, using brain asymmetry as a model for metabolic efficiency, we found that optimizing energy expenditure independently in each hemisphere outperformed non-independent optimization. This supports the concept of hemispheric competition rather than lateralization in energy allocation. Our results demonstrate how the spatial organization of functional connections is systematically linked to optimized energy expenditure in the human brain, providing new insights into the metabolic basis of brain function.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

In the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, HU is the only identified NAP, and its role in chromosome conformation and other essential processes has not yet been investigated. Here, we use a multi-scale approach to explore the role of HU in chromosome conformation and segregation dynamics. By combining superresolution microscopy and whole-genome binding analysis, we describe the nucleoid as a dynamic structure where HU binds transiently across the entire nucleoid, with a preference for the origin of replication over the terminus. Reducing cellular HU levels impacts nucleoid maintenance and disrupts robust nucleoid scaling with cell size. This effect is similar to the distortion caused by fluoroquinolone-antibiotics, supporting earlier observations that HU is essential for maintaining DNA supercoiling. Furthermore, in cells lacking HU, the replication machinery is misplaced, and cells are unable to initiate and proceed with on-going replication. Chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments revealed that HU is required to maintain cohesion between the two chromosomal arms, in a similar way to the structural maintenance of the chromosome complex SMC. Together, we show that by promoting long-range chromosome interactions and supporting the architecture of the domain encompassing the origin, HU is fundamental for chromosome integrity and the intimately related processes of chromosome replication and segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Honeybees, with their specialized gut microbiota and well-known ecology, offer an ideal system to study this evolution. Using shotgun metagenomics on 200 honeybee workers from five species, we recovered thousands of metagenome-assembled genomes, identifying several novel bacterial species. While microbial communities were mostly host-specific, we found both specialist and generalist bacteria, even among closely related species, with notable variation between host species. Some generalists emerged host-specific only at the strain level, suggesting recent host switches. Unexpectedly, we found no evidence of codiversification between hosts and symbionts. Instead, symbiont gains, losses, and replacements led to functional differences, such as the ability to degrade pollen-derived pectin. Our results provide new insights into gut microbiota evolution and uncover the functional potential of the previously underexplored gut microbiota of these important pollinators.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

However, non-lytic spread established infections in recipient cells substantially faster than lytic spread and yielded higher rates of genome replication. While lytic spread was sensitive to the presence of capsid entry/uncoating inhibitors, non-lytic spread was not. Consistent with emerging models for non-lytic spread of enteroviruses using autophagy, reduction of LC3 levels in cells impaired non-lytic spread and elevated the fraction of virus in donor cells spreading lytically.

Although an EEG shows advantages in availability and cost compared to the current diagnostic tools, it is not routinely used in clinical practice. Previous reviews have either focused on single disease populations and/or solely on resting state EEG. To evaluate the utility of EEG for early diagnosis and differential diagnosis, we conducted a systematic review across Alzheimers disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Lewy Body Dementia (DLB).

MethodsWe searched databases Pubmed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus for articles published from 2000 to 2023 investigating resting-state and task-based EEG-markers in biomarker-proven AD, FTD and DLB.

ResultsOur search yielded a total of 12010 studies, of which 71 papers were eligible: 34 on AD, 18 on DLB and 9 on FTD. Slowing of the frequency spectrum was a common observation across diseases, achieving excellent sensitivity in AD and DLB. Research on FTD was limited and with varying results in the discrimination from healthy controls, although connectivity analysis and microstates are promising avenues. In differential diagnosis, both spectral and connectivity metrics show encouraging results. Task-based EEG emerges as a promising tool in early AD.

ConclusionEEG shows promise as a cost-effective, non-invasive tool for early detection and differential diagnosis. Future research should aim to collect standardized data from multicentric cohorts, across multiple diseases and stages, and explore the neural underpinnings of these diseases, to improve interpretability of the findings.","NA","medrxiv",1727561316986

One such process is the multi-step denitrification, the dominant pathway for bioavailable nitrogen (N) loss and nitrous oxide (N2O) production. Denitrification-derived N loss is typically measured and modeled as a single step, but observations reveal that most denitrifiers in OMZs contain only subsets (modules) of the complete pathway. Here, we identify the ecological mechanisms sustaining diverse denitrifiers, explain the observed prevalence of certain modules, and examine the implications for N loss. We describe microbial functional types carrying out diverse denitrification modules by their underlying redox chemistry, constraining their traits with thermodynamics and pathway length penalties, in an idealized OMZ ecosystem model. Biomass yields of single-step modules increase along the denitrification pathway when growth is limited by organic matter (OM), explaining the viability of populations respiring nitrite and N2O in a nitrate-filled ocean. Results predict denitrifier community succession along environmental gradients: shorter versus longer modules are favored when OM versus N limits growth, respectively, suggesting a niche for the NO3- -> NO2- module in free-living communities and for the complete pathway in organic particles, consistent with observations. The model captures and mechanistically explains the observed dominance and higher oxygen tolerance of the NO3- -> NO2- module. Results also capture observations that nitrate is the dominant source of N2O. These results advance the mechanistic understanding of the relationship between microbial ecology and N loss, which is essential for accurately predicting the ocean's future.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Moreover, microtubule-accumulated structures like swarming microtubule assemblies are attractive components for dynamic materials, such as active matter and molecular robots. Thus, dynamic control of microtubule superstructures is an important topic. However, implementing stimulus-dependent control of superstructures remains challenging. This challenge can be resolved by developing designer protein approaches. We have previously developed a Tau-derived peptide (TP), which binds to the inner or outer surface of microtubules depending on the timing of the incubation. In this report, we designed the TP-fused photo-switchable protein Dronpa (TP-Dronpa) that reversibly photoconverts between monomeric and tetrameric states to photocontrol microtubule assemblies. The formation of microtubule superstructures, including bundles and doublets, was induced by tetrameric TP-Dronpa, whereas monomeric TP-Dronpa ensured that microtubules remained dispersed. Tetrameric TP-Dronpa also induced motile aster-like structures and swarming movement of microtubules on a kinesin-coated substrate. The formation/dissociation of these microtubule superstructures can be controlled by light irradiation. This system can generate and photocontrol various microtubule superstructures and provides an approach to facilitate the assembly of dynamic materials for various applications.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Yet the role of adaptation in organismal responses to changing climates or in facilitating species invasions is still poorly understood. We conducted a large-scale trans-continental common garden experiment to understand adaptation to spatiotemporal variation in climate in the native and introduced ranges of a cosmopolitan plant species. Individuals from 96 populations of Trifolium repens (white clover) from both its native (Europe) and introduced (North America) ranges were planted into four experimental common gardens located in northern (Uppsala, Sweden) and southern (Montpellier, France) Europe, and northern (Mississauga, Canada) and southern (Louisiana, USA) North America. We recorded plant sexual and clonal fitness in each common garden and assessed whether plants are best adapted to local climates, whether the strength of local adaptation differed between the native and introduced ranges, and whether populations show evidence of rapid adaptation to recent climate change. Results show that white clover is locally adapted, particularly in lower latitude locations, but also that the most prominent bioclimatic drivers of local adaptation differed by latitude. We also found that strong local adaptation was only evident when populations were transplanted into common gardens located in the same range (native or introduced) from which they originated, indicating rapid local adaptation across a large latitudinal gradient has occurred in T. repens populations in less than 400 years since its introduction to North America. However, we do find some evidence of an adaptation lag in the northern common garden in the introduced range, with plants from historically slightly warmer climates exhibiting the greatest fitness. This indicates that despite evidence of local adaptation to historic climatic conditions and rapid local adaptation post-introduction, white clover populations may be evolving more slowly than climate change is occurring.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Fluctuating temperatures can also influence the patterns of cytosine DNA methylation, thereby influencing gene expression. However, whether these epigenetic changes provide an adaptative advantage remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that DNA methylation is required to regulate thermomorphogenesis. Hypomethylated drm1 drm2 cmt3 mutants or seedlings treated with 5-azacytidine to block DNA methylation exhibit reduced hypocotyl growth at warm temperatures, primarily due to impaired cell elongation. Moreover, DNA hypomethylation compromises auxin biosynthesis and transport in response to warmth, partially by reducing PIF4 protein levels. Notably, the loss of DNA methylation leads to increased expression of SUPPRESSOR OF drm1 drm2 cmt3 (SDC), which in turn restricts hypocotyl elongation during thermomorphogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that DNAme regulates the inhibition of SDC expression to promote gibberellin biosynthesis. Our findings underscore the critical role of DNA methylation in modulating gene expression in response to temperature fluctuations and provide new insights into the epigenetic regulation of thermomorphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Each sleep stage, such as NREM and REM, has distinct rhythms, making it even harder for models trained on awake tasks to generalise and decode memory replay during sleep. To overcome this, we developed the Sleep Interpreter (SI), an artificial neural network. We first collected a large EEG dataset from 135 participants, recording brain activity during both awake tasks and overnight sleep. Using a Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) technique with 15 pairs of auditory cues and visual images, we tracked when specific memories were reactivated during sleep. The SI model was then trained separately for NREM and REM stages, using contrastive learning to align neural patterns between wakefulness and sleep while filtering out the background rhythms that previously hindered decoding. We also examined how specific sleep rhythms, such as slow oscillations and their coupling with spindles, influenced decoding performance. In a 15-way classification task during sleep, our model achieved a Top-1 accuracy of up to 40.05% on unseen subjects, surpassing all other available decoding models. Finally, we developed a real-time sleep decoding system by integrating an online automatic sleep staging process with the SI model for each sleep stage. This ability to decode brain activity during sleep opens new avenues for exploring the functional roles of sleep. By making our dataset and decoding system publicly available, we provide a valuable resource for advancing research into sleep, memory, and related disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

However, most existing analyses rely on bulk data or cultured cell lines, which may fail to identify cell-type-specific enhancers and target genes. Recently, single-cell multimodal data measuring both gene expression and chromatin accessibility within the same cells have enabled the inference of enhancer-gene pairs in a cell-type-specific and context-specific manner. However, this task is challenged by the data's high sparsity, sequencing depth variation, and the computational burden of analyzing a large number of enhancer-gene pairs. To address these challenges, we propose scMultiMap, a statistical method that infers enhancer-gene association from sparse multimodal counts using a joint latent-variable model. It adjusts for technical confounding, permits fast moment-based estimation and provides analytically derived p-values. In systematic analyses of blood and brain data, scMultiMap shows appropriate type I error control, high statistical power with greater reproducibility across independent datasets and stronger consistency with orthogonal data modalities. Meanwhile, its computational cost is less than 1% of existing methods. When applied to single-cell multimodal data from postmortem brain samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and controls, scMultiMap gave the highest heritability enrichment in microglia and revealed new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of AD GWAS variants in microglia.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Although aPKC-Par6 can phosphorylate Lgl at three serine sites to exclude it from the apical domain, paradoxically, aPKC-Par6 and Lgl can also form a stable kinase-substrate complex whose function remains unclear and with conflicting roles proposed for Par6. We report the structure of human aPKC{iota}-Par6 bound to full-length Llgl1, captured through an aPKC{iota} docking site and a Par6 PDZ contact. This soluble tripartite complex traps a phospho-S663 Llgl1 intermediate bridging between aPKC and Par6, impeding phosphorylation progression. Thus, aPKC{iota} is effectively inhibited by Llgl1pS663 whilst Llgl1 is captured by aPKC{iota}-Par6. Mutational disruption of Lgl-aPKC interaction impedes complex assembly and Lgl phosphorylation, whereas disrupting the Lgl-Par6PDZ contact promotes complex dissociation and completion of Lgl phosphorylation cycle. We incorporate these findings into a Par6 PDZ-regulated substrate capture-and-release model that we demonstrate requires binding by Cdc42-GTP and the apical partner Crumbs to drive complex disassembly. Our results provide an explanation for the opposing roles of Par6 underpinning the spatial control of aPKC-Par6 activity by Lgl relevant to polarised membrane contexts across multi-cellular organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Traditionally inferred from allele frequency differences, the question arises how FST can be estimated and interpreted when analysing genomic datasets with low sample sizes. Here, we advocate an elegant solution first put forward by Hudson et al. (1992): FST = (Dxy -{pi} xy)/Dxy, where Dxy and{pi} xy denote mean sequence dissimilarity between and within populations, respectively. This multi-locus FST-metric can be derived from allele frequency data, but also from sequence alignment data alone, even when sample sizes are low and/or unequal. As with other FST-metrices, the numerator denotes net divergence (Da), which is equivalent to the f2-statistic and Neis D (for realistic estimates of Dxy and{pi} xy). In terms of demographic inference, net divergence measures the difference in increase of Dxy and{pi} xy since the population split, owing to a reduction of coalescence times within populations as a result of genetic drift. Because different combinations of{Delta} Dxy and{Delta}{pi} xy can produce identical FST-estimates, no universal relationship exists between FST and population split time. Still, in case of recent population splits, when novel mutations are negligible, FST-estimates can be accurately converted into coalescent units ({tau}. i.e., split time in multiples of 2Ne). This then allows to quantify gene tree discordance, without the need for multispecies coalescent based analyses, using the formula: Pdiscordance = [2/3]{middle dot}(1 - FST). To facilitate the use of the Hudson FST-metric, we implemented new utilities in the R package SambaR.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Downstream brain regions that depend on a steady supply of information from a neural population subject to this representational drift face a challenge: they must stabilise their readout using only statistical regularities in neural activity. Recent studies have described how representational drift induces deterioration in the accuracy of fixed decoders. Here, we highlight that while a variety of underlying statistics of drift at the level of individual neurons can produce comparable deterioration of a fixed decoder, these different statistics result in dramatically different deterioration rates in adaptive decoders. We describe an adaptive decoding strategy that can read out from a model drifting population long after fixed decoders degrade completely, and demonstrate that in simulated models this strategy is better-suited to heavy-tailed drift statistics, in which individual neurons make sudden and large changes in tuning. We investigate the extent to which these advantageous statistics manifest in experimental in-vivo measurements of drift by considering two existing and well-studied datasets that observe drift in the posterior parietal cortex and the visual cortex. We find preliminary support for sudden jumps in neural tuning that would allow a downstream observer to more easily distinguish changes in representation from noise. These observations are a step towards refining the larger picture of mechanisms underpinning the robustness of information transfer between brain regions that can function in spite of changes in representation driven both by drift and by the learning of new information.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Integration of both methodologies has resulted in the development of electrophilic degraders where recruitment of a suitable E3 ubiquitin ligase is achieved through formation of a covalent bond with a cysteine nucleophile. Expanding the scope of electrophilic degraders requires the development of electrophiles with tempered reactivity that enable selective ligase recruitment and reduce cross-reactivity with other cellular nucleophiles. In this study, we report the use of chemical moieties that enable nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions in the rational design of electrophilic protein degraders. Appending an SNAr covalent warhead to several preexisting small molecule inhibitors transformed them into degraders, obviating the need for a defined E3 ligase recruiter. The SNAr covalent warhead is versatile; it can recruit various E3 ligases, including DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 11 (DCAF11), DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 16 (DCAF16), and possibly others. The incorporation of an SNAr covalent warhead into the BRD4 inhibitor led to the discovery of degraders with low picomolar degradation potency. Furthermore, we demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach through rational functional switching from kinase inhibitors into potent degraders.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Vice versa, RNA can regulate the interactions and functions of the associated proteins. Dysregulation of RBPs is linked to diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders. RNA and RBPs are present in mitotic structures like the centrosomes and spindle microtubules, but their influence on mitotic spindle integrity remains unknown. Thus, we applied the R-DeeP strategy for the proteome-wide identification of RNA-dependent proteins and complexes to cells synchronized in mitosis versus interphase. The resulting atlas of RNA-dependent proteins in cell division can be accessed through the R-DeeP 3.0 database (R-DeeP3.dkfz.de). It revealed key mitotic factors as RNA-dependent such as AURKA, KIFC1 and TPX2 that were linked to RNA despite their lack of canonical RNA-binding domains. KIFC1 was identified as a new interaction partner and phosphorylation substrate of AURKA at S349 and T359. In addition, KIFC1 interacted with both, AURKA and TPX2, in an RNA-dependent manner.

However, this algorithm typically assumes that DNA is homogeneously distributed through- out the nucleus, which is not realistic. In this study, we evaluated whether stochastic simulations based on the assumption of spatial homogeneity can accurately capture the dynamics of gene regulation. Our findings indicate that when transcription factors diffuse slowly, these simulations fail to accurately capture gene expression, highlighting the necessity to account for spatial heterogeneity. However, incorporating spatial heterogeneity considerably increases computational time. To address this, we explored various stochastic quasi-steady-state approximations (QSSAs) that simplify the model and reduce simulation time. While both the stochastic total quasi-steady state approximation (stQSSA) and the stochastic low-state quasi-steady-state approximation (slQSSA) reduced simulation time, only the slQSSA provided an accurate model reduction. Our study underscores the importance of utilizing appropriate methods for efficient and accurate stochastic simulations of gene regulatory dynamics, especially when incorporating spatial heterogeneity.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

While induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) give rise to HE with robust hemogenic potential, the generation of bona fide HSCs from iPSCs remains a challenge. Here, we map single cell dynamics of EHT during embryoid body differentiation from iPSCs and integrate it with human embryo datasets to identify key transcriptional differences between in vitro and in vivo cell states. We further map ligand-receptor interactions associated with differential expression of developmental programs in the iPSC system. We found that the expression of endothelial genes was incompletely repressed during iPSC EHT. Elevated FGF signaling by FGF23, an endothelial pathway ligand, was associated with differential gene expression between in vitro and in vivo EHT. Chemical inhibition of FGF signaling during EHT increased HSPC generation in the zebrafish, while an FGF agonist had the opposite effect. Consistently, chemical inhibition of FGF signaling increased hematopoietic output from iPSCs. In summary, we map the dynamics of EHT from iPSCs at single cell resolution and identify ligand-receptor interactions that can be modulated to improve iPSC differentiation protocols. We show, as proof of principle, that chemical inhibition of FGF signaling during EHT improves hematopoietic output in zebrafish and the iPSC system.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

The cellular UndP pool is shared by other polysaccharide synthesis pathways and in peptidoglycan (PG) biogenesis. Disruptions in cytosolic polysaccharide synthesis steps are detrimental to bacterial survival due to affecting UndP recycling. In contrast, bacteria can survive disruptions in the periplasmic steps, suggesting a tolerance mechanism to mitigate UndP sequestration. Here we investigated tolerance mechanisms to disruptions of polymerases that are involved in UndP-releasing steps in two related polysaccharide synthesis pathways: the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) and the O antigen (OAg), in Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri. Our study reveals that polysaccharide polymerisation is crucial for efficient UndP recycling. In E. coli K-12, cell survival upon disruptions in OAg polymerase is dependent on a functional ECA synthesis pathway and vice versa. This is because disruptions in OAg synthesis leads to the redirection of the shared lipid-linked sugar substrate UndPP-GlcNAc towards increased ECA production. Conversely, in S. flexneri, the OAg polymerase is essential due to its limited ECA production, which inadequately redirects UndP flow to support cell survival. We propose a model whereby sharing the initial sugar intermediate UndPP-GlcNAc between the ECA and OAg synthesis pathways allows UndP to be redirected towards ECA production, mitigating sequestration issues caused by disruptions in the OAg pathway. These findings suggest an evolutionary buffering mechanism that enhances bacterial survival when UndP sequestration occurs due to stalled polysaccharide biosynthesis, which may allow polysaccharide diversity in the species to increase over time.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Occupancy of a TF inside a region of open chromatin can be detected in ATAC-seq where bound TFs block the transposase Tn5, leaving a pattern of relatively depleted Tn5 insertions known as a ""footprint"". Here, we sought to identify variants associated with TF-binding, or ""footprint quantitative trait loci"" (fpQTLs) in ATAC-seq data generated from 170 human liver samples. We used computational tools to scan the ATAC-seq reads to quantify TF binding likelihood as ""footprint scores"" at variants derived from whole genome sequencing generated in the same samples. We tested for association between genotype and footprint score and observed 693 fpQTLs associated with footprint-inferred TF binding (FDR < 5%). Given that Tn5 insertion sites are measured with base-pair resolution, we show that fpQTLs can aid GWAS and QTL fine-mapping by precisely pinpointing TF activity within broad trait-associated loci where the underlying causal variant is unknown. Liver fpQTLs were strongly enriched across ChIP-seq peaks, liver expression QTLs (eQTLs), and liver-related GWAS loci, and their inferred effect on TF binding was concordant with their effect on underlying sequence motifs in 80% of cases. We conclude that fpQTLs can reveal causal GWAS variants, define the role of TF binding site disruption in disease and provide functional insights into non-coding variants, ultimately informing novel treatments for common diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

We developed a novel murine model of spontaneous PDAC clearance, generated by overexpressing interleukin-6 (IL-6) in orthotopically implanted PDAC cancer cells (OT-PDACIL6). Circulating IL-6 was 100-fold higher in OT-PDACIL6 than in OT-PDACparental mice. OT-PDACIL6 tumors were present at 5 days post-implantation, and undetectable by 10 days post implantation. Flow cytometry revealed increased T cells and NK cells, and decreased T regulatory cells in OT-PDACIL6 as compared to OT-PDACparental tumors. Increased lymphoid aggregates were apparent by histological assessment and may account for elevated T cell content. Antibody-based depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells prevented tumor clearance and significantly reduced survival of OT-PDACIL6 mice. The anti-tumor immune response to OT-PDACIL6 rendered mice immune to re-challenge with OT-PDACparental tumors.

To uncover clinically translatable mechanisms of psychopathology, it is critical to define how the spatial organization of these networks relates to genetic risk during development. Objective: To determine the relationship between transdiagnostic polygenic risk scores (PRSs), personalized functional brain networks (PFNs), and overall psychopathology (p-factor) during early adolescence. Design: The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) StudySM is an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of 21 collection sites across the United States. Here, we conduct a cross-sectional analysis of ABCD baseline data, collected 2017-2018. Setting: The ABCD Study(R) is a multi-site community-based study. Participants: The sample is largely recruited through school systems. Exclusion criteria included severe sensory, intellectual, medical, or neurological issues that interfere with protocol and scanner contraindications. Split-half subsets were used for cross-validation, matched on age, ethnicity, family structure, handedness, parental education, site, sex, and anesthesia exposure. Exposures: Polygenic risk scores of transdiagnostic genetic factors F1 (PRS-F1) and F2 (PRS-F2) derived from adults in Psychiatric Genomic Consortium and UK Biobanks datasets. PRS-F1 indexes liability for common psychiatric symptoms and disorders related to mood disturbance; PRS-F2 indexes liability for rarer forms of mental illness characterized by mania and psychosis. Main Outcomes and Measures: (1) P-factor derived from bifactor models of youth- and parent-reported mental health assessments. (2) Person-specific functional brain network topography derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. Results: Total participants included 11,873 youths ages 9-10 years old; 5,678 (47.8%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 9.92 (0.62) years. PFN topography was found to be heritable (N=7,459, 57.06% of vertices h2 pFDR<0.05, mean h2=0.35). PRS-F1 was associated with p-factor (N=5,815, r=0.12, 95% CI [0.09--0.15], p<0.001). Interindividual differences in functional network topography were associated with p-factor (N=7,459, mean r=0.12), PRS-F1 (N=3,982, mean r=0.05), and PRS-F2 (N=3,982, mean r=0.08). Cortical maps of p-factor and PRS-F1 regression coefficients were highly correlated (r=0.7, p=0.003). Conclusions and Relevance: Polygenic risk for transdiagnostic adulthood psychopathology is associated with both p-factor and heritable PFN topography during early adolescence.

Pro-tumor stromal cells provide the essential support needed for tumor growth, metastasis, and development of drug resistance in due time. Tumor-associated macrophages, one of such cells, are essential to tumor microenvironment and tumor survival. In recent years, TAMs have been identified as potential drug targets and therapeutic agents, which encourages the in-depth characterization of their crosstalk with the tumors. The current study has successfully developed a cost-effective in vitro platform for Chemokine Assisted Recruitment of Macrophages to spheroids mimicking the physiology of TAM recruitment. Firstly, monocytic cell line (u937) were converted into activated naive macrophages (M0) and pro-and anti-inflammatory (M1 and M2) subtypes. Monocytes, M0, M1, and M2 macrophages are characterized extensively. Secondly, the naive and polarized macrophages were subjected to chemokine-dependent recruitment into monotypic and heterotypic breast cancer spheroids. The nature of the recruitment is further investigated by assessing the profile of chemokines and chemokine receptors. Recruited macrophages are also observed to manipulate spheroid behavior in many ways. The recruited macrophages also exhibit an increased level of Siglec-1 (CD169), one of the potential TAM markers. The current platform's potential for application can be extended to understand the recruitment process of other immune/stromal cells to solid tumors. It could be a potential addition to the arrays of in vitro platforms developed to screen the efficiency of cell-based immunotherapeutics in the future.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Despite their ecological significance, the diversity of microbial defense systems, their interactions, and the evolutionary arms race with viral anti-defense strategies in cold seeps remain largely unexplored. To address this, we analyzed 3,813 microbial and 13,336 viral genomes from 193 metagenomic samples collected across 17 cold seep sites. Cold seep microbes harbor an extensive repertoire of `defense systems (n = 26,389), with 63% representing novel systems. Laboratory experiments confirm that several of these novel systems effectively protect against viral infections. These defense systems frequently co-occur and interact synergistically to combat viral infections. They are widely distributed across different sediment depths and geographical locations, exhibiting active expression. In response, cold seep viruses have evolved a diverse array of anti-defense genes (n = 1,197), employing complex strategies to counteract host defenses. The concurrent presence of multiple viral anti-defense genes and various microbial defense genes in their hosts highlights the intricate and dynamic interactions between viruses and their microbial counterparts. Functionally critical lineages, such as anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME), sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), and diazotrophs, adapt their defensive strategies according to ecological niches and environmental pressures. Notably, SRB strains were found to harbor multiple Gabija defense systems, enhancing their resistance to viral attacks, while corresponding viruses carry anti-Gabija genes, illustrating a specific evolutionary adaptation. Overall, these findings underscore the critical role of virus-microbe interactions in shaping microbial metabolic functions and environmental adaptation in extreme deep-sea subseafloor environments.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

This observational study includes 12 post-COVID patients exhibiting a predominance of ME/CFS symptoms alongside increased concentrations of autonomic nervous system receptors (ANSR) autoantibodies and neurological impairments. We found that following immunoadsorption therapy, the ANSR autoantibodies were nearly eliminated from the patients' blood.

Prior work showed that coccidioidomycosis cases in California sharply increase by nearly 2-fold following wet winters that occur one- and two-years following drought. Statewide drought between 2020-2022 followed by heavy precipitation during the 2022-2023 winter raised concerns over potential increases in coccidioidomycosis cases in the fall of 2023, prompting California Department of Public Health (CDPH) to issue public health alerts. As anticipated, California saw a near record number of cases in 2023, with 9,054 provisional cases reported. During the 2023-2024 California wet season, precipitation was 115% the long-term average, furthering concerns about continued high coccidioidomycosis risk. We developed an ensemble model to forecast coccidioidomycosis cases in California in 2024-2025. Using this model, we predicted a total of 11,846 cases (90% PI: 10,056-14,094) in California between April 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024, encompassing the preliminary state report of 10,593.

There are uncertainties about whether treatments in the acute or post-acute phase of infection can prevent PCC. We report an update to a previous systematic review on the effects of interventions to prevent PCC.

MethodsWe updated our previous peer-reviewed searches on February 9, 2024. We searched bibliographic databases and grey literature resources to identify trials and comparative observational studies reporting on any intervention provided during the acute (symptom onset to 4 weeks) or post-acute phase (4-8 weeks) of COVID-19 and our primary outcome of incidence of PCC, ascertained at 3 months or longer following infection and capturing, at a minimum, symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea and one or more aspects of cognitive function. Non-recovery from COVID-19 was included if necessary. Secondary outcomes included fatigue, breathlessness/dyspnea, post-exertional malaise, health-related quality of life, psychopathology, cognitive impairment, hospitalization, return to work/education, and adverse effects of the intervention. For screening we employed artificial intelligence to prioritize records and modified our methods to rely on single-reviewer screening after 50% of citations were screened in duplicate. Study selection and risk of bias assessments were conducted independently by two reviewers and data extraction relied on verification of another reviewers work. We grouped studies by intervention type and timing, and by acute-care setting, and performed meta-analysis where appropriate. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the primary outcome, excluding studies with high risk of bias, using non-recovery as a proxy outcome, and evaluating the outcome at more than 12 months of follow-up. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

ResultsTwenty-four studies (5 randomized and 19 non-randomized), all among adults, were included. The acute care setting in nine studies was outpatient and in 15 studies was in-patient; all but one intervention was administered during the acute-phase of illness. The use of convalescent plasma in outpatient acute COVID-19 care probably does not reduce the risk of PCC (relative risk [RR]: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.77-1.12; 1 RCT; moderate certainty). There was low-certainty evidence suggesting that probiotics (RR [95% CI]: 0.32 [0.13-0.78]; 1 RCT) and metformin (0.50 [0.25-0.99]; 1 RCT among individuals with a BMI [&ge;]25 kg/m2) reduce PCC to a small-to-moderate extent in outpatients, while ivermectin (outpatients), antivirals (outpatients), steroids (in-patients), and therapeutic-dose heparin (vs. prophylactic dose; in-patients) may not be effective. Evidence was very low certainty for several other acute-phase pharmacologic intervention and post-acute outpatient assessment and referrals. For outpatient antiviral treatment, while overall PCC risk may not decrease, there might be a slight reduction in psychopathology. Similarly, inpatient antiviral use may not prevent PCC but may offer a small reduction in prolonged general malaise after light exertion. Therapeutic-dose heparin may slightly reduce the risk of cognitive impairment compared to prophylactic-dose heparin among in-patients. The findings remained consistent across all these sensitivity analyses.

ConclusionsEvidence suggests that PCC can be prevented to some extent among outpatients with the use of probiotics and metformin during the acute phase of COVID-19. Effects from interventions used among in-patients and within the post-acute phase are uncertain at this time. Evidence on commonly recommended interventions including rehabilitation or multidisciplinary care was lacking.

In cell culture this can occur by the induction of intercellular membrane connections known as tunnelling nanotube-like structures (TLSs), which are capable of trafficking the viral genome between cells. Here, we showed that TLSs are present at the site of IAV infections in vivo, and then used in vitro models to ask how IAVs induce their formation. We found that TLS induction cannot be induced by cytokine signalling from infected to uninfected cells, but requires IAV replication within cells. IAV replication can form filamentous virions with structural similarities to TLSs, but we found that TLS induction is independent of virion morphology. We therefore looked at the intracellular responses to infection. Using a pan-caspase inhibitor, we found that TLS induction by IAVs requires the onset of apoptosis. Our results, which suggest that IAVs control their ability to spread directly from cell to cell by driving infected cells into apoptosis, identifies a new way in which a virus can manipulate its host to evade antiviral immune responses.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

As such, the endolysosomal system plays a critical role in determining the abundance of proteins on the cell surface, influencing cellular identity and function. Highly polarized cells, like neurons, rely on the endolysosomal system for axonal and dendritic specialization and synaptic compartmentalization. The importance of this system to neuronal function is reflected by the prevalence of risk variants in components of the system in several neurodegenerative diseases, ranging from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, our understanding of endocytic cargo and core endolysosomal machinery in neurons is limited, in part due to technical limitations. Here, we developed a toolkit for capturing EEA1-postive endosomes (Endo-IP) and TMEM192-positive lysosomes (Lyso-IP) in stem cell-derived induced neurons (iNeurons). We demonstrated its utility by revealing the endolysosomal protein landscapes for cortical-like iNeurons and stem cells. This allowed us to globally profile endocytic cargo, identifying hundreds of transmembrane proteins, including neurogenesis and synaptic proteins, as well as endocytic cargo with predicted SNX17 or SNX27 recognition motifs. By contrast, parallel lysosome profiling reveals a simpler protein repertoire, reflecting in part temporally controlled recycling or degradation for many endocytic targets. This system will facilitate mechanistic interrogation of endolysosomal components found as risk factors in neurodegenerative disease.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Cellular senescence, characterized by the irreversible cessation of cell division, is a critical process in placental function and its dysregulation has been implicated in pregnancy complications like preterm birth. Senescence can be induced by various stressors, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, and viral infections. Method of Study: In this study, we determined whether COVID-19 had an impact on placental senescence. We examined placentas from women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=10 term, 4 preterm) compared to uninfected controls (n=10 term, 3 preterm). The placentas were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication (Spike and Nucleocapsid viral proteins), markers of DNA damage ({gamma}H2AX) and oxidative stress (ROS), and senescence (telomere length; cell cycle regulators, SASP). Results: While no overall differences in cellular senescence markers were observed between the COVID-19 positive and negative groups, we found increased secreted SASP markers and confocal microscopy revealed localized areas of oxidative stress and DNA damage in the placentas from COVID-19 positive cases. Conclusions: These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces localized placental damage, warranting further investigation into its impact on maternal and perinatal outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Downstream effectors activated by cOAs are typically non-specific proteins that induce damage to essential cellular components, thereby preventing phage epidemics. Due to these toxic effects, it is crucial that the production and concentration of cOAs remain under tight regulatory control during infection-free periods or when deactivating the immune response after clearing an infection. Type III CRISPR loci often encode enzymes known as ring nucleases (RNs) that bind and degrade specific cOAs, while some effectors are auto-deactivating. Despite the discovery of several classes of RNs, a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of type III CRISPR-Cas loci in this context is lacking. Here, we examined 38,742 prokaryotic genomes to provide a global overview of type III CRISPR loci, focussing on the known and predicted RNs. The candidate RNs Csx16 and Csx20 are confirmed as active enzymes, joining Crn1-3. Distributions and patterns of co-occurrence of RNs and associated effectors are explored, allowing the conclusion that a sizeable majority of type III CRISPR systems regulate cOA levels by degrading the signalling molecules, which has implications for cell fate following viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Previous evaluations have shown that pre-trained gLMs can be leveraged to improve predictive performance across a broad range of regulatory genomics tasks, albeit using relatively simple benchmark datasets and baseline models. Since the gLMs in these studies were tested upon fine-tuning their weights for each downstream task, determining whether gLM representations embody a foundational understanding of cis-regulatory biology remains an open question. Here we evaluate the representational power of pre-trained gLMs to predict and interpret cell-type-specific functional genomics data that span DNA and RNA regulation.

Here, we report that lymphoid stroma-secreted ligands for CCR7 constrained interaction duration by gradually inducing CD8+ T cell release from DCs. At late time points of interactions, CCR7 ligands repositioned the F-actin-promoting factor DOCK2 away from the DC interface to enable CD8+ T cell detachment, proliferation onset and acquisition of cytotoxicity. Lack of CCR7 signaling, as during ex vivo activation or in chronically inflamed lymphoid tissue, caused sustained T cell-DC interactions, and generated dysfunctional TEFF with high expression of inhibitory receptors, impaired antimicrobial activity, and poor recall responses.

Explosive growth of targeted protein degradation (TPD) drug development has spurred renewed interest in proximity-inducing molecules and especially Molecular Glue Degraders (MGDs). These compounds catalyze destruction of disease-causing proteins by reshaping protein surfaces and promoting cooperative binding between ubiquitylating enzymes and target proteins. MGD discovery for pre-defined targets is a major challenge in contemporary drug discovery. The field is limited by a lack of approaches that can exploit charged ligand-binding pockets, thus excluding a major fraction of ubiquitin ligases (E3s) that evolved to recognize exceedingly common acidic and basic degrons. Here we solve these important chemical challenges through chemocentric MGD discovery of ZZ1, a BET-family protein degrader and a prodrug of a negatively charged glue (c-Glue). ZZ1 activation unmasks a sulfinic acid moiety that binds the modular GID/CTLH ubiquitin ligase complex via a basic pocket in its YPEL5 subunit. YPEL5 is a CRBN structural homolog and an essential non-Cullin ubiquitin ligase cofactor expressed in cancers of the bone marrow. These findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized capacity of YPEL5 to recruit GID/CTLH substrates, and they provide a powerful strategy to discover c-Glues that induce proximity to ubiquitin ligases with similarly desirable properties.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Combination of variant effect data from several such experiments provides the opportunity to conduct large-scale analyses of variant effect scores measured across proteins, but can be complicated by variations in the phenotypes that are probed across experiments. Thus, using variant effect datasets obtained with similar MAVE techniques can help reveal general rules governing the effects of amino acid variation for a single molecular phenotype. In this work, we accordingly combined data from six individual variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq) experiments and analysed a total of 31,614 variant effect scores reporting solely on the impact of single amino acid residue substitutions on the cellular abundance of proteins. Using our combined variant effect dataset, we derived and analysed a collection of amino acid substitution matrices describing the average impact on cellular abundance of all residue substitution types in different structural environments. We found that the substitution matrices predict the cellular abundance of protein variants with surprisingly high accuracy when given structural information only in the form of whether a residue is buried or exposed. We thus propose our substitution matrix-based predictions as strong baselines for future abundance model development.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Maintaining stiffness in the vane would have been crucial in early pterosaur flight, but how this was achieved has been unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats.

Previous studies have reported that overexpression of ASCL1 or combinations of proneural factors in Muller glia (MG) induces regeneration of functional neurons in the adult mouse retina. Recently, we applied the same strategy in dissociated cultures of fetal human MG and although we stimulated neurogenesis from MG, our effect in 2D cultures was modest and our analysis of newborn neurons was limited. In this study, we aimed to improve our MG reprogramming strategy in a more intact retinal environment. For this purpose, we used an in vitro culture system of human fetal retinal tissue and adult human postmortem retina. To stimulate reprogramming, we used lentiviral vectors to deliver constructs with a glial-specific promoter (HES1) driving ASCL1 alone or in combination with additional developmental transcription factors such as ATOH1 and NEUROD1.

Endogenous electric fields, generated by the disruption of the transepithelial potential across the skin, help to guide the movement of immune and skin cells toward the wound site. However, the mechanisms by which cells sense these physical cues remain largely unknown. Through a CRISPR-based screen, we identified Galvanin, a previously uncharacterized single-pass transmembrane protein that is required for human neutrophils to change their direction of migration in response to an applied electric field. Our results indicate that Galvanin rapidly relocalizes to the anodal side of a cell on exposure to an electric field, and that the net charge on its extracellular domain is necessary and sufficient to drive this relocalization. The spatial pattern of neutrophil protrusion and retraction changes immediately upon Galvanin relocalization, suggesting that it acts as a direct sensor of the electric field that then transduces spatial information about a cells electrical environment to the migratory apparatus. The apparent mechanism of cell steering by sensor relocalization represents a new paradigm for directed cell migration.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

While local adaptation does not manifest in obvious morphological changes, population genomic studies can reveal cryptic diversity and provide insights into local adaptive processes. In this study, we investigated the biogeographic history and genomic diversity across the range of the zebra longwing butterfly Heliconius charithonia, a species with a widespread distribution in the Neotropics, but which is phenotypically homogenous across its range. We examined whole genome sequence data from 55 individuals from the eight described subspecies. We infer that there were at least two distinct colonization events of the Caribbean islands from the mainland. The second colonization wave occurred relatively recently, accounting for the genetic homogeneity observed across the species range. Despite low divergence across most of the genome, two large non-recombining genomic regions showed deeply divergent haplotypes that correspond to chromosomal inversions. Phylogenetic analyses indicate ancient origins of these inversion polymorphisms, and there is no evidence that they were introgressed from another extant lineage of Heliconius. These ancient polymorphisms are likely maintained by heterogeneous selection across the landscape, with the inversion on chromosome 19 likely playing a role in local adaptation to cold and desiccation. Our findings underscore the importance of genomic analysis in uncovering hidden diversity and adaptation in phenotypically homogenous species and highlight the significant role of chromosomal inversions in driving local adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

Genetic effects on gene expression have been extensively characterized by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies, yet data from non-European populations is limited. This restricts our understanding of disease to genes whose regulatory variants are common in European populations. While previous work has leveraged data from multiple populations to improve GWAS power and polygenic risk score (PRS) accuracy, multi-ancestry data has not yet been used to better estimate cis-genetic effects on gene expression. Here, we present a new method, Multi-Ancestry Gene Expression Prediction Regularized Optimization (MAGEPRO), which constructs robust genetic models of gene expression in understudied populations or cell types by fitting a regularized linear combination of eQTL summary data across diverse cohorts. In simulations, our tool generates more accurate models of gene expression than widely-used LASSO and the state-of-the-art multi-ancestry PRS method, PRS-CSx, adapted to gene expression prediction. We attribute this improvement to the ability of MAGEPRO to more accurately estimate causal eQTL effect sizes (p<3.98x10^(-4), two-sided paired t-test). With real data, we applied MAGEPRO to 8 eQTL cohorts representing 3 ancestries (average n=355) and consistently outperformed each of 6 competing methods in gene expression prediction tasks. Integration with GWAS summary statistics across 66 complex traits (representing 22 phenotypes and 3 ancestries) resulted in 2,331 new gene-trait associations, many of which replicate across multiple ancestries, including PHTF1 linked to white blood cell count, a gene which is overexpressed in leukemia patients. MAGEPRO also identified biologically plausible novel findings, such as PIGB, an essential component of GPI biosynthesis, associated with heart failure, which has been previously evidenced by clinical outcome data. Overall, MAGEPRO is a powerful tool to enhance inference of gene regulatory effects in underpowered datasets and has improved our understanding of population-specific and shared genetic effects on complex traits.","NA","medrxiv",1727561316986

This study aimed to investigate the significance of the airborne transmissions and the effectiveness of air cleaning in reducing infections among children in daycare. Methods A cross-over study was conducted in four daycare centers in Helsinki. All children attending the daycare were invited to participate (n = 262) and the sole inclusion criterion was that the children were expected to stay in the same day care center for the two-year duration of the study. 51 subjects were included in the final analysis. Clean air flow rate was increased by 2.1-2.9 times compared to baseline mechanical ventilation of the premises. The effect of intervention was assessed using negative binomial regression. Results The intervention reduced incident infections from 0.95 to 0.78 infections per child per month among the children (primary outcome) in daycare. The reduction attributed to intervention in the statistical model was 18.0 % (95% CI 2.1-31.3 %, p = 0.028). Conclusions We observed a significant decrease in incident infections without implementing any other infection mitigation strategies but air cleaning. Our results challenge the current paradigm which emphasizes fomite and contact transmission and infection control measures that target these pathways. As ventilation and air cleaning can only affect particles able to float in the air stream, our results support the significance of airborne transmission among common respiratory pathogens as well as air cleaning as an infection control measure.","NA","medrxiv",1727561316986

Metabolic pathway kinases (VIP1/VIHs) leading to the production of PP-InsPs are now well characterized in yeast and plants. Previously, the wheat inositol pyrophosphate kinase (TaVIH2) was shown to encode a catalytic active kinase domain. Heterologous expression of TaVIH2 in Arabidopsis thaliana showed enhanced drought tolerance by modulating the cell composition. In this study, we attempted to identify the interacting protein targets of wheat VIH2-3B using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) cDNA library screen, identifying 52 putative interactors that are primarily involved in cell wall-related functions. Notably, fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein (FLA7), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein emerged as the most frequently interacting partner in the screen. Further analysis using pull-down assays validated the interaction between TaVIH2-3B and TaFLA7 in vivo. Using the reporter fusion studies, we observed the localization of TaFLA7 to be a plasma membrane. We also observed that this localization of the FLA7 was perturbed in the yeast vip1delta strain. The expression of TaVIH2-3B bearing PP-InsP5K enzymatic activity in yeast mutants rescued the localisation of the FLA7 to the membrane. Expression analysis of TaFLA7 showed differential expression response under drought in wheat shoot tissues. TaFLA7 was also found to be highly expressed during grain development, particularly in the endosperm and seed coat during grain maturation. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential role of TaVIH2 in cell wall remodelling and stress response pathways, offering new insights into the functional roles of VIH proteins in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316986

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis.

However, these dances have attracted little scientific attention and their structure and meaning remain largely obscure. Here we analyse close-range video recordings of captive crested gibbons, extracting descriptions of dance in four Nomascus species (N. annamensis, N. gabriellae, N. leucogenys, and N. siki). Additionally, we report results from a survey amongst relevant professionals clarifying behavioural contexts of dance in captive and wild crested gibbons. Our results demonstrate that dances in Nomascus represent a common and intentional form of visual communication restricted to sexually mature females. While primarily used as a proceptive signal to solicit copulation, dances occur in a wide range of contexts related to arousal and/or frustration in captivity. A linguistically informed view of this sequential behaviour demonstrates that dances follow a grouping organisation and isochronous rhythm - patterns not described for visual displays in other non-human primates. We argue that applying the concept of dance to gibbons allows us to expand our understanding of the communicative behaviours of non-human apes and develop hypotheses on the rules and regularities characterizing this behaviour. We propose that gibbons dances likely evolved from less elaborate rhythmic proceptive signals, similar to those found in siamangs. Although dance displays in humans and crested gibbons share a number of key characteristics, they cannot be assumed to be homologous. Nevertheless, gibbon dances represent a model behaviour whose investigation could be extended to the study of complex gestural signals in hominoid primates.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316987

A transdiagnostic factor for psychopathology is emotion regulation, which is influenced by sex hormones, such as estradiol (E2), across the menstrual cycle on the behavioral and neural level. Whether this is also the case in the antepartum period remains unknown. For the first time, behavioral and neural emotion regulation were investigated in healthy primiparous pregnant females with extremely high E2 levels during the second trimester (N = 15) using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm. Results were compared with naturally-cycling females with high E2 levels (after E2-administration, N = 16) and low E2 levels (early follicular phase, N = 16). Although pregnant females reported the lowest trait use of cognitive reappraisal, all females successfully regulated their emotions by applying cognitive reappraisal in the scanner. On the neural level, all females had increased activity in the left middle frontal gyrus during downregulation of negative emotions. Pregnant females showed no significant differences in functional connectivity (psychophysiological interaction, resting-state) related to emotion regulation compared to the nonpregnant group. However, group differences emerged for amygdala activation. In pregnant females, increased amygdala activity predicted reduced regulation success and was positively associated with depression scores. This first fMRI study during pregnancy indicates that depression scores are reflected in heightened amygdala activity already observable in the antepartum period. Thus, through its association with reduced regulation success, increased amygdala activity suggests a neural risk marker for peripartum mental health. Future research needs to investigate emotion regulation in pregnant and postpartum women to further understand pregnancy-related changes and associations of mood, emotional and neural functions. Eventually, this will allow enhanced identification, prevention, and treatment of peri- and postpartum mental ill-health.","NA","medrxiv",1727561316987

Previously published in 2019, 57 HCM-associated genes were curated providing the first systematic evaluation of gene-disease validity. Here we report work by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel (HCVD-GCEP) to reappraise the clinical validity of previously curated and new putative HCM genes.

MethodsThe ClinGen systematic gene curation framework was used to re-classify the gene-disease relationships for HCM and related syndromic entities involving left ventricular hypertrophy. Genes previously curated were included if their classification was not definitive, and if the time since curation was >2-3 years. New genes with literature assertions for HCM were included for initial evaluation. Existing genes were curated for new inheritance patterns where evidence existed. Curations were presented on twice monthly calls, with the HCVD-GCEP composed of 29 individuals from 21 institutions across 6 countries.

ResultsThirty-one genes were re-curated and an additional 5 new potential HCM-associated genes were curated. Among the re-curated genes, 17 (55%) genes changed classification: 1 limited and 4 disputed (from no known disease relationship), 9 disputed (from limited), and 3 definitive (from moderate). Among these, 3 (10%) genes had a clinically relevant upgrade, including TNNC1, a 9th sarcomere gene with definitive HCM association. With new evidence, two genes were curated for multiple inheritance patterns (TRIM63, disputed for autosomal dominant but moderate for autosomal recessive; ALPK3, strong for autosomal dominant and definitive for recessive). CSRP3 was curated for a semi-dominant mode of inheritance (definitive). Nine (29%) genes were downgraded to disputed, further discouraging clinical reporting of variants in these genes. Five genes recently reported to cause HCM were curated: RPS6KB1 and RBM20 (limited), KLHL24 and MT-TI (moderate), and FHOD3 (definitive).

ConclusionsWe report 29 genes with definitive, strong or moderate evidence of causation for HCM or isolated LVH, including sarcomere, sarcomere-associated and syndromic conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1727561316987

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

C_LI

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

Performing rare variant (minor allele frequency<1%) association testing using exome-sequencing data from 402,375 participants in the UK Biobank (UKB) for nine overall and tissue-specific fat distribution traits, we identified 19 genes where putatively damaging rare variation associated with at least one trait (Bonferroni-adjusted P<1.58x10-7) and 52 additional genes at FDR[&le;]1% (P[&le;]4.37x10-5).

Five of the 71 genes have cognate protein UKB Olink data available; all five associated (P<3.80x10-6) with three or more analysed traits. Combining rare and common variation evidence, allelic series and proteomics, we selected 17 genes for CRISPR knockout in human white adipose tissue cell lines. In three previously uncharacterised target genes, knockout increased (two-sided t-test P<0.05) lipid accumulation, a cellular phenotype relevant for fat mass traits, compared to Cas9-empty negative controls: COL5A3 (fold change [FC]=1.72, P=0.0028), EXOC7 (FC=1.35, P=0.0096), and TRIP10 (FC=1.39, P=0.0157); furthermore, knockout of SLTM resulted in reduced lipid accumulation (FC=0.51, P=1.91x10-4). Integrating across population-based genetic and in vitro functional evidence, we highlight therapeutic avenues for altering obesity and body fat distribution by modulating lipid accumulation.","NA","medrxiv",1727561316987

Here, we describe a comprehensive genomic dataset from the first individual, HG008, including DNA from an adherent, epithelial-like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor cell line (HG008-T) and matched normal cells from duodenal tissue (HG008-N-D) and pancreatic tissue (HG008-N-P). The data come from thirteen whole genome measurement technologies: Illumina paired-end, Element standard and long insert, Ultima UG100, PacBio (HiFi and Onso), Oxford Nanopore (standard and ultra-long), Bionano Optical Mapping, Arima and Phase Genomics Hi-C, G-banded karyotyping, directional genomic hybridization, and BioSkryb Genomics single-cell ResolveDNA. Most tumor data is from a large homogenous batch of non-viable cells after 23 passages of the primary tumor cells, along with some data from different passages to enable an initial understanding of genomic instability. These data will be used by the GIAB Consortium to develop matched tumor-normal benchmarks for somatic variant detection. In addition, extensive data from two different normal tissues from the same individual can enable understanding of mosaicism. Long reads also contain methylation tags for epigenetic analyses. We expect these data to facilitate innovation for whole genome measurement technologies, de novo assembly of tumor and normal genomes, and bioinformatic tools to identify small and structural somatic mutations.

Yet, technical limitations associated with short reads challenge their use for detection of disease-associated variation in complex regions of the genome. Long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies may overcome these challenges, potentially qualifying as a first-tier test for all rare diseases. To test this hypothesis, we performed LRS (30x HiFi genomes) for 100 samples with 145 known clinically relevant germline variants that are challenging to detect using short-read sequencing and necessitate a broad range of complementary test modalities in diagnostic laboratories.

We show that relevant variant callers readily re-identify the majority of variants (120/145, 83%), including [~]90% of structural variants, SNVs/InDels in homologous sequences and expansions of short tandem repeats. Another 10% (n=14) was visually apparent in the data but not automatically detected. Our analyses also identified systematic challenges for the remaining 7% (n=11) of variants such as the detection of AG-rich repeat expansions. Titration analysis showed that 89% of all automatically called variants could also be identified using 15-fold coverage.

Thus, long-read genomes identified 93% of pathogenic variants that are most challenging to detect using short-read technologies. Even with reduced coverage, the vast majority of variants remained detectable, possibly enhancing cost-effective diagnostic implementation. Most importantly, we show the potential to use a single technology to accurately identify all types of clinically relevant variants.","NA","medrxiv",1727561316987

We aimed to test whether epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) estimated using different epigenetic clocks predict long-term overall, cardiovascular or cancer mortality.

MethodsWe analyzed data from 2,105 participants to the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey aged [&ge;]50 years old who were followed for mortality through 2019. EAAs was calculated from the residuals of Horvath, Hannum, SkinBlood, Pheno, Zhang, Lin, Weidner, Vidal-Bralo and Grim epigenetic clocks regressed on chronological age. Using cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association of EAA (per 5-year) and the DunedinPoAm pace of aging (per 10% increase) with overall, cardiovascular and cancer mortality, adjusting for covariates and white blood cell composition.

ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 17.5 years, 998 deaths occurred, including 272 from cardiovascular disease and 209 from cancer. Overall mortality was most significantly predicted by Grim EAA (P < 0.0001; HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.32-1.71) followed by Hannum (P = 0.001; HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.07-1.27), Pheno (P = 0.001; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.21), Horvath (P = 0.007; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04-1.22) and Vidal-Bralo (P = 0.008; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.03-1.23) EAAs.

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1727561316987

""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha).

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1727561316987

We investigated whether a diverse refugee committee could utilize participatory methods to identify health priorities and a research agenda to address them.

MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study with focus groups of current and former refugees, asylum claimants and evacuees from a specialized refugee clinic over a year. We collected sociodemographic data using standardized instruments, then utilized a four-step nominal group technique process (idea generation, recording, discussion, and voting) to identify and rank participants health and research priorities. Participants ranked their top five priorities across three time periods: Pre-migration/early arrival (0-3 months), post-migration (3 months-2 years), and long-term health (>2 years). Participants created overarching priorities and corroborated findings via a member checking step.

FindingsTwenty-three participants (median age 35 years) attended one or more of five focus groups. Twenty-one completed sociodemographic surveys: 16/21 (76%) were women, representing 8 countries of origin. Participants identified ""more family physicians"" and ""improving health system navigation"" (11/60 votes each) as top health and research priorities respectively across all resettlement periods. Participants also prioritized pre-departure healthcare system orientation and improved post-arrival and long-term mental health services. Twelve participants completed the member checking process, affirming the results with minor clarifications.

InterpretationThis proof-of-concept study illustrates how refugees can use a rigorous consensus process without external influence to prioritize their healthcare needs, direct a health research agenda to address those needs, and co-produce research. These low-cost participatory methods should be replicated elsewhere.
