PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1746742153510

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

However, it is unclear whether a reformulation will be necessary for 2025. KP.2-based monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (KP.2 MV) were authorized for use in 2024, and they conferred substantial protection against hospitalizations caused by viral variants that emerged and dominated later, such as KP.3.1.1 and XEC. Today, LP.8.1 has become the dominant variant worldwide, particularly so in North America. To characterize the antigenicity of LP.8.1, we tested serial serum samples from 16 individuals who recently received KP.2 MV in neutralization assays against KP.3.1.1, XEC, and LP.8.1 pseudoviruses. Serum neutralizing antibody titers against LP.8.1 were comparable to those against KP.3.1.1 and XEC, indicating that LP.8.1 is antigenically similar to its predecessors. Therefore, the currently authorized KP.2 MV may not need to be updated for 2025, if the vaccine manufacturers could demonstrate comparable immunogenicity for KP.2 MV and LP.8.1-based mRNA vaccines and, of course, in the absence of an antigenically divergent SARS-CoV-2 emerging.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

By hijacking the cellular ubiquitin-proteasome-system pathogenic proteins are degraded via heterobifunctional molecules, referred to as proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs). However, to date, only few PROTACs targeting viral or proviral proteins have been developed. To explore the possibilities and advantages of antiviral PROTACs, we have developed an antiviral PROTAC against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPro) using an allosteric warhead. Here, we present the design of ten MPro degraders that were developed using pelitinib as a warhead, an allosteric binder of MPro. Among several candidates, LLP019 emerged as the most potent molecule, capable of degrading up to 90% of MPro after ectopic expression in HEK293F cells. LLP019 displayed significant antiviral activity against several variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2 in infected Calu3 cells. In conclusion, we show that the development of antiviral PROTACs using an allosteric warhead represents a promising antiviral strategy, expanding the range of possible target proteins and ligands.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

To address this gap, we introduce an integrated approach where we generate ultra-deep Region Capture Micro-C (RCMC) and Micro-C data specifically designed for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. We developed Cleopatra, an attention-based deep learning model that takes epigenomic inputs and is pre-trained on genome-wide Micro-C data followed by fine-tuning with high-resolution RCMC data. Cleopatra accurately predicts 3D maps at sub-kilobase bin sizes and unprecedented resolution, enabling us to generate ultra-high-resolution, genome-wide 3D contact maps across four human cell types. These maps revealed cell-type-specific microcompartments and over 900,000 loops across the cell types, about half of which are cell-type-specific. Using Cleopatra maps, we observe that promoters form about a dozen loops on average, and that expression increases monotonically with the number of loops, indicating that looping is associated with higher gene expression. We further show the enhancer-promoter loops are often anchored by CTCF, and nominate new transcription factors that may regulate cell-type-specific enhancer-promoter interactions. Overall, we establish a framework for ultra-high-resolution 3D genome mapping, providing a broadly applicable resource for gaining new insights into cell-type-specific gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1746742153510

Identifying BAPS has enabled the discovery of entirely novel phage clusters, including clusters distantly related to Salmonella Goslarviruses in E. coli, and Shigella, while significantly expanding known genera such as Seoulvirus (from 16 to >300 members). Notably, close relatives of therapeutic lytic phages were also detected, suggesting clinical isolate sequencing unknowingly archives viable phage candidates.

Understanding the dominance of deleterious mutations is critical as it can fundamentally impact the rate and efficiency of natural selection, the magnitude of inbreeding depression, and the prevalence and evolution of genetic diseases. Despite its inarguable importance, the dominance effects of mutations remain poorly understood in humans, primarily because existing statistical methods cannot distinguish them from the overall selective effects of mutations. In this work, we take a fundamentally different approach to infer dominance by leveraging the distribution of Neanderthal ancestry across the human genome. We show through simulations that recessive deleterious mutations lead to an increase in archaic introgressed ancestry in the absence of positive selection, contrary to what is expected when deleterious mutations are additive. Leveraging this unique pattern, we develop a machine learning classifier to infer dominance in genomic windows at a megabase resolution, trained on simulations of a human demographic model with Neanderthal introgression using fully recessive or additive mutations. Our method demonstrates robust accuracy at detecting genomic windows containing recessive deleterious mutations, with particularly high power in exon-dense regions. When applied to the non-African populations from the 1000 Genomes Project, we find that approximately 3-9% of the human genome is enriched for recessive mutations with most recessive regions shared across human populations. Furthermore, our method reveals that recessive deleterious mutations are not evenly distributed across the genome: regions enriched for recessive mutations are significantly depleted of haploinsufficient genes and runs of homozygosity, and are enriched with non-additive variants associated with complex traits. Overall, our Neanderthal ancestry-based approach reveals the presence of recessive deleterious mutations in the human genome and suggests that these mutations are found in regions containing genes associated with metabolism and immune-related traits.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

Yet, how and when heterochromatin is reconfigured to facilitate changes in cell-fate remains a key open question. Here, we address this by mapping a prevalent heterochromatic feature - genome-lamina interactions - relative to transcription in single-cells during mouse embryogenesis. We find that genome-lamina interactions remain relatively uniform between germ layers following gastrulation but are extensively reconfigured in diverse tissues during later organogenesis. Focusing on limb development, we demonstrate that genome-lamina interactions are selectively released in early multipotent progenitors at key developmental genes and their surrounding regulatory domains. This lamina-release often precedes gene expression at later developmental stages, suggesting it primes regulatory domains for future potential activation. Conversely, lamina-release coincides with chromatin opening at sites of crucial limb transcription factor binding, and so is closely intertwined with the regulatory machinery driving limb formation. Finally, we show that the boundaries of topologically-associated domains (TADs) constrain the spread of lamina-release at a limb gene locus. This ensures independent lamina dynamics between neighbouring domains. Together, our data suggest a previously unrecognised process where genome-lamina interactions are selectively released at regulatory domains to transition loci toward more permissive chromatin states, thereby potentiating cell type specific activation. Our work thus reveals how systematic heterochromatin reorganization links to developmental multipotency, providing mechanistic insights into cell-fate decisions in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

Pathogens can rapidly evolve resistance which diminishes the impact of antimicrobial treatments. The presence of other microbes in polymicrobial infections can impact the development of antimicrobial resistance of pathogens, yet it is unclear how the interplay between the environmental structure and the presence of a polymicrobial community affect the rate of plasmid mediated antibiotic resistance evolution. This study investigates the effect of environmental structure and microbial interactions on antibiotic resistance evolution in a uropathogenic Escherichia coli. We conducted a serial transfer experiment across well-mixed and spatially structured environ-ments with increasing concentrations of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, in the presence and absence of a polymicrobial community. Our results revealed that E. coli in community context displayed parallel evolutionary trajectories, leading to higher final antibiotic tolerance, while spatial structures allowed for prolonged resistance evolution. Copy number variation of the plasmid-borne resistance locus varied significantly across the different evolutionary contexts. E. coli lineages evolved in the absence of the community, in the well-mixed isolation environ-ments demonstrated the highest copy number increases, while those in the presence of the community showed minimal changes compared to the ancestor. These findings underscore the intricate relationship between the genetic basis of resistance, the environmental structure and the microbial ecology in plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

Underlying this variation are evolutionary forces, such as selection, that operate on changes to circuitry against a background of constraints. The interplay between selection and potentially limiting constraints determine how circuits evolve. Understanding how this process operates requires an evolutionary framework that facilitates comparative analysis of neural traits, within a clear behavioural and functional context. We leverage a large radiation of Heliconiini butterflies to examine how selection shapes the evolution of the central complex and the mushroom bodies, two integration centres in the insect brain involved in spatial navigation. Within the Heliconiini, one genus, Heliconius, performs systematic spatial foraging and navigation to exploit specific plants as a source of pollen, a novel dietary resource. Closely related genera within Heliconiini lack this dietary adaptation, and are more vagrant foragers. The evolution of increased spatial fidelity in Heliconius has led to changes in brain morphology, and in specific learning and memory profiles, over a relatively short evolutionary time scale. Here, using a dataset of 41 species, we show that in contrast to a massive expansion of the mushroom bodies, the central complex and associated visual processing areas are strongly conserved in size and general architecture. We corroborate this by characterising patterns of fine anatomical conservation, including conserved patterns in dopamine and serotonin expression. However, we also identify a divergence in the expression of a neuropeptide, Allatostatin A, in the noduli, and in the numbers of GABA-ergic ellipsoid body ring neurons and their branching in the fan-shaped body, which are essential members of the anterior compass pathway. These differences match expectations of where evolutionary adaptability might occur inside the central complex network and provide rare examples of divergence of these circuits in a shallow phylogenetic context. We conclude that due to the contrasting volumetric conservation of the central complex and the massive volumetric differences in the mushroom bodies, their circuit logics must determine distinct responses to selection associated with divergent foraging behaviours.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

The 10-minute National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lean Test (NLT) is an objective clinical test used to assess these symptoms and direct management. There is, however, no robust literature on normative data for this test, particularly from a younger population.

AimsThe aim of this study was to produce a healthy control data set for NLT, which can be used for comparison with the patient population with health conditions.

MethodsIndividuals recruited into the study had no history or symptoms of orthostatic intolerance; autonomic dysfunction; post-infection conditions (such as long COVID); or other neurological conditions with hemodynamic instability. Participants were primarily recruited from the general population in a metropolitan city. All participants underwent a standardised NLT. Lying Blood Pressure (BP) and Heart Rate (HR) after 2 min of lying down supine was recorded, followed by BP and HR recordings at every minute of standing (leaning against a wall) up to 10 minutes, along with recording patient-reported symptoms at each time point.

ResultsA complete dataset was available for 112 individuals (60.7% Female, 39.3% Male). The population was 61.6% Caucasian, 8.0% Asian, 3.6% Black/Caribbean, 9.8% Mixed, and 17.0% Other; the mean age was 35.3 {+/-} 15.1, with a BMI of 24.8 {+/-} 4.0; 30.6% of individuals had a background medical condition, but none of the exclusion criteria.

During NLT, upon standing, the average change of HR was an increase of 9.89 {+/-} 8.15bpm. The sustained HR increase (HR increase sustained at two consecutive readings) was an average of 6.23 {+/-} 6.94bpm. The predominant response with BP was an increase of systolic BP, with the average initial increase being 7.55 {+/-} 10.88mmHg. None of the participants met the diagnostic criteria for symptomatic OH or PoTS during NLT.

ConclusionFor the first time in the current literature, NLT data from a relatively younger healthy population without orthostatic intolerance have been gathered. This normative data will help interpret NLT findings in younger patients with Orthostatic Intolerance better and be useful in managing dysautonomia in specific conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1746742153510

The recent advances in next-generation sequencing technology generated large-scale genomic and/or multi-omics datasets from different disease types or models. Owing to the huge volume of data coming out of genomic experiments, scientists are facing challenges in handling, manipulating, visualizing, and interpreting the data. Currently, available tools to visualize genetic variants from VCF files are not very user-friendly as most of them require knowledge of command line tools or scripts to install and run those software. Moreover, biologists or clinicians lack this knowledge of computer programming. Therefore, graphical user interface (GUI) based tools or software are needed to effectively summarize and visualize the huge volume of genomic data such as VCF data.

MethodsWe have developed a Shiny App, interactive tool using the R programming language that utilizes other R packages like ""vcfR"" and ""maftools"" to visualize and generate quality control metrics for genetic data effectively and exquisitely. A key improvement is the addition of a user-friendly interface, providing researchers with an interactive way to explore VCF or Cancer genomics data. Our tool is powered by Shiny, making it even easier for researchers to analyze and visualize genomic variation data using a GUI. Researchers can upload their datasets and customize the analysis parameters to suit their specific research needs.

ResultsA user-friendly interactive tool has been developed for the summarization and visualization of data related to genomic variation research. The application features an easy and friendly interface, allowing users to perform various functions such as data loading, summarization, and visualization interactively. XVCF offers an easy-to-use GUI platform to read genetic variant data (annotated or unannotated) and extract useful information such as read depth, mapping quality, genotype, quality control summary, and allele frequency from unannotated data. In the second module of XVCF, the cancer genomic data (annotated, so far supported by ANNOVAR) is analyzed using ""maftools"" to produce oncoplot, comparison of mutational load across different TCGA datasets, gene summary, etc. XVCF is available for free download from https://github.com/rashidma/XVCF.

ConclusionXVCF Shiny web application can serve as a robust visualization and quality control GUI platform for the germline and cancer genomics dataset. We expect this tool will be immensely useful for researchers with less computational or technical knowledge. Being a shiny R package, XVCF can be installed across different operating systems and utilize different computer hardware configurations.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

We introduce hedonic foraging as a mechanism by which hedonic evaluation guides behaviour via iterative reward maximisation. This framework integrates hedonic evaluation with active inference, whereby expected free energy encodes wanting--the motivational drive toward rewarding outcomes--while variational free energy co responds to liking--the hedonic impact of the outcome. Hedonic foraging unifies the mechanisms underlying behaviours ranging from allostasis to art appreciation, casting cognition and motivated behaviour as purposive engagement with the environment and its affordances.

Long abstractHedonic evaluation shapes behaviour across organisms. Yet, the mechanisms that transform hedonic values into motivated behaviour remain poorly understood, and key questions remain unanswered. How do habits, wanting, and liking or disliking interact to generate behaviour? Do common principles govern behaviour across species and cognitive systems, from basic survival mechanisms to complex cultural endeavours? We propose a unifying theory of motivated behaviour that integrates hedonic evaluation with active inference--a framework in which perception, action and cognition emerge from the imperative to minimise free energy. We argue that variational free energy provides a natural measure of liking and disliking, while expected free energy encodes wanting--the motivational drive toward rewarding outcomes. This synthesis, which we term hedonic foraging, offers a principled explanation for how organisms navigate their environments based on pleasure-driven learning and decision-making. It posits that motivated behaviour emerges from the fundamental pursuit of maximising reward, with hedonic evaluation motivating and monitoring actions through wanting and liking mechanisms. We demonstrate that hedonic foraging captures a wide range of behaviours, from allostatic processes common to all animals to sophisticated human activities such as art appreciation and cultural exploration. Crucially, our integrative perspective fosters mutual enrichment between hedonic evaluation and active inference--two fundamental approaches to behaviour. Ultimately, hedonic foraging reinforces the view that cognition is essentially about purposive engagement in adaptive interactions with the environment and its affordances and offers a unified framework for investigating cognition and behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

While significant progress has been made in migratory birds, where multiple compass systems are well described, similar knowledge for migratory Lepidoptera remains limited. Most insights into butterfly and moth orientation come from just two species: the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and the Australian Bogong moth (Agrotis infusa), both of which possess multimodal compass systems involving visual and geomagnetic cues. However, these species follow unusual migratory strategies that include diapause or aestivation and multigenerational round-trip migrations between breeding region and very specific non-breeding areas, that are not representative of most other Lepidoptera migrants. In contrast, European species such as the painted lady (Vanessa cardui) and red admiral (Vanessa atalanta) undertake regular seasonal migrations involving multiple generations and no diapause, yet the sensory mechanisms guiding their orientation remain largely unexplored. Here, we report findings from a two-year study investigating compass orientation in red admirals using a flight simulator under a range of controlled light and magnetic conditions. Our experiments yielded three key results: (1) red admirals orient using solar cues when selecting migratory direction; (2) the sun compass in this species appears to be time-independent, as clock-shifted individuals did not alter orientation; and (3) there is no sign of magnetic sense in red admirals. These findings sharply contrast with those from monarch butterflies, which rely on both time-compensated sun and light-dependent magnetic compasses. Our results reveal important interspecific variation in compass use among diurnal Lepidoptera and underscore the need to expand orientation research beyond traditional model systems to better understand the diversity of migratory strategies and orientation mechanisms in migratory Lepidoptera.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

Their existence leads one to wonder whether amino acid sequences are sufficiently degenerate with respect to protein folding to broadly allow arbitrary pairs of functional proteins to be overlapped. Here, we investigate this question by engineering synthetic OLGs using state-of-the-art generative models. To evaluate the approach, we first design overlapped sequences targeting two different protein families. We then encode distinct highly ordered de novo protein structures and observe surprisingly high in silico and experimental success rates. This demonstrates that the overlap constraints under the structure of the standard genetic code do not significantly restrict simultaneous accommodation of well defined 3D folds in alternative reading frames. Our work suggests that OLG sequences may be frequently accessible in nature and could be readily exploited to compress and constrain synthetic genetic circuits.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

Leveraging single-cell genomics, we investigated the transcriptional dynamics and cis-regulatory evolution of duplicated genes in cultivated soybean (Glycine max), a species that has undergone two rounds of whole-genome duplication. Our analysis revealed extensive transcriptional divergence among these duplicated gene pairs, including dosage balanced, paralogue dominance, divergence, specialization, and widespread mono-expressed pattern. These expression divergences are correlated with sequence variation in their associated accessible chromatin regions (ACRs), where cis-regulatory elements reside. Moreover, different duplication mechanisms, including whole-genome duplication and small-scale duplication, likely give rise to distinct types of cis-regulatory variants, leading to varying effects on transcriptional divergence. To further explore the evolution of cis-regulatory elements and their impact on gene expression, we focused on gene sets in which duplicated genes are derived from two rounds of whole-genome duplication and share a common ancestral gene, as cis-regulatory elements are typically co-duplicated with genes during whole-genome duplication. Most ACRs were retained after duplication whereas a subset likely arose de novo. Both mutations in duplicated elements and the emergence of de novo evolved elements contribute to widespread expression divergence within these gene sets. We also characterized the evolution of cell-type-specific expression and cell-type-specific ACRs among these sets. Collectively, our findings highlight the important role of cis-regulatory evolution in shaping transcriptional divergence and facilitating the retention of duplicated genes, offering a high-resolution view through the lens of single-cell genomics.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

It is widely used in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, yet its efficiency and broader applicability remain limited. Here, we identify key floral stages and develop novel strategies to enhance AMT-FI-based genome editing. Using a dual-reporter system (RUBY and hygromycin resistance), we determined that flowers opened at 6 days post-inoculation (DPI) are optimal for high transformation efficiency, with nearly 100% of siliques harboring transformants. However, Agrobacterium infection induced ovule abortion, particularly in wild-type (Col-0) plants, whereas efr mutants lacking the EF-Tu receptor (EFR)-mediated pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) showed reduced ovule abortion. Notably, efr mutants exhibited more RUBY-positive ovules and significantly enhanced genome editing efficiency, despite showing no improvement in stable transformation rates. These results suggest that PTI restricts transient transformation rather than T-DNA integration. We further engineered stealth Agrobacterium strains expressing a chimeric EF-Tu for evading recognition by EFR. These GV3101-derived strains, named as AS201 and AS202, enhanced both transient transformation and genome editing efficiency without significantly altering stable transformation frequency. Remarkably, genome-edited T1 plants could be recovered based on phenotype or direct sequencing without the need for antibiotic selection when targeting flowers opened at 6 DPI. Our findings reveal EFR-mediated immunity as a key barrier to efficient transient transformation and genome editing via AMT-FI. By integrating floral stage selection, immune evasion, and Agrobacterium engineering, this study provides a practical and versatile platform to advance plant genome engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

We introduce Reinforcement Learning from eXperimental Feedback (RLXF), a general framework that aligns protein language models with experimentally measured functional objectives, drawing inspiration from the methods used to align large language models like ChatGPT. Applied across five diverse protein families, RLXF improves generation of high-functioning variants beyond pre-trained baselines. We demonstrate this with CreiLOV, an oxygen-independent fluorescent protein, where RLXF-aligned models generate sequences with significantly enhanced fluorescence, including the most fluorescent CreiLOV variants reported to date. Our results indicate that RLXF-aligned models effectively integrate the evolutionary knowledge encoded in pre-trained pLMs with experimental observations, improving the success rate of generated sequences and enabling the discovery of synergistic mutation combinations that are difficult to identify through zero-shot or evolutionary approaches. RLXF provides a scalable and accessible approach to steer generative models toward desired biochemical properties, enabling function-driven protein design beyond the limits of natural evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

Here, we identify a small RNA (svsR) encoded by the lambdoid prophage NC-SV in adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) strain NC101 that confers resistance to lytic coliphages. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that NC-SV-like prophages and svsR homologs are conserved across diverse Enterobacteriaceae. Transcriptional analyses reveal that svsR represses maltodextrin transport genes, including lamB, which encodes the outer membrane maltoporin LamB--a known receptor for multiple phages. Nutrient supplementation experiments show that maltodextrin enhances phage adsorption, while glucose suppresses it, consistent with established effects of these sugars on lamB expression. In vivo, we compared wild-type NC101 and a prophage-deletion strain (NC101deltaNC-SV) in mice to assess the impact of NC-SV on lytic phage susceptibility. Although intestinal E. coli densities remained stable across groups, animals colonized with NC101 exhibited markedly reduced phage burdens in both the intestinal lumen and mucosa compared to mice colonized with NC101deltaNC-SV. This reduced phage pressure was associated with increased dissemination of NC101 to extraintestinal tissues, including the spleen and liver. Together, these findings highlight a nutrient-responsive, prophage-encoded mechanism that protects AIEC from phage predation and may promote bacterial persistence and dissemination in the inflamed gut.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

Comparing these discoveries to a gold-standard set of genes linked to blood traits, the two approaches provide highly complementary insights with distinct strengths and caveats.

We identified nutrient-dependent interactions as a key driver of these dynamics and found that S. aureus strains auxotrophic to tyrosine rely on amino acid-providing nasal communities to thrive in the nutrient-limited environment of the nose. Large-scale screenings revealed tyrosine dependency to affect 8% of nasal S. aureus strains and to impair S. aureus colonization.

Lateral transfer of carbon needs to be more widely studied, especially in smaller streams and catchments, as they receive high loading of organic matter and are hotspots of carbon degradation. In this study we combined measurements of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality and quantity with microbial community data from a small Arctic catchment. Our aim was to understand how the catchment is affected by two sub-catchments, degrading palsa permafrost mire and peatland thawing in spring. The small thaw ponds in the palsa mire were clearly distinct from the rest of the catchment and ponds in the peatland. Palsa ponds had higher DOM quantity, more aromatic DOM and distinct microbial communities. Thus, our results point towards analogous and low export rates of organic matter from the permafrost mire and peatland to the receiving small streams.

While group-level analyses showed only trend-level increases in PET synaptic markers, we observed significantly elevated Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) glutamate levels post-ketamine. Functional connectivity analyses revealed decreased within-network integrity, particularly in high-order networks like the default mode network (DMN), alongside increased low-to-high-order network integration. Our multimodal analysis showed that increased [11C]-UCBJ volume distribution (VT), a putative index of synaptic plasticity, correlated with reduced intrinsic activity in DMN regions and decreased influence of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in global network dynamics.

Part of the difficulty arises from the enormous number of possible genotypes and the lack of understanding of the underlying phenotypic differences driving adaptation. Here, we present a computational method that takes advantage of modern high-throughput fitness measurements to learn a map from high-dimensional fitness profiles to a low-dimensional latent space in a geometry-informed manner. We demonstrate that our approach using a Riemannian Hamiltonian Variational Autoencoder (RHVAE) outperforms traditional linear dimensionality reduction techniques by capturing the nonlinear structure of the phenotype-fitness map. When applied to simulated adaptive dynamics, we show that the learned latent space retains information about the underlying adaptive phenotypic space and accurately reconstructs complex fitness landscapes. We then apply this method to a dataset of high-throughput fitness measurements of E. coli under different antibiotic pressures and demonstrate superior predictive power for out-of-sample data compared to linear approaches. Our work provides a data-driven implementation of Fisher's geometric model of adaptation, transforming it from a theoretical framework into an empirically grounded approach for understanding evolutionary dynamics using modern deep learning methods.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

We found that H2O2 levels rise during algal death and that bacterial H2O2 production triggers this demise. Manipulating H2O2 levels shifted the outcome of the interaction. We also uncovered a link between H2O2 and betaine metabolism: aging algae release betaine, which promotes bacterial H2O2 production and, in turn, accelerates algal death. Genes involved in H2O2 and betaine metabolism were upregulated in environmental samples from an algal bloom. Together, our findings identify H2O2 and betaine as key molecules that modulate algal-bacterial interactions, potentially impacting microbial dynamics in marine ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

Here we present a computational framework that leverages sequence-based models to assess the functional impact of (ultra-)rare somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in promoter regions. We analysed SNVs derived from 24,529 whole-tumour genomes from three cohorts and applied the sequence-based model PARM, which was trained on massively parallel reporter assay data. We identified up to 492 promoter regions significantly enriched for putatively functional SNVs, including known cancer-drivers such as TERT. Overall, we find that functional promoter mutations are significantly enriched in established cancer-driver genes (p-value = 9.7{middle dot}10-5). Cross-cohort validation and replication using an independent sequence-based model (Borzoi) identified nine candidate cancer genes where the prioritized promoter mutations were shown to be functional by affecting gene expression levels.

While the sensory encoding of music is well-studied, when and how infants naturally start moving to music is largely unexplored. This study simultaneously investigates infants neural (auditory) responses and spontaneous movements to music during the first year of life. Neural activity (EEG) and body kinematics (markerless pose estimation) were recorded from 79 infants (aged 3, 6, and 12 months) listening to refrains of childrens music, along with shuffled, high-pitched, and low-pitched versions of the same songs. Neural data revealed that, across all ages, infants exhibit enhanced auditory responses to music compared to shuffled music, indicating that auditory encoding of music emerges early in development. Movement data revealed a different outcome. While coarse auditory-motor coupling is present at all ages, more complex structured movement patterns emerge in response to music only by 12 months. Notably, no age group demonstrated evidence of coordinated movements to music. Additionally, enhanced auditory responses to high vs low pitch were only evident at 6 months, while infants movements were better predicted by high-pitched compared to low-pitched music at all ages. This study provides initial insights into how the developing brain gradually transforms music into spontaneous movements of increasing complexity.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

We investigate the transcriptome of P. malariae during transmission in the vector by analyzing RNA-seq data from midgut and salivary gland parasite stages obtained in two experimental mosquito infections with field P. malariae isolates. Our analysis resulted in 3,699 expressed genes, of which 263 are developmentally regulated and 1,338 are P. malariae specific, including genes with unknown functions and without orthologs in other Plasmodium.

We found expressed several members of multigene families, like PIR, PHIST, fam-l, and described new families potentially showing transcriptional heterogeneity. Our findings point to the uniqueness of the P. malariae transcriptome, probably related to different transmission traits in the vector, and the lower pathogenicity and virulence in the human.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

The genus Bacteroides comprises several dozen named species, several of which serve as a nexus of gene exchange in gut microbiomes, especially in humans. Because gene exchange will blur the historically defined species boundaries, we assessed the patterns and extent of recombination for nearly 2,000 fully sequenced Bacteroides genomes representing 36 named species, and redefined species boundaries based on their capacity to exchange genes. We recognized numerous incongruences between traditional classification schemes, those based on nucleotide sequence identity thresholds, and species defined by gene flow. Almost all named species of sufficient sample size for analysis included genomes that failed to recombine with other genomes that were historically assigned to the same species. Such misclassifications occurred even for cases in which sequence identities surpassed the thresholds regularly used to define species. Conversely, we detected instances in which species previously considered distinct were found to recombine extensively--the most striking of which supported unification of B. kribbi, B. koreensis, and B. ovatus (which freely recombines with B. xylanisolvens). Among the broadly distributed populations of B. fragilis, we detected elevated levels of recombination among human-derived strains, although this result is confounded by geographic and sampling biases. Our findings emphasize the utility of a universal species concept based on gene flow, not only for refining bacterial classifications but also for understanding the variation within and across gut microbiomes.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

We explore this issue using goddard (gdrd), an orphan gene essential for spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Although the Gdrd protein has maintained structural conservation across the Drosophila genus, its overall length and primary sequences, especially at its disordered termini, show substantial divergence. Using gene swaps assays that included gdrd orthologs from multiple species across different evolutionary distances, we investigated how lineage-specific evolutionary changes have affected Goddard's ability to function in D. melanogaster. Our results indicate that most orthologs possess the ability to interact with axonemes and insect ring centrioles in D. melanogaster, suggesting these interactions could have been present in the orthologs' common ancestor. Surprisingly, a highly divergent ortholog from D. mojavensis fully rescued fertility in goddard null D. melanogaster, indicating that the Gdrd protein at the base of the Drosophila genus was most likely fully integrated into an essential spermatogenesis pathway. However, several orthologs, including one from a more closely related species, failed to complement fertility in D. melanogaster. All of these complementation failures correlated with weaker axonemal binding. Furthermore, we noted that all tested orthologs exhibited divergent subcellular localization patterns. In parallel with these gene swap studies, we computationally analyzed each ortholog's structural stability and flexibility, physicochemical properties within its intrinsically disordered regions, and amino acid sequence divergence. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated structural instability in the most closely related, non-functional ortholog, while shared motifs identified in the disordered termini correlated with functionality, notably present in D. mojavensis and D. melanogaster but absent in non-rescuing orthologs. These findings suggest that although Goddard's central structure and key interactions likely existed at the base of the Drosophila genus, several orthologs have undergone consequential lineage-specific evolutionary changes.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

However, studies evaluating the efficacy of T cell immunotherapy in aged mice are limited and yield inconsistent results, while clinical data are largely retrospective.

MethodsHere, we used a murine model of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy to investigate how aging influences efficacy, from CAR T cell production to in vivo anti-tumor activity.

ResultsWe found that aging reduced CAR T cell production yields and altered their phenotype and function. Aged CAR T cells were predominantly effector memory CD4 T cells, whereas young CAR T cells were primarily central memory CD8 T cells. Functionally, aged CAR T cells exhibited non-specific cytotoxicity, driven by constitutive degranulation and elevated granzyme B secretion independent of CAR expression. This phenotype was induced by the aged microenvironment, as young T cells transferred into aged hosts adopted similar behavior. In vivo, young CAR T cells efficiently reduced tumor burden in young leukemia-bearing hosts, but were not effective in aged hosts, where the aged microenvironment impaired CAR T cell persistence.

ConclusionThese findings indicate that aging impacts CAR T cell therapy at multiple levels, from manufacturing to therapeutic efficacy, highlighting the need to design tailored immunotherapies for elderly patients.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

Contrary to the common assumption that PGCs directly develop into germline stem cells (GSCs), recent mammalian data and our zebrafish observations suggest a more complex picture. We hypothesized that individual PGCs contribute differentially to gonad development. To test this hypothesis, we developed two Cre-based lineage tracing systems and demonstrate that PGCs give rise to at least four distinct clone types in zebrafish. We observed no restriction in clone type localization along the anterior-posterior axis, suggesting these differences are PGC intrinsic or locally determined. Further examination of the ovarian reserve revealed functional evidence that some PGCs generate self-renewing GSCs, while others produce non-renewing progenitors that are depleted with successive matings. Collectively, our findings propose a revised model of vertebrate germline establishment with implications to reproductive lifespan. This model suggests that differentiation potential varies among PGCs, allowing individual PGCs to directly differentiate into multiple distinct germ cell types, including renewing GSCs and transient populations that contribute to an early wave of gametes.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway plays a key role in inducing cardiac hypertrophy and in regulating specific protein translation. However, it is unclear how the specificity is achieved, and the spatiotemporal dynamics of protein translation remain unexplored.

MethodsWe employed single-molecule imaging of nascent peptides (SINAPs) reporters to visualize and analyze the translation dynamics in single adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and tracked active translation sites at high spatiotemporal resolution. We also examined the effects of adrenergic stimulation and the role of the ERK pathway in translation localization.

ResultsOur findings revealed that translation sites are primarily localized near Z-lines in cardiomyocytes, with some sites being highly dynamic and moving during translation. The 3 untranslated regions did not significantly change the localization of translation. Many translation sites co-localized with microtubules, and their movement predominantly occurred along microtubular tracks. Adrenergic stimulation led to a transient shift in translation activity toward the peri-nuclear region, peaking at 12 hours and requiring ERK pathway activity for this localization change.

ConclusionsOur high-resolution single-cell study demonstrates that protein translation in cardiomyocytes is dynamic and responsive to hypertrophic stimuli in an ERK-dependent manner. The localized translation mechanism allows cardiomyocytes to rapidly adapt to changing environments by preferentially translating mRNAs in the peri-nuclear region.

These findings provide new insights into the spatial regulation of translation in cardiomyocytes and its role in cardiac hypertrophy.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

Despite emerging as important sensors of infection to regulate immunity and inflammation, the mechanisms by which pain-sensing nociceptor neurons can detect infections are poorly defined. Using C. elegans as a tractable model host that shares many features with mammalian systems, we investigated nociceptor function during bacterial infection. Results In vivo intracellular Ca2+ imaging of nociceptor ASH neurons revealed a drastic reduction in ASH responses to aversive stimuli in Staphylococcus aureus-infected animals compared to noninfected controls. Morphological examination showed that the ASH neurons lost integrity in the sensory processes that extend to the mouth, in a pathogen growth phase-dependent manner. Neighboring neurons did not exhibit this pathogen-induced neurodegeneration (PaIN) phenotype. Genetic analysis suggested that apoptosis, necrosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy are dispensable for the PaIN phenotype. In contrast, loss of the evolutionarily conserved stress-response transcription factor HLH-30/TFEB reduced the penetrance of ASH PaIN by about 50%. Moreover, infected animals showed defective ASH-mediated evasive behaviors, suggesting that the S. aureus-triggered drop in ASH activation and morphological degeneration are physiologically relevant. Conclusions Collectively, these findings reveal that nociceptor neurons lose functional and morphological integrity during infection with S. aureus, with severe consequences for animal behavior.

However, localizing subdural electrodes in patients with brain tumors presents unique challenges due to altered neuroanatomy and the impracticality of acquiring extraoperative computed tomography (CT). To address this gap, we developed BrainTRACE, a novel MATLAB tool that combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cortical vascular reconstructions, and intraoperative photography for accurate subdural electrode grid placement. Methods: Preoperative MRI, cortical photography, and subdural electrode array data were recorded from patients with diffuse glioma and brain metastasis. BrainTRACE generated three-dimensional cortical surfaces, integrated vascular reconstructions, and enabled precise placement of electrode grids. Each electrode was placed based on cortical anatomy and vascular landmarks informed by intraoperative photographs. Novice and expert-level proficiency were quantified. Results: Expert users achieved high consistency and accuracy, with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.934 and a mean deviation of 4.3 mm from consensus placements. Novice users demonstrated lower reliability (ICC = 0.399) and greater variability, averaging a 16.3 mm deviation from consensus. These findings highlight the non-trivial nature of intraoperative ECoG localization, which requires neuroanatomical expertise for successful grid placement. Conclusion: BrainTRACE enables accurate localization of intraoperative ECoG electrodes in brain tumor patients. By integrating anatomical images, intraoperative photographs, and vascular mapping, the tool addresses challenges posed by tumor-induced artifacts. While requiring that users have cortical neuroanatomical expertise, BrainTRACE provides a practical tool for neurosurgical and neuroscience applications, including brain malignancy, epilepsy, and deep brain stimulation procedures.

Our super-resolution movies reveal differences in 53BP1 foci contour: some foci are compact and stationary while others appear amorphous, dynamically changing shapes. To explore them, we developed FRAP in the Super-Resolution regime (FRAP-SR). 53BP1 foci with an amorphous loose contour display subcompartments that recover 53BP1-eGFP signals rapidly, indicating differential protein mobilities and 53BP1 functions within a single foci. In contrast, 53BP1-eGFP foci with a compact contour recover uniformly as single foci but show higher heterogeneity in 53BP1-eGFP recovery rates compared to foci that recover as multiple subcompartments. In cells released from aphidicolin, amorphous foci show faster 53BP1 recovery compared to compact foci. We discuss the conceptual implications of different 53BP1 mobilities, and how the FRAP-SR method transforms studies of dynamic 60-100 nm structures.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

While chromosomes of most species are monocentric with a single centromere, a minority exhibit holocentricity, with a centromere along the chromatid length. Sporadic emergence of holocentricity suggests multiple independent transitions. To explore this, we compared the centromere and (epi)genome organization of two sister genera with contrasting centromere types: Chamaelirium luteum with large ""macro-monocentromeres"" and Chionographis japonica with holocentromeres. Both exhibit chromosome-wide histone phosphorylation patterns distinct from typical monocentric species. Kinetochore analysis revealed similar chimeric Borealin in both species, with additional KNL2 loss and NSL1 chimerism in Cha. luteum. The broad-scale synteny between both genomes supports de novo holocentromere formation in Chi. japonica. Despite sharing features with both centromere types, macro-monocentromeres do not represent a direct link between mono- and holocentromeres. We propose a model for the divergent evolution involving kinetochore gene mutations, altered histone phosphorylation patterns, and centromeric satellite DNA amplification.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

Here, we use a synthetic platform to introduce diverse promoters at defined genomic sites within the Sox2 locus and measure how these inserted promoters attenuate activity of the endogenous promoter. We find that reduction in endogenous Sox2 transcription is correlated with the strength of the inserted promoter. Transcription from the inserted promoter is required for competition, with longer transcript resulting in more competition. Furthermore, competition is dependent on the location of the inserted promoter, but independent of cohesin mediated loop extrusion. Lastly, we encounter silencing of the de novo inserted promoter by HUSH, which counteracts competition. Together, our work uncovers the rules governing promoter competition, highlights its impact on tuning gene expression levels, and suggests a role for RNA in mediating this process.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

Due to its high conservation, the 3CLpro is relatively stable across all these variants without significant changes, suggesting that drugs targeting this enzyme could be effective against all variant viruses. And compared to traditional antibodies, nanobodies show significant advantages against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Traditional antibodies often lose their inhibitory activity due to viral mutation. Nanobodies are characterised by their small size, high stability, high affinity for antigen binding, and high water solubility, which enable them to capture viruses quickly and effectively address the continuous mutations and persistent infections of SARS-CoV-2. In this research, we devised a strategy to produce nanobodies by utilizing a fragment-generating large language model, resulting in the identification of a nanobody named Nb01. Nb01 exhibits potent and broad-spectrum neutralizing activity against numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants. The nanobody Nb01, directed against the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, demonstrated efficacy against the majority of prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants. Notably, it has a higher affinity than the current best performing nanobodies (S43, bn03, R14, and 3-2A2-4) for most of the variants, including the Alpha (27.5%), Gamma (29.7%), Omicron BA.2 (32.2%), BA.4/5 (81.2%), BF.7 (64.2%) and XBB (5.5%) variants. For other variants, Nb01 displayed affinities that were on par with these benchmark nanobodies. In summary, the exceptional specificity, low toxicity, robust stability, and extensive spectrum of Nb01 indicate its potential to be developed as a nanobody therapeutic for the management of SARS-CoV-2 infections and its diverse variants.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

Given evidence of increased intestinal permeability in ALS, we investigated its link to neuroinflammation and oxysterol alterations in SOD1G93A rats. Methods: Oxysterols were quantified in plasma and spinal cord from presymptomatic and symptomatic SOD1G93A rats and age-matched controls via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Circulating LBP, a marker of intestinal permeability, was quantified via ELISA. Results: Oxysterols involved in bile acid biosynthesis - 7-hydroxycholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH), and 3{beta}-hydroxycholestenoic acid - were increased in the plasma of symptomatic rats. The neuronal oxysterol 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24(S)-OH) decreased in the spinal cord but increased in the plasma. In contrast, 27-OH and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH) levels were elevated in both plasma and spinal cord, with 25-OH rising during the presymptomatic stage. Presymptomatic animals also exhibited elevated LBP levels, which strongly correlated with spinal cord 25-OH levels, suggesting a link between systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation in ALS. Conclusion: Oxysterol alterations in plasma and spinal cord suggest compromised blood-spinal cord barrier integrity and early neuroinflammation. Elevated LBP levels indicate increased intestinal permeability and circulating LPS as contributors to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. These findings highlight 25-OH and LBP as markers and mediators of gut-brain axis interactions in ALS pathogenesis, particularly in the presymptomatic phase.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

This emerging technique involves flash melting a cryo sample with a laser beam to provide a brief time window during which dynamics are initiated. When the laser is switched off, the sample revitrifies, arresting the proteins in their transient configurations. However, observations have so far been limited to tens of microseconds only, due to the instability of the thin liquid film under laser irradiation. Here, we seal samples between two ultrathin, vapor-deposited silicon dioxide membranes to extend the observation window by an order of magnitude. These membranes not only allow for reconstructions with near-atomic spatial resolution, but can also be used to eliminate preferred particle orientation. Finally, we perform a time-resolved temperature jump experiment on the 50S ribosomal subunit that provides new insights into the conformational landscape of the L1 stalk. Our experiments significantly expand the capabilities of microsecond time-resolved cryo-EM and promise to bridge the gap to the millisecond timescale, which can already be addressed with traditional approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

These analyses use genome-wide patterns of variation to provide an average picture of genetic structure and relatedness. However, evolutionary processes result in different patterns of relationship among samples in local genomic regions as compared to the genome-wide aggregate. Recently, these local patterns of relatedness have been used to identify regions under selection and inverted segments. Here, we propose a unifying method to dissect these local deviations in genetic relatedness. Our method, Local Decomposition and Similarity to All Regions (LODESTAR), uses Procrustes Analysis to assess the similarity between local MDS results computed using pairwise allele sharing distances or a set of user-defined points. Given two sets of points, Procrustes Analysis computes the optimal rotation and scaling that fits one set of points onto the other, while maintaining the relative relationship between points within both sets. We use the Procrustes statistic to measure the similarity between the two sets of points. We show how this method can be used to explore local relatedness patterns that mirror sampling geography or population stratification by performing Procrustes analysis between local relatedness plots and coordinates representing sampling geography or between local relatedness plots and the genome-wide relatedness plot, respectively. In addition, we show how the variance of samples in lower-dimensional space can capture regions lacking population structure and inverted segments.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

PFC often uses distinct subspaces to represent incoming sensory information and to maintain it in working memory. However, its generally assumed that a subspace carries specific information within a specific time frame. Here, in two datasets, we show that neither assumption is correct. The same subspace used during initial encoding was later reactivated during the behavioral response. We also found that subspaces ostensibly dedicated to processing sensory information were recycled to represent behavioral response information later in a trial. We further found a consistent spatial mapping between the original subspace usage and its later recycling. These results demonstrate previously unknown flexibility of PFC subspace coding, both in the deployment of subspaces across time and in their multiplexing of information. This flexibility suggests that PFC subspaces function more like ""workspaces"" into which different types of information can be written.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

Gamete release is often synchronised with respect to the daily light changes at sunrise and sunset. In the hydrozoan jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica, morning spawning occurs when oocyte maturation and gamete release are induced by maturation-inducing hormone (MIH) neuropeptides released from opsin-expressing cells in the gonad directly upon light stimulus. Here, we characterise the distinct spawning cycle of a previously undescribed species Clytia sp. IZ-D identified on the Pacific coast of Japan, which releases gametes in the evening. Clytia sp. IZ-D jellyfish spawn 14 hours after light stimuli under a 24-hour light-dark cycle and exhibit autonomous and synchronised spawning cycles with a 20-hour interval under constant light. We found that the female spawning cycle reflects the growth and acquisition of maturation competence by oocytes, such that each day a new batch of growing oocytes becomes responsive to MIH at a time that correlates with the timing of actual spawning. We propose that the synchronised evening spawning in this species is controlled by an unusual circadian timing mechanism based on the progressive development of gamete competence to MIH and modulation of the opsin-controlled MIH signalling pathway. This mechanism may provide resilience to light cycle instability due to local climate variation and ensure reproductive isolation from other Clytia species by alternating the gamete release timing.","NA","biorxiv",1746742153510

We present a new framework - Adaptive Diagnostic Architecture for Personalized Testing by Mass Spectrometry (ADAPT-MS) - that enables direct diagnostic and prognostic interpretation of discovery-mode proteomics data at the level of individual samples. ADAPT-MS dynamically retrains simple, robust classifiers based on the proteins quantified in each sample, eliminating the need for imputation or fixed panels. Applied to plasma and cerebrospinal fluid datasets across diseases and clinical centers, it achieves high performance and generalizability using robust, transparent and generalizable statistical models. A single proteomic measurement can support multiple diagnostic questions via retrospective cohort matching, with each classification taking only seconds. As population-scale proteomics datasets grow, this approach lays the foundation for scalable, real-time, and personalized diagnostics directly from proteome-wide data. Such a community effort may help to transform discovery proteomics into a routine clinical tool.

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

(2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1746742153510
