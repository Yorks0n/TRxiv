Because these RBD sequences did not match known circulating strains and their source was not known, we termed them ""cryptic lineages"". To date, more than 20 cryptic lineages have been identified using the RBD-focused sequencing strategy. Here, we identified and characterized additional cryptic lineages from SARS-CoV-2 wastewater sequences submitted to NCBIs Sequence Read Archives (SRA). Wastewater sequence datasets were screened for individual sequence reads that contained combinations of mutations frequently found in cryptic lineages but not contemporary circulating lineages. Using this method, we identified 18 cryptic lineages that appeared in multiple samples from the same sewershed, including 12 that were not previously reported. Partial consensus sequences were generated for each cryptic lineage by extracting and mapping sequences containing cryptic-specific mutations. Surprisingly, seven of the mutations that appeared convergently in cryptic lineages were reversions to sequences that were highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2-related bat Sarbecoviruses. The apparent reversion to bat Sarbecovirus sequences suggests that SARS-CoV-2 adaptation to replicate efficiently in respiratory tissues preceded the COVID-19 pandemic.","NA","medrxiv",1735423716385

However, several emerging JN.1 sublineages, such as LF.7.2.1, MC.10.1, NP.1, and, especially, LP.8.1, have demonstrated superior growth advantages compared to XEC. It is critical to access the virological and antigenic characteristics of these emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we found that LF.7.2.1 is significantly more immune invasive than XEC, primarily due to the A475V mutation, which enabled the evasion of Class 1 neutralizing antibodies. However, LF.7.2.1's weak ACE2 binding affinity substantially impaired its fitness. Likewise, MC.10.1 and NP.1 exhibited strong antibody immune evasion due to the A435S mutation, but their limited ACE2 engagement efficiency restricted their growth advantage, suggesting that A435S may regulate the Spike conformation, similar to the NTD glycosylation mutations found in KP.3.1.1 and XEC. Most importantly, we found that LP.8.1 showed comparable humoral immune evasion to XEC but demonstrated much increased ACE2 engagement efficiency, supporting its rapid growth.

In North America, infections in novel avian and mammalian species suggest the potential for changing ecology and establishment of new animal reservoirs. Outbreaks among domestic birds have persisted despite aggressive culling, necessitating a re-examination of how these outbreaks were sparked and maintained. To recover how these viruses were introduced and disseminated in North America, we analyzed 1,818 Hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences sampled from North American wild birds, domestic birds and mammals from November 2021-September 2023 using Bayesian phylodynamic approaches. Using HA, we infer that the North American panzootic was driven by [~]8 independent introductions into North America via the Atlantic and Pacific Flyways, followed by rapid dissemination westward via wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, shorebirds, and Galliformes, while species such as songbirds, raptors, and owls mostly acted as dead-end hosts. Unlike the epizootic of 2015, outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by [~]46-113 independent introductions from wild birds, with some onward transmission. Backyard birds were infected [~]10 days earlier on average than birds in commercial poultry production settings, suggesting that they could act as ""early warning signals"" for transmission upticks in a given area. Our findings support wild birds as an emerging reservoir for HPAI transmission in North America and suggest continuous surveillance of wild Anseriformes and shorebirds as crucial for outbreak inference. Future prevention of agricultural outbreaks may require investment in strategies that reduce transmission at the wild bird/agriculture interface, and investigation of backyard birds as putative early warning signs.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of AIV infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We identified 607 AIV infections in felines, including 302 associated deaths, comprising 18 countries and 12 felid species. We observed a drastic flux in the number of AIV infections among domestic cats in 2023 and 2024, commensurate with the emergence of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b.

Stomatal complexes in the emerging succulent model Kalanchoe laxiflora consist of two guard cells surrounded by three anisocytic subsidiary cells (SCs). Here, we show that these SCs shuttle ions and thus likely support stomatal movements. Furthermore, gene editing, reporter lines and protein overexpression implicate the stomatal transcription factor MUTE in facilitating additional rounds of asymmetric divisions that form SCs in succulents. This is opposite to the role of MUTE in Arabidopsis thaliana, where it stops rather than induces asymmetric divisions, but reminiscent of MUTE's SC-related function in grasses. Together, our work deciphers an intricate genetic mechanism that generates innovative stomatal morphology in Crassulaceae succulents.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Although the behavioral manifestations of sequence learning are clear, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Motor sequence learning may arise from three distinct processes: (1) improved execution of individual movements independent of their sequential context; (2) enhanced anticipation of ""what"" movement should be executed next, enabling faster initiation; and (3) the development of motoric sequence-specific representations that encode ""how"" movements should be optimally performed within a sequence. However, many existing paradigms conflate the ""what"" and ""how"" components of learning, as participants often acquire both the sequence content (what to do) and its execution (how to do it). This overlap obscures the distinct contributions of each mechanism to motor sequence learning. In this study, we disentangled these mechanisms using a continuous reaching task. Performance in trained sequences was compared to random sequences to rule out improvements attributable solely to isolated movement execution. By also varying how many upcoming targets were visible we assessed the role of anticipation in learning. When participants could only see one future target, improvements were mostly due to them learning which target would come next. When they could see four future targets, participants immediately demonstrated fast movement times and increased movement smoothness, surpassing late-stage performance in the one target condition. Crucially, even with full visibility of future targets, participants showed further sequence-specific learning caused by a continuous optimization of movement trajectories. Follow-up experiments revealed that the learned sequence representations were effector-specific and encoded contextual information of four movements or longer. Our paradigm enables a clear dissociation between the ""what"" and ""how"" components of motor sequence learning and provides compelling evidence for the development of effector-specific sequence representations that guide optimal movement execution.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1735423716386

Recently, a proxy for DNA mechanics, cyclizability, was measured by loop-seq and enabled genome-scale investigation of DNA mechanics. Here, we use this dataset to build a computational model predicting bias-corrected intrinsic cyclizability, with near-perfect accuracy, solely based on DNA sequence. Further, the model predicts intrinsic bending direction in 3D space. Using this tool, we aimed to probe mechanical selection - that is, the evolutionary selection of DNA sequence based on its mechanical properties - in diverse circumstances. First, we found that the intrinsic bend direction of DNA sequences correlated with the observed bending in known protein-DNA complex structures, suggesting that many proteins co-evolved with their DNA partners to capture DNA in its intrinsically preferred bent conformation. We then applied our model to large-scale yeast population genetics data and showed that centromere DNA element II, whose consensus sequence is unknown, leaving its sequence-specific role unclear, is under mechanical selection to increase the stability of inner-kinetochore structure and to facilitate centromeric histone recruitment. Finally, in silico evolution under strong mechanical selection discovered hallucinated sequences with cyclizability values so extreme that they required experimental validation, yet, found in nature in the densely packed mitochondrial(mt) DNA of Namystynia karyoxenos, an ocean-dwelling protist with extreme mitochondrial gene fragmentation. The need to transmit an extraordinarily large amount of mtDNA, estimated to be > 600 Mb, in combination with the absence of mtDNA compaction proteins may have pushed mechanical selection to the extreme. Similarly extreme DNA mechanics are observed in bird microchromosomes, although the functional consequence is not yet clear. The discovery of eccentric DNA mechanics in unrelated unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes suggests that we can predict extreme natural biology which can arise through strong selection. Our methods offer a way to study the biological functions of DNA mechanics in any genome and to engineer DNA sequences with desired mechanical properties.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

However, no current computational model explains V4 responses under natural conditions. To address this, we developed a new hierarchical convolutional energy (HCE) model reflecting computations thought to occur in areas V1, V2, and V4, but which consists entirely of simple- and complex-like units like those found in V1. In contrast to prior models, the HCE model is trained end-to-end on neurophysiology data, without relying on pre-trained network features. We recorded 313 V4 neurons during full-color nature video stimulation and fit the HCE model to each neuron. The model's predicted optimal patterns (POPs) revealed complex spatiotemporal pattern selectivity in V4, supporting its role in representing space, time, and color. These findings indicate that area V4 is crucial for image segmentation and grouping operations that are essential for complex vision. Thus, responses of V4 neurons under naturalistic conditions can be explained by a hierarchical three-stage model where each stage consists entirely of units like those found in area V1.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

The crlRNAs target and inhibit the promoters of various immune systems, including the newly characterized Nezha and Gabija, as well as eight previously unrecognized systems that feature distinct defensive domains. Notably, CRISPR regulation balances the expression level of these systems to ensure effective anti-phage activity while avoiding their autoimmunity risks. In return, the supervised immune systems trigger abortive infections when CRISPR-Cas is inhibited by viral anti-CRISPR proteins, thereby offering an anti-anti-CRISPR protection at the population level. Moreover, these systems complement CRISPR immunity with a differing anti-phage profile.

Recent studies highlight the significance of interactions between ACh and various neuromodulators in regulating complex behaviors. The ability to simultaneously image ACh and other neuromodulators can provide valuable information regarding the mechanisms underlying these behaviors. Here, we developed a series of red fluorescent G protein-coupled receptor activation-based (GRAB) ACh sensors, with a wide detection range and expanded spectral profile. The high-affinity sensor, rACh1h, reliably detects ACh release in various brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and cortex. Moreover, rACh1h can be co-expressed with green fluorescent sensors in order to record ACh release together with other neurochemicals in various behavioral contexts using fiber photometry and two-photon imaging, with high spatiotemporal resolution. These new ACh sensors can therefore provide valuable new insights regarding the functional role of the cholinergic system under both physiological and pathological conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

However, how the genetic sex shapes the molecular architecture of the nervous system at a single neuron level is still unknown. To address this gap, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile the transcriptome of the sex-shared nervous system of adult male and hermaphrodite Caenorhabditis elegans. By ranking neurons based on the degree of molecular dimorphism, we uncover novel sexually dimorphic neurons such as PLM neurons, where functional dimorphism was corroborated by diminished posterior touch responses in hermaphrodites. We identify sex-specific regulators of mechanosensory behavior and neuronal function by combining our dataset with reverse genetic screens. While most sex-shared neurons retain their neurotransmitter identity, the male neuropeptide connectome undergoes substantial remodeling, with most of the neuropeptides showing a male-bias expression. This reinforces the notion that neuropeptides are crucial for diversifying connectome outputs. Furthermore, by correlating gene expression with outgoing synaptic connectivity, we identified regulatory candidates for synaptic wiring, including both shared and sex-specific genes. This comprehensive resource provides foundational insights into the molecular drivers of sexual dimorphism, facilitating future exploration of regulatory mechanisms and their impact on sex-specific behaviors in higher organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

There are a range of methods for HGT inference, but they are seldom systematically compared with each other. This is due to the validation problem associated with HGT inference. It is impossible to go back in time and know the true HGT events that we infer today, that too after the effect of other evolutionary processes. In the absence of such a benchmark, inference methods are often validated using simulated data. Simulations may not accurately reflect reality. They can be biased by our current understanding of evolution and by simplifying assumptions. The assumptions made in the inference model may also get incorporated into the simulation. Here, we perform a large-scale comparison of HGT inference methods using a common dataset of bacterial genomic data. We focus on how they infer clusters of neighboring co-acquisitions and co-transferred genes, as well as the inference of HGT experienced by genes associated with environmental response. Our analysis reveals that implicit phylogenetic methods, which depend on gene presence-absence profiles rather than gene trees, demonstrate superior performance in inferring meaningful HGT events. Our findings underscore the importance of selecting an appropriate inference method to accurately infer HGT. We offer practical recommendations to guide the choice of such methods and establish a comprehensive benchmark, which can inform future development of HGT inference approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Here we show that LAMA5, a central BM component, is critical for luminal mammary tumour initiation, and controls tumor progression and phenotype development. LAMA5 is overexpressed in both human and mouse luminal mammary tumours and LAMA5 downregulation attenuates growth of human breast cancer cells. Prepubertal luminal deletion of Lama5 in MMTV-PyMT mice results in marked reduction in emergence of early hyperplasias, along with a shift from mature hormone receptor (HR+) positive luminal epithelial phenotype towards a HR+ progenitor phenotype, and widespread alterations in extracellular matrix and Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signalling genes, including overexpression of Fgf receptor 2 (Fgfr2) in the HR+ progenitor cells. Single allele deletion, but not biallelic deletion of Lama5 additionally inhibits growth and progression towards advanced mammary carcinomas. However, inhibition of Fgf receptors restores growth decrease and induces apoptosis in biallelic-Lama5-deleted organoids without affecting wildtype organoids.

Although different biochemical mechanisms are proposed, due to the dearth of direct force measurements, how mechanical forces determine the competition outcome remains unclear. Here, using ex vivo tissues and different cell lines, we have discovered an unknown form of cell competition that is regulated by differences in force transmission capabilities, favoring cell types with stronger intercellular adhesion. Direct force measurements reveal increased mechanical activity at the interface of the two competing cell types in the form of large stress fluctuations which can lead to upward forces and cell elimination. We show how a winning cell type endowed with a stronger intercellular adhesion exhibits a higher resistance to elimination while benefiting from efficient force transmission to neighboring cells.

In this study, the effects of DAMP/MAMP oligosaccharides mixture (Oligo-Mix) derived from plant cell wall (cello-oligosaccharide and xylo-oligosaccharide), and fungal cell wall (chitin-oligosaccharide) were examined in cucumber. Treatment of cucumber with Oligo-Mix promoted root germination and plant growth, along with increased chlorophyll contents in the leaves. Oligo-Mix treatment also induced typical defense responses such as MAP kinase activation and callose deposition in leaves. Pretreatment of Oligo-Mix enhanced disease resistance of cucumber leaves against pathogenic fungi Podosphaera xanthii (powdery mildew) and Colletotrichum orbiculare (anthracnose). Oligo-Mix treatment increased the induction of hypersensitive cell death around the infection site of pathogens, which inhibited further infection and the conidial formation of pathogens on the cucumber leaves.

In cultured cells, chemical-mediated control of Cas9 activity can limit off-target effects and enable mechanistic study of essential genes. However, widely-used Tet-On systems often show leaky Cas9 expression, leading to unintended edits, as well as weak activity upon induction. Leakiness can be distinctly problematic in the context of Cas9 nuclease activity, which may result in cumulative DNA damage and degradation of the target cell genome over time. To overcome these deficiencies, we established transgenic platforms that minimize Cas9 functionality in the off-state along with maximized and uncompromised on-state gene editing efficiency. By combining conditional destabilization and inhibition of Cas9, we developed an all-in-one (one or multiple guide RNAs and Cas9) ultra-tight, Tet-inducible system with exceptional dynamic range (on vs. off-state) across various cell lines and targets. As an alternative to Tet-mediated induction, we created a branaplam-regulated splice switch module for low-baseline and robust Cas9 activity control. Lastly, for circumstances where DNA damage needs to be avoided, we constructed a dual-control, Tet-inducible CRISPRi module for tight and potent transcriptional silencing. This upgraded suite of inducible CRISPR systems has broad applications for numerous cell types and experimental conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Furthermore, sensory neuronal TrkB expression and function has been traditionally associated with non-nociceptive neurons, particularly A{delta} low-threshold mechanoreceptors (A{delta}-LTMRs). In this study, we challenge these prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that TrkBT1 is the predominant TrkB isoform expressed in sensory neurons and plays a functional role in modulating neuronal activity. We present a comprehensive characterization of TrkBT1 expression and function in trigeminal sensory neurons and uncover its critical role in nociceptor activity, sensitization, and survival. Using western blot, immunohistochemistry and single-cell RTPCR, we demonstrate that TrkBT1 is the predominant isoform expressed in nociceptors, identified by markers such as TRPV1, TRPA1, TRPM8 and 5HT3A as well as non-nociceptors, while TrkBTK+ is restricted to non-nociceptive subpopulation. Functionally, we show that acute application of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induces modest calcium influx in nociceptors, though unable to sensitize nociceptors. However, prolonged BDNF exposure significantly potentiates capsaicin-induced calcium influx, an effect blocked by the TrkB-specific antagonist ANA12. Intriguingly, BDNF also promotes the survival of both nociceptive and non-nociceptive sensory neurons in culture, an effect similarly dependent on TrkBT1 activity. Our data also reveal that ANA12 inhibits BDNF-mediated neuronal sensitization and survival in a concentration-dependent manner, implicating distinct TrkBT1 signaling pathways in these processes. Collectively, our findings redefine TrkBT1 as a functional modulator of nociceptor activity rather than a passive regulator of full-length TrkB. By uncovering its dual roles in nociceptor sensitization and survival, this study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of BDNF/TrkB signaling in pain. Future work evaluating the role of TrkBT1 in sensory biology could offer new perspectives on how this receptor contributes to neuronal function and plasticity during chronic pain conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Previously, we showed that transplantation of cortical interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) opens a robust period of ocular dominance plasticity 33-35 days after transplantation into neonatal host visual cortex. The plasticity can be induced by transplanting either PV or SST MGE-derived cortical interneurons; it requires transplanted interneurons to express the vesicular GABAergic transporter; and it is manifested by changes to the host visual circuit. Here, we show that transplantation of MGE-derived cortical interneurons into the adult host visual cortex also opens a period of ocular dominance plasticity. The transplanted interneurons must be active to induce plasticity, and the neuronal activity and tuning of visually evoked responses in transplanted and host PV and SST interneurons are modulated by the locomotor state of the host. We also show that changes in activity over the period of plasticity induction are different between PV and SST interneurons but similar between host and transplanted interneurons of each type.

Additionally, RF-EMF can activate L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (LTCC), which have been linked to sleep quality and EEG oscillatory activity.

ObjectiveThis study investigates whether the allelic variant rs7304986 in the CACNA1C gene, encoding the 1C subunit of LTCC, modulates 5G RF-EMF effects on EEG spindle activity during NREM sleep.

MethodsThirty-four healthy, matched participants, genotyped for rs7304986 (15 T/C and 19 T/T carriers), underwent a double-blind, sham-controlled study with standardized left-hemisphere exposure to two 5G RF-EMF signals (3.6 GHz and 700 MHz) for 30 min before sleep. Sleep spindle activity was analyzed using high-density EEG and the Fitting Oscillations & One Over f (FOOOF) algorithm.

ResultsT/C carriers reported longer sleep latency compared to T/T carriers. A significant interaction between RF-EMF exposure and rs7304986 genotype was observed, with 3.6 GHz exposure in T/C carriers inducing a faster spindle center frequency in the central, parietal, and occipital cortex compared to sham.

ConclusionThese findings suggest 3.6 GHz 5G RF-EMF modulates spindle center frequency during NREM sleep in a CACNA1C genotype-dependent manner, implicating LTCC in the physiological response to RF-EMF and underscoring the need for further research into 5G effects on brain health.","NA","medrxiv",1735423716386

Core genes are traditionally identified by the analysis of amino acid similarities among proteomes, but can also be defined using structures, which bear potential in deep clades beyond the twilight zone of amino acids. Despite breakthroughs in accurate AI-driven protein structure prediction, obtaining full 3D structural models on a proteomic scale is still prohibitively slow. Here, we present Unicore, a novel method for identifying structural core genes at a scale suitable for downstream phylogenetic analysis. By applying the ProstT5 protein language model to the input proteomes to obtain their 3Di structural strings, Unicore saves over three orders of magnitude in runtime compared to a full 3D prediction. Using Foldseek clustering, Unicore identifies single-copy structures universally present in the species and aligns them using Foldmason. These structural core gene alignments are projected back to amino acid information for downstream phylogenetic analysis. We demonstrate that this approach defines core genes with linear run-time scaling over the number of species, up to 56 times faster than OrthoFinder, while reconstructing phylogenetic relationships congruent with conventional approaches. Unicore is universally applicable to any given set of taxa, even spanning superkingdoms and overcoming limitations of previous methods requiring orthologs of fixed taxonomic scope, and is available as a free and open source software at https://github.com/steineggerlab/unicore.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

However, an increased incidence of severe dengue and fatalities are seen in females of the reproductive age. As per vaginal (PV) bleeding is an important complication that has not been well characterized, we sought to determine the frequency, complications and disease outcomes in women who develop PV bleeding. Methodology/Principal findings 288 adult female patients were recruited from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Sri Lanka. All clinical features and laboratory investigations were recorded throughout the duration of hospital admission along with treatment received. 28/288 (9.72%) reported PV bleeding, with 12/28 (42.85%) developing dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) compared to 65/260 (25%) of those who did not have bleeding. Women who developed PV bleeding were more likely to have developed DHF (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.1, p=0.06), abdominal pain (OR=2.17, 95% CI = 0.99 to 4.69, p = 0.06), vomiting (OR= 2.0, 95% CI= 0.89 to 4.44, p= 0.10), diarhoea (OR= 4.35, 95% CI = 1.908 to 9.610, p= 0.0004) or evidence of any fluid leakage (OR= 1.98, 95% CI = 0.91 to 4.5, p = 0.11). Although not significant, those who had PV bleeding were more likely to have been given intravenous fluids, blood transfusions and colloids. Conclusions PV bleeding appears to associate with worse disease outcomes. The possible contribution of PV bleeding to higher incidence of severe dengue and fatality rates observed in many countries, should be further investigated.","NA","medrxiv",1735423716386

Hippocampal place cells are the neuronal substrate of these cognitive maps. However, while hippocampal allocentric position coding in reference to external landmarks is well characterized, the determinants of idiothetic hippocampal distance coding remain poorly understood. Using virtual reality, electrophysiological recordings in mice, and local cue manipulations we could dissociate distance from position coding. In the cue-poor condition, we found pervasive distance coding with high distance indices in all bidirectional place cells including both superficial and deep CA1 pyramidal cells. In this condition, the mapping of distance onto a low-dimensional manifold and rigid distance relationships between place fields suggested strong attractor dynamics similar to those observed for grid cells. Inactivation of the medial septum (MS), which disrupts grid cells, significantly reduced both distance coding and rigid distance dynamics, suggesting an alteration (but not complete abolition) of the underlying attractor. In contrast, allocentric position coding could be observed in cue-rich environments, predominantly engaged deep CA1 pyramidal cells, and persisted during MS inactivation. These results are consistent with a selective contribution of grid cells and associated rigid attractor dynamics to hippocampal idiothetic distance coding but not allocentric position coding.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Our DNA nanoruler design enables the deployment of oligonucleotide-barcoded labeling targets with nanometer precision near the enzymes. By quantifying labeling yields using quantitative PCR and mapping them against target distances, we uncovered surprising insights into the labeling mechanisms. Contrary to the prevailing diffusive labeling model, our results demonstrate that TurboID primarily operates through contact-dependent labeling. Similarly, APEX2 shows high labeling efficiency within its direct contact range. In parallel, it exhibits a low-level diffusive labeling towards more distant phenols. These findings reframe our understanding in the mechanism of proximity labeling enzymes, at the same time highlight the potential of DNA nanotechnology in spatially profiling reactive species.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

The periosteum is typically quiescent, but upon fracture, periosteal cells proliferate and contribute to bone fracture repair. The expansion of the periosteum is regulated by gene transcription; however, the molecular mechanisms behind periosteal expansion are unclear. Here, we show that Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) mediate periosteal expansion and periosteal cell proliferation. Bone fracture increases the number of YAP-expressing periosteal cells, and deletion of YAP and TAZ from Osterix (Osx) expressing cells impairs early periosteal expansion. Mechanistically, YAP regulates both  cell-intrinsic and  cell-extrinsic factors that allow for periosteal expansion. Specifically, we identified Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) as a cell extrinsic factor regulated by YAP, that rescues the impairment of periosteal expansion upon YAP/TAZ deletion. Together, these data establish YAP mediated transcriptional mechanisms that induce periosteal expansion in the early stages of fracture repair and provide new putative targets for therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Recent studies have identified several cell behaviors as triggers, including junctional tension, cell density and geometry, and topological defects. However, how these factors drive stratification throughout the entire epithelium remains poorly understood. Here, we report a mechanism underlying epithelial stratification that mirrors the physics of phase transition. Combining cell culture with three-dimensional vertex modeling, we demonstrate that epithelium stratifies via nucleation-growth process, i.e., multilayer origins dispersedly appear and expand across the epithelium via unordered intermediate states. This process is akin to a phase transition induced by a mechanical instability inherent in the foam-like geometry of the epithelium. Moreover, this concept applies to embryonic skin development and malignant transformation of cancer. These findings conceptualize epithelial stratification as a form of a phase transition governed by nucleation and growth, offering a physical perspective on various epithelial developments.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Across 75 individuals including 25 patients with cancer, we prepared conventional DBS, and plasma-separating DBS (psDBS) from whole blood samples, prior to plasma separation. In paired comparisons of plasma DNA between psDBS and blood tubes, we observed correlated concentrations, similar distributions of fragment lengths, correlated genome-wide fragmentation features, and equivalent performance of machine learning algorithms for cancer detection. Our results provide proof-of-principle that plasma DNA fragmentation analysis can be performed from small amounts of DNA obtained from psDBS.

In pond snails and Caenorhabditis elegans, cell division plays a critical role in regulating both levels of L-R asymmetries. However, the precise mechanism by which cell division breaks cellular-level L-R symmetry remains elusive. Here, we show that cytokinesis-induced cortical flow twists the cell-cell adhesion pattern, which in turn controls the L-R asymmetrical constriction of the contractile ring, thereby breaking the first L-R body symmetry in C. elegans. During the second mitosis of C. elegans embryos, we discovered the twisting of the HMR-1/cadherin patch at the cell-cell contact site. The HMR-1 patch twisting occurs within a few minutes upon cytokinesis onset, with individual cadherin foci within the patch exhibits directional flow and coalescence. This cell type exhibits chiral cortical flow, characterized by counter-rotational surface flows in the two halves of the dividing cell. We found that this chiral cortical flow plays a critical role in regulating HMR-1 patch twisting by inducing cadherin flow. As the HMR-1 patch twists, the contractile ring preferentially associates with HMR-1 on the right side of the embryo. We demonstrate that HMR-1 patch twisting regulates the L-R asymmetric ring closure. This study uncovers an interplay between three fundamental cellular processes--cell-cell adhesion, cytokinesis, and cell polarity-- mediated by cadherin flow, shedding light on cadherin flows role in cellular patterning during development.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Here we show ATP synthesis of Na+-transporting Enterococcus hirae V-ATPase (EhVoV1) driven by electrochemical potential gradient of Na+ across the membrane (sodium motive force, smf). We reconstituted EhVoV1 into liposome and performed a luciferin/luciferase-based assay to analyze ATP synthesis quantitatively. Our result demonstrates that EhVoV1 synthesizes ATP with a rate of 4.7 s-1 under high smf (269.3 mV). The Michaelis constants for ADP (21 {micro}M) and inorganic phosphate (2.1 mM) in ATP synthesis reaction were comparable to those for ATP synthases, suggesting similar substrate affinities among rotary ATPases regardless of their physiological functions. Both components of smf, Na+ concentration gradient across the membrane ({Delta}pNa) and membrane potential ({Delta}{psi}), contributed to ATP synthesis, with {Delta}pNa showing a slightly larger impact. At the equilibrium points where smf and Gibbs free energy of ATP synthesis are balanced, EhVoV1 showed reversible reactions between ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. The obtained Na+/ATP ratio (3.2 {+/-} 0.4) closely matched the value expected from the structural symmetry ratio between EhVo and EhV1 (10/3 = 3.3), indicating tight coupling between ATP synthesis/hydrolysis and Na+ transport. These results reveal inherent functional reversibility of EhVoV1. We propose that physiological function of EhVoV1 in vivo is determined by relatively small smf against large Gibbs free energy of ATP synthesis, in addition to the absence of inhibitory mechanisms of ATP hydrolysis which are known for ATP synthases.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

The recognition between NLRs and pathogen secreted effectors often triggers a localized programmed cell death termed hypersensitive response (HR). Despite significant progresses have been achieved in understanding canonical NLRs with the N-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains, the molecular mechanisms underlying TIR-only proteins in plant immune responses remain unclear. In this study, we identified six TIR-containing proteins in maize, including three TIR-only proteins. Functional analysis showed that ZmTIR1 and ZmTIR2, but not ZmTIR3, confer autoactive HR when transiently expressed in N. benthamiana. The autoactivity conferred by ZmTIR1 and ZmTIR2 depends on EDS1-PAD4-RNL module and their putative NADase activities. Interestingly, ZmTIR1 and ZmTIR2 predominantly localize in the punctate dots and likely form condensation, while ZmTIR3 mainly localizes in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Two specific amino acids in the BB-loop region were identified to be required for ZmTIR1- and ZmTIR2-mediated condensation formation and auto-HR. Furthermore, ZmTIR and ZmTIR2 are induced by Cochliobolus heterostrophus, the causal agent of southern leaf blight (SLB) in maize, and knock-down the expression of ZmTIR1 or ZmTIR2 decreased the resistance to SLB in maize.

Additionally, we also obtained a high-quality transcriptome for annotation. This resource represents the first chromosome-level assembly for snails in the superfamily Helicoidea, which includes more than 5,000 species of terrestrial snails, and will facilitate genomic study in Bradybaena and, more broadly, in the superfamily Helicoidea.

In an OPM, the sample space is mapped to a distortion free image space via remote focusing, and the oblique light-sheet plane is mapped via a tilted tertiary imaging system onto a camera. As a result, the 3D point-spread function and optical transfer function are tilted to the optical axis of the tertiary imaging system. To satisfy Nyquist sampling, small scanning steps are required to encompass the tilted 3D OTF, slowing down acquisition and increasing sample exposure. Here we show that a judicious amount of under-sampling can lead to a form of aliasing in OPM that can be recovered without a loss of spatial resolution or introducing artifacts. The resulting speed gain depends on the optical parameters of the system and can reach 2-4-fold in our demonstrations.

Here we show that, adjusting for geography, phylogeny, and environment, genetic diversity is inversely correlated with diversity in linguistic structures. Low genetic diversity (i.e. excess homozygosity) results from relative isolation, and this promotes diversification in language. High genetic diversity results from contact and migration, and this promotes homogenization in language. These effects are particularly pronounced in Asia and, under some conditions, also in a few other areas, suggesting sociocultural factors contributing to differences in how strongly isolation favors linguistic diversity and how strongly contact promotes linguistic homogenization. Our results suggest that present-day hotspots of linguistic diversity, which are characterized by relative isolation, may provide a privileged window on the dynamics of linguistic evolution as they are less affected by the vast demographic expansions, migrations, and extinctions that characterize the Neolithic age.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Here, we demonstrate in vitro and in Drosophila cells that the mitotic kinase POLO phosphorylates PP187B at a conserved residue (T286) within a pocket implicated in the recognition of RVxF-containing target proteins. Phosphorylation of T286 inhibits PP187B binding to the RVxF motif of the SAC kinase MPS1, dampening the dephosphorylation of MPS1 T-loop. Phosphorylation of T286 is dynamically regulated during mitosis. It occurs at unattached/tensionless kinetochores and decreases as chromosomes congress. Expression of phosphomimetic PP187BT286D prevents MPS1 inactivation in metaphase and causes a SAC-dependent delay of anaphase onset. Conversely, an unphosphorylatable PP187BT286A mutant impairs MPS1 activation at unattached kinetochores and weakens the SAC. In vivo, larval neuroblasts expressing PP187BT286 phosphomutants exhibit frequent chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy. Thus, our findings identify POLO-mediated phosphorylation of PP187B as a critical regulatory strategy that fine-tunes phosphatase activity to ensure a robust and timely SAC and prevent genome instability.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Human cortical neurons differ from those of other species, such as rodents, in both their morphological and physiological characteristics. Could the distinct properties of human cortical neurons help explain the superior cognitive capabilities of humans? Understanding this relationship requires a metric to quantify how neuronal properties contribute to the functional complexity of single neurons, yet no such standardized measure currently exists. Here, we propose the Functional Complexity Index (FCI), a generalized, deep learning-based framework to assess the input-output complexity of neurons. By comparing the FCI of cortical pyramidal neurons from different layers in rats and humans, we identified key morpho-electrical factors that underlie functional complexity. Human cortical pyramidal neurons were found to be significantly more functionally complex than their rat counterparts, primarily due to differences in dendritic membrane area and branching pattern, as well as density and nonlinearity of NMDA-mediated synaptic receptors. These findings reveal the structural-biophysical basis for the enhanced functional properties of human neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Thus, inferring single-cell phenotypes with the leverage of bulk data is practical. Here we proposed an algorithm for Single Cells Phenotype Prediction based on the expression profiles of phenotype-associated marker genes in bulks and single cells (ScPP). ScPP first analyzes bulk data to identify phenotype-associated marker genes. Next, ScPP evaluates the enrichment scores of the phenotype-associated marker gene sets in single cells using the AUCell algorithm. The single cells with the phenotype are defined as the intersection of the single cells with top  ranks according to the phenotype-associated AUC values and the single cells with bottom  ranks according to the opposite phenotype-associated AUC values. Finally, all single cells are determined as phenotype+, phenotype- or background. We demonstrated that ScPP could effectively recognize cell subpopulations with specific phenotypes, including tumor malignancy, estrogen receptor status, microsatellite instability, copy number variation, survival and immunotherapy response. Compared to the established algorithms (Scissor and scAB), ScPP displays more excellent predictive performance and needs less running time. Thus, ScPP is an effective and competitive tool for inferring cell phenotypes.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

However, the mechanisms that separate TADs remain incompletely understood. Most boundaries between TADs contain CTCF binding sites (CBSs), which individually contribute to the blocking of Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. Using genome-wide classification, we show here that TAD boundary width forms a continuum from narrow to highly extended and correlates with CBS distribution, chromatin features, and gene regulatory elements. To investigate how these boundary widths emerge, we modified the Random Cross-Linker (RCL) polymer model to incorporate specific boundary configurations, enabling us to evaluate the differential impact of boundary composition on TAD insulation. Our analysis identifies three generic boundary categories, each influencing TAD insulation differently, with varying local and distal effects on neighboring domains. Notably, we find that increasing boundary width reduces long-range inter-TAD contacts, as confirmed by Hi-C data. While blocking loop extrusion at boundaries indirectly promotes spurious intermingling of neighboring TADs, extended boundaries counteract this effect, emphasizing their role in maintaining genome structure. In conclusion, TAD boundary width not only enhances the efficiency of loop extrusion blocking but may also modulate enhancer-promoter contacts over long distances across TADs boundaries, providing a mechanism for transcriptional regulation.

Significance statementTopologically Associating Domains (TADs) compartmentalize vertebrate genomes to limit cross-domain enhancer-promoter loops. Our study reveals that boundaries between TADs are diverse genomic entities that range from narrow to highly extended. Using an interdisciplinary approach that combines genome-wide data analysis with biophysical polymer modeling, we find that wider TAD boundaries reduce spurious long-range interactions between neighboring domains. Moreover, we reveal how different boundary components can create this difference in insulating capacity. Our identification and characterization of TAD boundary width and composition suggests they have the potential to regulate the formation of enhancer-promoter loops across TAD boundaries at close and long distance.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

However, existing tools primarily focus on detecting localized, highly-concentrated, interactions. Furthermore, the wide variety of available chromatin conformation datasets is rarely utilized in developing effective loop callers. Here, we present Polaris, a universal tool that integrates axial attention with a U-shaped backbone to accurately detect loops across different 3D genome assays.

Poor water quality, inadequate sanitation, poverty, undernutrition, and limited healthcare access contribute to this lingering problem, along with emerging environmental stressors driven by climate change. We analysed long-term spatial relationships between environmental, socioeconomic, and maternal/child factors using Demographic and Health Surveys and WorldClim data across eight South and Southeast Asian countries (n = 66,545 clusters; 3,143,811 child-level observations).

We employed boosted regression trees to assess variable importance across five thematic phases: socio-economic, maternal, child, climate, and combined. We selected variables based on biological plausibility, collinearity checks, and completeness. We addressed uncertainty through multiple imputation and stochastic resampling, and we evaluated model performance using cross-validation.

The main predictors of diarrhoea incidence included annual temperature variability, precipitation in the wettest month, maternal education, and household size. Higher annual temperature range (30-40 {degrees}C) was associated with a [~] 39% increase in diarrhoea probability, while lower precipitation in the wettest month (< 600 mm) increased risk by [~] 29%, highlighting the role of drier conditions. We found that maternal education < 8 years increased diarrhoea probability by [~] 18%, and household sizes exceeding six members increased it by [~] 9%.

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1735423716386

Unfortunately, clinical responses remain limited due to rapid resistance onset. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional inhibition. However, there is limited mechanistic understanding of KRAS degradation in vivo. Here, we developed a preclinical LUAD mouse model and demonstrated that targeted oncogenic KRAS degradation induces rapid tumor regression. Transcriptional, histological, and immunophenotypic analyses revealed a substantial remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Notably, disease relapse observed during long-term degrader treatment stems from proteolysis machinery dysregulation, indicating resistance mechanisms distinct from those reported upon KRAS inhibition. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of KRAS degradation in LUAD, offering insights into cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms driving durable antitumor responses and supporting further clinical exploration.

A foundational question is whether social observation and experience engage common circuit mechanisms that enable behavioral change. While classic studies on social learning have shown that aggressive behaviors can be learned through observation3, it remains unclear whether aggression observation promotes persistent neural changes that generalize to new contexts. Here, to directly compare the effects of aggression experience and observation at brain-wide scale, we develop a strategy to perform large-scale cell-type specific recordings across subcortical networks for social behavior control and learning. We record longitudinally while animals ""train"" through direct experience or observation, then probe shared differences in behavior and neural activity in a novel ""hard"" aggression context. Using supervised and unsupervised methods for behavioral quantification, we detect unique signatures of a shared behavioral strategy not present in animals with no training. During observation, we find widespread activation that mimics experience in networks for behavior generation, with critical differences in signals associated with reward and threat learning. After observation, we observe that changes persist into the novel aggression context, with increased similarity in the neural dynamics between experience and observation groups. Network-level modeling reveals persistent shared changes to a core aggression network, with widespread decoupling of inhibition from a key hypothalamic output region. This demonstrates that ""experience-like"" activity during observation can recruit a shared plasticity mechanism that biases behavior toward adaptive defensive strategies in new contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Despite the critical importance of antibodies in a wide range of areas of biomedical significance, the traditional process of antibody discovery is limited by inefficiency, high costs and failure rates, fundamental logistical hurdles, limited scalability potential, and long turnaround times. Recent computational biology efforts, including machine learning/artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, have proven to have critical capabilities and advantages over purely experimental techniques, disrupting a number of areas that have traditionally met with limited success, such as protein structure modeling, enzyme engineering, drug design, and others (1-3). In the context of antibodies, AI-based approaches have been developed to optimize existing antibodies and generate novel antibody sequences in a target-agnostic manner (4-6). However, the ability of AI approaches to generate novel paired antibody sequences against a specific target (antigen) of interest has not been validated. In this work, we present MAGE (Monoclonal Antibody GEnerator), a sequence-based protein Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned for the task of generating paired variable heavy and light chain antibody sequences against antigens of interest. Here we show that MAGE is capable of efficiently generating diverse antibody sequences that are distinct from the antibody sequences found in the training datasets, with experimentally validated binding specificity against SARS- CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), an emerging avian influenza H5N1 viral hemagglutinin (H5), and respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV-A) prefusion F. MAGE is trained on protein sequence alone and requires only an antigen sequence as input for antibody design, with no need for a preexisting antibody template. MAGE represents a first-in-class model capable of designing human antibodies with demonstrated functionality against multiple targets. AI models for generation of human antibodies will provide unique and disruptive capabilities in the far-reaching field of antibody science.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Using the model bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, we showed that methionine activates catabolic processes, including extracellular electron transfer, at submillimolar concentrations.

We also observe higher levels of selective forces acting on habitat-specific metabolic genes linked to SAR11 fitness and polyphyletic distributions of habitat preferences and metabolic traits across SAR11 subclades, suggesting that contrasting lifestyles have emerged across multiple lineages independently. Together, these insights reveal niche-partitioning within sympatric and parapatric populations of SAR11 and demonstrate that the immense genomic diversity of SAR11 bacteria naturally segregates into ecologically and genetically cohesive units, or ecotypes, that vary in spatial distributions in the tropical Pacific.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

A total of 1,017 female mosquitoes (81.4%, N=1,249) intercepted on nets suspended from helium balloons at altitudes of 120-290 m above ground over Mali and Ghana were screened for infection with arboviruses, plasmodia, and filariae, using pan-genus qPCR analyses followed by sequencing of positive samples. The mosquito fauna collected at altitude comprised 61 species, across 9 genera, dominated by Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles. Infection and infectiousness rates of high-altitude migrant mosquitoes were 7.2% and 4.4% with plasmodia, 1.6% and 0.6% with filariae, 3.5% and 1.1% with flaviviruses, respectively. Nineteen mosquito-borne pathogens were identified, including three arboviruses: dengue, West Nile and MPoko viruses, 13 putative plasmodia species including Plasmodium matutinum and P. relictum, three filariids, including Pelecitus spp., 27 insect-specific viruses and 5 non-mosquito-borne pathogens (e.g., Trypanosoma theileri). Confirmed head-thorax (disseminated) infections of multiple pathogens in multiple mosquito species, eg., Culex perexiguus, Coquilletidia metallica, Mansonia uniformis, and Anopheles squamosus provides evidence that pathogens carried by high-altitude windborne mosquitoes are infectious and likely capable of infecting naive hosts far from their starting location.

However, there are other reorganizations of the network that do not involve fission and fusion. One such exception is the elusive, beads-on-a-string morphological transition of mitochondria. During such transitions, the cylindrical tubes of the mitochondrial membrane transiently undergo shape changes to a string of pearls connected along thin tubes. These dynamics have been anecdotally observed in many contexts and given disparate explanations. Here we unify these observations by proposing a common underlying mechanism based on the biophysical properties of tubular fluid membranes for which it is known that, under particular regimes of tension and pressure, membranes reach an instability and undergo a shape transition to a string of connected pearls. First, we use high-speed light-sheet microscopy to show that transient, short-lived pearling events occur spontaneously in the mitochondrial network in every cell type we have examined, including primary fibroblasts, T-cells, neurons, and budding yeast. We present evidence that transient mitochondrial pearling occurs during important biological events, particularly during T cell activation and neuronal firing. Using our high-temporal resolution data, we identify two distinct categories of spontaneous pearling, i) internal pressure-driven pearling regulated by ionic flux, and ii) external tension-driven pearling regulated by molecular motors. By applying live-cell STED microscopy we document the structural reorganization of inner cristae membranes during mitochondrial pearling. We then compare numerous methods for inducing pearling, including the ability to induce these dynamics with single mitochondrion precision. These methods include ionophores, channel activators, osmotic shock, detergents, laser stimulation, membrane intercalating molecules, chemical fixation, and micro-needle force. These disparate inducers establish three main physical causes of pearling, i) ionic flux amplifying internal osmotic pressure, ii) membrane packing lowering bending elasticity, and iii) external mechanical force increasing membrane tension. Pearling dynamics thereby reveal a fundamental biophysical facet of mitochondrial biology. We suggest that pearling should take its place beside fission and fusion as a key process of mitochondrial dynamics, with implications for physiology, disease, and aging.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

While contemporary research has somewhat advanced our understanding of DMT, and psychedelics more broadly, there is little research that integrates time-resolved measures of subjective experience with temporally fine-grained brain imaging. We therefore present the current study, a repeated-measures dose-dependent study of the subjective and neural dynamics induced through DMT under naturalistic conditions. Nineteen participants received either a 20mg or 40mg dose of freebase DMT across two dosing sessions in a blinded, counterbalanced order, with blinding rates consistent across doses. Electroencephalography (EEG) data was collected, as well as time-resolved retrospective measures of subjective experience (Temporal Experience Tracing). Both doses of DMT induced rapid changes in experience dimensions. However, the 40mg dose induced significantly more extreme visual hallucinations and emotionally intense experiences. Further, we computed a variety of neural markers on the EEG data, and found that oscillatory alpha power and permutation entropy were most strongly associated with continuous subjective experience dimensions. Strikingly, lempel-ziv complexity, a previously hailed as a robust correlate of subjective experiences within the psychedelic-state, was the least strongly associated neural marker. These findings provide an important insight into how distinct neural dynamics may contribute to this radical and intense altered state of consciousness.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

To test this, we reconstituted critical SARS-CoV-2 RNA-RNA interactions in Nucleocapsid condensates. We observed that RNAs with low propensity RNA-RNA interactions resulted in more round, liquid-like condensates while those with high sequence complementarity resulted in more heterogeneous networked morphology independent of RNA structure stability. Residue-resolution molecular simulations and direct sequencing-based detection of RNA-RNA interactions support that these properties arise from degree of trans RNA contacts.

Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we found that CD4 T cell depletion before infection results in short-lived plasma cells secreting low-avidity antiviral IgG with limited BCR diversity and weak virus-neutralizing ability. CD4 T cell deficiency during persistent infection incurs a shift from a T-dependent (TD) to T-independent (TI) Ab response, resembling the pre-existing TI Ab response. CD4 T cell loss before infection or during persistent infection is conducive for emergence of Ab-escape variants. Cryo-EM reconstruction of complexes of MuPyV virions with polyclonal IgG directly from infected mice with pre-existing or acquired CD4 T cell deficiency enabled visualization of shortfalls in TI IgG binding. By debilitating the antiviral IgG response, CD4 T cell deficiency sets the stage for outgrowth of variant viruses resistant to neutralization.

Our data reveal that mitochondria frequently undergo spontaneous and reversible pearling - a biophysical instability in which tubules undulate into regularly spaced beads. We discovered that pearling imposes a characteristic length scale, simultaneously mediating nucleoid disaggregation and establishing inter-nucleoid distancing with near-maximally achievable precision. Cristae invaginations play a dual role: lamellar cristae density determines pearling frequency and duration, and preserves the resulting nucleoid spacing after recovery. The distribution of mitochondrial genomes is thus fundamentally governed by the interplay between spontaneous pearling and cristae ultrastructure.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Unsupervised clustering of genomic principal component analysis (PCA) data revealed a non-uniform distribution of genetic diversity and substantial population structure in the All of Us cohort, with dense clusters of closely related participants interspersed among less dense regions of genomic PC space. Supervised genetic ancestry inference was performed using genetic similarity between All of Us participants and global reference population samples.

Participant genetic similarity clusters show group-specific genetic ancestry patterns, with distinct patterns of continental and subcontinental ancestry among groups. We also explored how genetic ancestry changes over space and time in the United States (US). African and American ancestry are enriched in the southeast and southwest regions of the country, respectively, whereas European ancestry is more evenly distributed across the US.

This process is typically slow in nature because of low mutational frequency. In contrast, the B cells of mammalian immune systems have evolved somatic hypermutation (SHM) mechanisms that introduce mutations at the immunoglobulin genomic loci at a significantly higher frequency than the rest of the genome. SHM allows B cells to rapidly evolve new antibody sequences without compromising their fitness as a consequence of genome-wide mutations. In this work, we developed a continuous directed evolution platform in human B cell lines (CODE-HB) that recruits and repurposes the SHM mechanisms to rapidly evolve reporter proteins like the Green Fluorescent Protein. This approach uses a stable, non-immunoglobulin locus within the genomes of human B cell lines. To comprehensively characterize the mutational profile and breadth of this strategy, we performed single-molecule sequencing experiments. We illustrate the utility of the platform by rapidly evolving antibody fragments in a continuous manner by B cell surface display targeting avian subtypes of influenza hemagglutinin (e.g., H5) from emerging strains.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Traditionally we assess fusion and fission by snapshots of protein markers at distinct time points or in vitro models to infer outcomes in vivo. Recent technological advancements enable visualization of mitochondrial dynamics in vivo using fluorescent microscopy. Our study modified this technique to evaluate mitochondrial dynamics in skeletal muscle, comparing young (6mo) and old (24mo) mice in vivo and contrasting this to ex vivo and in vitro models. We hypothesized that in vitro and ex vivo models would have higher rates of dynamics than in vivo models and that young animals would have higher rates than old animals. We electroporated mitochondrial matrix-targeted photo-activatable GFP into the tibialis anterior (TA) of young and old C57Bl6 mice and imaged using multiphoton microscopy. We also measured rates of mitochondrial dynamics using single fibers isolated from the TA of the electroporated mice, as well as C2C12 myotubes transfected with the same plasmids. We found that the rates of dynamic events in vivo are slower than previously indicated, with the C2C12 myoblasts having the fastest rates of dynamic events across all models. We also observed that dynamic rates are slower in old animals compared to young animals. Finally, we found that rates of dynamic events were higher in old animals after an acute bout of exercise. Our data demonstrate it is possible to directly measure rates of mitochondrial dynamics in vivo.

Many species are motile, despite having no appendages and a completely rigid cell body. Cells move to seek out nutrients, locate mating partners, and undergo vertical migration. To explore the natural diversity of diatom motility, we perform a comparative study across five common biofilm-forming species. Combining morphological measurements with high-resolution cell tracking, we establish how gliding movements relate to the morphology of the raphe - a specialised slit in the cell wall responsible for motility generation. Our detailed analyses reveal that cells exhibit a rich but species-dependent phenotype, switching stochastically between four stereotyped motility states. We model this behaviour and use stochastic simulations to predict how heterogeneity in microscale navigation patterns leads to differences in long-time diffusivity and dispersal. In a representative species, we extend these findings to quantify diatom gliding in complex, naturalistic 3D environments, suggesting that cells may exploit these distinct motility signatures to achieve niche segregation in nature.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

GeneSetCluster clusters gene-sets based on shared genes, providing a high-level overview of the involved biological pathways, thereby facilitating interpretability. However, the original version faced limitations in managing redundancies across multiple gene sets. Additionally, programmatic tools like GeneSetCluster can be challenging for users with limited coding expertise.

ResultsWe introduce GeneSetCluster 2.0 which substantially improves upon its predecessor. This update presents a new methodology for addressing duplicated gene-sets and incorporates a seriation-based clustering algorithm that reorders data, enabling the identification of patterns. The updated version is optimized for faster computational performance through parallelization, reducing execution times. Furthermore, the 2.0 version also enhances cluster annotation by identifying relevant tissues and biological processes associated with each cluster. Finally, to improve accessibility and usability, we have developed a user-friendly web application, making GeneSetCluster 2.0 suitable for a broader audience, including those without programming expertise. We also ensured the interplay between the R package, targeting users with programming knowledge, and the web-application, which targets the rest of the users.

ConclusionGeneSetCluster 2.0 significantly improves the original version by providing a more comprehensive, intuitive, and efficient exploration of GSA results. On the other hand, it bridges the gap between bioinformaticians and clinicians in multidisciplinary teams.

However, stable genome editing in plants remains limited by the time- and labor- intensive process of generating transgenic plants, as well as by the efficient isolation of desired heritable edits. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the morphogenic regulator GRF-GIF on plant regeneration and genome editing outcomes in tomato. We demonstrate that expressing a tomato GRF-GIF chimera reliably accelerates the onset of shoot regeneration from callus tissue culture by approximately one month and nearly doubles the number of recovered transgenic plants. Consequently, the GRF-GIF chimera enables the recovery of a broader range of edited haplotypes and simplifies the isolation of mutants harboring heritable edits, but without markedly interfering with plant growth and development. Based on these findings, we outline strategies that employ basic or advanced diagnostic pipelines for efficient isolation of single and higher-order mutants in tomato. Our work represents a technical advantage for tomato transformation and genome editing, with potential applications across other Solanaceae species.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

However, the relationship between the actin network density, the penetration ability of actin-binding proteins into the network, and resulting network dynamics remains elusive. Here, we report an in vitro optogenetic system, named OptoVCA, which induces Arp2/3-mediated actin network assembly on a lipid membrane. By changing the illumination power, duration, and pattern, the OptoVCA flexibly manipulates the density, thickness, and shape of the actin network. Taking these advantages, we examine the effects of the network density on the two representative actin-binding proteins, myosin and ADF/cofilin. We find that the penetration of myosin filaments into the network is strictly inhibited by only a several-fold increase in network density due to the steric hindrance. Furthermore, penetrated myosin filaments induce directional actin flow when the network has a density gradient. On the other hand, ADF/cofilin penetrates into the network regardless of network density, however, network disassembly is dramatically inhibited by only a several-fold increase in network density. Thus, the OptoVCA contributes to understanding cell mechanics through the examination of the network density-dependent effect on the actin-binding proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

However, due to the high noise in the unspliced/spliced data for individual genes, existing RNA velocity models often fail to accurately capture the dynamics between unspliced and spliced abundance in the phase portraits of many genes. In addition, optimizing the high dimensional dynamics of all genes within a global framework and effectively handling multi-lineage data still require further exploration in RNA velocity modeling. Inspired by the role of transcriptional regulation in linking genes into complex networks and providing additional context for gene dynamics modeling, we propose TSvelo. TSvelo integrates cross-gene transcriptional regulation and gene-specific splicing processes of all genes into one neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)-based framework. By incorporating cell-specific transcriptional rates with the unspliced-spliced data, TSvelo precisely models the dynamics of velocity genes, learns global pseudotime, and can be extended to multi-branch datasets. Experiments on six scRNA-seq datasets, including two multi-branch datasets, demonstrate that TSvelo outperforms existing methods in modeling gene dynamics, inferring cell pseudotime and trajectories, and analyzing gene expression patterns across branches.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Mixotrophy in ciliates is commonplace, but has been investigated at a cellular and molecular level almost entirely in one organism, Paramecium bursaria. Reliance on just one model system makes it difficult to know which cell biological aspects of this system represent general features of ciliate mixotrophy versus accidental features of the specific organism. Here we describe the cell biology and genome of the giant heterotrichous ciliate Stentor pyriformis. We show that this giant unicellular organism contains Chlorella variabilis as its endosymbiont, that the Chlorella can live freely outside the host, that within the host the Chlorella cells are docked near the cell surface, surrounded by microtubule ""baskets"", and that the photosynthetic efficiency of the Chlorella is reduced inside the Stentor cell compared to when it is free-living outside the host, with photon energy instead being shunted to non-photochemical quenching. Compared to the non-mixotrophic Stentor coeruleus, S. pyriformis has several distinct cellular features that may be related to endosymbiosis: the presence of microtubule baskets, which are absent in S. coeruleus; positive rather than negative phototaxis, which is likely an adaptation to allow the photosynthetic symbionts access to sufficient light; and a lack of pigment in the host cell, which may be an adaptation to tolerate high light levels. Compared to P. bursaria, S. pyriformis has several similar cellular features: in both organisms, the symbiont is a strain of Chlorella variabilis; the Chlorella endosymbiont retains the ability to live freely when separated from the host; and the algal symbionts contained in perialgal vesicles are docked at the cell surface. One potentially informative difference between P. bursaria and S. pyriformis is that S. pyriformis employs a standard genetic code, similar to other Stentor species but different from most other ciliates, including P. bursaria, which use a non-standard code in which one or more stop-codons are respecified to encode amino acids. This difference in genetic code could serve as a barrier to impede gene transfer from symbiont to host in other ciliates, but this would not be a factor in S. pyriformis. A second cell biological difference is that whereas P. bursaria performs phototaxis by a kinetic accumulation mechanism, in which swimming is non-directional but cells slow down in regions of higher light intensity, S. pyriformis performs directed swimming towards the direction of high light intensity. However, as in P. bursaria, phototaxis in S. pyriformis requires the presence of the Chlorella, implying a potential flow of information from the symbiont to direct the orientation and swimming of the host cell. We propose that S. pyriformis will serve as a useful model system for studying the evolution of mixotrophy and endosymbiosis, with unique advantages in terms of size and regenerative ability as well as distinct cellular and genomic features compared with other mixotrophic ciliate models.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Currently known phage counter-defense systems are specific to (the activity of) the targeted bacterial defense system. Here, we uncover a mechanism by which the T7 bacteriophage broadly counteracts bacterial defenses using protein phosphorylation. We show that the T7 protein kinase (T7K), which was believed to specifically redirect the function of a few host proteins, is in fact a hyper-promiscuous, dual-specificity kinase enacting a massive wave of phosphorylation on virtually all host and phage proteins during infection. The scale of phosphorylation vastly exceeds the number of previously known phosphorylation events in E. coli, has no sequence motif specificity, and results in a higher proteome-wide phosphorylation density than that of mammalian cells which encode [~] 500 kinases. Stoichiometry analysis of phosphorylation sites revealed a strong bias of T7K activity towards nucleic acid-binding substrates, which we show is mediated by its C-terminal DNA-binding domain. This specificity for highly stoichiometric phosphorylation of nucleic acid-binding proteins enables the deactivation of DNA-targeting or - containing bacterial defense systems. We provide mechanistic insight into how T7K weakens two such defense systems, Retron-Eco9 and DarTG1, through specific phosphorylation events, with single phosphomimetic mutations in key sites of the toxins abolishing defense. Finally, by screening a large collection of E. coli strains, we provide evidence of broad counter-defense capacities for T7K in nature, as strains counteracted contain diverse bacterial defense systems.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

They infect and cause disease in humans, animals and plants but also play crucial roles in the ecology of microbial communities. Tolerance to genetic change, high-mutation rates, adaptations to hosts and immune escape has driven high divergence of viral genes, hampering their functional annotation and phylogenetic inference. The protein structure is more conserved than sequence and can be used for searches of distant homologs and evolutionary analysis of divergent proteins. Structures of viral proteins are traditionally underrepresented in public databases, but recent advances in protein structure prediction allows us to address this issue. Combining two state-of-the-art approaches, AlphaFold2-ColabFold and ESMFold, we predicted models for 85,000 proteins from 4,400 human and animal viruses, expanding the structural coverage for viral proteins by 30 times compared to experimental structures. We also performed structural and network analyses of the models to demonstrate their utility for functional annotation and inference of distant phylogenetic relationships. Taking this approach, we examined the deep evolutionary history of viral class-I fusion glycoproteins, gaining insights on the origins of coronavirus spike protein. To enable further discoveries, we have created Viro3D (https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/), a virus species-centred protein structure database. It allows users to search, browse and download protein models from a virus of interest and explore similar structures present in other virus species. This resource will facilitate fundamental molecular virology, investigation of virus evolution, and may enable structure-informed design of therapies and vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

However, the mechanism(s) by which changes in LD composition and dynamics contribute to pathophysiology of these disorders remains unclear. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a droplet associated protein with a common risk variant (E4) that confers the largest increase in genetic risk for late-onset AD. E4 is associated with both increased neuroinflammation and excess LD accumulation. In the current study, we sought to quantitatively profile the lipid and protein composition of LDs between the neutral E3 and risk variant E4, to gain insight into potential LD-driven contributions to AD pathogenesis. Targeted replacement mice expressing human E3 or E4 were injected with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and after 24 hours, hepatic lipid droplets were isolated for proteomic and lipidomic analyses. Lipidomics revealed a shift in the distribution of glycerophospholipids in E4 LDs with a concomitant increase in phosphatidylcholine species, and overall, the baseline profile of E4 LDs resembled that of the LPS-treated groups. Quantitative proteomics showed that LDs from E4 mice are enriched for proteins involved in protein/vesicle transport but have decreased levels of proteins involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation. Interestingly, proteins associated with LDs showed substantial overlap with previously published lists of AD postmortem tissue and microglia -omics studies, suggesting a potential role for LDs in modulating AD risk or progression. Given this, we exposed primary microglia from the same E3 or E4 mice to exogenous lipid, inflammatory stimulation, necroptotic N2A cells (nN2A), or a combination of treatments to evaluate LD formation and its impact on the cells immune state. Microglia from E4 mice accumulated more LDs in every condition tested, at baseline, and following addition of fatty acids, LPS stimulation, or nN2As. E4 microglia also secreted significantly more cytokines (TNF, IL-1b, IL-10) than E3 microglia in the control, oleic acid, and nN2A treatment conditions, yet showed a blunted response to LPS. In sum, these results suggest that E4 microglia accumulate more LDs compared to E3 microglia and that E4 is associated with a basal LD composition that resembles a pro-inflammatory cell. Together with the high overlap of the LD proteome with established AD-associated datasets, these data further support the idea that alterations in LD dynamics, particularly within microglia, may contribute to the increased risk for AD associated with APOE4.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Here we design, synthesize, and characterize a reversibly photoswitchable morphinan agonist termed azo-morphine-3 (AM-3) which interconverts from low to high efficacy in response to different wavelengths of light to enable optical control of MOR signaling. Cryo-EM structures of the low efficacy trans and high efficacy cis states of AM-3 bound to the MOR reveal distinct binding modes of the photoswitchable azobenzene moiety, each inducing unique structural dynamics, providing insight into the molecular basis of agonist efficacy. In mice, AM-3 drives reversible and repeatable optical control of anti-nociception with a reduced side effect profile owing to its restriction to the periphery and its ability to be locally activated at the site of pain.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

The emergence of single-cell multi-omics technologies has driven the development of several methods that integrate transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data to infer GRNs. While these methods provide examples of their utility in discovering new regulatory interactions, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating their mechanistic and predictive properties as well as their ability to recover known interactions is lacking. To address this, we built a comprehensive framework, Gene Regulatory nETwork Analysis (GRETA), available as a Snakemake pipeline, that includes state of the art methods decomposing their different steps in a modular manner. With it, we found that the GRNs were highly sensitive to methods choices, such as changes in random seeds, or replacing steps in the inference pipelines, as well as whether they use paired or unpaired multimodal data. Although the obtained networks performed moderately well in predictive evaluation tasks and partially recovered known interactions, they struggled to capture causal relationships from perturbation assays. Our work brings attention to the challenges of inferring GRNs from single-cell omics, offers guidelines, and presents a flexible framework for developing and testing new approaches.

Coral bleaching, the disruption of the symbiosis between stony corals and zooxanthellate algae, is driven by climate change-induced seawater warming and further exacerbated by pathogenic microbes. However, how pathogens, especially viruses, contribute to accelerated bleaching remains poorly understood. The present study utilizes the model sea anemone Nematostella vectensis to explore these dynamics by creating a transgenic line with a reporter gene regulated by sequences from two RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) genes involved in antiviral responses. Under heat stress, the reporter gene showed significant upregulation, indicating that these regulatory sequences are indeed responsive to thermal stress. Analyses of transcriptome data of N. vectensis, Exaiptasia diaphana (another sea anemone), and the stony coral Stylophora pistillata revealed stress-induced activation of a set of bona fide immune-related genes conserved between the three species. Population-specific differences in stress-induced transcriptional responses of immune-related genes were evident in both Nematostella and Stylophora, depending on geographic origin. In Exaiptasia, the presence or absence of zooxanthellae also influenced stress-induced immune gene expression. To test whether the viruses themselves may contribute to this immune response under stress, we subjected Nematostella polyps to variable periods of heat stress and measured the transcript levels of resident viruses as well as selected antiviral genes. While the antiviral genes responded within 1-3 hours of heat stress, viral gene expression was already upregulated within 30 minutes, suggesting that their increase might be contributing to the elevated immune response under stress, and consequentially, the further demise of organismal homeostasis. These findings highlight the complex interplay between environmental stress, viruses, immune responses, and symbiotic states in Hexacorallia. Better understanding of these mechanisms could provide insights into the role of immune pathways in coral resilience and bleaching in a changing climate.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

We found that the translation initiation factor EIF4A1, which unwinds complex mRNA structures in the 5 UTR of oncogenic transcripts, is highly expressed in AML stem- and progenitor-like cells. Inhibiting eIF4A with the small molecule Zotatifin reduces translation of transcripts related to the cell cycle and survival. This results in downregulation of AKT, STAT-5, and MCL-1 and underlies synergy of Zotatifin with Venetoclax. The drug combination promotes apoptosis across AML genotypes, while the effect on healthy blood cells is limited.

In this study, we elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of triculamin through heterologous expression and show that the biosynthesis proceeds in the presence of a precursor (triA), macrocyclase (triC), and acetyltransferase (triT). Through in vitro triT acetylation and bioactivity assays, we show that acetylation functions as a resistance mechanism. Genomic searches of triculamin BGC genes across bacteria show that triculamin is more widely distributed than previously anticipated, as triculamin-like core peptides are found in at least three phyla in contrast to previously described lasso peptides that are typically restricted to one phylum. Triculamin BGCs with both canonical and non-canonical RiPP biosynthetic genes were identified. Two strains containing canonical triculamin-like BGCs were chemically characterized and shown to produce the novel triculamin-like lasso peptides palmamin and gelatinamin, the latter of which appears to have an unprecedented additional ring formation. Detailed phylogenetic investigation of the macrocyclases from triculamin-like BGCs suggests that these molecules are products of convergent evolution. These findings broaden the evolutionary and functional landscape of lasso peptides, revealing their unexpected diversification and cross-phylum distribution.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

However, movements are regularly triggered and constantly corrected based on sensory inputs caused by disturbances to the body or environment. Since such disturbances are often predictable and since preparing for disturbances would make movements better, we hypothesized that expectations about sensory inputs also influence preparatory activity in motor circuits. Here we show that when humans and monkeys are probabilistically cued about the direction of a future mechanical perturbation, they incorporate sensory expectations into their movement preparation and improve their corrective responses. Using high-density neural recordings, we establish that sensory expectations are widespread across the brain, including the motor cortical areas involved in preparing self-initiated actions. The geometry of these preparatory signals in the neural population state is simple, scaling directly with the probability of each perturbation direction. After perturbation onset, a condition-independent perturbation signal shifts the neural state leading to rapid responses that initially reflect sensory expectations. Based on neural networks coupled to a biomechanical model of the arm3, we show that this neural geometry emerges through training, but only when the incoming sensory information indicating perturbation direction coincides with - or is preceded by - a condition-independent signal indicating that a perturbation has occurred. Thus, motor circuit dynamics are shaped by future sensory inputs, providing clear empirical support for the idea that movement is governed by the sophisticated manipulation of sensory feedback4.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

We found that Anxa1+ DANs have a unique functional profile, as they do not signal reward or reinforce actions, and they are not necessary for motivated behavior. Instead, activity of Anxa1+ DAN axons correlates with vigorous movements during self-paced exploration, yet their silencing only disrupts a subset of action sequences that mirror a PD bradykinesia profile.

An example of an important social association is that between breeding partners - a key social connection in monogamously breeding species. The selection of a breeding partner begins well before reproduction for many species, and this process can have consequences for subsequent reproductive success. Thus, the non-breeding season can shape behaviour during the breeding season. However, it is currently unknown how outcomes in the breeding season can impact associate choice during the non-breeding season, as studying this has been limited due to requiring high volumes of individual social data across both contexts. This study used three years of wild great tit social data from Wytham Woods, Oxford, UK, to examine social associations between pairs classified with respect to prior and future relationship status. We found a distinct behavioural pattern in divorced pairs, which was present from early in the winter, suggesting that the act of divorce occurs soon after the completion of the breeding season. Pairs forming for the first time behaved similarly to divorced pairs earlier in the season, but became similar to faithful pairs throughout the winter. On a finer spatiotemporal scale the behaviour of faithful and divorced birds diverged over the winter. These results provide the first evidence of when divorce occurs in paired great tits, while suggesting that different behaviours may drive behavioural divorce at different times.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Existing tools for uncovering co-evolutionary signals primarily rely on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), often neglecting considerations of phylogenetic relatedness and shared evolutionary history. Here, we present a novel approach based on the substitution mapping of amino acid changes onto the phylogenetic tree. We categorize amino acids into two groups: 'tolerable' and 'intolerable,' and assign them to each position based on the position dynamics concerning the observed amino acids. Amino acids deemed 'tolerable' are those observed phylogenetically independently and multiple times at a specific position, signifying the position's tolerance to that alteration. Gaps are regarded as a third character type, and we only consider phylogenetically independent altered gap characters. Our algorithm is based on a tree traversal process through the nodes and computes the total amount of substitution per branch based on the probability differences of two groups of amino acids and gaps between neighboring nodes. We employ an MSA-masking approach to mitigate misleading artifacts from poorly aligned regions. When compared to tools utilizing phylogeny (CAPS and CoMap) and state-of-the-art MSA-based approaches (DCA, GaussDCA, PSICOV, and MIp), our method exhibits significantly superior accuracy in identifying co-evolving position pairs, as measured by statistical metrics including MCC, AUC, and F1 score.

Despite its clinical success, the mechanism through which daptomycin exerts its antibacterial properties has remained controversial. Much of the debate is focused around daptomycin's ability to depolarise the cytoplasmic membrane, potential formation of large membrane pores, and its more recently discovered capability to inhibit cell wall synthesis and disturb membrane lipid domain organisation through interactions with cell wall precursor lipids. Here we show that, rather than representing different facets of a single underlying activity, daptomycin exhibits two independent antibacterial mechanisms of action: (i) targeting of cell wall precursor lipids that leads to cell wall synthesis inhibition and (ii) membrane depolarisation that does not rely on interactions with cell wall precursor lipids. This dual mechanism of action provides an explanation for the frequently disagreeing findings obtained through in vivo and in vitro studies and explains why resistance development towards daptomycin is slow and multifactorial. In a broader context, this demonstrates that dual mechanism antibiotics can be clinically successful and exhibit favourable characteristics in terms of real-world, clinically relevant resistance development.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Computational studies suggest that bacterial genomes encode several defence systems, which may act synergistically to enhance phage resistance.

This study explored the role of eight predicted defence systems in the clinical isolate NILS69 of E. coli by testing its susceptibility to 93 phages. Infectivity and adsorption assays using mutants defective in these systems revealed that only PD-T4-3 and RM systems restricted phages able to adsorb. The RM system acted via a predicted Type IV endonuclease and was also able to limit plasmid conjugation if the plasmid was transferred from a donor strain lacking a methylase, which is the hallmark of Type I, II or III RM systems. Other defence systems showed no detectable activity, likely due to phage specificity, environmental regulation, or cofactor requirements.

Perturbation of domain boundaries causes aberrant genomic contacts and gene expression misregulation. Architectural proteins such as CTCF and the cohesin complex are critical to form boundaries. However, we still lack a complete understanding of what makes a boundary more effective at insulating genomic contacts than others. To understand how domains are structured, we experimentally classified boundaries according to their chromatin accessibility as a proxy of protein occupancy in K562 human cells. We found that highly accessible boundaries are occupied by more proteins, are more robust contact insulators, have a more conserved CTCF DNA-binding motif and are more conserved across cell types in contrast to less accessible ones. By exploring the proteins enriched at boundaries with different accessibility, we found that CTCF and cohesin, together with REST, form a module, and ZFN316, together with EMSY, form another module, and both modules occupy boundaries very frequently. Finally, by using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genetic edition of ZNF316 DNA-binding motif at a robust domain boundary, we demonstrate that ZNF316 can block chromatin contacts in the absence of CTCF.

Our results imply that CD4+ T-cell TCRs experience significantly lower forces than previously estimated, with only a small fraction of ligand-engaged TCRs being subjected to these forces during antigen scanning. These rare and minute mechanical forces do not impact the global lifetime distribution of the TCR:ligand bond.

Gastruloids, self-organizing stem cell-based models of post-implantation mammalian development, provide a powerful platform to address this question. Here, we show that physical parameters, particularly system size, critically influence the timing and outcomes of morphogenetic processes. Larger gastruloids exhibit delayed symmetry breaking, increased multipolarity, and prolonged axial elongation, with morphogenesis driven by system size. Despite these variations, transcriptional programs and cell fate composition remain remarkably stable across a broad size range. Notably, extreme sizes show distinct transcriptional modules and clear shifts in gene expression patterns. Intriguingly, size perturbation experiments rescued the morphogenetic and pattern phenotypes observed in extreme sizes, demonstrating the remarkable adaptability of gastruloids to their effective system size. These findings establish gastruloids as versatile models for studying spatiotemporal dynamics in mammalian embryogenesis and reveal how physical constraints decouple transcriptional from morphogenetic programs.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

However, effectively controlling these models to generate novel sequences with desired functions remains a major challenge. Here, we show that Evo, a 7-billion parameter genomic language model, can perform function-guided design that generalizes beyond natural sequences. By learning semantic relationships across multiple genes, Evo enables a genomic ""autocomplete"" in which a DNA prompt encoding a desired function instructs the model to generate novel DNA sequences that can be mined for similar functions. We term this process ""semantic mining,"" which, unlike traditional genome mining, can access a sequence landscape unconstrained by discovered evolutionary innovation. We validate this approach by experimentally testing the activity of generated anti-CRISPR proteins and toxin-antitoxin systems, including de novo genes with no significant homology to any natural protein. Strikingly, in-context protein design with Evo achieves potent activity and high experimental success rates even in the absence of structural hypotheses, known evolutionary conservation, or task-specific fine-tuning. We then use Evo to autocomplete millions of prompts to produce SynGenome, a first-of-its-kind database containing over 120 billion base pairs of AI-generated genomic sequences that enables semantic mining across many possible functions. The semantic mining paradigm enables functional exploration that ventures beyond the observed evolutionary universe.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Here we present initial results for 10.5 Tesla Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) based functional brain imaging (fMRI) of the human brain acquired with previously unavailable or difficult to attain spatial resolutions and functional contrast. We present data obtained with nominal isotropic resolutions ranging from 0.65 to 0.35 mm for partial brain coverage for stimulus evoked responses, and 0.75 mm for whole brain coverage to capture the spontaneous fluctuations that are the source of functional connectivity measures. The increasingly higher nominal resolutions (i.e. smaller voxel volumes and dimensions) employed in image acquisition were shown to correspond to real gains in resolution using image reconstruction methods developed to minimize blurring. Existence of supralinear gains in stimulus-evoked percent signal change and major improvements in statistical significance were evident relative to 7 Tesla, the most advanced commercially available ultrahigh magnetic field platform currently employed in human brain studies. These results were feasible due to gains in intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio, BOLD contrast, and image acceleration provided by the uniquely high magnetic field of 10.5 Tesla, and the use of novel high channel count arrays to capture these gains.

The growing availability of biological data has driven the development of a variety of in silico perturbation methods designed for single-cell analysis, which offer a means to address many inherent limitations of experimental approaches. However, these computational methods are often tailored to specific scenarios and validated on limited datasets and metrics, making their evaluation and comparison challenging. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmarking framework to systematically evaluate in silico perturbation methods across four key scenarios: predicting effects of unseen perturbations in known cell types, predicting effects of observed perturbations in unseen cell types, zero-shot transfer to bulk RNA-seq of cell lines, and application to real-world biological cases. For each scenario, we curated diverse and abundant datasets, standardizing them into flexible formats to enable efficient analysis. Additionally, we developed multiple metrics tailored to each scenario, facilitating a thorough and comparative evaluation of these methods. Our benchmarking study assessed 10 methods, ranging from linear baselines to advanced machine learning approaches, across these scenarios. While some methods demonstrated surprising efficacy in specific contexts, significant challenges remain, particularly in zero-shot predictions and the modeling of complex biological processes. This work provides a valuable resource for evaluating and improving in silico perturbation methods, serving as a foundation for bridging computational predictions with experimental validation and real-world biological applications.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

However, bacteria in nature experience flowing environments that are nutrient limited. Using microfluidics and single cell imaging, we discover that flow promotes growth of the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa at surprisingly low nutrient concentrations. In static environments, cells require high nutrient concentrations as they steadily consume non-renewable resources. In flowing environments, cells grow robustly at very low nutrient concentrations that are constantly replenished. Our simulation-guided experiments show how stopping flow halts growth within minutes and varying flow impacts growth gradients across bacterial populations. By precisely delivering nutrients using microfluidics, we learned that cells in flow can grow on glucose concentrations 1,000 times lower than those observed in typical laboratory experiments. The ultralow glucose concentrations sufficient for growth in flow closely align with the affinity of bacterial glucose transporters, suggesting that bacteria have evolved in flowing environments with scarce nutrients. Collectively, our results emphasize the limits of traditional culturing approaches and highlight how depleted environments can unexpectedly support bacterial growth.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

Using the golden hamster as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persist in the central nervous system, as we found viral RNA and replicative virus in the brainstem after 80 days of infection. Infected hamsters presented a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, with overexpression of innate immunity genes, impacted dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, altered energy metabolism. Finally, the infected hamsters manifested persistent signs of depression and impaired short-term memory, as well as late-onset signs of anxiety, as a valuable model to study long Covid.

Although these methods are conceptually similar, we show by analyzing association studies of 209 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank that they systematically prioritize different genes. This raises the question of how genes should ideally be prioritized. We propose two prioritization criteria: 1) trait importance -- how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and 2) trait specificity -- a genes importance for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, while burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, while burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation. Our results illustrate that burden tests and GWAS reveal different aspects of trait biology and suggest ways to improve their interpretation and usage.","NA","biorxiv",1735423716386

We used individual-level data on disease timing and nightly room assignments in these prisons to reconstruct locations and pathways of transmission statistically, and from that estimated reproduction numbers, locations of unobserved infection events, and the subsequent magnitude and distribution of long COVID prevalence. Where earlier work has recommended smaller cells over large dormitory housing to reduce transmission, recommended use of cells with solid doors over those with bars only, and cautioned against reliance on solid doors (e.g., in cold months when HVAC systems can circulate aerosols), we found evidence of substantial transmission in both dorms and cells regardless of the door and season. Effective reproduction numbers were found to range largely between 0 and 5, in both cells and dorms of all door types. Our estimates of excess case rates suggest that as a result of disparities in incarceration, prison outbreaks contributed to disproportionate disease burden on Black and Indigenous people in California. We estimated that 9,100-11,000 people have developed long COVID as a result of infection in these prison outbreaks, 1,700-2,000 of them with disabling consequences, and that this burden is disproportionately on Black and Indigenous people in comparison to the state as a whole.
