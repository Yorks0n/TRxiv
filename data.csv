To facilitate this goal, we engineered and screened 3365 variants of the fluorescent protein glutamate indicator iGluSnFR3 in neuron culture, and selected variants in the mouse visual cortex. Two variants have high sensitivity, fast activation (< 2 ms) and deactivation times tailored for recording large populations of synapses (iGluSnFR4s, 153 ms) or rapid dynamics (iGluSnFR4f, 26 ms). By imaging action-potential evoked signals on axons and visually-evoked signals on dendritic spines, we show that iGluSnFR4s/4f primarily detect local synaptic glutamate with single-vesicle sensitivity. The indicators detect a wide range of naturalistic synaptic transmission, including in the vibrissal cortex layer 4 and in hippocampal CA1 dendrites. iGluSnFR4 increases the sensitivity and scale (4s) or speed (4f) of tracking information flow in neural networks in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

Defense-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems provide an intriguing counterpoint to this strategy by leveraging DNA synthesis instead. We and others recently showed that DRT2 systems use an RNA template to assemble a de novo gene, leading to expression of an antiviral effector protein, Neo. It remains unknown whether similar mechanisms of defense are employed by other DRT families. Focusing on DRT9, here we uncover an unprecedented mechanism of DNA homopolymer synthesis, in which viral infection triggers polydeoxyadenylate (poly-dA) accumulation in the cell to drive abortive infection and population-level immunity. Cryo-EM structures reveal how a conserved noncoding RNA serves as both a structural scaffold and reverse transcription template to direct hexameric complex assembly and RNA-templated poly-dA synthesis. Remarkably, biochemical and functional experiments identify conserved tyrosine residues within the reverse transcriptase itself that prime DNA synthesis, leading to the formation of high-molecular weight protein-DNA covalent adducts. Synthesis of poly-dA in vivo is regulated by the competing activities of phage-encoded triggers and host-encoded silencers of DRT9. Collectively, our work unveils a novel nucleic acid-driven defense system that expands the paradigm of bacterial immunity and broadens the known functions of reverse transcriptases.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

Here, we performed large-scale shotgun metagenomic sequencing on 1,889 individuals from rural Honduras, providing the most comprehensive microbiome dataset from Central America.

Functional profiling reveals unique carbohydrate metabolism adaptations consistent with high-fiber diets. Longitudinal analysis over two years reveals microbiome instability, with shifts in taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential, including changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we characterize the gut virome and eukaryotic microbiome, identifying novel viral taxa, including Crassvirales phages, and a high prevalence of Blastocystis species in individuals with greater microbial diversity. Finally, by integrating host genomic data obtained from low-pass saliva whole-genome sequencing, we uncover significant host-microbiome associations, highlighting the influence of human genetic variation on microbial composition. People who are more genetically similar also have more similar gut microbiomes. These findings expand our understanding of microbiome diversity in non-industrialized populations, highlighting the uniqueness of those microbiomes and underscoring the need for global microbiome research.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

We present an optimized perchloric acid based workflow with neutralization - PCA-N - that addresses these limitations. By introducing a neutralization step following protein precipitation, PCA N enables direct enzymatic digestion without additional purification steps, reducing sample volume requirements to only 5 uL of plasma while maintaining deep plasma proteome coverage. The streamlined protocol allows preparation of over 10,000 samples per day using 384 well formats at costs comparable to undepleted plasma analysis (NEAT). Rigorous validation according to the recently introduced CLSI C64 guideline demonstrated that despite somewhat higher technical variability compared to NEAT, PCA-N maintained excellent biological resolution and reproducibility. We confirmed the workflow its exceptional stability through analysis of 1,500 quality control samples systematically interspersed among 36,000 plasma samples measured continuously over 311 days. Technical performance remained consistent across multiple instruments, sample preparation batches and nearly a year of measurements. Compared to NEAT plasma proteomics, PCA-N doubled the proteomic depth while maintaining comparable reagent costs and throughput. The minimal sample reequipments, operational simplicity while using only common laboratory chemical and exceptional scalability positions PCA-N as an attractive approach for population level plasma proteomics, democratizing access to deep plasma proteome analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

Application of in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) made it possible to visualize the consequences of mitochondrial depolarization at higher resolution than heretofore attainable. Parkin-expressing U2OS cells were treated with the depolarizing agents oligomycin and antimycin A (OA), subjected to cryo-FIB milling, and mitochondrial structure was characterized by in situ cryo-ET. Phagophores were visualized in association with mitochondrial fragments. Bridge-like lipid transporter (BLTP) densities potentially corresponding to ATG2A were seen connected to mitophagic phagophores. Mitochondria in OA-treated cells were fragmented and devoid of matrix calcium phosphate crystals. The intermembrane gap of cristae was narrowed and the intermembrane volume reduced, and some fragments were devoid of cristae. A subpopulation of ATP synthases re-localized from cristae to the inner boundary membrane (IBM) apposed to the outer membrane (OMM). The structure of the dome-shaped prohibitin complex, a dodecamer of PHB1-PHB2 dimers, was determined in situ by sub-tomogram averaging in untreated and treated cells and found to exist in open and closed conformations, with the closed conformation is enriched by OA treatment. These findings provide a set of native snapshots of the manifold nano-structural consequences of mitochondrial depolarization and provide a baseline for future in situ dissection of Parkin-dependent mitophagy.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

The LacI/GalR family (LGF) of transcription factors provides a system for examining how these trade-offs evolve over billions of years but has seldom been studied from a full thermodynamic perspective. While the evolution of ligand specificity has been well-studied, the thermodynamic determinants underlying the changes in specificity is not well understood - especially how proteins alter thermodynamic strategies to optimize affinity. By reconstructing LGF ancestors, we reveal a shift from entropy-driven binding in the most distant ancestor, to enthalpy-driven binding in the most recent ancestor and extant LacI. The most distant ancestor is characterized by the ability to bind its ligand in an open and dynamic conformation, and we propose that entropically-driven binding is driven by the presence of entropic reservoirs. This thermodynamic binding trade-off between the most distant and most recent ancestor is in accordance with the concept of ancient life that existed in a hot Earth environment, where higher temperatures enhanced entropically-driven binding. This suggests that molecular binding mechanisms evolved not just for ligand specificity, but to adapt to environmental pressures such as cooling Earth temperatures where enthalpic binding modes are favored.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

Because dopamine influences blood vessel dilation, we hypothesized that hemodynamic latency, which reflects BOLD signal timing, could serve as an indirect marker of dopamine physiology. Across four datasets, we found a topography of hemodynamic latencies that precisely distinguished the nucleus accumbens, a dopaminergic region implicated in motivation and substance abuse, from other striatal regions. Using PET, genetics, and pharmacology, we found that hemodynamic latencies are robustly related to dopamine function and dopamine-linked behavior. In individuals with cocaine use disorder, we observed a spatial gradient of altered hemodynamic latencies in the striatum. This pattern independently predicted nicotine use, revealing a conserved physiological profile associated with addictive substance use. Hemodynamic latencies map regional, individual, and pathological differences linked to dopamine, opening new avenues for indirectly assessing the role of dopamine in healthy cognition and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

At anaphase onset, sister separation is triggered by cleavage of the cohesin subunit SCC1/RAD21 by the cysteine protease separase. SCC1 contains two cleavage sites, where cleavage is stimulated by SCC1 phosphorylation. The molecular mechanisms of substrate recognition and cleavage are only partly understood. Here, we determined a series of cryoEM structures of human separase in apo- or substrate-bound forms that, together with biochemical analysis, provide novel insights into the regulation of separase cleavage activity. We verify the first SCC1 cleavage site and reassign the second site. We show that multiple substrates, including separase autocleavage sites and the two SCC1 cleavage sites, interact with several docking sites in separase, including four phosphate-binding sites. We also describe the structural basis of the interaction between the cohesin subunit SA1/A2 and separase, which promotes cleavage at the second site in SCC1. Finally, using cross-linking mass spectrometry and cryoEM, we propose a model of how cohesin is targeted by human separase.

Ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has achieved mesoscopic (< 0.5 mm) imaging of angioarchitecture, revealing fine vascular details that were previously inaccessible in vivo. However, current mesoscopic MRI methods for imaging angioarchitecture face two major limitations. First, acquisition times are prohibitively long--often exceeding 40 minutes--making integration into everyday clinical practice and research projects impractical. Second, even with data successfully acquired, conventional data visualization methods--such as 2D slice browsing and 3D vessel segmentation renders--are rudimentary and have limited effectiveness for navigating and interpreting the complex vascular network. In this paper, we present a fast whole-brain MRI protocol that provides robust images of the brains venous network at 0.35 mm resolution in under seven minutes. Additionally, we introduce novel data processing and visualization techniques that enable identification of specific vessel types and more informative navigation of the complex vascular network. We demonstrate that, with these advancements, we can reproduce, in vivo and without intravenous contrast application, the seminal postmortem vasculature images of Duvernoy and Vannson (1999). Furthermore, leveraging the ability for MRI to cover the entire brain, we achieve, for the first time, whole-brain intracortical mesoscopic vein maps in humans. Our acquisition and post-processing methods lay the groundwork for detailed examination of vascular organization across individuals, brain regions, and cortical layers. More generally, these methods make mesoscopic imaging of angioarchitecture viable for broad neuroscientific and clinical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

Historically, research has prioritized protists associated with animals and plants, particularly those of medical significance, thereby overlooking the majority of protist diversity. Conventional molecular methods, such as 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, frequently encounter limitations, including primer binding bias and PCR bias caused by gene length variations, creating a biased perspective of understudied protistan diversity. Further, most protist lineages are notoriously difficult to cultivate. Here, we apply a cultivation-independent approach in which we analyzed over 27,000 assembled metagenomes and protist single cell genomes and 21 long 18S rRNA gene amplicon data sets from various global ecosystems, including marine, freshwater, and soil environments. We recovered 157,958 18S rRNA gene sequences ([&ge;]800 bp), which clustered into 103,338 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% sequence identity and 24,438 OTUs at 85% identity. Notably, 69% of 13,238 non-singleton clusters at 85% identity consisted exclusively of environmental sequences, uncovering a wealth of yet uncultivated and unclassified novel protist diversity. A comprehensive taxonomic framework of eukaryotes based on concatenated 18S and 28S rRNA genes that incorporated most novel lineages revealed substantial underrepresentation of Amoebozoa, Discoba, and Rhizaria in reference databases, with many lacking isolate or genome sequence representation. Further, we identified 13 eukaryotic lineages with novelty on higher taxonomic ranks, such as class and phylum-level, that lack representation in public databases. The corresponding 85% OTUs were primarily affiliated with Excavata, with some branching closely to the root of the eukaryotic tree. Comprehensive analysis of the global distribution of eukaryotes revealed uneven microbial eukaryotic diversity across supergroups and ecosystems, with notable novelty particularly in soil and marine environments. We then examined co-occurrence between protists and prokaryotes, predicting putative symbiotic or predator-prey relationships, particularly among understudied protist groups with bacteria such as Verrucomicrobia and Rickettsiales. Our results substantially enhance the understanding of protistan diversity and distribution, revealing taxonomic blind spots and laying groundwork for future studies of these organisms' ecological roles.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

Population variation in the growth rate and potential of mutant clones suggests the presence of genetic factors protecting against CH, but these remain largely undefined. Here, we identify a non-coding regulatory variant, rs17834140-T, that significantly protects against CH and myeloid malignancies by downregulating HSC-selective expression and function of the RNA-binding protein MSI2. By modeling variant effects and mapping MSI2 binding targets, we uncover an RNA network that maintains human HSCs and influences CH risk. Importantly, rs17834140-T is associated with slower CH expansion rates in humans, and stem cell MSI2 levels modify ASXL1-mutant HSC clonal dominance in experimental models.

Although this transition in vocal behavior is known to occur, its developmental timing remains poorly described. In the current study, we performed longitudinal measurements of mouse USVs to establish the age at which juvenile mice begin producing social USVs. Every 4 days (postnatal day (P)12-P28), USVs were first recorded from individual mice in solo sessions to establish rates of isolation/spontaneous USVs and then were recorded again during interactions between same-sex and opposite-sex pairs of age-matched, socially novel (non-littermate) C57BL/6J mice. We report that juvenile mice begin producing social USVs earlier than previously reported, at ages P20-P24. Moreover, although these early social USVs are produced at low rates compared to adult social USVs, they are nonetheless temporally coordinated with active social interaction. Our characterization of the timing of the transition from isolation USVs to social USVs forms a foundation to investigate brain mechanisms that enable the context-dependent regulation of vocal communication over development.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

To address this, we compared three mechanistically distinct nuclei isolation strategies with brain tissues: a sucrose gradient centrifugation-based method, a spin column-based method, and a machine-assisted platform.

A major translational challenge in analgesic development is the difference in gene expression and functional properties between human and rodent dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. Extensive work in rodents suggests that sensitization of nociceptors in the DRG is essential for the pathogenesis and persistence of pain; however, direct evidence demonstrating similar physiological sensitization in humans is limited. Here, we examine whether pain history is associated with nociceptor hyperexcitability in human DRG (hDRG). We identified three electrophysiologically distinct clusters (E-types) of hDRG neurons based on firing properties and membrane excitability. Combining electrophysiological recordings and single-cell RNA-sequencing (''Patch-seq''), we linked these E-types to specific transcriptionally defined nociceptor subpopulations. Comparing hDRG neurons from donors with and without evident pain history revealed cluster-specific, pain history-associated differences in hDRG excitability. Finally, we found that hDRG from donors with pain history express higher levels of transcripts encoding voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7 (NaV1.7) and 1.8 (NaV1.8) which specifically regulate nociceptor excitability. These findings suggest that donors with pain history exhibit distinct hDRG electrophysiological profiles compared to those without pain history and further validate NaV1.7 and 1.8 as targets for analgesic development.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

One of the most fascinating adaptations to this lifestyle is the specific silencing of individual rDNA genes in the human host that are de-repressed following host-to-vector transmission. In this study, we defined the epigenetic signatures of rRNA transcription and found that rDNA silencing relies on aerobic glycolysis, the sole energy-generating pathway in the human host. We show that disruption of NAD+ regeneration during lactate fermentation promotes rDNA de-repression and identify the sirtuin histone deacetylase Sir2a as the mediator between fluctuating NAD+ levels and a functional transcriptional outcome. Hence, rDNA activation appears to be coupled to the metabolic state of the parasite as it transitions from aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration during host-to-vector transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

In this study we analyzed genomes derived from cultures and environmental metagenome-assembled genomes focusing on characters indicative of genome evolution. Our results show an enrichment of short length transposable elements (TEs) and pseudogenes in the periplasmic endosymbiont genomes, suggesting an active and transitionary period in genome evolution. In contrast, genomes of endobionts exhibited fewer TEs and pseudogenes, reflecting advanced stages of genome reduction and increased host dependency in the endobionts. Pangenome analyses identified that endobionts streamline their genomes and conserve a majority of their genes in the core, whereas periplasmic endobionts and epibionts maintain larger flexible genomes, suggesting increased genomic plasticity. Functional gene comparisons with other N2-fixing cyanobacteria revealed that Richelia endobionts have similar patterns of metabolic loss but are distinguished by absence of specific pathways (e.g. cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase, lipid-A) that increase dependency and direct interaction with their respective hosts. In conclusion, our findings underscore the dynamic nature of genome reduction in N2-fixing cyanobacterial symbionts and demonstrate the diatom-Richelia symbioses as a valuable and rare model to study genome evolution in the transitional stages from a free-living facultative symbiont to a host-dependent endobiont.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

First the conservation of the GABA site explains the absence of insect-selective orthosteric compounds. Second, the classical modulation site, occupied here by abamectin, exists in a closed-pore conformation contrasting with ivermectin-bound states in other receptors. Third, using the fungal-derived Chrodrimamin B, we resolve an unanticipated membrane modulation pocket structurally analogous yet pharmacologically opposite to a neurosteroid site in mammalian receptors.

TEI can be initiated and maintained by small RNAs and histone modifications. The latter includes histone methylation, deposited by proteins with methyltransferase activity, including SET domain-containing proteins. Other SET domain-containing proteins with no catalytic methyltransferase activity also adopt roles in chromatin and gene expression regulation. Here, we describe SET-24, a SET domain-containing protein in Caenorhabditis elegans that belongs to a family of catalytically inactive SET proteins. SET-24 localises to germline nuclei and is required for germline immortality. Additionally, the inheritance of small RNA-driven epigenetic silencing is compromised in set-24 mutants. Using quantitative proteomics and yeast two-hybrid assays, we found that SET-24 interacts with Host Cell Factor 1 (HCF-1), a protein involved in epigenetic regulation and associated with known chromatin remodelling complexes, like COMPASS, which deposits H3K4me3. In set-24 mutants, hundreds of genes display increased H3K4me3 levels at their transcription start sites. While these changes are not matched at the transcriptional level, small RNA production is disrupted in approximately one fifth of those genes, which are normally targeted by small RNA pathways. We propose that SET-24 is a factor required to maintain epigenetic memory in the germline by maintaining a chromatin environment permissible to small RNA biogenesis over generations.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

In an effort to avert future pandemics, surveillance studies aimed at identifying zoonotic viruses at high risk of spilling over into humans act to monitor the  viral chatter at the animal-human interface. These studies are hampered, however, by the diversity of zoonotic viruses and the limited tools available to assess pandemic risk. Methods currently in use include the characterization of candidate viruses using in vitro laboratory assays and experimental transmission studies in animal models. However, transmission experiments yield relatively low-resolution outputs that are not immediately translatable to projections of viral dynamics at the level of a host population. To address this gap, we present an analytical framework to extend the use of measurements from experimental transmission studies to generate more quantitative risk assessments. Specifically, we develop modeling approaches for estimating transmission parameters and gauging population-level emergence risk using within-host viral titer data from index and contact animals. To illustrate the use of these approaches, we apply them to two recently published influenza A virus (IAV) ferret transmission experiments: one using influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1pdm09) and one using influenza A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2). We find that, when controlling for viral titers, the H3N2 virus tends to be less transmissible than the H1N1 virus. Because of this difference in infectiousness and more robust replication of H1N1 in ferrets, we further find that the H1N1 virus has a higher projected reproduction number than the H3N2 virus and therefore more likely to cause an epidemic following introduction. Incorporating estimates of the generation interval for each virus, we find that the H1N1 virus has a higher projected epidemic growth rate than the H3N2 virus. The methods we present to assess relative pandemic risk across viral isolates can be used to improve quantitative risk assessment of other emerging viruses of pandemic concern.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

These N-MTSs interact with the translocation machinery and are cleaved in the matrix by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP), a heterodimeric zinc metalloprotease which is essential for the maturation of imported proteins. Import and cleavage of PINK1, a kinase implicated in Parkinson's disease, govern its ability to sense mitochondrial damage, but the MPP cleavage site and its role in PINK1's function remains cryptic. MPP typically cleaves a unique motif in N-MTSs with an arginine in the P2 position, but how MPP recognizes this motif is unclear. Here, we show that recombinant human MPP cleaves PINK1 between Ala28 and Tyr29 yet is turned over slowly compared to other canonical N-MTSs. While MPP cleavage is not required for downstream PARL processing or PINK1 accumulation in cells, the PINK1 N-MTS binds potently to MPP and inhibits the cleavage of other N-MTSs by glueing the regulatory () and catalytic ({beta}) subunits. Finally, we utilize hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to reveal the binding site of the PINK1 N-MTS on MPP. Taken together, our work provides key insight into both the PINK1 import pathway and the mechanisms of MPP processing.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

Individual plants mature at different rates due to genetics, environmental factors, and random chance. All of this contributes to trait heterogeneity. EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3), a core circadian clock component, determines developmental timing, and here we tested the hypothesis that it would shape trait heterogeneity. We developed a model predicting that faster-growing populations exhibit greater heterogeneity during development but reduced heterogeneity at maturity, while slower-growing populations show the opposite pattern. Experiments in Arabidopsis elf3 and barley Hvelf3 mutants supported this prediction. In Arabidopsis, ELF3 controlled hypocotyl elongation variability via maturation rate rather than direct regulation. Bolting time heterogeneity also decreased in faster-growing plants. In barley, Hvelf3 altered growth heterogeneity, but this was initially masked by germination timing differences. Finally, smaller barley plants were found to be more resilient to osmotic stress, suggesting that ELF3-driven trait heterogeneity may contribute to bet hedging. These findings highlight how modifying developmental rates influences population-level trait distributions and stress resilience.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

However, it remains uncertain how strongly genome size is linked to microbial prevalence, relative abundance and co-occurrence in the environment. To address this gap, we present a systematic and global-scale evaluation of the relationship between genome size, relative abundance and prevalence in freshwater ecosystems, including 80,561 medium-to-high quality genomes. We identified 9,028 species (defined by ANI >95%) across a manually curated dataset of 636 freshwater metagenomes and calculated their relative abundance. Our results show that prokaryotes with reduced genomes exhibited higher prevalence and relative abundance, and a greater prevalence than expected based on their mean abundance, suggesting that genome streamlining may promote cosmopolitanism. Furthermore, our network analysis revealed that prokaryotes with reduced genomes are found in co-occurrent groups comprising up to 295 species. The species in these groups potentially possess a diminished capacity for synthesizing essential metabolites such as vitamins, amino acids and nucleotides, which may foster complex metabolic interdependencies within the community. Moreover, the fitness advantage of losing biosynthetic functions appears to be frequency dependent: while nucleotide biosynthesis is the most retained biosynthetic function, amino acid and then vitamin biosynthesis are more frequently lost. Our study finds that genome size is linked to microbial community structure and ecological adaptation to freshwaters. Our results underscore genome streamlining as a central ecological and evolutionary strategy that both shapes and is shaped by community dynamics, ultimately fostering interdependences among prokaryotes.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

The discovery of an enzyme that regulates CRBN substrates through the C-terminal cyclic imide modification reveals a previously unknown biological pathway that is perturbed by thalidomide derivatives and provides a biochemical basis for the connection between multiple biological processes and CRBN.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

We document an exception to this pattern in the wider Rhine-Meuse area in communities in the wetlands, riverine areas, and coastal areas of the western and central Netherlands, Belgium and western Germany, where we assembled genome-wide data for 109 people 8500-1700 BCE. Here, a distinctive population with high hunter-gatherer ancestry ([~]50%) persisted up to three thousand years later than in continental European regions, reflecting limited incorporation of females of Early European Farmer ancestry into local communities. In the western Netherlands, the arrival of the Corded Ware complex was also exceptional: lowland individuals from settlements adopting Corded Ware pottery had hardly any steppe ancestry, despite a characteristic early Corded Ware Y-chromosome. The limited influx may reflect the unique ecology of the regions river-dominated landscapes, which were not amenable to wholesale adoption of the early Neolithic type of farming introduced by Linearbandkeramik, making it possible for previously established groups to thrive, and creating a persistent but permeable boundary that allowed transfer of ideas and low-level gene flow. This changed with the formation-through-mixture of Bell Beaker using populations [~]2500 BCE by fusion of local Rhine-Meuse people (9-17%) and Corded Ware associated migrants of both sexes. Their expansion from the Rhine-Meuse region then had a disruptive impact across a much wider part of northwest Europe, including Britain where its arrival was the main source of a 90-100% replacement of local Neolithic peoples.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

Using comprehensive longitudinal profiling of 553 SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic antigens across globally prevalent HLAs, we identified antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses that were either critical for early viral clearance or associated with severe disease outcomes. During acute infection, patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited a broader and more robust CD8+ T-cell response than those with mild disease. Notably, we identified HLA-A1-restricted immunodominant antigen-specific T-cells strongly associated with severe disease. These T-cells were present at extremely high frequencies but showed significantly reduced expression of cytotoxic molecules at both the transcriptomic (PRF1, GZMB, GZMH, GNLY) and protein levels (IFN-{gamma}, TNF-, IL-2), as revealed by multidimensional single-cell and cytokine profiling. In contrast, patients with mild disease had T-cells that recognized a more restricted set of antigens, showed only partial overlap with those in severe cases, and showed enhanced cytotoxicity, along with enrichment in gene sets associated with cytotoxic function, hypoxia, and glycolysis. Furthermore, the long-term memory CD8+ T-cells were maintained for a limited subset of immunodominant antigens, with their persistence correlating with their initial frequency during infection. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination following infection expanded the long-term T-cell repertoire by enhancing pre-existing responses and generating de novo responses, regardless of prior disease severity. These findings resolve the antigen-specific kinetics and durability of CD8+ T-cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide key insights into their functional landscape. This knowledge could inform future vaccine strategies and therapeutic interventions to enhance protective immunity against emerging viral threats.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

Scaling up infected cell fate to ecosystem-scale impacts requires quantitative estimates of viral life history traits, including underlying heterogeneity in the timing, efficiency, and outcome of lytic infections. Here, we apply a nonlinear model of phage-bacteria infection dynamics to infer single-cell heterogeneity of phage-induced lysis from population-scale time series. We evaluate this inference approach in an ecologically relevant system: Syn9, a T4-like cyanophage infecting Synechococcus strain WH8109, a representative of globally abundant marine cyanobacteria. The model infers heterogeneous distributions of latent period and burst size that were subsequently validated using a single-cell assay. We find observed latent period variation exceeds that found in coliphage with holin lysis systems and that burst size variability is largely explained due to latent period variation. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of inferring phage trait heterogeneity from population data in ecologically relevant systems even in the absence of single-cell experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

While several studies have demonstrated changes in brain function and connectivity associated with psychedelics, we still have a limited understanding of how LSD reshapes brain networks operating across different frequency bands. In this study, we applied the recently developed FREQ-NESS method to MEG data from 14 healthy participants who received LSD under four conditions: eyes-closed with or without music and eyes-open with or without a video stimulus. LSD significantly restructures canonical networks in the alpha and beta bands. Relative to broadband brain activity, it enhances the prominence of high alpha (12.1, 13.3 Hz) across all experimental conditions and high beta (25.3 Hz) in three conditions. Conversely, LSD decreases the prominence of low beta (18.1, 19.3 Hz) in both Open and Closed conditions and low alpha (8.5 Hz) in the latter. In addition, LSD substantially alters the spatial distributions or topographies of the networks. Under LSD, the low alpha (8.5 Hz) network shifts anteriorly toward the motor cortex, while high alpha (12.1, 13.3 Hz) becomes more localized to the visual cortex. Low beta (18.1, 19.3 Hz) expands over the temporal and occipital cortices, whereas high beta (25.3, 26.5 Hz) topographies remain unchanged. Our findings provide critical insights into the specific frequencies and spatial networks in which LSD modulates brain connectivity, adding nuance to prevailing theories about network disintegration under psychedelics.

Significance statementPsychedelic substances such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) profoundly alter perception and cognition, yet their effect on brain activity across different frequency bands remains unclear. Using FREQ-NESS applied to MEG data, we show that LSD reorganizes brain networks by enhancing high-frequency alpha and beta rhythms while suppressing lower-frequency counterparts. These changes occur across various experimental conditions and shift the spatial distribution of brain activity, particularly in motor and visual regions. Our findings suggest that LSD modulates brain connectivity in a frequency- and region-specific manner, offering new insights into how psychedelics alter consciousness. This work advances our understanding of LSDs neural effects, which may be relevant for therapeutic applications and models of brain function.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

Lignature compiles signatures from published transcriptomic datasets and established resources such as CytoSig and ImmuneDictionary, generating both gene- and pathway-based signatures for each ligand. We applied Lignature to predict active ligands driving transcriptomic changes in controlled in vitro experiments and real-world single-cell sequencing datasets. Lignature outperformed existing methods such as NicheNet, achieving higher accuracy in identifying active ligands at both the gene and pathway levels. These results establish Lignature as a robust platform for ligand signaling inference, providing a powerful tool to explore ligand-receptor interactions across diverse experimental and physiological contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

Discovery of protein localization and protein complex composition are powerful approaches to determine protein function, but have not been widely applied in mycobacteria, in part due to technical barriers. Here we develop a multi-functional system that utilizes the ALFA tag and functional protein fusions to an anti-ALFA nanobody (NBALFA) to target proteins in fast and slow growing mycobacteria. Insertion of the ALFA epitope tag on the target protein, coupled with conditional expression of the NBALFA fused to a fluorescent protein faithfully recapitulates cytosolic and membrane protein localization by fluorescent microscopy in living cells. Targeted NBALFA can relocalize an ALFA tagged protein to inclusion bodies or the cytoplasmic membrane, demonstrating enforced protein localization. Finally, conditional expression of the NBALFA fused to TurboID for proximity proteomics allowed identification of known partner proteins of the RNA polymerase complex and the PKS13 mycolic acid biosynthesis protein.

This social context-dependent modulation overrides responses to other external sensory cues and is shaped by developmental social experience. Leveraging the genetic toolbox available in Drosophila, we find that different sensory modalities are required for normal social context modulation.

During early development, epigenetic reprogramming selectively loosens TE repression, and TE transcription actively contributes to embryogenesis. This raises the question: how can embryos and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) tolerate TE expression without incurring widespread inflammation or DNA damage? Here, we reveal multiple mechanisms that prevent innate immune activation by TE-derived cytosolic DNA, including reduced cGAS/STING expression and signalling, dampening of Type I interferon responses by pluripotency factors, and post-transcriptional restriction of retrotransposition. These layers of protection are essential, as experimental perturbation triggers loss of ESC self-renewal and pluripotency.

Traditional analysis approaches make parametric assumptions about the functional form of these curves, limiting their usefulness for studying conditions that distort standard growth curves. In addition, modern robotics platforms enable the high-throughput collection of large volumes of growth data, thus requiring strategies that can analyze large-scale growth data in a flexible and efficient manner. Here, we introduce DGrowthR, a statistical R and standalone app framework for the integrative analysis of large growth experiments. DGrowthR comprises methods for data pre-processing and standardization, exploratory functional data analysis, and non-parametric modeling of growth curves using Gaussian Process regression. Importantly, DGrowthR includes a rigorous statistical testing framework for differential growth analysis. To illustrate the range of application scenarios of DGrowthR, we analyzed three large-scale bacterial growth datasets that tackle distinct scientific questions. On an in-house large-scale growth dataset comprising two pathogens that were subjected to a large chemical perturbation screen, DGrowthR enabled the discovery of compounds with significant growth inhibitory effects as well as compounds that induce non-canonical growth dynamics. We also re-analyzed two publicly available datasets and recovered reported adjuvants and antagonists of antibiotic activity, as well as bacterial genetic factors that determine susceptibility to specific antibiotic treatments. We anticipate that DGrowthR will streamline the analysis of modern high-volume growth experiments, enabling researchers to gain novel biological insights in a standardized and reproducible manner.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

In this context, Python programming language is extensively used for manipulation and analysis of data stored in a tabular-form of rows and columns called dataframe. Pandas is the most-widely used Python dataframe package and is criticized for its inefficiencies and scalability problems that its novel alternative - Polars - tries to address with a vectorized backend written in Rust programming language.

Resultspolars-bio is a Python library that enables fast, parallel and out-of-core operations on large genomic intervals datasets. Its main components are implemented in Rust, using the Apache DataFusion query engine and Apache Arrow for efficient data representation. It is compatible with Polars and Pandas DataFrame formats. Single-thread benchmarking results confirm that for operations such as count overlaps is 38x and coverage is 15x faster than the state-of-the-art bioframe library. Our implementation of overlap operation consumes 90x less memory in streaming mode. Multi-thread benchmarks show good scalability and up to 282x speedup for count overlaps operation when executed with 8 CPU cores. To the best of our knowledge, polars-bio is the fastest single-node library for genomic interval dataframes in Python.

However, simulations incorporating realistic selection along heterogeneous genomes in complex demographic histories are challenging, limiting our ability to benchmark statistical methods aimed at detecting selection and to explore theoretical predictions. stdpopsim is a community-maintained simulation library that already provides an extensive catalog of species-specific population genetic models. Here we present a major extension to the stdpopsim framework that enables simulation of various modes of selection, including background selection, selective sweeps, and arbitrary distributions of fitness effects (DFE) acting on annotated subsets of the genome (for instance, exons). This extension maintains stdpopsims core principles of reproducibility and accessibility while adding support for species-specific genomic annotations and published DFE estimates. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by benchmarking methods for demographic inference, DFE estimation, and selective sweep detection across several species and scenarios. Our results demonstrate the robustness of demographic inference methods to selection on linked sites, reveal the sensitivity of DFE-inference methods to model assumptions, and show how genomic features, like recombination rate and functional sequence density, influence power to detect selective sweeps. This extension to stdpopsim provides a powerful new resource for the population genetics community to explore the interplay between selection and other evolutionary forces in a reproducible, low-barrier framework.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

These rare states influence protein function, interactions, aggregation, and immunogenicity, yet they remain far less understood than protein native states. Although native protein structures are now often predictable with impressive accuracy, conformational fluctuations and their energies remain largely invisible and unpredictable, and experimental challenges have prevented large-scale measurements that could improve machine learning and physics-based modeling. Here, we introduce a multiplexed experimental approach to analyze the energies of conformational fluctuations for hundreds of protein domains in parallel using intact protein hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. We analyzed 5,778 domains 28-64 amino acids in length, revealing hidden variation in conformational fluctuations even between sequences sharing the same fold and global folding stability. Site-resolved hydrogen exchange NMR analysis of 13 domains showed that these fluctuations often involve entire secondary structural elements with lower stability than the overall fold. Computational modeling of our domains identified structural features that correlated with the experimentally observed fluctuations, enabling us to design mutations that stabilized low-stability structural segments. Our dataset enables new machine learning-based analysis of protein energy landscapes, and our experimental approach promises to reveal these landscapes at unprecedented scale.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1743113319519

In metagenomic studies, fragments can be mapped against multiple references or de novo assembled contigs to identify those likely to be ancient. Generating and comparing damage profiles to identify samples or contigs that are likely to stem from modern contaminants, however, can be both tedious and time-consuming. Although tools exist for estimating damage in single reference genomes and metagenomic datasets, none efficiently cluster damage patterns.

ResultsTo address this methodological gap, we developed AdDeam, a tool that combines rapid damage estimation with clustering for streamlined analyses and easy identification of potential contaminants or outliers. Our tool takes aligned aDNA fragments from various samples or contigs as input, computes damage patterns, clusters them and outputs representative damage profiles per cluster, a probability of each sample of pertaining to a cluster as well as a PCA of the damage patterns for each sample for fast visualisation. We evaluated AdDeam on both simulated and empirical datasets. AdDeam effectively distinguishes different damage levels, such as UDG-treated samples, sample-specific damages from specimens of different time periods, and can also distinguish between contigs containing modern or ancient fragments, providing a clear framework for aDNA authentication and facilitating large-scale analyses.

Clade diversity trajectories follow rise and decline dynamics, with fast accumulation following recurrent speciation while slowdowns and losses are modulated primarily by changes in extinction. Diversity dynamics do not appear to be governed by clade-level processes expected from adaptive radiations or diversity equilibria. Rather, these patterns emerge from dynamics at the species-level, where lineages tend to become increasingly vulnerable to extinction and less likely to speciate with time. Those species that counteract this trend create and maintain biodiversity through deep time.

Most research focusses on Dictyostelium discoideum, which - due to its ease of culturing and genetic tractability - has been adopted as a model species in the fields of developmental biology, cell biology and microbiology. Over decades, genome editing methods in D. discoideum have steadily improved but remain relatively time-consuming and limited in scope, effective in a few species only. Here, we introduce a CRISPR-Cas9 editing protocol that is cloning-free, selection-free, highly-efficient, and effective across Dictyostelid species. After optimizing our protocol in D. discoideum, we obtained knock-out efficiencies of [~]80% and knock-in efficiencies of [~]30% without antibiotic selection. Efficiencies depend on template concentrations, insertion sizes, homology arms and target sites. Since our protocol is selection-free, we can isolate mutants as soon as one day post-transfection, vastly expediting the generation of knock-outs, fusion proteins and expression reporters. Our protocol also makes it possible to generate several knock-in mutations simultaneously in the same cells. Boosted by cell-sorting and fluorescent microscopy, we could readily apply our CRISPR-Cas9 editing protocol to phylogenetically distant Dictyostelid species, which diverged hundreds of millions of years ago and have never been genome edited before. Our protocol therefore opens the door to performing broad-scale genetic interrogations across Dicyostelids.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

However, little is known about their biology, even in the model diplonemid Paradiplonema papillatum whose genome sequence is available. Examining the subcellular localization of proteins using fluorescence microscopy is a powerful approach to infer their putative function. Here we report a plasmid-based method that enables YFP-tagging of a gene at the endogenous locus. By examining the localization of proteins whose homologs are involved in chromosome segregation in other eukaryotes, we discovered several interesting features in mitotically dividing P. papillatum cells. Cohesin is enriched on condensed interphase chromatin. During mitosis, chromosomes organize into two rings (termed metaphase rings herein) that surround the elongating nucleolus. Homologs of chromosomal passenger complex components (INCENP, two Aurora kinases, and KIN-A), a CLK1 kinase, spindle checkpoint protein Mad1, and microtubule regulator XMAP215 localize in between the two metaphase rings, suggesting that kinetochores may assemble in between them. We also found that a homolog of the meiotic chromosome axis protein SYCP2L1 is enriched in between metaphase rings during mitosis. These features have some resemblance to the bivalent bridge (also known as the modified synaptonemal complex), which is thought to mediate the linkage between homologous chromosomes using axis components in Bombyx mori female meiotic metaphase I. By representing the first molecular characterization of mitotic mechanisms in P. papillatum and raising a number of questions, this study forms the foundation for dissecting mitotic mechanisms in diplonemids.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

Preliminary evidence has shown the gut microbiome influences the aging process of bone and muscle in animal studies. However, such evidence in humans is still scarce. This study aimed to assess the microbiome-bone and microbiome-muscle associations in two cohorts of community-dwelling older adults.

MethodsWe leveraged information from two large population-based cohorts, i.e., the Rotterdam Study (mean age 62.7 {+/-} 5.6 years; n=1,249) and the Framingham Heart Study (mean age 55.2 {+/-} 9.1 years; n=1,227). For individuals included in this study, gut microbiome 16S rRNA sequencing, musculoskeletal phenotyping derived from DXA images, lifestyle and socioeconomic data, and medication records were available. Per cohort, the 16S rRNA sequencing data, derived from stool, were processed with the DADA2 pipeline and taxonomies were assigned using the SILVA reference database. In addition, the microbiome functional potential was obtained with PICRUSt2. Further, we investigated the association between the human gut microbiome (alpha diversity, genera and predicted functional pathways) and appendicular lean mass (ALM), femoral neck bone mineral density (FN-BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) using multilinear regression models controlling for multiple confounders, and performed a joint analysis from both cohorts. Sex-stratified analyses were also conducted.

ResultsThe gut microbiome alpha diversity was not associated with either tested phenotype after accounting for multiple-testing (P>1.67e-02). In the joint analysis, lower abundance of Oscillibacter (beta= -0.51, 95%CI [-0.74, -0.29]), Anaerotruncus (beta=-0.41, 95%CI [-0.61, - 0.21]), Eisenbergiella (beta=-0.39, 95%CI [-0.59, -0.19]) and higher abundance of Agathobacter (beta=0.40, 95%CI [0.20, 0.60]) were associated with higher ALM (P<2.0e-04). Lower abundance of Anaerotruncus (beta=-0.32, 95%CI [-0.45, -0.19]), Hungatella (beta=-0.26, 95%CI [-0.38, -0.15]) and Clostridiales bacterium DTU089 (beta=-0.37, 95%CI [-0.55, -0.19]) was associated with higher ALM only in females (P< 2.0e-04). Moreover, the biotin biosynthesis II pathway was positively associated with ALM (beta=0.44, 95% CI [0.24, 0.64]) (P<1.90e-04) in females while no associations were observed in males. We did not observe any robust association of bone traits with gut microbiome features.

ConclusionOur results indicate that specific genera are associated with ALM in middle-aged and older adults and these associations can present in a sex-specific manner. Overall, our study suggests that the gut microbiome is linked to muscle aging in middle-aged and older adults. However, larger sample sizes are still needed to underpin the specific microbiome features involved.","NA","medrxiv",1743113319519

Studies indicate that lysosome disruption can play a role in NLRP3 inflammasome activation, but whether lysosome positioning impacts NLRP3 inflammasome activation is currently unknown. Using HeLa and macrophage cell models, the effect of repositioning lysosomes to either the cell periphery or the perinuclear region on inflammasome activation was studied. Lysosome positioning to the cell periphery increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to nigericin. This effect correlated with a change in the subcellular localisation of the inflammasome complex and an increase in its size. As macrophages at sites of tissue inflammation are exposed to environments known to influence lysosome position, these data help us understand how subcellular organelle reorganisation can regulate inflammation in response to inflammatory stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

This design allows efficient scaling of experiments, isolation of cell-intrinsic differences, and mitigation of batch effects. We present CellBouncer, a computational toolkit for demultiplexing and analyzing single-cell sequencing data from pooled experiments. We demonstrate that CellBouncer can separate and quantify multi-species and multi-individual cell mixtures, identify unknown mitochondrial haplotypes in cells, assign treatments from lipid-conjugated barcodes or CRISPR sgRNAs, and infer pool composition, outperforming existing methods. We also introduce methods to quantify ambient RNA contamination per cell, infer individual donors contributions to the ambient RNA pool, and determine a consensus doublet rate harmonized across data types. Applying these tools to tetraploid composite cells, we identify a competitive advantage of human over chimpanzee mitochondria across 10 cell fusion lines and provide evidence for inter-mitochondrial incompatibility and mito-nuclear incompatibility between species.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive the onset and progression of synaptic pathology remain to be established. Here, we used synaptic density positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using the [11C]UCB-J radiotracer to reveal a prominent widespread pattern (pFWE < 0.05) of lower synaptic density in individuals with schizophrenia (n=29), compared to a large sample of healthy controls (n=93). We found that the spatial pattern of lower synaptic density in schizophrenia is spatially aligned (rcca = 0.67; p < 0.001) with higher normative distributions of GABAA/BZ, 5HT1B, 5HT2A, and 5HT6, and lower levels of CB1 and 5HT1A. Competing neighborhood deformation network models revealed that regional synaptic pathology strongly correlated with estimates predicted using a model constrained by both interregional structural connectivity and molecular similarity (.42 < r < .61; pFWE < 0.05). These data suggest that synaptic pathology in schizophrenia is jointly constrained by both global axonal connectivity and local molecular vulnerability. Simulation-based network diffusion models were used to identify regions that may represent the initial sources of pathology, nominating left prefrontal areas (pFWE < 0.05) as potential foci from which synaptic pathology initiates and propagates to molecularly similar areas. Overall, our findings provide in vivo evidence for widespread deficit in synaptic density in schizophrenia that is jointly constrained by axonal connectivity and molecular similarity between regions, and that synaptic deficits spread from initial source regions to axonally connected and molecularly similar territories.","NA","medrxiv",1743113319519

In the intestinal tract, bidirectional communication occurs between the nervous and immune systems to affect local immune responses by modulating the activity of resident and recruited immune cells, and indirectly on the supporting stromal cells. These neuroimmune signaling pathways that alter host defense have focused on specialized sensory innervation and the unique neurotransmitters released from them. Although the sympathetic nervous system has been established to induce a tissue-protective phenotype in subpopulations of neuron-associated macrophages in the small intestine, the role of these neurons during enteric bacterial infection was unknown. Using genetic labeling of activated neurons with ArcTRAP, we demonstrate that colonic infection induces activation of the rostral ventrolateral medulla, a major sympathetic center in the brainstem. The importance of peripheral sympathetic neurons was further demonstrated using chemical sympathectomy that significantly increased bacterial burden during Citrobacter rodentium (C. rodentium) infection. Increased bacterial burden was matched by a deficit in host protection due to reduced IFN{gamma} production by colonic CD4+ T-cells. Sympathectomy, however, did not diminish the capacity to differentiate into IFN{gamma}- or IL-17A- producing T-cells in vitro, suggesting that the lack of sympathetic innervation during infection may alter this process in vivo without causing sustained T-cell intrinsic defects. In assessing which receptors could mediate these effects, pharmacological antagonists selective for - adrenergic receptors (AR), but not {beta}-adrenergic receptors, increased bacterial burden and reduced colonic IFN{gamma} production. Using isolated cell types from the colon of uninfected and infected mice, we identified the AR subtypes expressed on immune and stromal cells, with significant upregulation of these receptors on T-cells during C. rodentium infection. Together these data demonstrate the unique role of the sympathetic nervous system and AR in mucosal immune responses against enteric bacterial pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

While extensive research has explored navigation strategies in rodents, how these strategies emerge and evolve in freely moving non-human primates remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted a longitudinal study to investigate the dynamics of spatial learning and navigation strategies in freely moving common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) performing a foraging task in a semi-naturalistic environment. Marmosets were trained to collect rewards from eight spatially distributed dispensers. Using behavioral analyses combined with machine learning methods, including unsupervised clustering and probabilistic modeling, we examined how their navigation strategies evolved over time. Our results reveal a progressive improvement in performance, accompanied by an increasing structuring of movement patterns. Initially, marmosets exhibited exploratory behaviors, with high transition variability between food dispensers. As training progressed, their navigation became more structured, with the emergence of recurrent transition patterns and a shift towards route-based navigation. However, despite this increasing regularity, their navigation retained a degree of flexibility, allowing them to dynamically adapt their routes rather than following a fixed sequence. These findings suggest that marmosets develop structured yet flexible navigation strategies through experience. Their behavior reflects a balance between efficiency and adaptability and supports the emergence of a flexible representation of space. Our study provides novel insights into spatial memory development in primates and highlights the value of semi-naturalistic paradigms for studying navigation strategies and spatial learning in freely moving animals.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

Enhanced TCR and IL-15 signaling correlates with a progression from a naive-like CD39neg {gamma}{delta} IEL to a more mature, tissue-adapted CD39hi IEL population. We found that TCR{gamma}{delta} activation drives CD122-mediated CD39 upregulation on {gamma}{delta}HYP IELs and increased mucosal IL-15 further amplifies CD39 expression in these cells. Further investigation revealed that CD39 induction requires sustained exposure to the {gamma}{delta}HYP-associated microbiota. Moreover, CD39hi {gamma}{delta} IELs exhibit a reduced capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokine, which may explain the lack of histopathology in {gamma}{delta}HYP mice. Overall, our study identifies a previously unappreciated mechanism by which an altered microbiota amplifies CD39 expression on {gamma}{delta}HYP IELs, leading to the expansion of {gamma}{delta} IELs with regulatory potential.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

Understanding the cellular processes that occur in the later stages of life is essential to address age-related diseases. Although aging is a global process that affects the entire body, the brain is one of the most sensitive organs and is affected by numerous degenerative diseases. In this study, we investigate cell types and genes that are particularly sensitive to the aging process. To this end, we performed a time-course single-cell RNAseq experiment series in the brain of the killifish, the vertebrate model with the shortest lifespan, which makes it an excellent model for aging studies. Our analysis reveals that non-glial progenitor cells are among those populations that change the most between young and old animals. Furthermore, we identify specialized stromal clusters that seem to support a primitive hematopoietic program in the brain, which is active only during the embryonic stages in other vertebrate species. Our results show that the expression of embryonic genes in the adult brain appears to be a general feature in killifish, and that several cell populations in the adult killifish brain show a higher level of similarity to the zebrafish embryonic populations than to adult ones. Our study suggests that adult killifish maintain a neotenic gene expression status in the brain that may help in sustaining their characteristic high proliferation and metabolic rates, as well as combat the detrimental effects of this high metabolism on cells, especially at advanced ages.","NA","biorxiv",1743113319519

CH is associated with risk for hematologic malignancies and cardiovascular disease, but most studies are predominately based on individuals of European ancestry. Using peripheral blood whole exome sequencing data from 125,748 individuals of diverse genetic ancestries, we cataloged 503,703 SM mutations based on low variant allele frequency distributions and 89,361 CH variants based on age-skewing. We examined CH prevalence across ancestry groups, including commonly recognized pathogenic variants in myeloid (M-CHIP) and lymphoid (L-CHIP) malignancies. CH and M-CHIP variants had the highest prevalence in the European non-Finnish ancestry group, and males trended toward more M-CHIP variants. Ancestry differences in CH included more mutations in NF1 in African/African American, TP53 in European, and CUX1 in Asian and Latino/Admixed American ancestry groups. Linking the identified CH variants to a cancer database, CH was detected in 14% (55,190/391,102) of patient tumors. Prevalence of CH variants in some solid tumors ranged from 25% - 40%. M-CHIP variants in solid tumors were associated with younger age (61 vs 63, p <0.001), while M-CHIP in hematologic malignancies were linked to older age (60 vs 50, p <0.001), suggesting differences in disease biology. This study provides a catalog of SM, CH, and CHIP variants across diverse ancestry groups, highlighting differences that are important to inform clinical care, drug discovery, and study design to maximize generalizability across individuals.
