Data points that exert influence on the fit and its parameters are routinely, but not as often as required, identified by established influence measures and their corresponding cut-off values. In this work, we are specifically concerned with the presence of influential data points that directly impact hypothesis testing of linear regressions, which none of the established measures describe. Interestingly, the highly overlooked influence measure dfstat and its derived leave-one-out p-value exists exactly for this purpose, unmentioned in the majority of statistical text books as well as absent from all available statistical software packages. Its application for identifying these data points seems pivotal, as scientific reasoning in publications is almost exclusively based on the p-value of the fit, commonly adhering to the alpha = 0.05 threshold to state significance or not. With this metric, we found for 29 of 100 digitizable papers published in Science, Nature and PNAS in 2016, a time when the ""reproducibility crisis"" was a growing concern, that stated significances (or their absence) are based on the presence of a single influential data point.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

We characterized the magnitude, phenotype and clonal composition of CD8 T cell responses against 16 epitope specificities by ELISpot, flow cytometry as well as single-cell RNA, TCR and surface protein sequencing. To test the functionality of identified clonotypes, 106 T cell receptors (TCR) from five epitope-specific repertoires were re-expressed and tested for peptide sensitivity. While recruited repertoires were overall enriched for high-avidity TCRs, differential clonal expansion was not linked to fine avidity differences. Instead, maintenance of polyclonality ensured robustness in counteracting mutational escape of epitopes. Our findings on the induction and maintenance of high-functionality polyclonal T cell repertoires shed light on T cell quality as a neglected criterion in the assessment of vaccine immunogenicity.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

For twenty years, the GENCODE consortium has developed reference annotations for the human and mouse genomes, becoming a foundation for biomedical and genomics communities worldwide. Nevertheless, collections of important yet poorly-understood gene classes like long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) remain incomplete and scattered across multiple, uncoordinated catalogs, slowing down progress in the field. To address these issues, GENCODE has undertaken the most comprehensive lncRNAs annotation effort to date. This is founded on the manual annotation of full-length targeted long-read sequencing, on matched embryonic and adult tissues, of orthologous regions in human and mouse. Altogether 17,931 novel human genes (140,268 novel transcripts) and 22,784 novel mouse genes (136,169 novel transcripts) have been added to the GENCODE catalog representing a 2-fold and 6-fold increase in transcripts, respectively - the greatest increase since the sequencing of the human genome. Novel gene annotations display evolutionary constraints, have well-formed promoter regions, and link to phenotype-associated genetic variants. They greatly enhance the functional interpretability of the human genome, as they help explain millions of previously-mapped ""orphan"" omics measurements corresponding to transcription start sites, chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding sites. Crucially, our targeted design assigned human-mouse orthologs at a rate beyond previous studies, tripling the number of human disease-associated lncRNAs with mouse orthologs. The expanded and enhanced GENCODE lncRNA annotations mark a critical step towards deciphering the human and mouse genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Here we review magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies assessing structural and functional brain associations with depressive and anxiety symptoms in insomnia disorder (ID; n=38), insomnia symptoms in depressive and anxiety disorders (n=14), and these symptoms in the general populations (n=2). The studies on insomnia disorder consistently showed overlapping (salience network: insula and anterior cingulate cortex) and differential MRI correlation patterns between depressive (thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex and its associated functional connectivity) and anxiety (functional connectivity associated with default mode network) symptoms. The insula was also consistently identified as indicating the severity of insomnia symptoms in depressive disorder. In contrast, findings for other regions related to insomnia symptoms in both depressive and anxiety disorders were generally inconsistent across studies, partly due to variations in methods and patient cohorts. In the general population, brain regions in the default mode network provided a functional link between insomnia and depressive symptoms. These findings underscore both the shared and distinct neural correlates among depression, anxiety, and insomnia, providing potential avenues for the clinical management of these conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1730585372834

While traditional approaches using genetic screens in model organisms have uncovered some fundamental processes underlying these traits, model organisms do not possess the variation required to understand the evolution of traits with complex genetic architectures. In contrast, the advent of genomics at tree-of-life scales enables us to study the genetic interactions underlying these processes by leveraging millions of years of evolutionary trial-and-error. Here, we use the rich species diversity of the genus Myotis - one of the longest-living clades of mammals - to study the evolution of longevity-associated traits and infectious disease using functional evolutionary genomics. We generated reference genome assemblies and cell lines for 8 closely-related ([~]11 MYA) species of Myotis rich in phenotypic and life history diversity. Using genome-wide screens of positive selection, analysis of structural variation and copy number variation, and functional experiments in primary cell lines, we identify new patterns of adaptation in longevity, cancer resistance, and viral interactions both within Myotis and across bats. We find that the rapid evolution of lifespan in Myotis has some of the most significant variations in cancer risk across mammals, and demonstrate a unique DNA damage response in the long-lived M. lucifugus using primary cell culture models. Furthermore, we find evidence of abundant adaptation in response to DNA viruses, but not RNA viruses, in Myotis and other bats. This is in contrast to these patterns of adaptation in humans, which might contribute to the importance of bats as a reservoir of zoonotic viruses. Together, our results demonstrate the utility of leveraging natural variation to understand the genomics of traits with implications for human health and suggest important pleiotropic relationships between infectious disease tolerance and cancer resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Here, we investigated humoral recall responses and vaccine-mediated protection in Syrian hamsters immunized with the third-generation Comirnaty(R) Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, followed by infection with either antigenically closely (EG.5.1) or distantly related (JN.1) Omicron subvariants. Vaccination with YF17D vector encoding a modified Gamma spike (YF-S0*) served as a control for pre-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Our results show that both Comirnaty(R) XBB.1.5 and YF-S0* induce robust, however, poorly cross-reactive, neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses. In either case, total antibody and nAb levels increased following infection. Intriguingly, the specificity of these boosted nAbs did not match the respective challenge virus but was skewed towards the primary antigen used for immunization, suggesting a marked impact of antigenic imprinting; confirmed by antigenic cartography. Furthermore, limited cross-reactivity and rapid decline of nAbs induced by Comirnaty(R) XBB.1.5 with EG.5.1 and, more concerning, JN.1. raises doubts about sustained vaccine efficacy against recent circulating Omicron subvariants. Future vaccine design may have to address two major issues: (i) to overcome original antigenic sin that limits the breadth of a protective response towards emerging variants, and (ii) to achieve sustained immunity that lasts for at least one season.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

The genomic revolution has enabled a rapid expansion of our knowledge of genomes in many living organisms, and most of that knowledge is classified and readily available in the databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The genomesizeR tool leverages the wealth of taxonomic and genomic information present in NCBI databases to infer the genome size of Archeae, Bacteria, or Eukaryote organisms identified at any taxonomic level. This R package uses statistical modelling on data from the most up-to-date NCBI databases and provides three statistical methods for genome size prediction of a given taxon, or group of taxa. A straightforward  weighted mean method identifies the closest taxa with available genome size information in the taxonomic tree, and averages their genome sizes using weights based on taxonomic distance. A frequentist random effect model uses nested genus and family information to output genome size estimates. Finally a third option provides predictions from a distributional Bayesian multilevel model which uses taxonomic information from genus all the way to superkingdom, therefore providing estimates and uncertainty bounds even for under-represented taxa.

All three methods use:

O_LIA list of queries; a query being a taxon or a list of several taxa. The package was designed to make it easy to use with data coming from environmental DNA experiments, but works with any table of taxa.
C_LIO_LIA reference database containing all the known genome sizes, built from the NCBI databases, with associated taxa, provided in an archive to download.
C_LIO_LIA taxonomic tree structure as built by the NCBI, provided in the same archive.

This coordinate system is abstract - with the same grid cells encoding position across different sensory environments; and hierarchical - with grid modules of increasing spatial scale occupying increasingly ventral locations in the EC. Recent theories suggest that a similar abstract coordinate system could offer the same benefits to general memories that are not sequences drawn from a 2D surface. Here we show that an abstract hierarchical coordinate system supports arbitrary sequences in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL). In single-unit recordings from MTL, we find abstract, coordinate-like coding of a simple sequential memory task. In an fMRI experiment with more complex hierarchical sequences, we discover an abstract hierarchical representation in EC: the coordinate representations at distinct levels in the hierarchy are arranged on an anatomical gradient along the EC's anterior-posterior axis, homologous to the ventro-dorsal axis in rodents. These results therefore mirror the anatomical gradient of grid cells in the rodent EC but now for arbitrary non-spatial sequences. Together they suggest that memories are scaffolded on a hierarchical coordinate system using common neuronal coding principles, aligned to preserved anatomy, across domains and species.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

ObjectiveThe Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD 2021) was employed to evaluate sex differences in the incidence of bipolar disorder (BD) and anxiety disorder (ANX) globally by year, age, and socioeconomic status.

MethodWe estimated sex-specific incidence of BD and ANX from GBD 2021 globally and in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. The sociodemographic index (SDI) was used to gauge national socioeconomic development and the Health Organization (WHO) region was used as a division of regions. Differences in age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) by sex (absolute and relative) and risk ratios (95% confidence interval) were calculated annually and by age. Annual percent change (APC) was calculated by joinpoint regression modeling and linear regression analyses were performed to explore the socioeconomic factors associated with sex differences in incidence.

ResultsThe absolute and relative sex difference in ASRs of BD showed a slight declining trend during 1990 and 2021, with absolute difference decreasing from 2.50 to 1.83, and relative difference decreasing from 1.08 to 1.06; The absolute and relative sex difference in ASRs of ANX showed an increasing trend during 1990 and 2021, with absolute difference increasing from 170.02 to 208.08, and relative difference increasing from 1.35 to 1.36. Worldwide, females had a higher risk of BD and ANX than males in 1990and 2021. The highest Risk ratios of BD and ANX were observed in the European Region in 2021.The greatest relative sex difference of BD was 1.09 in the age group of 30-34. The greatest relative difference of ANX was 1.51 in the age group of 20-24. Relative sex differences of BD and ANX were significantly and positively correlated with SDI (BD, standardized {beta} = 0.27 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.33), P < 0.001; ANX, standardized {beta} = 0.80 (95% CI, 0.47 to 1.14), P < 0.001).

ConclusionsSex difference in the incidence of anxiety disorders and bipolar disorder have persisted worldwide over the past several decades, and the rates have consistently been higher among females than males. The sex difference in the global incidence of bipolar disorder has shown a slight improvement, but that in the global incidence of anxiety disorders has not been effectively mitigated. The sex difference is even more pronounced at younger ages and in more developed nations. The findings emphasize the significance of sex-specific health policies to reduce sex differences in the incidence of bipolar and anxiety disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1730585372834

Dysregulation of clusterin is linked to late-onset Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular pathology and cancer. Despite its prominent role in extracellular proteostasis, the chaperone mechanism of clusterin has remained unclear. Here we present crystal structures of human clusterin, revealing a discontinuous three-domain architecture. Structure-based mutational analysis demonstrated that two intrinsically disordered, hydrophobic peptide tails enable diverse clusterin activities. Resembling the N-terminal substrate binding regions of so-called small heat shock proteins, these sequences mediate clusterin's chaperone function in suppressing amyloid-beta tau and alpha-synuclein aggregation. In conjunction with highly conserved surface areas, the tail segments also participate in clusterin binding to very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and cellular uptake. Moreover, the disordered tails cooperate with an adjacent amphipathic helix in lipoprotein formation, but remain accessible for chaperone function in the lipoprotein complex. The remarkable versatility of these sequences allows clusterin to function alone or bound to lipid in maintaining solubility of aberrant extracellular proteins and facilitating their clearance by endocytosis and lysosomal degradation.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

However, existing protocols often lack confidence in identifying the transcription start site (TSS) and fail to capture non-poly(A) RNA, thereby limiting the discovery of novel genes, particularly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). In this study, we introduce Cap-trap full-length cDNA sequencing (CFC-seq), a comprehensive protocol that combines Cap-trapping and poly(A)-tailing with Oxford Nanopore sequencing. This protocol enables precise identification of TSSs and full-length transcripts. Applying CFC-seq to two in vitro differentiation time courses resulted in approximately 236 million mappable reads. The transcript Start-site Aware Long-read Assembler (SALA) was developed for de novo assembling the transcript models, leading to the identification of 39,425 confident novel genes. Using this dataset, enhancer-derived ncRNAs were re-defined with longer length and more splicing activity, which were correlated with enhancer structure. Compared to enhancers with CpG islands, TATA box enhancers were shown to be more cell-type specific with fewer chromatin interaction but produced longer and more stable polyadenylated RNA. A significant proportion of these TATA box-derived eRNAs originated from LTR transposable elements. Overall, this study systematically annotated ~24,000 novel eRNA genes and correlated their transcription properties with enhancer structure.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

This conclusion, however, is primarily based on analyses of neural responses from macaques. Whether hierarchical variation in timescales is a general brain organizing principle across mammals remains unclear. Here we took a cross-species approach and estimated neuronal timescales of thousands of single neurons recorded across multiple areas in mice, monkeys, and humans using a task-agnostic method. We identify largely consistent hierarchies of timescales in frontal and limbic regions across species: hippocampus had the shortest timescale whereas anterior cingulate cortex had the longest. Within this scheme, variability across species was found, most notably in amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. We show that variation in timescales is not simply related to differences in spiking statistics nor the result of cytoarchitectonic features such as cortical granularity. Thus, hierarchically organized timescales are a consistent organizing principle across species and appear to be related to a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Currently, we have standard metrics for evaluating model performance (e.g., precision, recall, F1), but these to some extent overlook the ultimate aim of addressing the specific research question to which the model will be applied. As improving performance metrics has diminishing returns, particularly when data is inherently noisy, biologists are often faced with the conundrum of investing more time in maximising performance metrics at the expense of doing the actual research. This leads to the question: how much noise can we accept in our ML models?
C_LIO_LIHere, we start by describing an under-reported source of noise that can cause performance metrics to underestimate true model performance. Specifically, ambiguity between categories or mistakes in labelling of the validation data produces hard ceilings that limit performance metric scores. This common source of error in biological systems means that many models could be performing better than the metrics suggest.
C_LIO_LINext, we argue and show that imperfect models (e.g. low F1 scores) can still useable. We first propose a simulation framework to evaluate the robustness of a model for hypothesis testing. Second, we show how to determine the utility of the models by supplementing existing performance metrics with  biological validations that involve applying ML models to unlabelled data in different ecological contexts for which we can anticipate the outcome.
C_LIO_LITogether, our simulations and case study show that effects sizes and expected biological patterns can be detected even when performance metrics are relatively low (e.g., F1 between 60-70%). In doing so, we provide a roadmap for validation approaches of ML models that are tailored to research in ecology and evolutionary biology.

The dentate gyrus (DG) is an important brain region in contextual discrimination and disambiguation of new experiences from prior memories. The DG also receives dense projections from the locus coeruleus (LC), the primary source of norepinephrine (NE) in the mammalian brain, which is active during stressful events. However, how noradrenergic dynamics impact DG-dependent function during contextual discrimination and pattern separation remains unclear. Here, we report that aversive contextual processing in mice is linked to linear elevations in tonic norepinephrine release dynamics within the DG and report that this engagement of prolonged norepinephrine release is sufficient to produce contextual disambiguation, even in the absence of a salient aversive stimulus. These findings suggest that spatiotemporal ramping characteristics of LC-NE release in the DG during stress likely serve an important role in driving contextual processing.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

The primary target of neutralizing antibodies is the fusion (F) glycoprotein on the surface of the RSV and hMPV virion. As a result of the structural conservation between RSV and hMPV F, three antigenic regions are known to induce cross-neutralizing responses: sites III, IV, and V. Leveraging LIBRA-seq, we identify five RSV/hMPV cross-reactive human antibodies. One antibody, 5-1, potently neutralizes all tested viruses from the major subgroups of RSV and hMPV and provides protection against RSV and hMPV in a mouse challenge model. Structural analysis reveals that 5-1 utilizes an uncommon genetic signature to bind an epitope that spans sites 0, II and V, defining a new mode of antibody cross-reactivity between RSV and hMPV F. These findings highlight the molecular and structural elements influencing RSV and hMPV cross-reactivity as well as the potential of antibody 5-1 for translational development.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

COMBINE revealed diverse synergistic and antagonistic interactions between epigenetic protein domains, including a potent KRAB-L3MBTL3 fusion that enhanced gene silencing up to 34-fold in dose-limited conditions and enabled robust bidirectional CRISPR perturbation. Inducible screening showed DNA methylation modifiers are essential for epigenetic memory, with distinct combinations driving long-term silencing, repression, or activation.

Commonly used structure-based methods such as giga-docking often fail to rank compounds effectively, and free energy-based approaches, while accurate, are too computationally intensive for large-scale screening. Existing deep learning models struggle to generalize to new targets or drugs, and current evaluation methods do not reflect real-world performance accurately. We introduce BALM, a deep learning framework that predicts binding affinity using pretrained protein and ligand language models. BALM learns experimental binding affinities by optimizing cosine similarity in a shared embedding space. We also propose improved evaluation strategies with diverse data splits and metrics to better assess model performance. Using the BindingDB dataset, BALM shows strong generalization to unseen drugs, scaffolds, and targets. It excels in few-shot scenarios for targets such as USP7 and Mpro, outperforming traditional machine learning and docking methods, including AutoDock Vina. Adoption of the target-based evaluation methods proposed will allow for more stringent evaluation of machine learning-based scoring tools. Frameworks such as BALM show good performance, are computationally efficient, and are highly adaptable within this evaluation setting, making them practical tools for early-stage drug discovery screening.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

While previous studies have primarily focused on skin stretch directly at joints, here we investigate the extent and complexity of natural skin stretch across various body regions, including the face and trunk. We used a quad-camera setup to image large ink-based speckle patterns stamped on participants skin and calculated the resulting stretch patterns on a millimeter scale during a range of natural poses. We observed that skin stretch associated with joint movement extends far beyond the joint itself, with knee flexion inducing stretch on the upper thigh. Large and uniform stretch patterns were found across the trunk, covering considerable portions of the skin. The face exhibited highly complex and non-uniform stretch patterns, potentially contributing to our capacity to control fine facial movements in the absence of traditional proprioceptors. Importantly, all regions demonstrated skin stretch in excess of mechanoreceptive thresholds, suggesting that behaviorally relevant skin stretch can occur anywhere on the body. These signals might provide the brain with valuable information about body state and conformation, potentially supplementing or even surpassing the capabilities of traditional proprioception.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Increase in circulating amino acids and lipids, in part due to adipose dysfunction, have been shown to drive obesity-mediated diseases. Similarly, elevated purines and uric acid, a degradation product of purine metabolism, are found in the bloodstream and in adipose tissue. These metabolic changes are correlated with metabolic syndrome, but little is known about the physiological effects of targeting purine biosynthesis. Methods: To determine the effects of purine biosynthesis on organismal health we treated mice with mizoribine, an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IMPDH1/2), key enzymes in this pathway. Mice were fed either a low-fat (LFD; 13.5% kcal from fat) or a high-fat (HFD; 60% kcal from fat) diet for 30 days during drug or vehicle treatment. We ascertained the effects of mizoribine on weight gain, body composition, food intake and absorption, energy expenditure, and overall metabolic health. Results: Mizoribine treatment prevented mice on a HFD from gaining weight, but had no effect on mice on a LFD. Body composition analysis demonstrated that mizoribine significantly reduced fat mass but did not affect lean mass. Although mizoribine had no effect on lipid absorption, food intake was reduced. Furthermore, mizoribine treatment induced adaptive thermogenesis in skeletal muscle by upregulating sarcolipin, a regulator of muscle thermogenesis. While mizoribine-treated mice exhibited less adipose tissue than controls, we did not observe lipotoxicity. Rather, mizoribine-treated mice displayed improved glucose tolerance and reduced ectopic lipid accumulation. Conclusions: Inhibiting purine biosynthesis prevents mice on a HFD from gaining weight, and improves their metabolic health, to a significant degree. We also demonstrated that the purine biosynthesis pathway plays a previously unknown role in skeletal muscle thermogenesis. A deeper mechanistic understanding of how purine biosynthesis promotes thermogenesis and decreases food intake may pave the way to new anti-obesity therapies. Crucially, given that many purine inhibitors have been FDA-approved for use in treating various conditions, our results indicate that they may benefit overweight or obese patients.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

To identify pathways that are essential under fluoroquinolone stress and thus might represent novel targets to revitalize the use of this class of antibiotics, we performed genome-wide CRISPRi-seq screens to determine antibiotic-gene essentiality signatures. As expected, genes involved in DNA recombination and repair become more important under fluoroquinolone-induced DNA damage, such as recA, recJ, recF, recO, rexAB and ruvAB. Surprisingly, we also found that specific downregulation of the gene encoding the histidine kinase LiaS caused fluoroquinolone hypersensitivity. LiaS is part of the LiaFSR (VraTSR) three-component regulatory system involved in cell envelope homeostasis. We show that LiaS keeps the response regulator LiaR inactive, and that deletion of liaS causes hyperphosphorylation of LiaR and subsequent upregulation of the LiaR regulon. RNA-seq was used to refine the LiaR regulon, highlighting the role of the heat-shock response and the pleiotropic regulator SpxA2 in fluoroquinolone sensitivity. Activating the LiaR-regulon by the cell envelope-targeting antibiotic bacitracin synergized with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. This synergistic antibiotic combination restored sensitivity in fluoroquinolone-resistant strains in vitro. Importantly, bacitracin/levofloxacin combination therapy was also effective in vivo and improved the treatment of fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae infection in a zebrafish meningitis model.

However, it has only recently been discovered that MEC and hippocampus are modulated by the positions and trajectories of others. To understand how encoding spatial information of multiple agents shapes neural representations, we train a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that captures properties of MEC to path integrate trajectories of two agents simultaneously navigating the same environment. We find significant differences between these RNNs and those trained to path integrate only a single agent. At the individual unit level, RNNs trained to path integrate more than one agent develop weaker grid responses, stronger border responses, and tuning for the relative position of the two agents. At the population level, they develop more distributed and robust representations, with changes in network dynamics and manifold topology. Our results provide testable predictions and open new directions with which to study the neural computations supporting spatial navigation.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Taken together, our study identifies the proteome of pyrenoid-traversing membranes and initiates the characterization of a novel pyrenoid-traversing membrane complex, building toward a mechanistic understanding of the pyrenoid.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

While the design is individual-specific, we implement normalization steps to enable unbiased comparisons across individuals. As a proof of concept, we validated the method on cortical maps of 545 subjects across two datasets, using fMRI maps of healthy individuals and tau-PET maps of patients across the Alzheimer's disease continuum. Our results reveal that cortical regions in different canonical functional networks have connectivity patterns that entail different degrees of hemispheric asymmetry.

In humans, positive selection of driver mutations during spermatogenesis is known to increase the birth prevalence of certain developmental disorders. Until recently, characterising the extent of this selection in sperm has been limited by the error rates of sequencing technologies. Using the duplex sequencing method NanoSeq, we sequenced 81 bulk sperm samples from individuals aged 24 to 75 years. Our findings revealed a linear accumulation of 1.67 (95% CI = 1.41-1.92) mutations per year per haploid genome, driven by two mutational signatures associated with human ageing. Deep targeted and exome NanoSeq of sperm samples identified over 35,000 germline coding mutations. We detected 40 genes (31 novel) under significant positive selection in the male germline, implicating both activating and loss-of-function mechanisms and diverse cellular pathways. Most positively selected genes are associated with developmental or cancer predisposition disorders in children, while four genes that exhibit elevated frequencies of protein-truncating variants in healthy populations. We find that positive selection during spermatogenesis drives a 2-3 fold elevated risk of known disease-causing mutations in sperm, resulting in 3-5% of sperm from middle-aged to elderly individuals carrying a pathogenic mutation across the exome. These findings shed light on the dynamics of germline mutations and highlight a broader increased disease risk for children born to fathers of advanced age than previously appreciated.","NA","medrxiv",1730585372834

Notwithstanding these advancements, a key challenge remains: while some methods exist to evaluate artificially generated genomic data, comprehensive tools to assess its usefulness are still limited. To tackle this issue and present a promising use case, we test artificial genomes within the framework of population genetics and local ancestry inference (LAI). Building on previous work in deep generative modeling for genomics, we introduce a novel, frugal diffusion model and show that it produces high-quality genomic data. We then assess the performance of a downstream machine learning LAI model trained on composite datasets comprising both real and/or synthetic data. Our findings reveal that the LAI model achieves comparable performance when trained exclusively on real data versus high-quality synthetic data. Moreover, we highlight how data augmentation using high-quality artificial genomes significantly benefits the LAI model, particularly when real data is limited. Finally, we compare the conventional use of a single synthetic dataset to a robust ensemble approach, wherein multiple LAI models are trained on diverse synthetic datasets, and their predictions are aggregated. Our study highlights the potential of frugal diffusion-based generative models and synthetic data integration in genomics. This approach could improve fair representation across populations by overcoming data accessibility challenges, while ensuring the reliability of genomic analyses conducted on artificial data.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

During monsoon, flooding is common in most Indian cities bringing in fecal contamination in storm runoff. Identifying the major driving factors contributing to the elevated levels of AMR in these rivers is essential to combat AMR proliferation. Determining whether the introduction of ARBs and ARGs through fecal pollution or subsequent (co-) selection for ARGs through chemical pollutants is responsible for the rise and spread of AMR is important in mitigation efforts. To achieve this, we targeted two rivers in northern India which received untreated wastewater and assessed the level of two fecal indicators (E. coli and intI1) and wastewater-associated ARGs (ermF, sul1, sul2, and tetW) along with heavy metals (Ag, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn). Water and sediment samples were collected in triplicates at 5-6 locations for each river. Consequently, to evaluate how seasonality affects the ARG levels as well as their drivers in these heavily polluted rivers, sampling campaigns were carried out during three seasons: in summer (pre-monsoon), during monsoon, and post-monsoon in winter. We here demonstrate that the main source for the river resistome in the Bindal and Rispana is the constant inflow of untreated wastewater throughout the year and not the co-selection of ARGs due to the presence of heavy metals. This may be true for many Indian rivers that receive untreated or partially treated wastewater. The rainfall adds to the ARG abundance of the river instead of diluting it. MGE intI1 is more reliable than E. coli as an indicator for fecal pollution and horizontal gene transfer. Heavy metals, despite being present in the river in higher concentrations than the MCSC, no evidence for co-selection was observed.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Telomeric repeat motifs (TRMs), the minimal repeating unit of a telomere, vary from species to species, with some evolutionary clades experiencing a rapid sequence divergence. To explore the full scope of this evolutionary divergence, many bioinformatic tools have been developed to infer novel TRMs using repetitive sequence search on short sequencing reads. However, novel telomeric motifs remain unidentified in up to half of the sequencing libraries assayed with these tools. A possible reason may be that short reads, derived from extensively sheared DNA, preserve little to no positional context of the repetitive sequences assayed. On the other hand, if a sequencing read is sufficiently long, telomeric sequences must appear at either end rather than in the middle. The TeloSearchLR algorithm relies on this to help identify novel TRMs on long reads, in many cases where short-read search tools have failed. In addition, we demonstrate that TeloSearchLR can reveal unusually long telomeric motifs not maintained by telomerase, and it can also be used to anchor terminal scaffolds in new genome assemblies.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Methanol is a one-carbon alcohol that stands out as an alternative feedstock for the bioproduction of chemicals, as it is electron-rich, water-miscible and can be produced from several renewable resources. Bioconversion of methanol into products under thermophilic conditions (>50C) could be highly advantageous for industrial biotechnology. However, thermophilic natural methylotrophic microorganisms are typically not suitable for this purpose. Hence, we set out to implement synthetic methanol assimilation in the emerging thermophilic model organism Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius. We engineered P. thermoglucosidasius to be strictly dependent for its growth on methanol assimilation via the core of the highly efficient ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) cycle, while co-assimilating ribose. Surprisingly, this did not require heterologous expression of RuMP enzymes. Instead, by laboratory evolution we awakened latent, native enzyme activities to form the core of the RuMP cycle. We obtained fast methylotrophic growth in which ~15% of biomass was strictly obtained from methanol. This work paves the way for developing a thermophilic bioproduction platform based on renewable methanol.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

One question that arises often in data on natural populations is whether differentiation among populations on a particular trait might be caused in part by natural selection. For the past several decades, researchers have used Q_ST--F_ST approaches to compare the amount of trait differentiation among populations on one or more traits (measured by the statistic Q_ST) with differentiation on genome-wide genetic variants (measured by F_ST). Theory says that under neutrality, F_ST and Q_ST should be approximately equal in expectation, so Q_ST values much larger than F_ST are consistent with local adaptation driving subpopulations' trait values apart, and Q_ST values much smaller than F_ST are consistent with stabilizing selection on similar optima. At the same time, investigators have differed in their definitions of genome-wide F_ST (such as ""ratio of averages"" vs. ""average of ratios"" versions of F_ST) and in their definitions of the variance components in Q_ST. Here, we show that these details matter. Different versions of F_ST and Q_ST have different interpretations in terms of coalescence time, and comparing incompatible statistics can lead to elevated type I error rates, with some choices leading to type I error rates near one when the nominal rate is 5%. We conduct simulations under varying genetic architectures and forms of population structure and show how they affect the distribution of Q_ST. When many loci influence the trait, our simulations support procedures grounded in a coalescent-based framework for neutral phenotytpic differentiation.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

To understand the cause and consequence of NPC plasticity requires technologies to visualize differences within individual NPCs across the thousands in a given nucleus. We evaluate the utility of Pan Expansion Microscopy (Pan-ExM), which enables 16-20 fold isotropic cell enlargement while preserving the proteome, to reveal NPC plasticity. NPCs are robustly identified by deep learning-facilitated segmentation as tripartite structures corresponding to the nucleoplasmic ring, inner ring with central transport channel, and cytoplasmic ring, as confirmed by immunostaining. We demonstrate a range of NPC diameters with a bias for dilated NPCs at the basal nuclear surface, often in local clusters. These diameter biases are eliminated by disrupting linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex-dependent connections between the nuclear envelope (NE) and the cytoskeleton, supporting that they reflect local variations in NE tension. Pan-ExM further reveals that the transmembrane nucleoporin/nup POM121 resides specifically at the nuclear ring in multiple model cell lines, surprising given the expectation that it would be a component of the inner ring like other transmembrane nups. Remarkably, however, POM121 shifts from the nuclear ring to the inner ring specifically in aged induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons (iPSNs) from a patient with C9orf72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Thus, Pan-ExM allows the visualization of changes in NPC architecture that may underlie early steps in an ALS pathomechanism. Taken together, Pan-ExM is a powerful and accessible tool to visualize NPC plasticity in physiological and pathological contexts at single NPC resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

However, the underlying functional dynamics of the neural networks mediating such crossmodal responses remain unclear. Here, using braille reading as a model framework to investigate these networks, we presented sighted (N=13) and blind (N=12) readers with individual visual print and tactile braille alphabetic letters, respectively, during MEG recording. Using time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis and representational similarity analysis, we traced the alphabetic letter processing cascade in both groups of participants. We found that letter representations unfolded more slowly in blind than in sighted brains, with decoding peak latencies ~200 ms later in braille readers. Focusing on the blind group, we found that the format of neural letter representations transformed within the first 500 ms after stimulus onset from a low-level structure consistent with peripheral nerve afferent coding to high-level format reflecting pairwise letter embeddings in a text corpus. The spatiotemporal dynamics of the transformation suggest that the processing cascade proceeds from a starting point in somatosensory cortex to early visual cortex and then to inferotemporal cortex. Together our results give insight into the neural mechanisms underlying braille reading in blind persons and the dynamics of functional reorganization in sensory deprivation.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Yet, we identified significant epistatic expression interactions between this risk variant and others lying within regulatory regions subject to repression or activation.

Here, we demonstrate that cells entering quiescence select plasma membrane-resident amino acid (AA) transporters for endocytosis and lysosomal degradation, to match AA uptake with reduced translation. The endocytic degradation of the heterodimeric AA transporter SLC7A5-SLC3A2 (LAT1-4F2hc) requires the alpha-arrestin TXNIP and its interaction with HECT-type ubiquitin ligases. During growth, active AKT phosphorylates TXNIP, maintaining it inactive. In quiescence, reduced AKT signaling licenses TXNIP dependent endocytosis of SLC7A5-SLC3A2 to decrease AA uptake. TXNIP deficiency results in dysregulated AA uptake, enhanced mTORC1 signaling, increased translation, accelerated quiescence exit, and proliferation.

However, there are known sex-differences as older females harbour higher WMH burden than males. Some have hypothesized that the increase in this dementia-related risk factor is related to the menopausal transition. Methods: To untangle the effects of age and menopause, we leveraged a large sample from the UK Biobank (n = 10,519) to investigate differences in WMH volumes across the menopausal transition using a strict age-matching procedure. Results: Surprisingly, we find increased WMH volumes in premenopausal women compared to postmenopausal women when simply correcting for age with linear models, but we find no effect in the age-matched sample. Menopause-related characteristics, such as age at menopause or hormone replacement therapy, did not replicate previous literature reporting an association with WMH volumes. Cardiovascular lifestyle variables, such as smoking and blood pressure, were significant predictors of WMH volume in the full sample without age-matching. These effects varied by menopausal status only for days of moderate activity. Discussion: In sum, our findings in a well-powered study suggest that previous reports of menopause-related differences in WMH burden are potentially confounded by age. We further show that the effect of positive lifestyle factors on brain health, as indexed with WMH burden, generally does not change after menopause. Factors other than the menopausal transition are likely at play in explaining the difference in WMH burden between males and females in later life.","NA","medrxiv",1730585372834

Here, we present a near telomere-to-telomere, haplotype-phased reference genome assembly for a male mountain gorilla generated using PacBio HiFi (26.77X ave. coverage) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (52.87X ave. coverage) data. The resulting non-scaffolded assembly exhibits exceptional contiguity, with contig N50 of ~95 Mbp for the combined pseudohaplotype (3,540,458,497 bp), 56.5 Mbp (3.1 Gbp) and 51.0 Mbp (3.2 Gbp) for each haplotype, an average QV of 65.15 (error rate = 3.1 X 10-7), and a BUSCO score of 98.4%. These represent substantial improvements over most other available primate genomes. This first high-quality reference genome of the mountain gorilla provides an invaluable resource for future studies on gorilla evolution, adaptation, and conservation, ultimately contributing to the long-term survival of this iconic species.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Previous work on host-parasite systems has shown that parasite virulence is driven by dispersal rates and spatial structure, assuming that dispersal is an ecologically fixed parameter. However, dispersal is also a trait under selection and can evolve. In this context, we develop an individual-based eco-evolutionary model, in which both parasite virulence and host dispersal can evolve in representative terrestrial (random-geometric graphs; RGGs) and riverine aquatic (optimal channel networks; OCNs) landscapes. We find that in riverine aquatic landscapes, evolutionarily stable (ES) dispersal rates are lower and ES virulence is greater relative to terrestrial landscapes when dispersal mortality is low. When dispersal mortality is high, both dispersal and virulence evolve to lower values in both landscape types. Diverging co-evolutionary patterns between landscapes are explained by differences in network topology. Specifically, the highly heterogeneous degree distribution in riverine aquatic landscapes 1) leads to low parasite relatedness allowing for the evolution of greater virulence and 2) leads to spatial heterogeneity in host densities that constrains the evolution of dispersal to lower values. Our work highlights the importance of considering the concurrent and co-evolution of dispersal when studying trait evolution in complex landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

This ability is hypothesized to depend on sequential planning via step-by-step simulations of the future, using cognitive maps or schemas of task contingencies. However, it is still unclear if, how and where in the brain such flexible planning is enacted. In parallel, it is thought that consolidation transforms memory representations over time to promote adaptive behaviour. Here, we hypothesize that consolidation strengthens cognitive maps of task contingencies used for simulation during sequential planning. To test this, we developed a novel behavioural task and a new multivariate method for analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Using choice and reaction time data we dissociated flexible sequential planning from alternative non-sequential strategies, and identified this behaviour with robust neural markers of step-by-step simulation, localized to the anterior medial temporal lobe. Retesting a week later we showed that consolidation enhanced sequential planning and strengthened markers of sequential simulation in the prefrontal cortex, consistent with systems consolidation theory. By revealing that consolidation improves future simulations for flexible planning we open up a new frontier for the investigation of the functional interactions between memory and decision-making.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

To overcome this barrier, we have developed ChronoGauge: an ensemble model which can reliably estimate the endogenous circadian time of plants using the expression of a handful of time-indicating genes within a single time-pointed transcriptomic sample. ChronoGauge can predict the plant circadian time with high accuracy across unseen Arabidopsis bulk RNA-seq and microarray samples, and can be further applied across samples in non-model species, including field samples. Finally, we demonstrate how ChronoGauge can be applied to test hypotheses regarding the response of the circadian transcriptome to specific genotypes or environmental conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Here, we report single-nucleus RNA sequencing in resected cortical tubers vs matched pediatric controls. Strikingly, in spite of severe cortical disorganization, we found that cortical tubers preserve all neuronal subtypes, even the rarest ones. Moreover, we showed that principal neurons largely preserve spatial position based on transcriptional signatures. Principal neurons and layer 1-2 GABAergic neurons that modulate upper cortical circuits exhibited the largest gene expression changes. Interestingly, multiple mTOR pathway gene expression changes in TSC counteracted mTOR hyperactivation. TSC neuronal, but not glial, networks exhibited massive metabolic reorganization with a reduction in mitochondrial respiration and a concomitant switch to fatty acid metabolism. Finally, we show that neuron-specific AMPA receptor signaling might underlie epileptogenesis in TSC and could represent a potential candidate for therapeutic targeting.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Utilising phylogeographic approaches, we reveal a multi-scale expansion process with both short and long-distance dispersal events, and diffusion velocities in line with human-mediated jumps. We identify forest cover, banana and cocoa cultivation, temperature, and human population density as key environmental factors associated with OROV range expansion. Using ecological niche modelling, we show that OROV circulated in areas of enhanced ecological suitability immediately preceding its explosive epidemic expansion in the Amazon. This likely resulted from the virus being introduced into simultaneously densely populated and environmentally favourable regions in the Amazon, such as Manaus, leading to an amplified epidemic and spread beyond the Amazon. Our study provides valuable insights into the dispersal and ecological dynamics of OROV, highlighting the role of human mobility in colonisation of new areas, and raising concern over high viral suitability along the Brazilian coast.","NA","medrxiv",1730585372834

Here, we inoculated nubbins of the coral Pocillopora verrucosa with an opportunistic pathogen, Vibrio coralliilyticus, and/or a coral probiotic, Cobetia sp., and subjected the nubbins to heat stress. We discovered that the epigenomes responded already after 19 days to heat stress and 28 days to bacterial inoculation. Pathogen stress led to DNA methylation changes not seen in other treatments. Notably, the coral probiotic was able to mitigate specific epigenetic changes in a glutamate receptor pathway, and this correlated with increased stress resilience and higher survival rates of the corals. Importantly, epigenetic marks persisted even after the temperature stress was removed, suggesting epigenome acclimation. Thus, bacterial-induced changes to the coral epigenome may instigate long-term changes in host resilience.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

We developed a decision-making task for head-fixed mice in which we varied the expected value and risk associated with reward-predicting stimuli. Using large-scale electrophysiology and projection-specific optotagging across multiple frontal regions, we identified distinct spatial gradients for these variables, with stronger expected value coding in dorsal regions and stronger risk coding in medial regions. We then demonstrated that this encoding further depends on the neuronal projections: frontal neurons projecting to the dorsomedial striatum and claustrum differentially encoded economic variables. Our findings illustrate that frontal cortical representation of economic variables is jointly determined by spatial organization and downstream connectivity of neurons, revealing a structured, multi-scale code for economic variables.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Here, we provide evidence that mitochondrial activity is controlled in a tissue-specific manner through a non-canonical cytoplasmic function of the transcription factor FOXG1. Using zebrafish and human models of the neurodevelopmental disorder, FOXG1 Syndrome, we found that FOXG1 mutations inducing a premature stop codon unexpectedly lead to the production of a short C-terminal peptide. The expression of this truncated protein is responsible for an excess of excitatory neurons and a structural, functional, and translational mitochondrial phenotype in mutants. We demonstrate that this activity is a gain of function, normally carried out by a cleavage product in wildtype. Both peptides promote the translation of mitochondrially-encoded transcripts, are preferentially transported to the mitochondria, and interact with mito-ribosomal proteins. These findings unveil a mechanism that integrates cell fate decisions with metabolic output. Adjusting the dosage of the mutant peptide rescues aspects of FOXG1 Syndrome, offering a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of disorders involving mitochondrial dysfunctions.

BamA is a central component of the BAM complex. The molecular mechanisms of BamA when the substrate protein is assembled has been well elucidated and further the inhibitors targeting key mechanisms of BamA have been isolated. Although the BAM complex is a multi-subunit machine and its coordination is necessary for full function, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we report on a fine-tuning system with a subunit called BamE, which is required for the cooperation of two essential subunits BamA and BamD. BamE is a lipoprotein with an N-terminal extension region between the lipid-modifying cysteine on the N-terminus and the periplasmic folding domain. Our interaction mapping revealed that the N-terminal extension region of BamE interacts with the {beta}-barrel domain of BamA, which contains a catalytic site for assembly termed lateral gate. The mutational analysis demonstrated that the N-terminal extension region of BamE fine-tunes the assembly stage dependent BamA-BamD interaction, responsible for the crucial role for assembly and integrity of the outer membrane. We suggest that this fine-tuning system plays an important role in the substrate relay system from the receptor BamD to the insertase BamA. Furthermore, structure prediction-based analysis suspects that the C-terminal region of BamD acts as the replacement of BamE in BamE-less bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Hh signals are transduced via an unusual mechanism: upon agonist-induced phosphorylation, the noncanonical G protein-coupled receptor SMOOTHENED (SMO) binds the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA-C) and physically blocks its enzymatic activity. By combining computational structural approaches with biochemical and functional studies, we show that SMO mimics strategies prevalent in canonical GPCR and PKA signaling complexes, despite little sequence or secondary structural homology. An intrinsically disordered region of SMO binds the PKA-C active site, resembling the PKA regulatory subunit (PKA-R) / PKA-C holoenzyme, while the SMO transmembrane domain binds a conserved PKA-C interaction hub, similar to other GPCR-effector complexes. In contrast with prevailing GPCR signal transduction models, phosphorylation of SMO promotes intramolecular electrostatic interactions that stabilize key structural elements within the SMO cytoplasmic domain, thereby remodeling it into a PKA-inhibiting conformation. Our work provides a structural mechanism for a central step in the Hh cascade and defines a paradigm for disordered GPCR domains to transmit signals intracellularly.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

IME has been noted across diverse genes and organisms, but remains mysterious in many respects. For example, how does intron sequence affect the magnitude of IME? In this study, we performed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to assess the effect of varying intron sequence on gene expression in a high-throughput manner, in human cells, using tens of thousands of synthetic introns with natural splice sites and randomized internal sequence. We observe that most random introns splice efficiently and enhance gene expression as well as or better than fully natural introns. Nearly all introns stimulate gene expression [~]eight-fold above an intronless control, at both mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that the primary mechanism acts to increase mRNA levels. IME strength is positively associated with splicing efficiency and with the intronic content of poly-uridine stretches, which we confirm using reporter experiments. Together, this work elucidates sequence determinants of IME from tens of thousands of random introns, and confirms that enhancement of gene expression is a general property of splicing.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

The close homologue NINJ2 polymerizes with similar kinetics to NINJ1 but fails to form lesions during cell swelling, further highlighting that oligomerization and PMR are distinct events. Chimeras between NINJ1 and NINJ2 show that the unstructured N-terminal region of NINJ1 controls lesion opening in response to cell swelling. In summary, our data establish a new 2-step model for NINJ1-driven necrosis in which initial oligomerization causes the formation of NINJ1 filaments that serve as  weak links in the plasma membrane and can break once cell swelling causes a rise in membrane tension and mechanical stress.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

The somatic human NPC scaffold consists of three stacked rings: cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic, and inner ring, which define an approximately 55nm-wide central channel. However, how NPC architecture accommodates the different function of non-somatic cells is largely unknown. Here, we reveal the in-cell architecture of the human sperm NPC exhibiting a central channel less than 40nm-wide, outlined exclusively by the inner ring. This is accompanied by a 6-fold reduction in nuclear diffusion and mis-localization of Ran-dependent transport components. We also unveil a septin filaments meshwork connecting the NPCs and postulate a mechanical role in channel constriction. Furthermore, we show the end of meiosis as the key differentiation step for NPC architectural changes.

Despite this well-known link, we still know little about underlying age-related epigenetic differences, which could help us better understand inter-individual variation in aging and the etiology, onset, and progression of age-associated disease. Dogs exhibit this negative correlation between size, health, and longevity and thus represent an excellent system in which to test the underlying mechanisms. Here, we quantified genome-wide DNA methylation in a cohort of 864 dogs in the Dog Aging Project. Age strongly patterned the dog epigenome, with the majority (66% of age-associated loci) of regions associating age-related loss of methylation. These age effects were non-randomly distributed in the genome and differed depending on genomic context. We found the LINE1 (long interspersed elements) class of TEs (transposable elements) were the most frequently hypomethylated with age (FDR < 0.05, 40% of all LINE1 regions). This LINE1 pattern differed in magnitude across breeds of different sizes- the largest dogs lost 0.26% more LINE1 methylation per year than the smallest dogs. This suggests that epigenetic regulation of TEs, particularly LINE1s, may contribute to accelerated age and disease phenotypes within a species. Since our study focused on the methylome of immune cells, we looked at LINE1 methylation changes in golden retrievers, a breed highly susceptible to hematopoietic cancers, and found they have accelerated age-related LINE1 hypomethylation compared to other breeds. We also found many of the LINE1s hypomethylated with age are located on the X chromosome and are, when considering X chromosome inactivation, counter-intuitively more methylated in males. These results have revealed the demethylation of LINE1 transposons as a potential driver of inter-species, demographic-dependent aging variation.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Here, we present an encoder-only transformer model for assembly polishing called DeepPolisher, which predicts corrections to the underlying sequence using Pacbio HiFi read alignments to a diploid assembly. Our pipeline introduces a method, PHARAOH (Phasing Reads in Areas Of Homozygosity), which uses ultra-long ONT data to ensure alignments are accurately phased and to correctly introduce heterozygous edits in falsely homozygous regions. We demonstrate that the DeepPolisher pipeline can reduce assembly errors by half, with a greater than 70% reduction in indel errors. We have applied our DeepPolisher-based pipeline to 180 assemblies from the next Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) data release, producing an average predicted Quality Value (QV) improvement of 3.4 (54% error reduction) for the majority of the genome.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Therefore, approaches targeting food preferences should be integral in counteracting the current epidemic. However, food preferences are affected by a multitude of factors and are usually resistant to changes later in life. Hence, we tested whether the food choices of preschool children can be changed by a child-appropriate interactive fairytale. We used two interactive stories: the first (experimental) story was about how two protagonists of similar age as the participants saved their hometown from being drained of color with the help of magic fruits or vegetables, while the second (control) story consisted of a similar plot that did not mention food. In Experiment 1, we used a crossover design with a one-week baseline measurement. After the experimental stories, healthy food choices (i.e., pieces of fruit vs. cookies, sweets, or cake) increased significantly relative to the one-week baseline, whereas no change was observed after the control story. In preregistered Experiment 2, we replicated these results with vegetables as healthy options using a random control design and investigated the longevity of the effects. The food-story effect on vegetable choices was similar to fruits (Exp. 1) and lasted for two weeks. These findings demonstrate that appropriate narratives about food can have a strong and lasting effect on the healthy food choices of preschool children and might promote healthy food consumption if incorporated into nutrition education.","NA","medrxiv",1730585372834

In anoxic environments, methane is known to be produced through hydrogenotrophic, acetoclastic or methylotrophic mechanisms. Methane production from hydrocarbons may also be important, especially in hydrocarbon-rich environments, like the Gulf of California, but the mechanism of this hydrocarbonoclastic methanogenesis remains unclear. The activity of consortia of anaerobic methane oxidizing (ANME) archaea and bacteria limits the release of methane to the atmosphere by consuming methane in anoxic environments globally. Here we used isotopic-labeling to track the conversion of hydrocarbons (hexadecane and naphthalene) to methane in enrichments from hydrothermally impacted, hydrocarbon-rich sediments from the Gulf of California. Methane was produced directly from hexadecane and naphthalene, in both the presence and absence of sulfate. We reconstructed metagenomic assembled-genomes (MAGs) from these experiments which revealed a mixture of bacteria dominated by Desulfobacteriota and Bacteroidota, and archaea dominated by Aeinigmarchaeota, Thermoplasmatota, and ANME group 2c. The ANME-2c were the only MAGs that encoded methyl coenzyme M reductases (McrA) and complete Wood-Ljungdahl pathways (WLP). This suggests that ANME-2c archaea may be involved in the production of methane along the seafloor, and that our understanding of the roles of these globally important microbes is not yet fully appreciated.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

In this study, we aimed to identify the oscillatory correlates of this process across different spatial scales of neural activity. We simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFP) from the LPFC and electroencephalograms (EEG) from the scalp of monkeys performing a modified memory-guided saccade (MGS) task. The monkeys were required to remember the location of a target visual stimulus while anticipating distracting visual stimulus, flashed at 50% probability during the delay period. We found significant theta-band activity across spatial scales during anticipation of a distractor, closely linked with underlying working memory dynamics, through decoding and cross-temporal generalization analyses. EEG particularly reflected reactivation of memory around the anticipated time of a distractor, even in the absence of stimuli. During this anticipated time, beta-band activity exhibited transiently enhanced intrahemispheric communication between the LPFC and occipitoparietal brain areas. These oscillatory phenomena were observed only when the monkeys successfully performed the task, implicating their possible functional role in mitigating anticipated distractors. Our results demonstrate that distractor anticipation recruits multiple oscillatory processes across the brain during working memory maintenance, with a key activity observed predominantly in the theta and beta bands.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

NST-SPARK is a novel digital therapeutic targeting negative symptoms in SSD. It is a smartphone application delivering recovery-oriented cognitive therapy (CT-R), via gamified augmented reality (AR) experiences, to provide experiential learning aimed at dismantling maladaptive beliefs. In this study, we assessed a prototype (NST-SPARK v.1.5) in 20 participants with SSD and clinically significant negative symptoms. NST-SPARK v.1.5 delivers a single therapeutic module over a 1-week period. The primary objective was to determine the acceptability and feasibility of this approach. Secondary objectives were to generate descriptive findings for changes in defeatist beliefs, self-esteem, and attitudes toward goal-oriented activities.

MethodsRecruitment and all study procedures were completed online. Twenty participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were enrolled, with a range of demographic and socioeconomic status and treatment settings. Participants completed self-reports on the acceptability and feasibility of NST-SPARK v.1.5 and provided open-ended feedback through a semi-structured interview. Self-report scales on defeatist beliefs, self-esteem, and attitudes toward goal-oriented activities were completed before and after participants were introduced to NST-SPARK, and then again at a 1-week follow-up.

ResultsIn general, participants found NST-SPARK v.1.5 to be feasible and acceptable, responding with an average response of ""Agree"", indicating that the intervention was found to meet with the participants approval and seemed implementable. Almost all participants (19 of 20) used the app on their own prior to the 1-week follow up despite not being incentivized to do so. In addition, participants responded to open-ended feedback questions in a generally positive way. We also observed shifts in defeatist beliefs (Cohens d = 0.12), self-esteem (Cohens d = -0.21), and attitudes toward goal attainment consistent (intention: Cohens d = 0.13; confidence: Cohens d = 0.35) with intended improvements in these targeted areas. Participants were able to make substantive progress toward identified goals in 90% of cases.

ConclusionsThis preliminary, single-arm, unblinded study of a single-module prototype for NST-SPARK found that the approach is generally acceptable and feasible for people with SSD and negative symptoms. Engagement of the intended target of defeatist beliefs was supported by our findings but require confirmation in future randomized controlled trials. Overall, NST-SPARK is based on a promising approach and further development is warranted.","NA","medrxiv",1730585372834

Senolytic interventions have been successful in reducing multi-morbidity, frailty, and cognitive decline in animal models and are seen as promising anti-ageing interventions in mammals. We compared the effects of a 12-ingredient nutraceutical on mice lifespan and healthspan markers with that of a high efficacy senolytic intervention consisting of a low dose of Navitoclax combined with the specific mitochondrial uncoupler BAM15. Both interventions were started at old age (20 months). The supplement was given daily until the end of the experiment (30 months of age), but the senolytic intervention consisted of two short (5 days each) rounds of treatment at 20 and 23 months of age. Despite late onset, both interventions increased median lifespan similarly by around 20% over controls. The senolytic intervention significantly reduced frailty progression and improved cognitive function after the second round of treatment, but without subsequent treatment, these effects appeared to wane at later ages. The multi-ingredient supplement tended to reduce frailty progression steadily with time, albeit not significant, and maintained cognitive function. Mechanistically, in vitro, there was no evidence of senolytic activity of the multi-ingredient nutraceutical as a whole nor of its individual ingredients. Continuous multi-ingredient dietary supplementation shows promise in achieving comparable anti-ageing efficacy as a senolytic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Behavioral control is the decision about which process guides behavior. Despite the importance of behavioral control for adaptive decision-making, its neural mechanisms remain unclear. Critically, it is unknown if there are mechanisms for behavioral control that are distinct from those supporting the formation of goal-relevant knowledge. We performed deep phenotyping of individual dopamine system function by combining multiple PET scans, fMRI, and dopaminergic drug administration in a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Subjects performed a rule-based response time task, with goal-directed and automatic decision-making operationalized as model-based and model-free influences on behavior. We found a double dissociation between two aspects of ventral striatal dopamine physiology: D2/3 receptor availability and dopamine synthesis capacity. Convergent and causal evidence indicated that D2/3 receptors regulate behavioral control by enhancing model-based and blunting model-free influences on behavior but do not affect model-based knowledge formation. In contrast, dopamine synthesis capacity was linked to the formation of model-based knowledge but not behavioral control. D2/3 receptors also modulated frontostriatal functional connectivity, suggesting they regulate behavioral control by gating prefrontal inputs to the striatum. These results identify central mechanisms underlying individual and state differences in behavioral control and point to striatal D2/3 receptors as targets for interventions for improving goal-directed behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

Quantification of UFMylation sites in these participant biopsies with multiplexed isotopic labeling and LC-MS/MS reveal prominent increases in myosin UFMylation. Finally, in silico modelling suggest UFMylation of myosin directly adjacent to the ATP-binding site may regulate stability and/or function. Our data suggest that although UFMylation is not as widespread as ubiquitylation, its in vivo status is more complex than previously thought.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has MCSs with a variety of organelles in the cell. MCSs are dynamic, responding to changes in cell state, and are therefore best visualized through inducible labeling methods. However, existing methods typically distort ER-MCSs, by expanding contacts or creating artificial ones. Here we describe a new method for inducible labeling of ER-MCSs using the Lamin B receptor (LBR) and a generic anchor protein on the partner organelle. Termed LaBeRling, this versatile, one-to-many approach allows labeling of different types of ER-MCSs (mitochondria, plasma membrane, lysosomes, early endosomes, lipid droplets and Golgi), on-demand, in interphase or mitotic cells. LaBeRling is non-disruptive and does not change ER-MCSs in terms of the contact number, extent or distance measured; as determined by light microscopy or a deep-learning volume electron microscopy approach. We applied this method to study the changes in ER-MCSs during mitosis and to label novel ER-Golgi contact sites at different mitotic stages in live cells.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

How cell type diversification is constrained by the stable separation between families over vast evolutionary times remains unknown. Here, integrating single-nucleus multiomic sequencing and deep learning, we show that hundreds of sequence features (motifs) divide into distinct sets associated with accessible genomes of specific cell type families. This division is conserved across highly divergent, early-branching animals including flatworms and cnidarians. While specific interactions between motifs delineate cell type relationships within families, surprisingly, these interactions are not conserved between species. Consistently, while deep learning models trained on one species can predict accessibility of other species sequences, their predictions frequently rely on distinct, but synonymous, motif combinations. We propose that long-term stability of cell type families is maintained through genome access specified by conserved motif sets, or  vocabularies, whereas cell types diversify through flexible use of motifs within each set.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

However, recent and heavily disputed debates on data quality have raised questions on the accuracy of demographic data at older ages. Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1730585372834

ObjectiveThis study aimed to verify the association between SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of Stroke, based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, in order to assess the inclusion of the virus as a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases.

MethodsA metaumbrella was conducted, which included 34 systematic reviews, of which 4 were selected for the final analysis based on methodological quality and consistency. The analysis aggregated the results of 70 primary studies, considering different stroke subtypes and outcomes associated with COVID-19. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} index, and significance bias was verified using Eggers test.

ResultsThe analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 is significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 1.55 - 3.95), particularly for ischemic stroke (eOR = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.80) and hemorrhagic stroke (eOR = 3.86; 95%CI: 1.79 - 8.33). Additionally, patients with cerebrovascular comorbidities had higher mortality (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 2.48 - 19.63), as did those who had previously suffered a stroke (eOR = 6.08; 95%CI: 3.73 - 9.91).

ConclusionThe association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke was consistent and significant, suggesting that COVID-19 should be considered a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. However, the high heterogeneity among the studies analyzed reinforces the need for further research to consolidate this relationship.","NA","medrxiv",1730585372834

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1730585372834

The results indicate that Omicron BA.1.1 and its pure reverse mutants were widely distributed throughout the United States from the early days of their emergence, showing a statistically significant difference compared to other major variants, which spread from a small number of sources. The peak emergence of BA.1.1 and BA.1.1.18 pure reverse mutants occurred a few weeks before the peak of all collected samples, whereas the peak of pure reverse mutants in major BA.1 variants and BA.2 coincides with the overall sampling peak. Although the peaks of BA.1.x collections are not all synchronous, the peaks of pure reverse mutants in the BA.1 lineage completely overlap, with the number of such mutants declining abruptly after the peak. These regional and temporal anomalies in the Omicron BA.1 lineage, especially in the BA.1.1 lineage, are virtually impossible to explain by current theories of natural mutation and spread by human-to-human infection.","NA","medrxiv",1730585372834
