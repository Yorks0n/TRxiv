Mucosal IgA in salivary and nasal passages has a rapid response to antigens and can play a protective role against reinfection. The mainstay for analyzing SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine efficacy has been assessment of serum IgG levels; however, validated assays for assessment of mucosal IgA in clinical samples are necessary as new and adapted measures are generated to combat immune-evasive viral variants. A mucosal IgA assay was developed and tested through assessment of IgA levels in salivary samples from participants of the 2019nCoV-314/ NCT05973006 study. These participants had previously received [&ge;]2 mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccinations prior to enrollment and received a single intramuscular study dose of NVX-CoV2601 (XBB.1.5) or bivalent vaccine (NVX-CoV2601 + NVX-CoV2373 [Wuhan]). Salivary samples were collected prior to vaccination on day 0 and on day 28 to assess response post vaccination. Both vaccine groups elicited a significant increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgA against XBB.1.5. Furthermore, cross-reactivity via identification of anti-JN.1 and anti-Wuhan IgA was also observed. The detection of IgA in clinical mucosal samples through this assay will be a valuable tool in supporting vaccine development.","NA","medrxiv",1737756499891

We developed a simple regression-based point score in 2020 based on an objective of forecasting critical care occupancy in the Canadian province of Ontario based on mean age of cases, case numbers, and testing volume. Evolution of the pandemic (variants of concern, vaccination) led us to re-assess and re-calibrate our earlier work, with inclusion of information vaccination which became widespread in 2021. Methods: We obtained complete provincial SARS-CoV-2 case, testing, and vaccination data for the period from March 2020 to September 2022, with data subdivided into 6 major waves, following the approach applied by other Canadian investigators. Our initial model was fit only using the first two wild type SARS-CoV-2 waves; an updated model included wave 3 (N501Y+ variants). Our model was validated by comparing model projections to waves not used for model fitting; validation model fits were evaluated with Spearmans rho; counterfactuals without vaccination were modeled to impute fraction of critical care admissions prevented with vaccination. Costing was based on published economic estimates. Results: Our initial model (fit to waves 1 and 2) was well calibrated (rho 0.85) but predictive validity was modest (rho 0.46). Predictive validity improved in models fit to the first 3 pandemic waves without vaccination (rho 0.60) or with vaccination (rho 0.68) (P for inclusion of vaccination 0.013 by Likelihood Ratio Test). Prevented fraction of ICU admissions attributable to vaccination was 144% (22017 admissions expected vs. 9020 observed); based on published estimates of ICU admission cost for SARS-CoV-2 the 12977 admissions averted $2.9 (CDN) billion in economic costs, in contrast to the $3 billion total cost of the vaccination program. Conclusions: Simple time series regression incorporating case and testing characteristics continues to be useful as a tool for forecasting critical care occupancy due to SARS-CoV-2 but early pandemic models need to be updated to capture the preventive effects of widespread vaccination. The economic benefit of vaccination for prevention of critical care resource consumption during the pandemic is substantial, achieving near cost neutrality with the provinces entire vaccination program.","NA","medrxiv",1737756499891

AMR plasmids allow bacteria to survive antibiotic treatments, but they also produce physiological alterations in their hosts that commonly translate into fitness costs. Despite the key role of plasmid-associated fitness effects in AMR evolution, their origin and molecular bases remain poorly understood. In this study, we introduce plasmid-wide CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens as a tool to dissect plasmid-associated fitness effects. We designed and performed CRISPRi screens targeting the globally distributed carbapenem resistance plasmid pOXA-48 in 13 different multidrug resistant clinical enterobacteria. Our results revealed that pOXA-48 gene-level effects are conserved across clinical strains, and exposed the key role of the carbapenemase-encoding gene, blaOXA-48, as the main responsible for pOXA-48 fitness costs. Moreover, our results highlighted the relevance of postsegregational killing systems in pOXA-48 vertical transmission, and uncovered new genes implicated in pOXA-48 stability. This study sheds new light on the biology and evolution of carbapenem resistant enterobacteria and endorses CRISPRi screens as a powerful method for studying plasmid-mediated AMR.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Iteratively Defined Lengths of Inaccessibility (IDLI) classifies nucleosomes on the basis of shared patterns of intranucleosomal accessibility, into: i.) minimally-accessible chromatosomes; ii.) octasomes with stereotyped DNA accessibility from superhelical locations (SHLs) {+/-}1 through {+/-}7; iii.) highly-accessible unwrapped nucleosomes; and iv.) subnucleosomal species, such as hexasomes, tetrasomes, and other short DNA protections. Applying IDLI to mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) chromatin, we discover widespread nucleosomal distortion on individual mammalian chromatin fibers, with >85% of nucleosomes surveyed displaying degrees of intranucleosomally accessible DNA. We observe epigenomic-domain-specific patterns of distorted nucleosome co-occupancy and positioning, including at enhancers, promoters, and mouse satellite repeat sequences. Nucleosome distortion is programmed by the presence of bound transcription factors (TFs) at cognate motifs; occupied TF binding sites are differentially decorated by distorted nucleosomes compared to unbound sites, and degradation experiments establish direct roles for TFs in structuring binding-site proximal nucleosomes. Finally, we apply IDLI in the context of primary mouse hepatocytes, observing evidence for pervasive nucleosomal distortion in vivo. Further genetic experiments reveal a role for the hepatocyte master regulator FOXA2 in directly impacting nucleosome distortion at hepatocyte-specific regulatory elements in vivo. Our work suggests extreme--but regulated--plasticity in nucleosomal DNA accessibility at the single-molecule level. Further, our study offers an essential new framework to model transcription factor binding, nucleosome remodeling, and cell-type specific gene regulation across biological contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

However, existing full-length single-cell RNA-sequencing methods suffer from multiple technical limitations, such as the pervasive presence of reverse transcription artifacts across genes. Here, we introduce Ouro-Seq, a novel single-cell long-read sequencing framework with a versatile artifact removal mechanism for characterizing full-length mRNA species expressed by individual cells. We also developed a computational pipeline that identifies genuine full-length cDNAs and normalizes full-length mRNA size distributions for integration. Using Ouro-Seq, we constructed the Mouse Single-Cell Long-Read Splicing Atlas by collecting full-length transcriptomes of 103,304 nuclei or cells from 12 major organs and tissues of adult mice. Our atlas comprehensively characterizes alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, and alternative polyadenylation events across cell types, revealing previously unappreciated functional heterogeneity among individual cells. Different cell types exhibit largely distinct expression patterns of various isoforms, corresponding to their specific morphologies and biological functions. Our splicing atlas and generalized long-read frameworks will empower researchers to fully interpret biological variation across full-length transcriptomes of single cells.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Whereas RNA-binding proteins and noncoding RNAs have been implicated in cell division, their interplay during this process remains unknown. Here, we discover that RSRC2, an arginine/serine-rich RNA-binding protein, plays an essential role in cell division by interacting with the long non-coding RNA C1QTNF1-AS1. The loss of either RSRC2 or C1QTNF1-AS1 results in defects in chromosome congression and mitotic progression. We show that RSRC2 interacts with distinct sets of proteins involved in splicing and centrosome biogenesis, contributing to the fidelity of cell division through two different mechanisms: one linked to the splicing of mitotic regulators and the other by localising to mitotic centrosomes for which the interaction with the C1QTNF1-AS1 RNA is required. Our study uncovers RSRC2 as a new regulator of cell division and illustrates how RNA-protein complexes promote error-free mitosis.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Temporal changes in hematopoiesis parallel age-dependent incidences of blood diseases. Several heterochronic regulators of hematopoiesis have been identified, but how the master transcription factor (TF) circuitry of definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) adapts over the lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that expression of the ETS family TF Erg is adult-biased, and that programmed upregulation of Erg expression during juvenile to adult aging is evolutionarily conserved and required for complete implementation of adult patterns of HSC self-renewal and myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid differentiation. Erg deficiency maintains fetal transcriptional and epigenetic programs, and persistent juvenile phenotypes in Erg haploinsufficient mice are dependent on deregulation of the fetal-biased TF Hmga2. Finally, Erg haploinsufficiency in the adult results in fetal-like resistance to leukemogenesis. Overall, we identify a mechanism whereby HSC TF networks are rewired to specify stage-specific hematopoiesis, a finding directly relevant to age-biased blood diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

To shed light on how these components mediate CPC localisation during prometaphase and metaphase, we determined the structure of the CPC targeting module in complex with haspin-phosphorylated H3pT3-nucleosomes by cryo-electron microscopy. This structure shows how the N-terminus of borealin and the survivin BIR domain act as pivot and flexible tethering points, respectively, to increase CPC affinity for H3pT3 nucleosomes without limiting it to a specific orientation.

Conventional mRNA vaccines face cost and scalability challenges, prompting the exploration of alternative platforms like trans-amplifying (TA) mRNA that offer advantages in safety, manufacturability, and antigen dose optimization. Using consensus sequences of immunodominant antigens is a promising antigen design strategy for board cross-protection. Combining these two features, we designed and evaluated a TA mRNA vaccine encoding a consensus spike protein from SARS-CoV-2. Mice receiving the TA mRNA vaccine produced neutralizing antibody levels comparable to a conventional mRNA vaccine using 40 times less antigen mRNA. In hACE2 transgenic mice challenged with the Omicron BA.1 variant, the TA mRNA vaccine reduced lung viral titers by over 10-fold and induced broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies against multiple variants. These findings highlight the potential of TA mRNA vaccines with consensus antigen design to improve efficacy and adaptability against SARS-CoV-2 variants.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Bacteriophages, viruses of bacteria, are drivers of gut bacterial composition in the human gut and could affect bifidobacterial abundance. Here, we use a bioinformatics approach to explore the direct interactions occurring between human-associated Bifidobacterium spp. and prophages, as evidenced by their genomes. A total of 1,086 bifidobacterial genomes were analysed in this study, revealing complex systems to prevent viral invasion. Despite their characteristically small genomes, Bifidobacterium strains harboured more than double the number of defence systems as most bacteria. In total, 34 defence system types and 56 subtypes were detected, including several different CRISPR-Cas systems with spacers that targeted almost three-quarters of bifidobacteria-derived prophages. We identified at least one prophage which met our stringent quality control measures in [~]63% of strains, with phages exhibiting high genomic diversity and evidence of historical recombination. Additionally, prophages were found to encode various anti-defence systems, such as anti-CRISPR genes and restriction modification resistance mechanisms. In summary, our investigation reveals ""arms race"" dynamics drive genomic diversity in both bifidobacteria and their phages.

ImportanceMembers of the Bifidobacterium genus are widely acknowledged as being highly important for human health, particularly in infants. To date, there have been a limited number of large-scale studies that have investigated the presence of prophages and anti-viral defence systems of Bifidobacterium strains from multiple human-associated species. Here, we have uncovered a complex set of anti-phage strategies encoded by Bifidobacterium strains. In addition, we have also identified a highly diverse phage mobilome present within the genomes of bifidobacteria across the genus, which also encode several unique systems for overcoming bacterial defences. Elucidating these co-evolutionary dynamics between phages and bifidobacteria may provide valuable insight into developing high-throughput methods for identifying next-generation probiotic or live biotherapeutic candidates, which may then be applied for the prevention and treatment of various diseases in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Despite existing research, it remains unclear how the gut microbiome is affected by different intensities of PA, and how other lifestyle factors influence this relationship. Here we study the relation between PA intensity and gut microbiome composition and function in a large Lifelines Dutch Microbiome Project dataset.

MethodsA cross-sectional design was performed on 5409 adults aged 40 to 60 from the community-based Lifelines Dutch Microbiome Project and from all these participants metagenomic shotgun data was available. Participants were categorized into sedentary (N=2501), moderate (N=1915), and vigorous (N=993) PA groups, based on self-reported activity levels. We investigated association between PA intensity and microbial diversity, bacterial species, and metabolic pathways by multiple regression models sequentially adjusted for the covariates age/sex, BMI, stool consistency and diet quality/alcohol intake.

ResultsVigorous PA, but not moderate PA, was significantly associated with higher gut microbiome alpha diversity (i.e., species richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity) as compared to sedentary PA. Compared to the sedentary group, the vigorous PA group showed a lower abundance of the bacterial species Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus ({beta} = -0.003, p = 0.042), even after extensive covariate adjustments and correction for multiple testing. Other species were initially also significantly associated with vigorous PA, but they disappeared after adjusting for covariates resulting in a loss of significance. Pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of two distinct metabolic pathways related to cellular energy recycling (Pyruvate fermentation to acetate and lactate II, {beta} = 8.11x10-05, p = 0.035) and purine metabolism (Purine ribonucleosides degradation, {beta} = 3.36x10-04, p = 0.039) in participants engaging in vigorous PA as compared to sedentary PA.

ConclusionsVigorous PA is associated with higher gut microbiome diversity and with specific alterations of microbial composition. The lower abundance of Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus within the vigorous PA group may be linked to increased gut permeability. The identified enrichment of microbial fermentation and purine metabolism in vigorous PA hints at a potential role of PA in affecting gut microbiome functionality and host health. The results of our modeling strategy highlight the importance of adjusting for dietary covariates to understand how PA may impact the gut microbiome independently from other influences.","NA","medrxiv",1737756499891

By combining these two forms of data, we aim to build causal graphs in which the directional associations of genes with a trait can be explained by their regulatory effects on biological programs or direct effects on the trait. As a proof-of-concept, we constructed a causal graph of the gene regulatory hierarchy that jointly controls three partially co-regulated blood traits.

However, their high cost and regulatory challenges hinder rapid and broad clinical translation. Here, we demonstrate that our lentivirally (LV) manufactured R110-CAR T cells, targeting a leukemia neoepitope, can also be engineered using non-viral Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposition with minimal-sized DNA vectors. Flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing was used to compare the two production modes using healthy donor and CLL patient-derived T cells and a CD19-CAR T cell control. SB products were shifted towards CD8+ subsets with expression of activation/co-inhibition markers (CD69, LAG-3, TIM-3) despite their naive-like phenotype and lack of antigenic challenge. The CAR binding moiety modulated these patterns with R110-CAR T cells showing more aberrant phenotypes. Moreover, SB engineering resulted in inflammatory signatures along with RIG-I-like and TOLL-like nucleotide sensing potentially resulting from the transfection procedure. Patient-derived products showed significantly fewer CAR-expressing cells, reduced proliferation clusters, and lower T cell diversity, particularly with SB manufacturing, pointing at potential challenges with this method when engineering CLL T cells. Together, our data suggest that the engineering mode may substantially influence T cell properties and that these are further modulated by the CAR binding moiety and the type of T cell donor.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Historical contingencies arise when elements from an organism's past leave lasting effects on the genome, altering the paths available for adaptation. We utilize strains isolated before and after widespread antibiotic use to study the impact of deep historical differences shaped by decades of evolution in varying antibiotic and host pressures. We evaluated these effects by comparing immediate and adaptive responses of two strains of Acinetobacter baumannii to the last-resort antibiotic, tigecycline (TGC). When grown in subinhibitory TGC, the two strains demonstrated divergent transcriptional responses suggesting that baseline transcript levels may dictate global responses to drug and their subsequent evolutionary trajectories. Experimental evolution in TGC revealed clear differences in population-genetic dynamics - with hard sweeps in populations founded by one strain and no mutations reaching fixation in the other strain. Transcriptomes of evolved populations no longer showed signatures of drug response, as was seen in the ancestors, suggesting that genetic adaptation may outweigh preexisting differences in transcriptional networks. Genetically, AMR was acquired through predictable mechanisms of increased efflux and drug target modification; however, the two strains adapted by mutations in different efflux regulators. Fitness tradeoffs of AMR were only observed in lineages evolved from the pre-antibiotic era strain, suggesting that decades of adaptation to antibiotics resulted in preexisting compensatory mechanisms in the more contemporary isolate, an important example of a beneficial effect of historical contingencies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Acinetobacter baumannii is a high priority pathogen often causing multidrug resistant nosocomial infections. Many healthcare systems experience clonal outbreaks of A. baumannii infections, yet treatment strategies are often strain-agnostic, ignoring the importance of strain differences. We show that historical differences between two strains, one isolated prior to widespread antibiotic use and the other following decades of selection to clinical conditions, dictate transcriptional patterns and response to a last-resort antibiotic and influence the genetic and phenotypic routes of resistance adaptation. While our study focuses on two reference strains of A. baumannii, these findings can be more broadly applicable to other pathogenic organisms in which a better understanding of the forces influencing resistance adaptation is essential for combating the antimicrobial resistance crisis.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Complete anaerobic SQ degradation via interspecies metabolite transfer to sulfonate-respiring bacteria produces hydrogen sulfide, which has dose- and context-dependent health effects. Here, we studied potential SQ degradation by the mammalian host and the impact of SQ supplementation on human and murine gut microbiota diversity and metabolism. 13CO2 breath tests with germ-free C57BL/6 mice gavaged with 13C-SQ were negative. Also, SQ was not degraded by human intestinal cells in vitro, indicating that SQ is not directly metabolized by mice and humans. Addition of increasing SQ concentrations to human fecal microcosms revealed dose-dependent responses of the microbiota and corroborated the relevance of Agathobacter rectalis and Bilophila wadsworthia in cooperative degradation of SQ to hydrogen sulfide via interspecies transfer of 2,3-dihydroxy-1-propanesulfonate (DHPS). Similar to the human gut microbiome, the genetic capacity for SQ or DHPS degradation is sparsely distributed among bacterial species in the mouse gut. Escherichia coli and Enterocloster clostridioformis were identified as primary SQ degraders in the mouse gut. SQ and DHPS supplementation experiments with conventional laboratory mice and their intestinal contents showed that SQ was incompletely catabolized to DHPS. Although some E. clostridioformis genomes encode an extended sulfoglycolytic pathway for both SQ and DHPS fermentation, SQ was only degraded to DHPS by a mouse-derived E. clostridioformis strain. Our findings suggest that SQ is solely a nutrient for the gut microbiota and not for mice and humans, emphasizing its potential as a prebiotic. SQ degradation by the mouse microbiota differs from the human gut microbiota by absence of DHPS degradation activity. Hence, the microbiota of conventional laboratory mice does not fully represent the SQ metabolism in humans, indicating the need for alternative model systems to assess the impact of SQ on human health. This study advances our understanding of how individual dietary compounds shape the microbial community structure and metabolism in the gut and thereby potentially influence host health.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

The acquisition of effector signatures in Treg cells is closely tied to the surrounding tissue-specific immune environment and typically occurs alongside Foxp3 expression. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic and functional consequences of Treg-mediated regulation in a Th2-driven disease setting. The application of both in vitro systems and in vivo disease models allowed us to mimic Th2-mediated environments.

We could demonstrate Th2-driven loss of Foxp3 expression in Treg cells in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a maintained Treg signature despite the loss of active Foxp3 expression. Functional characterization of Tregs both in vitro and in vivo uncovered a preserved suppressive capacity even in the absence of Foxp3.

Our findings unveil that, despite loss of Foxp3, a preserved Treg signature remains intact enabling the regulation of Th2-mediated diseases. The persistence of this regulatory transcriptome highlights the importance for developing Treg-cell therapy strategies in cancer and autoimmune diseases independent of Foxp3 expression.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Quantification of cytokine production with single-molecule RNA imaging demonstrates stimulus-specific patterns of response to restimulation at the single cell level. Differential licensing of inflammatory transcription factors is associated with encoding of specificities in chromatin. Trained cells show stronger responses to secondary stimuli that are more similar to the initial stimulus they experienced, suggesting a functional role for these stimulus-specific memories.

The selection of appropriate symbionts is paramount for the host to gain valuable nutrients and could be tailored to increase stress tolerance against anthropogenic induced changes in ocean environments, such as coral bleaching in response to ocean warming. Previous research suggests glycan-lectin interactions play a role in symbiont uptake; however, blockage of such interactions does not fully inhibit symbiosis establishment, suggesting other receptors are at play. Potential candidates include RGD peptide binding integrins, which are known to mediate phagocytosis of microbes in other systems. Here, we used a combination of cnidarian model systems and human cell lines to determine if integrins facilitate symbiont recognition and uptake. Integrins are highly expressed in the endodermal tissue of the host, where symbiosis takes place, and upon uptake into endodermal cells, symbionts altered the expression of integrins and downstream signaling molecules. Blockage of integrin binding sites with RGD competitor peptides reduced symbiont uptake, but had no effect on the general uptake of non-symbiotic algae, or uptake in a non-symbiotic cnidarian. In addition, inert beads coated with integrin RGD peptide ligands were phagocytosed more readily than beads coated with scrambled peptide. Finally, overexpression of RGD-binding integrins in human cells increased symbiont uptake and mutation of the active binding site abolished uptake. Our findings reveal RGD-binding integrins as key players in symbiosis establishment and shed light on the evolutionary functions of integrins as phagocytic receptors.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

This study characterizes BvlzGluc, a novel beta-glucanase produced by Bacillus velezensis CECT 8237, which has potent antifungal properties. BvlzGluc specifically targets the beta-glucan layer of Botrytis cinerea, causing significant structural malformations, impaired fungal development, and reduced virulence. These effects weaken the fungal cell wall, increasing its susceptibility to environmental stress and reducing its capacity to infect host plants. Notably, BvlzGluc is a noncanonical beta-glucanase belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 16 (GH16) but presents unique structural features that distinguish it from typical members of this family, suggesting potential reclassification. Its physicochemical stability and simple structural design increase its suitability for scalable production, positioning it as a promising candidate for agricultural and industrial applications requiring efficient beta-glucan degradation.

Moreover, the fastest rubiscos that we know of so far were found among the sparsely sampled prokaryotes. Could there be yet faster rubiscos among the uncharted regions of rubiscos phylogenetic diversity? Here, we perform a characterization of more than 250 rubiscos from a wide range of bacteria and archaea, thereby doubling the coverage of the diversity of this key enzyme. We assess the distribution of the carboxylation rates at saturating levels of CO2, and establish that rubisco is a relatively slow enzyme across the tree of life, never exceeding {approx}20 reactions per second. We show that relatively faster subclades share similar evolutionary contexts, involving micro-oxygenic environments or a CO2 concentrating mechanism.

Inner membranes of mitochondria are known to be permeable to potassium ions (K+), which enter the matrix either through ATP-sensitive channels (MitoKATP) or leakage across the bilayer driven by inner membrane potentials. Mitochondrial K+ influx is associated with increased osmotic pressure, promoting water influx and increasing matrix volume. Since BAT mitochondria have lower inner membrane potentials due to uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) activity, we hypothesized this could involve compensatory changes in MitoKATP activity, and thus tested MitoKATP involvement in brown adipocyte activities under basal and stimulated conditions. We find that cold exposure and adrenergic stimulation in mice modulate BAT MitoK levels, the channel portion of MitoKATP. Genetic ablation of the gene that codes for the pore-forming subunit of MitoKATP in human pre-adipocytes decreased cellular respiration and proliferation, compromising differentiation into mature adipocytes. In mouse cell lines, the absence of the protein limited cellular oxygen consumption in the precursor stage, but not in mature adipocytes. Interestingly, inhibition of MitoKATP in mature adipocytes increased adrenergic-stimulated oxygen consumption, indicating that shutdown of this pathway is important for full BAT thermogenesis. Similarly, MitoKATP inhibition increased oxygen consumption in BAT mitochondria isolated from mice treated with beta 3 adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243. Overall, our results suggest that the activity of MitoKATP regulates differentiation and metabolism of brown adipocytes, impacting on thermogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

We identified a predominant spinal input from a distinct subset of genetically-defined V0C cholinergic interneurons. We found that these interneurons receive phasic excitation from brainstem respiratory centers, augment phrenic output through M2 muscarinic receptors, and are highly activated under a hypercapnia challenge. Specifically silencing cholinergic interneuron neurotransmission impairs the breathing response to hypercapnia.

We additionally tested individuals born without hands to control for hand motor imagery when performing foot actions. We show that the primary sensorimotor cortices have hand and foot selectivity, consistent with a somatotopic organization. In contrast, higher-level motor areas within the tool-use network, such as the premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, and superior parietal cortices, showed a shared preference for tool-use independent of the executing body part and sensorimotor experience. Multivariate decoding of action-type in these areas generalized between controls' hand and foot and was successful in individuals born without hands. Finally, the temporal dynamics pattern in primary and association areas carried effector-specific and action-type information, respectively. Altogether, we show that the tool-use network in motor association areas represents higher-order action information beyond concrete motor parameters associated with specific effectors, and regardless of hand motor experience. This suggests that an action-type, effector-independent organization extends beyond ethological actions, supporting a hierarchical organization in the action domain. Further, it shows that functional organization in congenital handlessness is based on the hierarchical organization of the intact cortex.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

We find that frailty related metabolites are enriched for amino acid metabolism and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, include ergothioneine, tryptophan, and alpha-ketoglutarate, and present sex dimorphism. We identify B vitamin metabolism related flavin adenine dinucleotide and pyridoxate as female-specific frailty biomarkers, and lipid metabolism related sphingomyelins, glycerophosphoethanolamine and glycerophosphocholine as male-specific frailty biomarkers. These associations are confirmed in a validation cohort, with ergothioneine and perfluorooctanesulfonate identified as robust frailty biomarkers. In summary, our results identify sex-specific metabolite biomarkers of frailty in aging, and shed light on potential mechanisms involved in frailty.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Surface proteins belonging to the SLAM family are known to be crucial for stabilizing the immunological synapse and regulating antiviral responses during lymphotropic viral infections. In the context of HIV-1, there have been reports of SLAMF6 down-regulation in HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells; however, the significance of this modulation for CTL function remains unclear. In this investigation, we used CTL lines from People living with HIV (PLWH) to examine the impact of SLAMF6 blockade on three pivotal processes: (1) the formation of CD8+-CD4+ T-cell conjugates, (2) the establishment of the immunological synapse, and (3) the killing and cytokine production capacity of HIV-1-specific CTLs during HIV-1 infection. Our findings reveal that the inability to form CD8+-CD4+ T-cell conjugates following incubation with an anti-SLAMF6 blocking antibody is primarily attributable to a defect in actin ring formation at the immunological synapse. Furthermore, SLAMF6 blockade leads to a reduction in the killing efficiency of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells by HIV-1-specific CTLs, underscoring the critical role of SLAMF6 in cytolytic function. This study highlights the importance of SLAMF6 receptors in modulating cytotoxic antiviral responses, shedding light on potential avenues for manipulation and enhancement of this pathway in the context of HIV and other lymphotropic viral infections.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

In Arabidopsis thaliana, SL biosynthesis mutants exhibit increased shoot branching and early flowering, underscoring their roles in developmental regulation. Shoot branching inhibition in Arabidopsis depends on the methylation of carlactonoic acid (CLA), a key intermediate classified as a noncanonical SL, catalyzed by CLA methyltransferase (CLAMT). Canonical SLs primarily function as rhizosphere signals, with their biosynthesis in dicots mediated by CYP722C enzymes. It is hypothesized that Arabidopsis does not produce canonical SL because of the lack of the CYP722C genes in its genome. Instead, Arabidopsis possesses CYP722A1, a member of the previously uncharacterized CYP722A subfamily, distinct from the CYP722C subfamily.

This study demonstrates that Arabidopsis cyp722a1 mutants exhibit an earlier floral transition without excessive shoot branching. Biochemical analysis revealed that CYP722A1 catalyzes the hydroxylation of CLA to produce 16-hydroxy-CLA (16-HO-CLA), which is subsequently methylated by CLAMT to form 16-HO-MeCLA. 16-HO-CLA and 16-HO-MeCLA were detected in the wild-type; however, these compounds were absent in max1-4 mutant, which is deficient in CLA synthesis, and in cyp722a1 mutant. These findings indicate the presence of CYP722A1-dependent 16-hydroxylation activity of CLA in Arabidopsis. Moreover, they suggest that hydroxylated CLA specifically regulates floral transition, distinct from branching inhibition. By identifying CYP722A1 as a regulator of floral transition, which is the distinct role of the CYP722A subfamily, this work provides insights into the adaptation of SL structures for specialized biological functions in plant development.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

JAM generates antibodies de novo in both single-domain (VHH) and paired (scFv/mAb) antibody formats that achieve double-digit nanomolar affinities, strong early-stage developability profiles, and precise epitope targeting without experimental optimization. We demonstrate JAMs capabilities across multiple therapeutic contexts, including the first fully computationally designed antibodies to multipass membrane proteins - Claudin-4 and CXCR7. Against SARS-CoV-2, JAM-designed antibodies achieved sub-nanomolar pseudovirus neutralization potency, with early stage developability metrics achieving established clinical benchmarks. We show that increasing test-time computation by allowing JAM to iteratively introspect on its outputs substantially improves both binding success rates and affinities, representing the first evidence that test-time compute scaling may extend to physical protein design systems. The entire process from design to recombinant characterization requires <6 weeks, and multiple targets can be pursued in parallel with minimal additional experimental overhead. These results establish de novo antibody design as a practical approach for therapeutic discovery, offering paths to both improved efficiency in standard workflows and new opportunities for previously intractable targets.

To investigate this limitation in LLMs, we employed the classic color Stroop task that is widely regarded as the gold standard for testing executive control of attention. Our results revealed a typical conflict effect of better performance in terms of accuracy in the congruent condition (e.g., naming the ink color of the word RED) compared to incongruent condition (e.g., naming the ink color of the word RED), which is similar to human performance, in short sequences. However, as sequence length increased, the performance degraded toward chance levels on the incongruent trials despite maintaining excellent performance on congruent trials and near-perfect word reading ability. These findings demonstrate that while transformer attention mechanisms can achieve human-comparable performance in smaller contexts, they are fundamentally limited in their capacity for conflict resolution across extended contexts. This study suggests that incorporating executive control mechanisms akin to those in biological attention could be crucial for achieving more general reasoning and reliable performance toward artificial general intelligence.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

One key strategy involves enzymatic oxidation of N-terminal cysteine residues coupled with proteolysis through the Cys-Arg/N-degron pathway. Despite the presence of hundreds of proteins with N-terminal cysteine in humans, only two have been identified as substrates of this pathway, and its substrate selectivity remains unclear. Moreover, the biological role of this pathway in the cellular response to hypoxia is not well defined. By employing a systematic proteomics approach, we discovered that nearly half of the cysteine-commencing proteome could be regulated by the Cys-Arg/N-degron pathway. Mutagenesis experiments revealed the specificty of Cys-Arg/N-degron pathway showing a preference for hydrophobic and positively charged residues following cysteine. Furthermore, we uncovered substrates that are regulated by this pathway during hypoxia, including IP6K1. The loss of IP6K1 impaired glucose uptake, glycolytic ATP production, and overall mitochondrial morphology and function. As a result, IP6K1-deficient cells exhibited disrupted metabolic adaptation under hypoxic conditions and decreased survival under stress. These findings underscore the importance of the Cys-Arg/N-degron pathway in regulating metabolic responses and highlight its potential importance in hypoxia-related disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Studies seeking to understand the underlying mechanisms have mostly focused on neurogenetic comparisons with extant species. Here we ask if developmental tempo differences may have also existed between us and our extinct relatives for whom genomes are available. To do so, we nominate a sapiens-specific derived allele, virtually fixed in contemporary populations, which resides in an enhancer region active during early cortical development. The single nucleotide variant is predicted to significantly affect CHD2 expression, a chromatin remodeler known to play an important role in neural development and for which haploinsufficiency is associated with epilepsy and autism. We leverage patient induced pluripotent stem lines (iPSC) and engineered iPSCs in which we reintroduced the ancestral allele and generated heterozygous loss-of-function mutations. We reveal that CHD2 deficiency impairs lysosomal acidification and autophagosome flux. In contrast, ancestralized lines, which we find express higher levels of CHD2, exhibit enhanced lysosomal function and consequently accelerated autophagosome flux, consistent with our observations in chimpanzee and bonobo lines. This set of findings demonstrates that CHD2 dosage critically regulates the autolysosomal pathway. Through deep phenotyping of cortical organoid and neuron cultures, we show that the CHD2-modulated autolysosomal pathway impacts the timing of developmental programs, acquisition of neuronal functional properties and circuit maturation. Finally, we validate an estrogen-dependent rewiring of CHD2 regulation in the evolution of our lineage, providing a mechanistic understanding of how a single nucleotide variant in a regulatory region contributed to the modern pace of neuronal development and maturation. Together, our findings establish CHD2 as a regulator in setting neurodevelopmental tempo via the autolysosomal pathway.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Here, we first identified locomotor activity as a trait transmissible through the gut microbiome in mice. We then performed a selection experiment, where we serially transferred microbiomes from low-activity mice to independently bred germ-free mice. Over four transfer rounds, microbiome transfer significantly reduced locomotor activity. Reduced locomotion was associated with increased Lactobacilli and their metabolite indolelactate. In a test of causality, independent administration to the mouse gut of Lactobacillus johnsonii or indolelactate reduced locomotion. These findings demonstrate that selection and transmission of microbes can modulate host traits independently of selection on the mammalian genome.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers of the colon/rectum, pancreas, liver/bile duct, and stomach contributed to more than a quarter of cancer deaths in the US, calling for focused advocacy. Known disparities for Black non-Hispanic Americans were verified in cancers of the colon/rectum, and pancreas. However, mortality data for 'More than one race' non-Hispanic group or non-White Hispanic group appeared unreliable, suggesting that under-reporting is also a sign of health disparity. Age-specific death rates (ASDRs) were calculated to view health disparities in various age groups. Cancers of the colon/rectum, liver, and stomach cause significant mortality in the under-50 population. And minority groups are more likely to die from cancers in the liver or the stomach compared to the White non-Hispanics. Liver cancer crude death rate was lower than expect in Asian Non-Hipanics when compared with the high mortalities of IARC's GLOBOCAN estimates for Asian countries. Census data were then used to calculate Asian sub-groups' ASDRs. Significantly higher risks were seen in gastric cancer for Korean Americans and liver cancer for Vietnamese Americans. The Asian Indian group had the lowest death rates across several GI cancers, even in gallbladder cancer.

Anopheles funestus is the dominant malaria vector in Tanzania and most parts of East and Southern Africa. To better understand its population genomic structure in Tanzania, we sequenced the genomes of 334 individual An. funestus mosquitoes from 11 administrative regions. We found two genetically differentiated populations; one inland and at high altitude (found in Katavi, Kagera, Kigoma, and Mwanza) and a second coastal, at low altitude (found in Pwani, Morogoro, Tanga, Ruvuma, Mtwara, Dodoma, and Lindi), with differences in genetic diversity and inbreeding. We found asynchronous selective sweeps, associated with insecticide resistance phenotypes, at the Cyp9k1 gene, and Cyp6p gene cluster, with distinct copy number-variant profiles between the coastal and inland populations. These results suggest that inland and coastal An. funestus populations have divergent histories, with the arid, central region of Tanzania, which also contains the Rift Valley being a possible barrier to gene flow. Such population disconnectedness should be considered for insecticide deployment, resistance management, and the rollout of novel genetic- based vector control approaches. These findings provide the most detailed study of Tanzanian An. funestus population structure and resistance genetics to date.

Analysis of whole genome next generation sequencing (NGS) data is a critical next step in improving our understanding of Cryptosporidium epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and genetic diversity. However, effective analysis of NGS data in a public health context necessitates the development of robust, validated bioinformatics tools. Here, we present Parapipe, a modular ISO accreditable bioinformatics pipeline designed for high-throughput processing and analysis of Cryptosporidium NGS datasets. Built using Nextflow DSL2 and containerized with Singularity, Parapipe is portable, scalable, and capable of end-to-end analyses, including quality control, variant calling, multiplicity of infection (MOI) investigations and phylogenomic clustering analysis.

Using both simulated and real-world datasets, we demonstrate Parapipes ability to resolve genetic heterogeneity, identify mixed infections, and generate high-resolution phylogenomic insights. Here, we use it to carry out a comparison between whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (wgSNP) typing and the conventionally used gp60 molecular typing scheme. Compared to existing pipelines, Parapipe uniquely integrates MOI analysis, enabling the differentiation of mixed infections and supporting epidemiological investigations. Parapipes design facilitates integration with geographic, demographic, epidemiological and environmental data, enhancing its utility for tracking transmission pathways and outbreak sources.

Parapipe represents a significant advance in utilising genomics for public health surveillance of Cryptosporidium, offering a streamlined and reproducible framework for analysis with potential application to other pathogenic protozoa. By automating complex workflows and enabling detailed genomic characterization, Parapipe provides a valuable tool for public health agencies and researchers, supporting efforts to mitigate the global burden of cryptosporidiosis.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

We assessed baseline associations between Pb and Cd concentrations in dried blood spots with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) among women in the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial. We analyzed data from three of the four HAPIN randomized controlled trial sites (Guatemala, Peru, and Rwanda), focusing on women aged 40 to 79 years living in households reliant on biomass cooking. Dried blood spots were collected, processed, and analyzed for Pb and Cd exposure; SBP and DBP were measured following international guidelines. Demographic, socioeconomic, and dietary variables were collected via standardized questionnaires administered by local field staff. Statistical analyses included multivariable linear regression to examine associations between Pb and Cd, separately, and BP, adjusting for covariates informed by a Directed Acyclic Graph. Additional analyses assessed effect modification by age and research site. There was regional variation in BP levels among women, with median SBP and DBP values higher in Rwanda (116.3 mmHg, 73.0 mmHg) and Guatemala (113.3 mmHg, 68.3 mmHg) compared to Peru (106.0 mmHg, 63.3 mmHg). Pb exposure showed positive associations with both SBP and DBP. For each log-unit increase in Pb concentration, we observed increases of 2.36 mmHg SBP (95% CI 0.51, 4.20) and 1.42 mmHg DBP (95% CI 0.16, 2.67). Cd was not associated with SBP or DBP in this analysis. Pb exposure may be an important risk factor for increased SBP and DBP, markers of cardiovascular disease risk.","NA","medrxiv",1737756499891

Among cellular membranes, the mitochondrial outer membrane (OMM) is an important interface for many cellular functions, but how lipid saturation impacts OMM function remains unclear. Here, we show that increased intracellular unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) remodel the OMM by promoting the formation of multilamellar mitochondrial-derived compartments (MDCs), which sequester proteins and lipids from the OMM. These effects depend on the incorporation of UFAs into membrane phospholipids, suggesting that changes in membrane bilayer composition mediate this process. Furthermore, elevated UFAs impair the assembly of the OMM protein translocase (TOM) complex, with unassembled TOM components captured into MDCs. Collectively, these findings suggest that alterations in phospholipid saturation may destabilize OMM protein complexes and trigger an adaptive response to sequester excess membrane proteins through MDC formation.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

This weight cycling has been demonstrated, in humans and animal models, to increase cardiometabolic disease and disrupt glucose homeostasis. Obesity itself -- and to an even greater extent weight regain -- causes adipose tissue inflammation, resulting in metabolic dysfunction. Studies show that even after weight loss, increased numbers of lipid associated macrophages and memory T cells persist in adipose tissue and become more inflammatory upon weight regain. These findings suggest that the immune system retains a ""memory"" of obesity, which may contribute to the elevated inflammation and metabolic dysfunction associated with weight cycling. Here, we show that blocking the CD70-CD27 axis, critical for formation of immunological memory, decreases the number of memory T cells and reduces T cell clonality within adipose tissue after weight loss and weight cycling. Furthermore, while mice with impaired ability to create obesogenic immune memory have similar metabolic responses as wildtype mice to stable obesity, they are protected from the worsened glucose tolerance associated with weight cycling. Our data are the first to target metabolic consequences of weight cycling through an immunomodulatory mechanism. Thus, we propose a new avenue of therapeutic intervention by which targeting memory T cells can be leveraged to minimize the adverse consequences of weight cycling. These findings are particularly timely given the increasing use of efficacious weight loss drugs, which will likely lead to more instances of human weight cycling.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Normative models are typically limited to coarse spatial scales due to computational constraints, limiting their spatial specificity. They additionally depend on fixed regions from fixed parcellation atlases, restricting their adaptability to alternative parcellation schemes. To overcome these key limitations, we propose spectral normative modeling (SNM), which leverages brain eigenmodes for efficient spatial reconstruction to generate normative ranges for arbitrary new regions of interest. Benchmarking against conventional counterparts, SNM achieves a 98.3% speedup in computing accurate normative ranges across spatial scales, from millimeters to the whole brain. We demonstrate its utility by elucidating high-resolution individual cortical atrophy patterns and characterizing the heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration in Alzheimers disease. SNM lays the groundwork for a new generation of spatially precise brain charts, offering substantial potential to drive advances in individualized precision medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1737756499891

Although appreciated for centuries, the identity of position-dependent cues and how they control tissue growth are not resolved. Here, we quantify Erk signaling events in whole populations of osteoblasts during zebrafish fin regeneration. We find that osteoblast Erk activity is dependent on Fgf receptor signaling and organized into millimeter-long gradients that extend from the distal tip to the amputation site. Erk activity scales with the amount of tissue amputated, predicts the likelihood of osteoblast cycling, and predicts the size of regenerated skeletal structures. Mathematical modeling suggests gradients are established by the transient deposition of long-lived ligands that are transported by tissue growth. This concept is supported by the observed scaling of expression of the essential epidermal ligand fgf20a with extents of amputation. Our work provides evidence that localized, scaled expression of pro-regenerative ligands instructs long-range signaling and cycling to control skeletal size in regenerating appendages.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

We present an open-source platform for behavioral training of head-fixed mice that combines a stationary or retractable forelimb-based joystick, sound-presentation system, capacitive lick sensor, and water reward dispenser. The setup allows for the creation of multiple behavioral paradigms, two of which are highlighted here: a two-alternative forced-choice auditory-motor discrimination paradigm, and a two-armed bandit value-based decision-making task. In the auditory-motor paradigm, mice learn to report high or low frequency tones by pushing or pulling the joystick. In the value-based paradigm, mice learn to push or pull the joystick based on the history of rewarded trials. In addition to reporting categorical choices, this setup provides a rich dataset of motor parameters that reflect components of the underlying learning and decision processes in both of these tasks. These kinematic parameters (including joystick speed and displacement, Frechet similarity of trajectories, tortuosity, angular standard deviation, and movement vigor) provide key additional insights into the motor execution of choices that are not as readily assessed in other paradigms. The systems flexibility of task design, joystick readout, and ease of construction represent an advance compared to currently available manipulandum tasks in mice.

The role of prothrombotic metabolites in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy remains elusive. Leveraging K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, we observed higher levels of the tryptophan metabolite, kynurenine, compared to controls. SARS-CoV-2 infected mice showed a significant upregulation of enzymes controlling Kynurenine biogenesis, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase levels in kidneys and liver, respectively, as well as changes in the enzymes involved in kynurenine catabolism, including kynurenine monooxygenase and kynurinase. Consistent with the agonistic role of these metabolites in Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) signaling, AHR activation and its downstream mediator, tissue factor (TF), a highly potent procoagulant factor, was observed in endothelial cells (ECs) of lungs and kidneys of infected mice. These findings were validated in humans, where compared to controls, sera of COVID-19 patients showed increased levels of Kynurenine, kynurenic acid, anthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid. Activation of the AHR-TF axis was noted in the kidneys and lungs of COVID-19 patients, and COVID-19 sera showed higher IDO-1 activity than controls. Levels of Kyn in COVID-19 patients correlated strongly with the TF-inducing activity of COVID-19 sera on ECs. A specific IDO-1 inhibitor or AHR inhibitor separately or in combination suppressed COVID-19 sera-induced TF activity in ECs. Together, we identified IDO-1 as upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in augmented Kyn and its prothrombotic catabolites, thereby suggesting the Kyn-AHR-TF axis as possibly a new diagnostic and/or therapeutic target.

For SARS-CoV-2, much of the population has been imprinted by a viral spike from an early strain, either through vaccination or infection during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence of this imprinting, infection with more recent SARS-CoV-2 strains primarily boosts cross-reactive antibodies elicited by the imprinting strain. Here we compare the neutralizing antibody specificities of imprinted individuals versus infants infected with a recent strain. Specifically, we use pseudovirus-based deep mutational scanning to measure how spike mutations affect neutralization by the serum antibodies of adults and children imprinted by the original vaccine versus infants with a primary infection by a XBB* variant. While the serum neutralizing activity of the imprinted individuals primarily targets the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), serum neutralizing activity of infants only infected with XBB* mostly targets the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). In these infants, secondary exposure to the XBB* spike via vaccination shifts more of the neutralizing activity towards the RBD, although the specific RBD sites targeted are different than for imprinted adults. The dramatic differences in neutralization specificities among individuals with different exposure histories likely impact SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Here, we provide evidence that in Xenopus laevis, H3K4 methylation provides an epigenetic memory of active chromatin states. We show that this is required for faithful zygotic genome activation and successful embryonic development. Chromatin configurations of promoters displaying high H3K4me3 intensity and breadth, alongside DNA hypomethylation and increased GC content, are propagated from the gametes to the embryo across multiple cell divisions and a transcriptionally quiescent phase in early development. We show that this transmission of H3K4 methylation is essential for precise zygotic genome activation and expression of key pioneer ZGA transcription factors Pou5f3.2 and Sox3.

In this study, we employ an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approach to systematically analyze potential interactions between Escherichia coli (E. coli) proteins and fifteen previously uncharacterized Cas12 proteins, generating 65,715 predicted binary complex structures. Our findings reveal a previously unknown dimension of CRISPR immunity, demonstrating that the hosts ubiquitous redox enzyme, thioredoxin (TrxA), significantly enhances the DNA cleavage efficiency of a phage-encoded, miniature Cas12 nuclease (termed  Cas12 hacker). This synergistic relationship represents a strategic inversion, where a bacteriophage hijacks a host protein to reinforce its own genome degradation machinery, possibly targeting rival nucleic acids. Through comprehensive biochemical characterizations, structural analyses of the Cas12 hacker-TrxA-sgRNA-dsDNA quaternary complex, and in vivo bacterial defense assays, we uncover an intricate association in which thioredoxin binds to and activates the Cas12 hacker nuclease, intensifying its DNA cleavage capacity and bolstering CRISPR immunity.

Yet, to date, no predictive theory incorporates the feedback between ecology and evolution while accounting for the evolution of genetic variance under selection, mutation, dispersal, and genetic drift. This study outlines a comprehensive theory showing that under joint evolutionary and population dynamics, the limits of adaptation are fundamentally determined by the three measurable parameters: i) the effective environmental gradient, ii) the effective rate of temporal change, and iii) the neighbourhood size, which represents the local population size accessible via dispersal. Dispersal across heterogeneous environments supports higher local genetic variance, facilitating adaptation to a faster temporal change. However, local diversity is depleted by genetic drift, which is measured by the inverse of neighbourhood size. Extending earlier predictions in stable environments, I use scaling arguments to derive a generalized expansion threshold - a tipping point where adaptation fails and the species range can no longer expand. Beyond this threshold, species ranges also tend to fragment, particularly when temporal change incurs a high fitness cost. The onset of fragmentation is rapid and associated with a loss of genetic variance. The theory not only identifies new phenomena but also establishes a fundamental relationship between these core measurable parameters. It provides a predictive framework for understanding species range and niche limits while advancing the theoretical foundations for assessing population resilience of spatially structured populations under unprecedented environmental change.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Contrary to expectations, our findings revealed that individuals trained on tasks with similar low-dimensional structures performed worse than those trained on dissimilar tasks. Magnetoencephalography revealed correlated neural representations in the samestructure group and anticorrelated ones in the different-structure group. Crucially, practice reduced this performance gap and shifted the neural representations of the tasks in the samestructure group towards anticorrelation, like those in the different-structure group. A neural network model trained on similar tasks replicated these findings: tasks with similar structures require more iterations to orthogonalize their representations. These results highlight a complex interplay between task similarity, neural dynamics, and behavior, challenging traditional assumptions about learning and generalization.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Using cryo-electron tomography and molecular dynamics simulations we elucidated the structure of phase separated chromatin condensates across scales, from individual amino acids to network architecture. We found that internucleosomal DNA linker length controls nucleosome arrangement and histone tail interactions, shaping the structure of individual chromatin molecules both within and outside condensates. This structural modulation determines the balance between intra- and intermolecular interactions, which in turn governs the molecular network, thermodynamic stability, and material properties of chromatin condensates.

Moreover, diverging neuronal population trajectory dynamics and enhanced antagonistic sub-ensemble representation of threat-related behaviors, and enhanced threat-related location representation, were also observed. Lastly, cannabinoid administration increased the proportion of SOM neurons exhibiting multidimensional representation of threat-related behaviors and behavior-location conjunction. While cannabinoid receptor activation ex vivo suppressed excitatory inputs to SOM neurons, our data suggest preferential suppression of local GABA release subserves cannabinoid activation of CeA SOM neurons.

The recent successful clinical trial of VX-548, a NaV1.8-selective inhibitor, has spurred much interest in expanding the arsenal of subtype-selective voltage-gated sodium channel therapeutics. Toward that end, we sought to determine whether NaVs are amenable to targeted protein degradation with small molecule degraders, namely proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular glues. Here, we report that degron-tagged NaVs are potently and rapidly degraded by small molecule degraders harnessing the E3 ubiquitin ligases cereblon (CRBN) and Von Hippel Lindau (VHL). Using LC/MS analysis, we demonstrate that PROTAC-mediated proximity between NaV1.8 and CRBN results in ubiquitination on the 2nd intracellular loop, pointing toward a potential mechanism of action and demonstrating the ability of CRBN to recognize a VGSC as a neosubstrate. Our foundational findings are an important first step toward realizing the immense potential of NaV-targeting degrader analgesics to combat chronic pain.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Positive delta in adults is normally interpreted as implying that an individual is aging (or has aged) faster than the population norm, an indicator of unhealthy aging. Unfortunately, from cross-sectional (single timepoint) imaging data, it is impossible to know whether a single individuals positive delta reflects a state of faster ongoing aging, or an unvarying trait (in other words, a ""historical baseline effect"" in the context of the population being studied). However, for a cross-sectional dataset comprising many individuals, one could attempt to disambiguate the overall relative contributions of varying aging rates vs. fixed baseline effects. We present a method for doing this, and show that for the most common approaches, which estimate a single delta per subject, baseline effects are likely to dominate. If instead one estimates multiple biologically distinct modes of brain aging, we find that some modes do reflect aging rates varying strongly across subjects. We demonstrate this, and verify our modelling, using longitudinal (two timepoint) data from 4,400 participants in UK Biobank. In addition, whereas previous work found incompatibility between cross-sectional and longitudinal brain aging, we show that careful data processing does show consistency between cross-sectional and longitudinal results.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Stomata serve as gatekeepers on plant leaves, regulating both CO2 capture for photosynthesis and the concomitant release of water. At higher CO2 concentrations or higher vapour pressure deficit (VPD), stomatal pores narrow, reducing stomatal conductance to water vapour (gsw) and transpiration (E)2-6. Increasing temperatures and/or nitrogen fertilisation promote an opposite stomatal response, enhancing gsw and E7,8. With atmospheric CO2 concentration, temperature and VPD predicted to rise throughout this century1, it is unclear how crops will modify stomatal gaseous exchanges, particularly under differing N-fertilisation regimes. Here, we show in wheat (Triticum aestivum), that elevated CO2 does not reduce gsw or E during heatwaves when VPD is high, instead plant water usage increases. High-VPD heatwave events also impact stomatal responsiveness to N-fertiliser application, prompting significantly higher gas exchange contributions from abaxial leaf surfaces, irrespective of CO2 growth conditions. Dynamic stomatal responsiveness to light and high CO2 are also attenuated during heatwaves in a CO2-independent manner. Taken together, our data suggests that future wheat crops will use significantly more water during heatwaves than might be expected, which has substantial implications for future global food security.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Traditionally linked to genomic imprinting, these effects are believed to have evolved from parental conflict over resource allocation to offspring, which results in opposing parental genetic influences. Despite their potential importance, POEs remain heavily understudied in complex traits, largely due to the lack of parental genomes.

Here, we present a multi-step approach to infer the parent-of-origin of alleles without parental genomes, leveraging inter-chromosomal phasing, mitochondrial and chromosome X data, and sibling-based crossover inference. Applied to the UK Biobank (discovery cohort) and Estonian Biobank (replication cohort), this scalable approach enabled parent-of-origin inference for up to 221,062 individuals, representing the largest dataset of its kind.

GWAS scans in the UK Biobank for more than 60 complex traits and over 2,400 protein levels contrasting maternal and paternal effects identified over 30 novel POEs and confirmed more than 50% of testable known associations. Notably, approximately half of our POEs exhibited a bi-polar pattern, where maternal and paternal alleles exert conflicting effects. These effects were particularly prevalent for traits related to growth (e.g., IGF-1, height, fat-free mass) and metabolism (e.g., type 2 diabetes, triglycerides, glucose). Replication in the Estonian Biobank and in 45,402 offspring from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study validated over 75% of testable associations.

Overall, our findings shed new light on the influence of POEs on diverse complex traits and align with the parental conflict hypothesis, providing compelling evidence for this understudied evolutionary phenomenon.","NA","medrxiv",1737756499891

The NLRP3 inflammasome complex is an innate immune mechanism that responds to mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS), however its activity relative to mitochondrial dysfunction in muscle requires exploration. The purpose of this study was to characterize immune signaling and mitochondrial function in muscle during aging, endurance training, and disuse induced by denervation. Denervation led to decreases in muscle mass, mitochondrial content, and impaired respiration. Protein analyses revealed increases in NF-{kappa}B p65 and downstream inflammatory markers including NLRP3, caspase-1, GSDMD-N, STING and IL-1{beta}, along with pro-apoptotic BAX and AIF. When assessing potential DAMPS, denervation led to increased ROS production but no changes in cytosolic mtDNA levels, relative to total mtDNA. Since we hypothesized that inflammasome activation would be increased with age, we studied young (6-8 months) and aged (21-22 months) mice that remained sedentary or underwent a 6-week voluntary running protocol. Aging resulted in marked increases in the expression of multiple pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic proteins. Remarkably, training uniformly attenuated age-related increases in BAX, NLRP3, caspase-1, STING, and GSDMD protein expression, and reduced the elevated level of cytosolic mtDNA evident in aged muscle. Training adaptations were evident also in the aged animals by the preservation of muscle mass and improvements in oxygen consumption and endurance performance and were achieved despite a lower training distance than in young animals. Our results strongly implicate endurance training as a promising therapeutic for combatting disuse and age-related inflammation in skeletal muscle.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Of particular concern is ice-rich, organic-rich, syngenetic ""yedoma"" type permafrost. The lability of organic carbon in permafrost post-thaw largely depends on the rate at which microorganisms resuscitate and proliferate after thousands of years in below-freezing, dark, anaerobic conditions. However, the resuscitation and growth rates of microorganisms in deep permafrost are unknown. To quantify these rates, we conducted lipid stable isotope probing (lipid-SIP) on permafrost cores collected from four locations within the Permafrost Tunnel near Fairbanks, Alaska. We compare rates of microbial growth, marker gene sequences, and greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4) emissions across cores held anaerobically at ambient and elevated temperatures. In deep, ancient permafrost, microbial biomass turnover is exceedingly slow, often undetectable, within the first month following thaw. Our results indicate microbial growth in response to anaerobic thaw has a notable lag period, where only 0.001 - 0.01% of cells turn over per day. This suggests a  slow reawakening that could provide some buffer between anomalous warmth and C degradation if permafrost refreezes seasonally. However, within six months, microbial communities undergo dramatic restructuring and succession, producing communities that are distinct from both the emplaced ancient and overlying surface communities. These results have critical implications for predictions of microbial biogeochemical contributions in a warming arctic, especially as thaw proceeds into deeper and more ancient permafrost horizons.

Plain Language SummaryPermafrost, earth material like soil, rock, or ice continually frozen for more than two years, contains more organic carbon than is currently in the atmosphere as CO2. As the Arctic warms and permafrost thaws, ancient microbes can reactivate, allowing the degradation of organic carbon that has accumulated in permafrost over millenia, resulting in the release of greenhouse gases. In this work, we measured the rates at which permafrost microorganisms resuscitate during thaw and related these growth rates to changes in microbial community composition and greenhouse gas emissions.

Key PointsO_LIMicrobial growth is extremely slow within the first 30 days of thaw. Temperature may drive which taxa are active, but not growth rates.
C_LIO_LISubsurface microbes show a preference for glycolipids over phospholipids, suggesting a possible cryotolerance adaptation.
C_LIO_LIAncient, entrapped gases may be the primary source of emissions in early thaw stages.

Previously, we showed that pathogenic LRRK2 mutations inhibit primary cilia formation in rare interneurons and astrocytes of the mouse and human dorsal striatum. This blocks Hedgehog signaling and reduces synthesis of neuroprotective GDNF and NRTN, which support neurons vulnerable in PD. Here we show that GBA1 mutations also impair Hedgehog signaling through a distinct mechanism. Loss of GBA1 activity decreases accessible cholesterol in primary cilia of cultured cells, thereby disrupting Hedgehog signaling. In the mouse striatum, Gba1 mutations result in reduced Hedgehog-induced Gdnf RNA expression in cholinergic interneurons, despite having no detectable impact on cilia formation. Also, both Lrrk2 and Gba1 mutations suppress Hedgehog-induced Bdnf expression in striatal astrocytes. These findings underscore the role of Hedgehog signaling in the nigrostriatal circuit and reveal a convergent mechanism by which distinct mutations may contribute to PD pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1737756499891

Here, we profile the nucleolar proteome and the chromatin landscape of stalled replication sites upon rDNA damage to characterize the early steps of nucleolar DNA damage response (nDDR). We observed early dynamics in nucleolar-nucleoplasmic proteome localization and identified nucleolar replication stress signatures involving chromatin remodeling networks, transcription-replication conflicts and DNA repair. Our findings define localized surveillance mechanisms that activate the nDDR. Further, we identified that upon rDNA damage, nucleolar RNA Polymerase (Pol) II binds to intergenic rDNA sequences and generates R-loops (DNA:RNA hybrid structures) that are essential for recruiting nDDR factors. Using a boutique CRISPR-Cas9 synthetic lethal screen of DNA repair factors with inhibitors of RNA Pol I transcription, we identified an unexpected protective role for the DNA translocase RAD54L in nDDR. Loss of Rad54L increases nucleolar R-loops and rDNA damage leading to defects in nucleolar structure and enhanced sensitivity to PARP and RNA Pol I inhibitors. Altogether, our study uncovers localized surveillance networks within the nucleolus that respond to rDNA damage.

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1737756499891
