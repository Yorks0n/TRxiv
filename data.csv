Still, the mechanisms for these headache types are unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess levels of amyloid related biomarkers in patients with persistent headache after COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

MethodsIn this prospective observational cohort, patients with severe headache as the dominating symptom after COVID-19 disease (n=29) and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (n=31), had neurological assessments with reassessments after 6 months. Plasma levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), pregnancy zone protein (PZP), cathepsin L1 (CTSL) and serum Amyloid A (SAA1) were measured by ELISA in relation to levels in healthy controls (n=16).

ResultsWe found a strong and persistent upregulation of APP in patients with headache after COVID-19 as compared to the two other groups. At both inclusion and after 6 months APP levels were also increased in those with accompanying cognitive symptoms. In contrast, plasma levels of PZP were elevated in both headache groups as compared to healthy controls at inclusion and after 6 months follow-up, but with no relation to cognitive symptoms. CTSL was only elevated in those with COVID-19 associated headache at baseline, whereas SAA1 showed levels comparable in all groups.

ConclusionAltered plasma levels of soluble markers potentially reflecting changes in amyloid processing was found in patients with persistent headache after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and particular in those with persistent headache after COVID-19 disease where we also found some association with cognitive symptoms.

NCT05235776

What is already known on this topicNew onset persistent headache occurs in a subset of individuals after COVID-19 and to some extent after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms are unknown.

What this study addsThere was high disability with only modest improvement after 6-month follow-up.

Altered plasma levels of soluble markers that potentially could reflect changes in amyloid processing was found in patients with persistent headache after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and particular in those with persistent headache after COVID-19 disease with association to cognitive symptoms.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyOur data point to plausible mechanism of amyloid processing and neuroinflammation in relation to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","NA","medrxiv",1729894129709

This review summarises reported contact- tracing data and evaluates the secondary attack rates (SAR) and factors associated with SARS- CoV-2 transmission in aircraft, to provide insight for future decision making in the context of future respiratory pandemics.

MethodsThis scoping literature review assessed studies published between December 2020 to November 2023 in Ovid Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. The inclusion criteria were based on the PCC framework (P-Population, C-Concept, C-Context). The study population was restricted to passengers and crew (population) to assess transmission (concept) in an aircraft setting (context).

ResultsThirty-one studies which assess SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 521 domestic and international flights were included in this systematic review. The SAR reported in the studies with an identified index case ranged from 0% to 16%. Significant variation in the reporting across studies was noted. Overall, the studies reported that using face masks or respirators by passengers and crew members during flight seemed to be a possible strategy for mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission while sitting within close proximity to index cases ([&le;]2 seats in every direction) was associated with a higher SAR.

ConclusionsOur results are consistent with sporadic clusters happening onboard aircraft. Close proximity to COVID-19 cases within the aircraft was associated with a higher SAR. Our findings further underscore the need for a systematic approach to examining and reporting SARS-CoV-2 transmission onboard aircraft. This evidence may assist policymakers and transportation authorities in the development of emergency preparedness measures and travel guidance during the post-pandemic COVID-19 era.","NA","medrxiv",1729894129709

In this study we describe a bacterial immune system comprising both a caspase-like protease and a TIR-domain protein. We found that the TIR protein, once it recognizes phage invasion, produces the previously unknown immune signaling molecule ADP-cyclo[N7:1'']-ribose (N7-cADPR). This molecule specifically activates the bacterial caspase-like protease which then indiscriminately degrades cellular proteins to halt phage replication. The TIR-caspase defense system, which we denote as type IV Thoeris, is abundant in bacteria and efficiently protects against phage propagation. Our study highlights the diversity of TIR-produced immune signaling molecules and demonstrates that cell death regulated by proteases of the caspase family is an ancient mechanism of innate immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129709

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment.

Here, we develop an experimentally-constrained biophysical network model of neocortical circuit motifs, focusing on layers 2-3 of the primary visual cortex (V1). We investigate the role of four major cortical interneuron classes in a competitive-cooperative computational primitive and validate these circuit motifs implemented soft winner-take-all (sWTA) computation for gain modulation, signal restoration, and context-dependent multistability. Using a novel parameter mapping technique, we configured IBMs TrueNorth (TN) chip to implement sWTA computations, mirroring biological neural dynamics. Retrospectively, we observed a strong correspondence between the biophysical model and the TN hardware parameters, particularly in the roles of four key inhibitory neuron classes: Parvalbumin (feedforward inhibition), Somatostatin (feedback inhibition), VIP (disinhibition), and LAMP5 (gain normalization). Moreover, the sparse coupling of this sWTA motif was also able to simulate a two-state neural state machine on the TN chip, replicating working memory dynamics essential for cognitive tasks. Additionally, integrating the sWTA computation as a preprocessing layer in the Vision Transformer (ViT) enhanced its performance on the MNIST digit classification task, demonstrating improved generalization to previously unseen data and suggesting a mechanism akin to zero-shot learning. Our approach provides a framework for translating brain-inspired computations to neuromorphic hardware, with potential applications on platforms like Intels Loihi2 and IBMs Northpole. By integrating biophysically accurate models with neuromorphic hardware and advanced machine learning techniques, we offer a comprehensive roadmap for embedding neural computation into NeuroAI systems.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129709

Male mosquitoes, on the other hand, are thought to rely exclusively on plant sugars for their energetic needs; indeed, this dichotomy is one of the central tenets of medical entomology. Here, we show that male Culex tarsalis and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes will readily take blood from a membrane feeder when reared under dehydration conditions with no toxic effects. Mosquitoes with impaired humidity detection do not increase their bloodfeeding rates when dehydrated compared to wild-type controls. While conventionally reared males ignore a human host, dehydrated males are attracted to and attempt to probe, with some success, although they cannot access host capillaries. However, they will take blood from a vertebrate host wound. When fed a blood meal containing West Nile virus, male mosquitoes can become infected with and orally transmit the pathogen at rates and titers equivalent to females. These data suggest that under some circumstances male mosquitoes may be able to probe and/or ingest blood and transmit pathogens to vertebrate hosts, and that their role in maintaining pathogen transmission cycles should be re-examined.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129709

Importantly, these novel lipids induced senolysis through ferroptosis, rather than apoptosis or necrosis, by exploiting elevated iron, cytosolic PUFAs and ROS levels in senescent cells. Mechanistic studies and computational analyses further revealed their key targets in the ferroptosis pathway, ACSL4, LPCAT3, and ALOX15, important for lipid-induced senolysis.

As proof-of-concept, we use G2PT to model the genetics of TG/HDL (triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), an indicator of metabolic health. G2PT learns to predict this trait via high attention to genetic variants underlying 24 functions, including immune response and cholesterol transport, with accuracy exceeding state-of-the-art.

The instability of all herpesvirus gBs have hindered biochemical and functional studies, thereby limiting our understanding of the infection mechanisms of these pathogens and preventing vaccine design. Here, we computationally stabilized and structurally characterized the Epstein-Barr virus prefusion gB ectodomain trimer, providing an atomic-level description of this key therapeutic target.

HASTY (HST), a karyopherin protein, has been implicated in miRNA biogenesis and movement, though its role in non-cell-autonomous miRNA movement remains unclear. Through a genetic screen, we identified that mutations in the HAWAIIAN SKIRT (HWS) gene suppress the developmental defects of hst mutants by restoring miRNA movement. Our findings show that HWS interacts with nuclear transport factors and nuclear pore complex (NPC) components, including NUP1, positioning HWS as a regulator of miRNA nuclear export. Using microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we showed that pri-miRNA transcription, and likely their co-transcriptional processing, occurs at the nuclear pore. Notably, we uncovered an antagonistic relationship between HST and HWS in regulating MIRNA transcription at the NPC and AGO1 loading, which could explain the observed changes in miRNA movement. HST promotes the association of MIRNA loci with the NPC, likely facilitating co-transcriptional processing, while HWS negatively regulates this process by targeting MEDIATOR complex subunits to degradation detaching, consequently, the processing complex from the NPC. Furthermore, our data provides evidence of spatial coordination of miRNA transcription, biogenesis, and movement highlighting a novel role for the NPC in the miRNA pathway.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

Alongside these introductions, inhabited and agricultural areas are spreading, and correspondingly most animal introductions occur in populated areas. Commensal species which can live alongside humans by making use of specific conditions, structures, or prey, have a significant advantage. Introduced mammal species often use anthropogenic features in their environment and demonstrate a higher tolerance of human disturbance, but their importance remains understudied in ectotherms. The Aesculapian snake (Zamenis longissimus) is an ectotherm which has been introduced beyond the northern extremities of its natural range. To understand their persistence, we radio-tracked snakes daily over two active seasons, including high-frequency tracking of a subset of males. We investigated snake home range size using Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimators (AKDE). Using AKDE-weighted Habitat Selection Functions we identified preferences for habitat features in a mosaic of habitats, and we used Integrated Step Selection Functions to further explore how these features influence movement. We revealed a particular preference for buildings in male snakes, while females preferred woodland.

Here, we present cryo-EM structures of RyR1 bound to dantrolene and the MH trigger agent 4-chloro-m-cresol (4CmC), revealing the dantrolene and 4CmC binding sites in atomic detail. Dantrolene binds stacked with ATP or ADP in the RY12 domain at the corner of the receptor, inducing a conformational change in this domain which is allosterically coupled to pore closure. Functional analyses revealed that ATP or ADP was required for dantrolene inhibition, and a single point mutation that disrupts the peripheral ATP binding site abolished ATP/ADP-dependent dantrolene inhibition. Strikingly, in the absence of dantrolene, this site selectively binds two ADP molecules, suggesting a possible role in ATP/ADP ratio sensing.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

The current biodiversity crisis demands a shift from single-species to multispecies approaches in conservation, particularly for rare and endangered species. However, this transition requires tools optimised for multispecies research, which are currently limited. 2. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies and bioinformatics have enabled efficient and robust acquisition of genetic data. Amplicon sequencing approaches, in particular, have demonstrated potential for enhancing non-invasive genetic studies of endangered species, but their application has been mostly limited to single species. 3. To enable multispecies genetic research, we introduce a cost-effective and robust HTS-based amplicon sequencing approach for genotyping multiple species simultaneously, designed for population monitoring, including individual identification and ascertaining patterns of population structure. 4. We developed Feliplex, a multiplex panel of 85 co-amplifying tetranucleotide microsatellite markers for cross-genotyping Felidae species, to demonstrate the utility of our approach. Feliplex was validated on known samples from nine Indian felid species across the genera Panthera, Prionailurus, and Felis. We applied it to invasive (blood and tissue) and non-invasive (hair and faeces) DNA extracts from 173 wild individuals obtaining respectively 70% and 56% multilocus genotyping success rates. The panel accurately identified known population clusters in tigers (Panthera tigris, n=19) and revealed hitherto unknown genetic structure in fishing cats (Prionailurus viverrinus, n=40). 5. Wide applicability of Feliplex across Felidae allows reliable multispecies genotyping from low-quality/quantity samples, while supporting cost-effective genetic studies and conservation monitoring of lesser-known species like small cats. Our approach has a broad applicability and can be adapted to develop similar multispecies panels for closely related species groups.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

However, cognitive abilities differ from one another in how they change with age: whereas executive functions, like working memory, show age-related decline, aspects of linguistic processing remain relatively preserved (Hartshorne et al., 2015). This heterogeneity of the cognitive-behavioral landscape in aging predicts differences among brain networks in whether and how they should change with age. To evaluate this prediction, we used individual-subject fMRI analyses ('precision fMRI') to examine the language-selective network (Fedorenko et al., 2024) and the Multiple Demand (MD) network, which supports executive functions (Duncan et al., 2020), in older adults (n=77) relative to young controls (n=470). In line with past claims, relative to young adults, the MD network of older adults shows weaker and less spatially extensive activations during an executive function task and reduced within-network functional synchronization. However, in stark contrast to the MD network, we find remarkable preservation of the language network in older adults. Their language network responds to language as strongly and selectively as in younger adults, and is similarly lateralized and internally synchronized. In other words, the language network of older adults looks indistinguishable from that of younger adults. Our findings align with behavioral preservation of language skills in aging and suggest that some networks remain young-like, at least on standard measures of function and connectivity.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

We estimated population-level immunity to SARS-CoV-2 for each of the fifty United States (U.S.) and the District of Columbia from January 2020 through December 2023.

MethodsWe updated a model of SARS-CoV-2 infections to align with the latest evidence on SARS-CoV-2 natural history and waning of immunity, and to integrate various data sources available throughout the pandemic. We used this model to produce population estimates of effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease.

ResultsOn December 30, 2023, 99.9% of the U.S. population had experienced immunological exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through infection and/or vaccination, with 99.4% (95% credible interval (CrI): 92.4-100%) having had at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite this high exposure, the average population-level protection against infection was 53.6% (95% CrI: 38.7-71.5%). Population-level protection against severe disease was 82.6% (95% CrI: 71.5-91.7%).

DiscussionA new wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations began near the end of 2023, with the introduction of the JN.1 variant. This upturn suggests that the U.S. population remains at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease despite the high level of cumulative exposure in the United States. This decline in effective protection is likely due to both waning and continued viral evolution.","NA","medrxiv",1729894129710

Historically, fossils typically spent years in preparation to be freed from the enclosing rock. Now, X-ray and synchrotron tomography reveal structure that is otherwise invisible and data acquisition can be fast. However, manual segmentation of these 3D volumes can still take months to years. This is especially challenging for resource-poor teams, as scanning may be free, but the computing power and (AI-assisted) segmentation software required to handle the resulting large data sets are complex to use and expensive. Here we present a free, browser-based segmentation tool that reduces computational overhead by splitting volumes into small chunks, allowing processing on low-memory, inexpensive hardware. Our tool also speeds up collaborative ground-truth generation and 3D visualization, all in-browser. We developed and evaluated our pipeline on various open-data scans of differing contrast, resolution, textural complexity, and size. Our tool successfully isolated the Thrinaxodon and Broomistega pair from an Early Triassic burrow. It isolated cranial bones from the Cretaceous acipenseriform Parapsephurus willybemisi on both 45.53 m and 13.67 m resolution scanning data. We also isolated bones of the Middle Triassic sauropterygian Nothosaurus and a challenging scan of a squamate embryo inside an egg dating back to the Early Cretaceous. Our tool reliably reproduces expert-supervised segmentation at a fraction of the time and cost, offering greater accessibility than existing tools. Beyond the online tool, all our code is open source, enabling contributions from the palaeontology community to further this emerging machine learning ecosystem.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

Direct RNA nanopore sequencing offers a unique advantage by observing these modifications through characteristic alterations in ionic current signals. Various computational tools have been developed to detect RNA modifications, typically by comparing a sample of interest with a control lacking the target modification, often achieved through enzyme knockdown or knockout. We have developed a robust in vitro transcription protocol to generate a modification-free copy of any input RNA to detect all modifications that alter the raw ionic current signal relative to the canonical nucleotides during nanopore sequencing. We generated an in vitro transcribed sample from K562 cells and used Nanocompore to detect 26,619 modified RNA sites across 2,520 transcript isoforms from 1,742 genes. Of these, 56% are consistent with the well-characterized m6A modification. By inferring the identities of these modifications, we assessed differential usage and correlation patterns, revealing a significant co-occurrence between m6A and m5C modifications within the same transcripts. Additionally, some modifications were non-randomly associated with alternative splicing events. This study provides a comprehensive survey of RNA modifications across the transcriptome, demonstrating the utility of in vitro transcription coupled with direct RNA nanopore sequencing to simultaneously detect multiple modifications without the need for additional independent biochemical assays. The protocol is consistent in the future with more complex experimental designs, for example for differential modification usage between samples.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

Seizure susceptibility and hippocampal-prefrontal cortex coherence in awake behaving animals, processes disrupted in mice deficient in microglia- enriched genes, are also normal. Similarly, segregation of eye-specific inputs into the lateral geniculate nucleus proceeds normally in the absence of microglia. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis did not uncover substantial perturbation due to neurons and astrocytes due to microglial absence. Thus, in the absence of microglia, the brain retains the capacity to execute developmental synaptic refinement, maturation and connectivity.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

However, the enzymes responsible for their turnover in plants remain largely unknown. Using a non-hydrolysable PP-InsP analog in a pull-down approach, we identified a family of Arabidopsis Nudix hydrolases (NUDTs) that group into two closely related subclades. Through in vitro assays, heterologous expression systems, and higher-order gene-edited mutants, we explored the substrate specificities and physiological roles of these hydrolases. Using a combination of strong anion exchange (SAX)-HPLC, PAGE, and capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS), we found that their PP-InsP pyrophosphatase activity is enantiomer-selective and Mg2+-dependent. Specifically, subclade I NUDTs preferentially hydrolyze 4-InsP7, while subclade II NUDTs target 3-InsP7, with minor activity against other PP-InsPs, including 5-InsP7. In higher-order mutants of subclade II NUDTs, we observed defects in both Pi and iron homeostasis, accompanied by increased levels of 1/3-InsP7 and 5-InsP7, with a markedly larger increase in 1/3-InsP7. Furthermore, ectopic expression of NUDTs from both subclades induced local Pi starvation responses (PSRs). However, RNA-seq analysis of WT and nudt12/13/16 plants suggests that these NUDTs have PSR-independent roles, potentially involving 1/3-InsP7 in the regulation of plant defense. Expanding beyond subclade II NUDTs, we demonstrated susceptibility of the 3PP-position of PP-InsPs to enzymatic activities unrelated to NUDTs, and found that such activities are conserved across plants and humans. Additionally, we found that NUDT effectors from pathogenic ascomycete fungi exhibit a substrate specificity similar to subclade I NUDTs. Collectively, our study provides new insights into the roles of NUDTs in regulating PP-InsP signaling pathways in plants and highlights cross-kingdom conservation of enzymes involved in PP-InsP metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

Here, we use long-read nanopore sequencing technology to develop a crossover mapping pipeline, COmapper, for high-resolution mapping of genome-wide crossovers from pooled DNA of F1 hybrid pollen and F2 recombinant seedlings derived from a cross between Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col and Ler. We validate the high accuracy of COmapper by applying nanopore long-read sequencing to pooled DNA of Arabidopsis F2 individuals with crossovers mapped by short-read sequencing. Using the COmapper, we constructed high-resolution genomic maps of crossovers using F1 hybrid pollen and F2 seedlings in wild type and crossover-elevated recq4a recq4b mutant, showing results comparable to short-read sequencing. Crossovers were enriched at gene-proximal promoters in wild type and increased but reshaped by high polymorphism density in recq4a recq4b.

Similar to AM symbiosis, multiple other intracellular symbiotic interactions have evolved in a variety of land plants. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis contrasts with these relationships as there is no intracellular accommodation of the symbiont inside the plant cell, but only intercellular colonization. This symbiotic relationship is common in a variety of seed plants, mostly trees and shrubs such as pines, willows and oaks.

Although it is known which plant lineages are involved in ECM symbiosis, there has been little investigation into the evolutionary origin of ECM symbiosis in these lineages. Furthermore, the genetic innovations and transcriptomic response related to this symbiosis have been studied largely in a genus or species-specific context, which hinders the study of their evolutionary origins. In this study, we reconstruct the origin of ECM in the rosid clade, showing at least 16 independent origins, resulting in the 17 known extant ECM rosid lineages. Moreover, comparative genomics of these lineages highlight genes involved in cell wall remodeling which underwent duplications in a convergent manner across ectomycorrhizal lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

These complexes are well known for depositing and maintaining the repressive H3K27me3 and activating H3K4me3 marks, respectively. However, the mechanisms that govern the switch between these functions remains elusive, especially in plants, whose lifelong, flexible development relies heavily on this process. Here we demonstrate that the plant specific ULTRAPETALA1 (ULT1) protein, previously reported as a trxG factor that antagonizes the PRC2 enzymatic subunit CURLY LEAF (CLF), also exhibits a repressive function, increasing H3K27me3 levels at over a thousand genes. We discovered a physical interaction between ULT1 and PRC2 components, particularly the SWINGER (SWN) enzymatic subunit. We further show that ULT1 significantly enhances PRC2SWN enzymatic activity in vitro, corroborating our epigenomic and developmental genetic data that reveal different ULT1 activity depending on the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex. This study provides new insights into the relative activities of CLF and SWN and introduces a novel mechanistic framework for a chromatin switch mediated by a bivalent trxG/PcG factor.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

Mendelian randomisation (MR) using molecular traits as exposures is a particularly promising approach for identifying such risk factors. Despite early successes with the application of MR to biomarkers such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and C-reactive protein, recent studies have revealed a more nuanced picture, with widespread horizontal pleiotropy. Using data from the UK Biobank, we illustrate the issue of horizontal pleiotropy with two case studies, one involving glycolysis and the other involving vitamin D synthesis. We demonstrate that, although the measured metabolites (pyruvate or histidine, respectively) do not have a direct causal effect on the outcomes of interest (red blood cell count or vitamin D level), we can still use variant effects on these downstream metabolites to infer how they perturb protein function in different gene regions. This allows us to use variant effects on metabolite levels as proxy exposures in a cis-MR framework, thus rediscovering the causal roles of histidine ammonia lyase (HAL) in vitamin D synthesis and glycolysis pathway in red blood cell survival. We also highlight the assumptions that need to be satisfied for cis-MR with proxy exposures to yield valid inferences and discuss the practical challenges of meeting these assumptions.","NA","medrxiv",1729894129710

Liver damage has emerged as a notable feature, yet no systematic review or meta-analysis has comprehensively evaluated the biomarkers confirming liver injury in LC patients.

ObjectiveThe present study aims to examine blood-based biomarkers of liver damage in LC disease.

MethodsA search of PubMed, Google Scholar, SciFinder, and SCOPUS identified 61 eligible studies, including 7172 participants, with 3404 LC patients and 3768 controls.

ResultsOur analysis identified a significant increase in the liver damage index among LC patients, with a moderate effect size (standardized mean difference, SMD = 0.553; confidence intervals; 95% CI: 0.305-0.760) compared to normal controls. Additionally, LC patients exhibited marked elevations in alanine aminotransferase (SMD = 0.615; 95% CI: 0.351;0.878), aspartate aminotransferase (SMD = 0.352; 95% CI: 0.068;0.637), gamma-glutamyl transferase (SMD = 0.969; 95% CI: 0.194;1.745), and lactate dehydrogenase (SMD = 0.666; 95% CI: 0.332;0.999) activities. Moreover, significant reductions were observed in total protein (SMD = -0.326; 95% CI: -0.631; -0.021) and increases in prothrombin time (SMD = 0.633; 95% CI: 0.077;1.189), ferritin (SMD = 0.437; 95% CI: 0.069;0.805), D-dimer (SMD = 0.359; 95% CI: 0.144;0.573). Further studies are needed to confirm reductions in platelet count and elevations in fibrinogen levels

ConclusionThis study suggests that LC is associated with persistent liver damage and coagulopathy, highlighting the need to incorporate liver injury into treatment strategies to reduce potential risks.","NA","medrxiv",1729894129710

Cryo-EM structures of brain-derived tau filaments revealed that specific structures define different diseases, triggering a quest for the development of experimental model systems that replicate the structures of disease. Here, we describe twelve phosphomimetic, serine/threonine to aspartate, mutations in tau, which we termed PAD12, that collectively induce the in vitro assembly of full-length tau into filaments with the same structure as that of paired helical filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggests that phosphomimetic mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain of tau may facilitate filament formation by disrupting an intramolecular interaction between two IVYK motifs. PAD12 tau can be used for both nucleation-dependent and multiple rounds of seeded assembly in vitro, as well as for the seeding of tau biosensor cells. PAD12 tau can be assembled into paired helical filaments under various shaking conditions, with the resulting filaments being stable for extended periods of time. They can be labelled with fluorophores and biotin. Tau filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease brains have been known to be made of hyperphosphorylated and abnormally phosphorylated full-length tau, but it was not known if the presence of this post-translational modification is more than a mere correlation. Our findings suggest that hyperphosphorylation of tau may be sufficient for the formation of the Alzheimer tau fold. PAD12 tau will be a useful tool for the study of molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are one of the main sources of AMR pollutants discharged into water bodies. One important factor for assessing the risks associated with such pollution is the colonization potential of the resistant bacteria (ARB) and resistance genes (ARGs) from the environment into human or animal microbiomes upon exposure. This study explores whether fish can act as sentinels for surveillance of AMR pollution in general and specifically the human colonization potential of ARB in rivers impacted by WWTP effluents. Two riverine fish species, Brown trout, and European bullhead, were sampled up- and downstream a German WWTP. The two fish species were chosen due to their different lifestyles: Trout are mainly actively swimming in the water phase, while bullheads are sedentary and river sediment-associated. The bacterial microbiomes and resistomes of fish gills, skin, and feces were compared with those of the respective river water and sediment up- and downstream of the WWTP. Microbiomes of both fish mirrored the changes in river water and sediment downstream of the WWTP, with significant shifts in bacterial community composition, particularly an increase in Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. However, increases in ARG abundances observed in water and sediment downstream of the WWTP were not reflected in any of the fish-associated resistomes. This indicates that while the fish microbiome is sensitive to environmental changes, resistomes of poikilothermic animals such as fish are less responsive to colonization by ARB originating from WWTPs and may not serve as effective sentinels for assessing AMR pollution and colonization risks in freshwater environments. This study highlights the complexity of using wildlife as indicators for environmental AMR pollution and suggests that other species are better suited for surveillance efforts.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

In this study, we aim to reconstruct the complex admixture histories of the population of Sao Tome, an island in the Gulf of Guinea that was the site of the first slave-based plantation economy, and experienced successive waves of forced and deliberate migration from Africa. We examined 2.5 million SNPs newly genotyped in 96 Sao Tomeans and found that geography alone cannot explain the observed patterns of genetic differentiation within the island. We defined five genetic groups in Sao Tome based on the hypothesis that individuals sharing the most haplotypes are more likely to share similar genetic histories. Using Identical-by-Descent and different local ancestry inference methods, we inferred shared ancestries between 70 African and European populations and each Sao Tomean genetic group. We identified admixture events between admixed groups that were previously isolated on the island, showing how recently admixed populations can be themselves the sources of other admixture events. This study demonstrates how complex admixture and isolation histories during and after the Transatlantic Slave-Trade shaped extant individual genetic patterns at a local scale in Africa.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

Organellar 16S rRNA sequences are automatically amplified and sequenced along with prokaryote 16S rRNA, and may provide an alternative method to identify eukaryotic microorganisms. CABO-16S combines bacterial and archaeal sequences from the SILVA database with 16S rRNA sequences of plastids and other organelles from the PR2 database to enable identification of all 16S rRNA sequences. Comparison of CABO-16S with SILVA 138.2 results in equivalent taxonomic classification of mock communities and increased classification of diverse environmental samples. In particular, identification of phototrophic eukaryotes in shallow seagrass environments, marine waters, and lake waters was increased. CABO-16S also provides the framework to add curated datasets of specialized sequences for further classification of clades which are not currently included in other databases. Addition of sequences obtained from Sanger sequencing of methane seep sediments and curated sequences of the polyphyletic SEEP-SRB1 clade resulted in differentiation of syntrophic and non-syntrophic SEEP-SRB1 in hydrothermal vent sediments. Such additions may simplify analysis of communities contributing to the anaerobic oxidation of methane, and highlight the potential benefit of amending existing training sets with curated sequences when studying extreme or unique environments underrepresented in existing databases.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

To explore factors that may contribute to protection, we conducted detailed T cell epitope mapping using previously published sequences from H1N1 strains. This analysis revealed a high conservation of amino acid sequences within the internal proteins of our bovine HPAI H5N1 virus strain.

A body of work has identified the taxonomic profile of the female urinary microbiome associate with aging, menopause, and urinay disease. However, how this microbial community engages with the host niche, including the local biochemical environment of the urogenital tract, in health and disease is yet to be fully defined. This study directly assesses differences in the biochemical environment of the urine, or biochemical ecology, associated with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) and defines a microbe-metabolite association network of the female urinary microbiome. By integrating metagenomic and metabolomic data collected from a controlled cohort of women with rUTI, we find that distinct metabolites, such as methionine sulfoxide (Met-SO) and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), are associated with differences in urinary microbiome diversity. We observe associations between microbial and biochemical beta diversity and unique metabolic networks of uropathogenic Escherichia coli and uroprotective Lactobacillus species, highlighting potential metabolite-driven ecological shifts that may influence UTI susceptibility. We identify a urinary lipid signature of active rUTI that can accurately distinguish (AUC = 0.987) cases controls. Finally, using time-to-relapse data we identify deoxycholic acid (DCA) as a new prognostic indicator for rUTI recurrence. Together these findings suggest that systemic metabolic processes may influence susceptibility, opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention and the development of more accurate diagnostic and prognostic to improve patient outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

MethodsHere, we studied the entire Norwegian population aged 10 to 40 between 2006 and 2018 (N = 2,468,503). By linking tax registries to administrative health registries, we describe prevalence rates by age, sex, and parental income rank. Next, we used kinship-based models with extended families of twins and siblings to distinguish direct effects of parents from shared genetic and environmental risk factors.

ResultsWe show that lower parental income rank was associated with more psychiatric disorders at all ages from age 10 to 40 (r between -.06 and -.15). The kinship-based models indicated that direct effects of parental income played a large role (38%) in explaining the parent-offspring correlation among adolescents, while shared risk factors accounted for the entire parent-offspring correlation among adults.

Rates of OA publications continue to grow, including for research carried out by pharmaceutical companies. To help drive more openness in the pharmaceutical industry, we aimed to compare the OA publication rates of pharmaceutical companies with those of academic institutions.

MethodsWe assessed OA publication rates from the 40 largest pharmaceutical companies by earnings and 40 comparator academic institutions that publish the largest number of medical research articles in their geographical region. Using the Lens, we built a live public dashboard that presents the OA publication rates for articles with authors affiliated to the pharmaceutical companies and comparator academic institutions of interest, detailed by OA model and licence, and by medical therapy area. We performed further analysis on data downloaded from the dashboard.

ResultsIn our primary analysis of articles 12-24 months since publication date, 76.6% of pharmaceutical company (pharma) and 69.5% of academic institution (academia) publications were OA. The most common OA models were gold (pharma, 37%; academia, 41%) and hybrid (pharma, 22%; academia, 11%). Oncology had lower rates of OA publications than other therapy areas. Growth in the OA publication rate was generally more rapid for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions, regardless of field.

ConclusionsThe OA publication rate was higher for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions and continues to increase. With the pharmaceutical industry focused on encouraging authors to publish OA and increasingly aware of the different types of OA licences, we expect and welcome further changes. Our new report provides data on pharmaceutical company and academic institution publications that are updated every 2 weeks. We encourage others to use this open resource and report their results.

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSOpen access (OA) publication rates for pharmaceutical companies have been steadily growing. However, previous methods for analysing pharmaceutical company OA publication rates have not been conducive to automation and have not facilitated easy comparison between pharmaceutical companies and other research-intensive environments, such as academic institutions.

What this study addsWe built an online dashboard that presents continually and automatically updated OA publication rates for articles with authors affiliated to several large pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. We found that the OA publication rate was higher for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions and that growth in OA publications was generally more rapid for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyOur dashboard allows ongoing monitoring, and we encourage the use of this free tool to capture evolving OA publishing behaviours and the disclosure of these results to help drive greater adoption of OA publishing practices.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIAs expected with large-scale bibliometrics sampling, there are various points at which error and/or information loss may have entered this analysis, for example, during the parsing of author affiliations or categorisation of topics and article types.
C_LIO_LIThe comparator set (a globally representative group of research-intensive academic institutions) may not represent academic institutions in general because it includes only the largest academic institutions (in terms of publication counts) from each global region.
C_LIO_LIThere is overlap between the pharmaceutical company and academic institution analysis sets because first, pharmaceutical company publications often include academic authors, and second, academic institution publications may include pharmaceutical company authors. Hence, some individual publications may have been included in both analysis sets.
C_LIO_LIThe analysis does not account for studies that are led by authors at academic institutions but funded by pharmaceutical companies. These investigator-sponsored studies typically do not have pharmaceutical company authors, and pharmaceutical companies have no influence over decisions relating to publications resulting from these studies, including target journal, OA status and license type.

Plain Language SummaryBiotechnology and pharmaceutical companies develop and deliver most of the worlds new medicines. To ensure important information about these medicines is shared transparently with audiences across the world, more and more often, pharmaceutical companies are choosing to publish their research open access. Open access publishing allows anyone to read and, in some cases, reuse the contents of research publications for free. In medical journals, an increasing proportion of articles are published open access every year. However, at the moment, we dont understand how the open access publication rates of medical publications from pharmaceutical companies compare with those of medical publications from academic institutions. Understanding this could help the scientific community assess how open access publication practices are changing over time.

We made an online platform that provides a free, live report of the open access publication rates for pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. We found that 77% of pharmaceutical company research publications and 70% of academic institution research publications were published open access. Open access publication rates increased each year for both pharmaceutical company and academic institution research publications, but the rates were increasing faster for pharmaceutical companies.

Our results are similar to those from other studies of open access publication rates. We encourage users to explore our free online live report and share their results publicly.

Here we tested whether these neural dynamics of speech encoding are altered for individuals with a language disorder. We recorded EEG responses from individuals with post-stroke aphasia and healthy age-matched controls (i.e., older adults) during 25 min of natural story listening. We estimated the duration of phonetic feature encoding, speed of evolution across neural populations, and the spatial location of encoding over EEG sensors. First, we establish that phonetic features are robustly encoded in EEG responses of healthy older adults. Second, when comparing individuals with aphasia to healthy controls, we find significantly decreased phonetic encoding in the aphasic group after shared initial processing pattern (0.08-0.25s after phoneme onset). Phonetic features were less strongly encoded over left-lateralized electrodes in the aphasia group compared to controls, with no difference in speed of neural pattern evolution. Finally, we observed that phonemes with high uncertainty about word identity were encoded longer in controls than in individuals with aphasia. This indicates that encoding phonetic information until word identity is resolved might be a crucial mechanism for successful speech comprehension. Together, our results suggest that aphasia may entail failure to maintain lower-order information long enough to recognize lexical items.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

Although human NK cell activation correlates with poor vaccine response, the mechanisms of human NK cell regulation of adaptive immunity are poorly understood. We found that in human ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection, broad neutralizers, who were capable of neutralizing Alpha, Beta, and Delta, had fewer NK cells that expressed inhibitory and immaturity markers whereas NK cells from narrow neutralizers were highly activated and expressed interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISG-mediated activation in NK cells from healthy donors increased cytotoxicity and functional responses to induced Tfh-like cells.

The presence of interfaces can affect their aggregation mechanism, often speeding up aggregation. -Synuclein (Syn) can adsorb to biomolecular condensates, leading to heterogenous nucleation and faster aggregation. Understanding the mechanism underlying localization of amyloidogenic proteins at condensate interfaces is crucial for developing strategies to prevent or reverse their binding. We show that Syn localization to the surface of peptide-based heterotypic condensates is an adsorption process governed by the proteins condensate-amphiphilic nature. Adsorption occurs in multiple layers and levels off at micromolar concentrations. Based on these findings, we design three strategies to modulate Syn accumulation: (i) addition of biomolecules that decrease the condensate {zeta}-potential, such as NTPs and RNA, (ii) competitive adsorption of proteins targeting the condensate interface, such as G3BP1, DDX4-YFP, EGFP-NPM1, Hsp70, Hsc70, and (iii) preferential adsorption of Syn to membranes. Removing Syn from the condensate interface slows aggregation, highlighting potential cellular control over protein adsorption and implications for therapeutic strategies.

Despite its popularity among recreational users and distinct pharmacodynamics, the neural correlates of 2C-B remain unexplored. Using 7T resting-state functional MRI in 22 healthy volunteers, we mapped out the acute effects of matched doses of 20 mg 2C-B, 15 mg psilocybin and placebo across spatiotemporal benchmarks of functional brain organisation. In a within-subjects, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, we evaluated the neuropharmacological and neurobehavioural correlates of an array of connectivity measures - including static (sFC) and global connectivity (gFC), dynamic connectivity variability (dFC), and spontaneous brain complexity. Compared to placebo, 2C-B and psilocybin selectively reduced intra-network sFC, while broadly increasing between-network and subcortical-cortical connectivity. Compared to psilocybin, 2C-B exhibited less pronounced reductions in between-network FC but elicited elevations in transmodal sFC. Both compounds yielded spatially divergent increases in gFC yet produced similar increases in brain complexity. Using PET density modelling, the spatial distribution of neural effects aligned with documented differences in monoaminergic transporter and serotonergic receptor binding affinity beyond 5-HT2A, highlighting the role of pharmacology in shaping functional dynamics. Lastly, we show behavioural markers of psychedelic effects are non-linearly reflected by the desynchronisation of the transmodal axis of functional brain organisation. Together, our findings highlight 2C-B as a useful new addition to the study of psychedelic neuroscience and may motivate new pharmacotherapy strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

While visual cortical areas did not show a significant preference, regions associated with spatial navigation were preferentially activated by visual objects. Electrophysiological recordings in the postsubiculum, the primary cortical area of the head direction (HD) system, further confirmed a preference for visual objects, which was present in both HD cells and fast-spiking interneurons. Finally, we found that visual objects dynamically modulate HD cells, selectively increasing firing rates for HD cells aligned with a visual landmarks direction, while suppressing activity in HD cells coding for other directions. These results reveal that visual objects refine population-level coding of head direction.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

However, the role of glial mitochondria in proper brain development is not well understood. We show that astrocyte mitochondria undergo extensive fission while populating astrocyte distal branches during postnatal cortical development. Loss of mitochondrial fission regulator, Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), decreases mitochondrial localization to distal astrocyte processes, and this mitochondrial mislocalization reduces astrocyte morphological complexity. Functionally, astrocyte-specific conditional deletion of Drp1 induces astrocyte reactivity and disrupts astrocyte organization in the cortex. These morphological and organizational deficits are accompanied by loss of astrocytic gap junction protein Connexin 43. These findings uncover a crucial role for mitochondrial fission in coordinating astrocytic morphogenesis and organization, revealing the regulation of astrocytic mitochondria dynamics as a critical step in neurodevelopment.

SummaryDuring cortical astrocyte morphogenesis, mitochondria decrease in size to populate distal astrocyte processes. Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission is necessary for peripheral astrocyte process formation. Astrocyte-specific Drp1 loss induces astrocyte reactivity, disrupts cortical astrocyte organization, and dysregulates gap-junction protein Connexin 43 abundance.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

However, the extent to which these relationships develop across all 4 cardiac chambers, particularly during early-stage disease, remains unknown. Here, we discovered that very young D2.mdx mice exhibit fibrosis exclusively in the right ventricle (RV) and left atrium. Concurrent cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and disorganization in the RV were related to a highly specific inflammatory signature of increased infiltrating pro-inflammatory macrophages (CD11b+CD45+CD64+F4/80+CCR2+), myofibre mitochondrial-linked apoptosis, and reduced carbohydrate and fat oxidation. This relationship did not occur in the left ventricle. Short-term daily administration of a peptidomimetic adiponectin receptor agonist, ALY688, completely prevented RV fibrosis, myofibre hypertrophy, infiltrating macrophages and mitochondrial stress as well as left atrial fibrosis.

To help achieve this, many bacteria utilise regulatory pathways that ensure DNA replication initiation only occurs once per cell cycle. When dysregulated, loss of DNA replication control can have severe consequences. In Escherichia coli it has been observed that hyper-initiation of DNA synthesis leads to pleiotropic genome instability and cell death. Therefore, targeting DNA replication initiation proteins to promote hyper-initiation may be an approach to generate novel antimicrobials. However, it is not clear whether DNA replication hyper-initiation generally inhibits bacterial proliferation, and if so, via which pathways. To address this question, we devised genetic systems to artificially induce hyper-initiation in the model organism Bacillus subtilis and the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. In both species, hyper-initiation elicited cellular degeneration culminating in growth inhibition by cell death. During this process in B. subtilis, temporal analyses revealed the early onset of the DNA damage response, followed by membrane depolarisation and cell lysis. This phenotype could be suppressed by removing pathways that repair damaged DNA, suggesting that cell death is a consequence of conflicts between DNA replication and repair. In S. aureus, cells quickly accumulated striking morphological changes associated with rapid loss of chromosomal DNA and death via a lysis-independent pathway. Moreover, inducing hyper-initiation in S. aureus was observed to decrease bacterial survival during infection of murine macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest that stimulating the initiation of bacterial DNA replication could be an alternative approach to inhibiting bacterial growth, particularly in combination with compounds that inhibit or poison DNA repair, akin to cancer therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

We establish Brillouin shift and linewidth as measures for average molecular interaction and dissipation strength, respectively, and we used QPI to obtain the protein concentration within the condensates. We monitored the response of condensates formed by FUS and by the low-complexity domain of hnRNPA1 (A1-LCD) to altering temperature and ion concentration. Conditions favoring phase separation increased Brillouin shift, linewidth, and protein concentration. In comparison to solidification by chemical crosslinking, the ion-dependent aging of FUS condensates had a small effect on the molecular interaction strength inside. Finally, we investigated how sequence variations of A1-LCD, that change the driving force for phase separation, alter the physical properties of the respective condensates. Our results provide a new experimental perspective on the material properties of protein condensates.

Combining spatio-temporal population genetic theory with population genomic data of 18 plant and animal species, we studied the dynamics of genetic diversity after habitat area losses. We show genetic diversity reacts slowly to habitat area and population declines, but lagged losses will continue for many decades even after habitats are fully protected. To understand the magnitude of this problem, we combined our predictive method with species habitat area and population monitoring reported in the Living Planet Index, the Red List, and new GBF indicators. We then project genetic diversity loss in 13,808 species with a short-term genetic diversity loss of 13-22% and long-term loss of 42-48% with substantial deviations depending on the level of habitat fragmentation.

Recombinant CD52 has been shown to act as a broad anti-inflammatory agent, dampening both adaptive and innate immune responses. This short glycopeptide is heavily glycosylated, with a complex sialylated N-linked glycan at N3 and reported O-linked glycosylation possible on several serine and threonine residues. Previously we demonstrated that specific glycosylation features of CD52 are essential for its immunosuppressive function, with terminal -2,3-linked sialic acids required for binding to the inhibitory SIGLEC-10 receptor leading to T-cell suppression. Using high resolution mass spectrometry, we have further characterised the N- and O-linked glycosylation of Expi293 recombinantly produced CD52 at a glycopeptide and released glycan level, accurately determining glycan heterogeneity of both N- and O-linked glycosylation, and localising the site of O-glycosylation to T8 with high confidence and direct spectral evidence.

Tau is released from neurons as free protein or in extracellular vesicles (EVs)3-5 but the role of these different release mechanisms in intercellular tau transmission is unclear. Here, we show that the neuronal gene Arc is critical for packaging tau into EVs.

In contrast, EVs purified from rTgWT crossed with Arc knock-out mice (rTgArc KO) have significantly less hTau and cannot seed tau aggregation. Arc facilitates the release of hTau in EVs produced via the I-BAR protein IRSp53, but not free tau. Arc protein directly binds hTau to form a fuzzy complex that we identified in both mouse and human brain tissue. We find that pathological intracellular hTau accumulates in neurons in rTgArc KO mice, which correlates with accelerated neuron loss in the hippocampus. Finally, we find that intercellular tau transmission is significantly abrogated in Arc KO mice. We conclude that Arc-dependent release of tau in EVs plays a significant role in intracellular tau elimination and intercellular tau transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

Here, we bridge this gap by linking genome to proteome in 800 meiotic progeny from an intercross between two closely related Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates adapted to distinct niches. Modest genetic distance between the parents generated remarkable proteomic diversity that was amplified in the progeny and captured by 6,476 genotype-protein associations, over 1,600 of which we resolved to single variants. Proteomic adaptation emerged through the combined action of numerous cis- and trans-regulatory mutations, a regulatory architecture that was conserved across the species. Notably, trans-regulatory variants often arose in proteins not traditionally associated with gene regulation, such as enzymes. Moreover, the proteomic consequences of mutations predicted fitness under various stresses. Our study demonstrates that the collective action of natural genetic variants drives dramatic proteome diversification, with molecular consequences that forecast phenotypic outcomes.

Highlights- Proteome diversity arises from natural genetic variants, with divergent proteomes in closely related parents and progeny.
- Cis-regulatory elements had strong individual impacts, but coherent trans effects combined to dominate protein expression.
- Directional selection and frequent transgression suggest much of the proteome is under selective pressure.
- Many trans-regulators are enzymes or transporters, with fewer than 4% of pQTLs linking known interactors.
- Genome-to-proteome connections predicted the fitness impact of mutations under various stresses, including a strong but hidden causal variant in IRA2/NF1.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

Capturing this structure remains a significant scientific challenge. Using information theory, we apply Dynamical Independence (DI) to uncover the emergent dynamical structure in a minimal 5-node biophysical neural model, shaped by the interplay of two key aspects of brain organisation: integration and segregation. In our study, functional integration within the biophysical neural model is modulated by a global coupling parameter, while functional segregation is influenced by adding dynamical noise, which counteracts global coupling. DI defines a dimensionally-reduced macroscopic variable (e.g., a coarse-graining) as emergent to the extent that it behaves as an independent dynamical process, distinct from the micro-level dynamics. We measure dynamical dependence (a departure from dynamical independence) for macroscopic variables across spatial scales. Our results indicate that the degree of emergence of macroscopic variables is relatively minimised at balanced points of integration and segregation and maximised at the extremes. Additionally, our method identifies to which degree the macroscopic dynamics are localised across microlevel nodes, thereby elucidating the emergent dynamical structure through the relationship between microscopic and macroscopic processes. We find that deviation from a balanced point between integration and segregation results in a less localised, more distributed emergent dynamical structure as identified by DI. This finding suggests that a balance of functional integration and segregation is associated with lower levels of emergence (higher dynamical dependence), which may be crucial for sustaining coherent, localised emergent macroscopic dynamical structures. This work also provides a complete computational implementation for the identification of emergent neural dynamics that could be applied both in silico and in vivo.

Author summaryUnderstanding how complex neural systems give rise to emergent macroscopic patterns is a central challenge in neuroscience. Emergence, where macroscopic structures appear from underlying microscopic interactions, plays a crucial role in brain function, yet identifying the specific dynamics involved remains elusive. Traditionally, methods have quantified the extent of emergence but have struggled to pinpoint the emergent dynamical structure itself. In this study, we develop and apply a method, based on a quantity called Dynamical Independence (DI), which simultaneously captures the extent of emergence and reveals the underlying dynamical structure in neurophysiological data. Using a minimal 5-node biophysical neural model, we explore how a balance between functional integration and segregation--two key organisational principles in the brain--affects emergent macroscopic dynamics. Our results show that a finely balanced system produces highly localised, coherent macroscopic structures, while extreme deviations lead to more distributed, less localised dynamics. This work provides a computational framework for identifying emergent dynamical structure in both theoretical models and potentially in empirical brain data, advancing our understanding of the brains complex organisation across higher-order scales.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

A prime example is organ regeneration, whereby despite intrinsically stochastic damage, organs are rebuilt via controlled cellular proliferation. Here, we use a mathematical approach to understand how a cell decides to re-enter and exit mitosis during organ repair. Using empirical data from regenerating neuromasts in larval zebrafish, we identify a minimal model based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Remarkably, the ODEs model reproduces the regeneration kinetics by assuming a cell-proliferation switch that depends on the type and the number of the neuromast cells. Additionally, a two-dimensional Cellular Potts Model (CPM) predicts that cell proliferation is a delayed response to injury. The CPM recapitulates the experimental results qualitatively and quantitatively, showing that cell proliferation is locally controlled by a switch, where each cell division stops when the type-dependent number of neighbouring cells exceeds a deterministic critical value. An intriguing corollary of our results is that a local negative feedback loop among identical cells may be a general property of organ-level proportional homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

However, the specific mechanisms by which different KRAS G12 alleles initiate distinctive patterns of metabolic reprogramming is unclear. Using isogenic panels of colorectal cell lines harbouring the G12A, G12C, G12D and G12V heterozygous mutations and employing transcriptomics, metabolomics, and extensive biochemical validation, we demonstrate distinctive features of each allele. We also demonstrate that cells harbouring the common G12D and G12V oncogenic mutations significantly alter glutamine metabolism and nitrogen recycling through FOXO1-mediated regulation compared to parental lines. Moreover, with a combination of small molecule inhibitors targeting glutamine and glutamate metabolism, we also identify a common vulnerability that eliminates mutant cells selectively. These results highlight a previously unreported mutant-specific effect of KRAS alleles on metabolism and signalling that could be potentially harnessed for cancer therapy.

In briefBer et al. reveal common and distinct features of oncogenic KRAS mutant isogenic cell lines. Mutant lines upregulate different nitrogen-recycling metabolic pathways and show sensitivity to combinatorial drugging of glutamine metabolism.

We applied our method to stress-test a highly effective gene drive that has evaded resistance in all laboratory-contained releases to date, known as Ag(QFS)1. We showed that previously undetected resistant alleles can arise at low frequency, and discovered novel, partially resistant alleles that can perturb drive-invasion dynamics. We then engineered next-generation gene drives that can actively remove resistant alleles by targeting several highly conserved and non-overlapping sites in the female-specific exon of the doublesex gene. Our models predict that such gene drive designs could suppress large, natural populations of the malaria mosquito in the field.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

Since then, 6 eligible RCTs have completed, including one large trial (n=15,804).

MethodsUpdated systematic review and meta-analysis of data from RCTs of vitamin D for ARI prevention using a random effects model. Sub-group analyses were done to determine whether effects of vitamin D on risk of ARI varied according to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration, dosing regimen or age. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched between May 2020 (previous search) and April 2024. No language restrictions were imposed. Double-blind RCTs supplementing vitamin D for any duration, with placebo or low-dose vitamin D control, were eligible if approved by Research Ethics Committee and if ARI incidence was collected prospectively and pre-specified as an efficacy outcome. Aggregate data, stratified by baseline 25(OH)D concentration and age, were obtained from study authors. The study was registered with PROSPERO (no. CRD42024527191).

FindingsWe identified 6 new RCTs (19,337 participants). Data were obtained for 16,086 (83.2%) participants in 3 new RCTs and combined with data from 48,488 participants in 43 previously identified RCTs. For the primary comparison of any vitamin D vs. placebo, the intervention did not significantly affect overall ARI risk (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00, P=0.057; 40 studies; I2 26.4%). Pre-specified subgroup analysis did not reveal evidence of effect modification by age, baseline vitamin D status, or dosing regimen. Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.04; 38 studies; I2 0.0%). A funnel plot showed left-sided asymmetry (P=0.002, Eggers test).

InterpretationThis updated meta-analysis yielded a similar point estimate for the overall effect of vitamin D supplementation on ARI risk to that obtained previously, but the 95% CI for this effect estimate now spans 1.00, indicating no statistically significant protection.

Our previous meta-analysis of 43 randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation for prevention of acute respiratory infections (ARI) conducted in 2021 revealed a statistically significant protective effect of the intervention (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99).

Added value of this studyOur meta-analysis of aggregate data from 64,086 participants in 46 randomised controlled trials, stratified by baseline 25(OH)D concentration and age, provides an updated estimate of the protective effects of vitamin D against acute respiratory infection overall (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00), and in sub-groups defined by baseline vitamin D status, age, and dosing frequency, amount and duration.

Implications of all the available evidenceUpdated meta-analysis including the latest available RCT data shows no statistically significant protective effect of vitamin D supplementation against ARI, either overall or in sub-group analyses.","NA","medrxiv",1729894129710

Given that the behaviors were not observed in seven other groups in the same sanctuary (N=148), we conclude that social learning of arbitrary behavior occurred and discuss our findings considering the larger scope of animal culture.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

However, the molecular determinants and functional impact of this additional system of inheritance are poorly characterized. Through comprehensive analyses of severe DNA methylation loss over TEs in an experimental population and in >700 natural strains of Arabidopsis thaliana, we uncovered hundreds of TE epivariants in nature, most of which can be inherited independently of DNA sequence changes and thus are true epialleles. Furthermore, natural epivariants are enriched near genes and we uncovered a novel role for the Paf1 complex as a major facilitator of their prevalence. Conversely, related TE copies limit epiallelic variation, by producing the small RNAs that guide DNA methylation in trans. Crucially, natural epivariants mainly affect stress-responsive genes, making them unique targets for selection. Our findings therefore demonstrate that TEs are important mediators of transgenerational epigenetic variation in nature, with singular properties for plant adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

These cellular interactions can be considered to be representative of evolutionary steps in plastid acquisition in eukaryotes, but the underlying cellular mechanisms and dynamics are not fully understood. Here, we studied a kleptoplastidic dinoflagellate (RSD: Ross Sea Dinoflagellate), which is known to steal plastids of the microalga Phaeocystis antarctica. We tracked the morphology and activity of stolen plastids over several months by combining multimodal subcellular imaging and photophysiology. Upon integration inside a host vacuole, the volume of plastids and pyrenoids significantly increased and photosynthetic activity was boosted along with carbon fixation and transfer to the host. This may be supported by the retention of a 50-fold larger algal nucleus for [~]1 week. Once the algal nucleus was lost, there was a decrease in plastid volume and photosynthesis, but plastids were still beneficial for the host after > 2 months. Unlike other kleptoplastidic interactions, we showed that the algal mitochondrion was also stolen and retained for several months, transforming into an extensive network in close proximity with plastids. This highlights a new strategy in plankton along the continuum of plastid symbioses where both the energy-producing plastid and mitochondrion of a microalga are hijacked for several months by a host. This symbiosis that we found to be widely-distributed in polar regions suggests that plastid-mitochondrion interaction may have played a role in the evolution of plastid acquisition.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

However, recent and heavily disputed debates on data quality have raised questions on the accuracy of demographic data at older ages. Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1729894129710

We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark.

MethodsA cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza.

ResultsAmong 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80).

ConclusionCOVID-19 represented a greater disease burden than influenza, with more hospitalisations and deaths, and more severe disease primarily among non-vaccinated and comorbid patients. These results highlight the continued need for attention and public health efforts to mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2.","NA","medrxiv",1729894129710

The results indicate that Omicron BA.1.1 and its pure reverse mutants were widely distributed throughout the United States from the early days of their emergence, showing a statistically significant difference compared to other major variants, which spread from a small number of sources. The peak emergence of BA.1.1 and BA.1.1.18 pure reverse mutants occurred a few weeks before the peak of all collected samples, whereas the peak of pure reverse mutants in major BA.1 variants and BA.2 coincides with the overall sampling peak. Although the peaks of BA.1.x collections are not all synchronous, the peaks of pure reverse mutants in the BA.1 lineage completely overlap, with the number of such mutants declining abruptly after the peak. These regional and temporal anomalies in the Omicron BA.1 lineage, especially in the BA.1.1 lineage, are virtually impossible to explain by current theories of natural mutation and spread by human-to-human infection.","NA","medrxiv",1729894129710

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1729894129710

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","10.1186/s40168-024-01916-8","biorxiv",1729894129710

Principally being a gap in technology, the HaloTag toolbox lacks affinity ligands displaying good cell permeability and efficient affinity capture.
