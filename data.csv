Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866528

However, the rate at which microbial genomes are sequenced has continued to increase, and there are now datasets in the millions, far beyond the abilities of existing alignment tools. We introduce LexicMap, a nucleotide sequence alignment tool for efficiently querying moderate length sequences (> 500 bp) such as a gene, plasmid or long read against up to millions of prokaryotic genomes. A key innovation is to construct a small set of probe k-mers (e.g. n = 40,000) which window-cover the entire database to be indexed, in the sense that every 500 bp window of every database genome contains multiple seed k-mers each with a shared prefix with one of the probes. Storing these seeds, indexed by the probes with which they agree, in a hierarchical index enables fast and low-memory variable-length seed matching, pseudoalignment, and then full alignment. We show that LexicMap is able to align with higher sensitivity than Blastn as the query divergence drops from 90% to 80% for queries [&ge;] 1 kb, and then benchmark on small (GTDB) and large (AllTheBacteria and Genbank+RefSeq) databases. We show that LexicMap achieves higher sensitivity and speed and lower memory compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Alignment of a single gene against 2.34 million prokaryotic genomes from GenBank and RefSeq takes 36 seconds (rare gene) to 15 minutes (16S rRNA gene).

Las is transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) where it colonizes the phloem tissue, resulting in substantial economic losses to citrus industry worldwide. Despite extensive efforts, effective management strategies against HLB remain elusive, necessitating a deeper understanding of the pathogen's biology. Las undergoes cell-to-cell movement through phloem flow and colonizes different tissues in which Las may have varying interactions with the host. Here, we investigate the transcriptomic landscape of Las in citrus seed coat vasculatures, enabling a complete gene expression profiling of Las genome and revealing unique transcriptomic patterns compared to previous studies using midrib tissues. Comparative transcriptomics between seed coat, midrib and ACP identified specific responses and metabolic states of Las in different host tissue. Two Las virulence factors that exhibit higher expression in seed coat can suppress callose deposition. Therefore, they may contribute to unclogging sieve plate pores during Las colonization in seed coat vasculature. Furthermore, analysis of regulatory elements uncovers a potential role of LuxR-type transcription factors in regulating Liberibacter effector gene expression during plant colonization. Together, this work provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of the devastating citrus HLB.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866528

Prior to moulting, epidermal tissue peels off from the old cuticle and grows non-uniformly to shape protruding appendages, which are often branching, curving, or twisting, from the planar epidermis. This non-uniform growth is possibly regulated by the distribution of morphogens on the epidermal cell sheet. Previous studies have identified molecules and signalling pathways related to such morphogenesis; however, how local regulation of cell sheet growth can transform planar epidermis globally into complex three-dimensional structures, such as beetle horns, remains unclear. To reveal the relationship between epidermal growth regulation and generated structures, this study theoretically examined how various shapes can be generated from planar epidermis under a deductive growth model that corresponds morphogen distributions to non-uniform growth on tissue. The results show that the heterochronic expression of multiple morphogens can flexibly fuse multiple simple shapes to generate various structures emulating complex appendages of beetles. These findings indicate that morphogenesis through such a mechanism may have developmental stability and modularity, providing insights into the evolution of the diverse morphology of arthropods.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866528

Genetic variants that confer MS risk implicate genes involved in immune function3, while variants related to severity of the disease are associated with genes preferentially expressed within the CNS4. Current MS therapies decrease relapse rates by preventing immune-mediated damage of myelin, but they ultimately fail to slow long-term disease progression, which apparently depends on CNS intrinsic processes. The molecular events that trigger progressive MS are still unknown. Here we report that the C-terminal region of TAF1 (the scaffolding subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID) is underrepresented in postmortem brain tissue from individuals with MS. Furthermore, we demonstrate in vivo, in genetically modified mice, that C-terminal alteration of TAF1 suffices to induce an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-elongation deficit that particularly affects oligodendroglial myelination-related genes and results in an MS-like brain transcriptomic signature, including increased expression of proinflammatory genes. This transcriptional profile is accompanied by CNS-resident inflammation, robust demyelination and MS-like motor phenotypes. We also identify numerous interactors of C-terminal TAF1 that participate in RNAPII-promoter escape, of which two show evidence for genetic association to MS3, 4. Our study reveals that TAF1 dysfunction converges with genetic susceptibility to cause transcriptional dysregulation in CNS cell types, such as oligodendrocytes, to ultimately trigger MS.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866528

We sought to overcome this challenge using the classic catalytic triad and oxyanion hole of serine hydrolases as a model system. We used RFdiffusion1 to generate proteins housing catalytic sites of increasing complexity and varying geometry, and a newly developed ensemble generation method called ChemNet to assess active site geometry and preorganization at each step of the reaction. Experimental characterization revealed novel serine hydrolases that catalyze ester hydrolysis with catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) up to 3.8 x 103 M-1 s-1, closely match the design models (C RMSDs < 1 [A]), and have folds distinct from natural serine hydrolases. In silico selection of designs based on active site preorganization across the reaction coordinate considerably increased success rates, enabling identification of new catalysts in screens of as few as 20 designs. Our de novo buildup approach provides insight into the geometric determinants of catalysis that complements what can be obtained from structural and mutational studies of native enzymes (in which catalytic group geometry and active site makeup cannot be so systematically varied), and provides a roadmap for the design of industrially relevant serine hydrolases and, more generally, for designing complex enzymes that catalyze multi-step transformations.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866528

These inferred ARGs provide a detailed representation of genealogical relatedness along the genome and have been shown to complement genotype imputation in complex trait analyses by capturing the effects of unobserved genomic variants. An inferred ARG can be used to construct a genetic relatedness matrix, which can be leveraged within a linear mixed model for the analysis of complex traits. However, these analyses are computationally infeasible for large datasets. We introduce a computationally efficient approach, called ARG-RHE, to estimate narrow-sense heritability and perform region-based association testing using an ARG. ARG-RHE relies on scalable randomized algorithms to estimate variance components and assess their statistical significance, and can be applied to multiple quantitative traits in parallel. We conduct extensive simulations to verify the computational efficiency, statistical power, and robustness of this approach. We then apply it to detect associations between 21,374 genes and 52 blood-related traits, using an ARG inferred from genotype data of 337,464 individuals from the UK Biobank. In these analyses, combining ARG-based and imputation-based testing yields 8% more gene-trait associations than using imputation alone, suggesting that inferred genome-wide genealogies may effectively complement genotype imputation in the analysis of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866528

We isolated satellite cells from eel muscle tissue to establish a foundation for cultured eel meat production. While initial cell cultures contained myoblasts, continued passaging led to a decline in myoblast characteristics and an increase in fibroblast-like cells. RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR analyses showed significant downregulation of well-established markers for satellite cells and myoblasts, such as pax7a and myoD, over successive passages, highlighting a loss of myoblastic traits. Single-cell cloning was employed to overcome this challenge and maintain myoblast purity, leading to the successful creation of the JEM1129 cell line. These JEM1129 cells demonstrated enhanced expression of myoblast marker genes, exceeding the initial primary culture cell population. The cells showed strong myotube formation, particularly when cultured in a differentiation medium, indicating their robust potential for muscle development. The JEM1129 cell line represents a significant advancement in the cultivation of eel muscle cells, offering a promising avenue for cultured meat production.

While the level of viral replication in the nasal turbinates of the three groups of hamsters was equivalent at 4dpi, the amount of viral RNA at 1dpi was higher in D614G- and Delta-infected animals than in the Omicron group. No difference in viral RNA levels or inflammatory markers in the nasal turbinates was observed between D614G- and Delta-infected animals, except for a significantly higher level of IFN-{lambda} in the Delta group at 1dpi.

One such pathogen is the fungus Fusarium graminearum, which causes Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) disease on wheat and barley. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that F. graminearum expresses many candidate effector proteins during early phases of the infection process, some of which are annotated as proteases. However, the contributions of these proteases to virulence remains poorly defined. Here, we characterize a F. graminearum endopeptidase, FgTPP1 (FGSG_11164), that is highly upregulated during wheat spikelet infection and is secreted from fungal cells. To elucidate the potential role of FgTPP1 in F. graminearum virulence, we generated FgTPP1 deletion mutants ({Delta}Fgtpp1) and performed FHB infection assays. While the number of completely bleached spikes infected by F. graminearum wild-type reached 50% of total infected spikes, the number of fully bleached spikes infected by {Delta}Fgtpp1 mutants was 25%, suggesting FgTPP1 contributes to fungal virulence. Transient expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged FgTPP1 revealed that FgTPP1 localizes, in part, to chloroplasts and attenuates chitin-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, reactive oxygen species production, and cell death induced by an autoactive disease resistance protein when expressed in planta. Notably, the FgTPP1 protein is conserved across the Ascomycota phylum, making it a core effector among ascomycete plant pathogens. These properties make FgTPP1 an ideal candidate for decoy substrate engineering, with the goal of engineering resistance to FHB, and likely other crop diseases caused by ascomycete fungi.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866528

However, a detailed description of the pathway from the initial assembly product (procapsid) to the mature, infectious particle (virion) has been elusive. This is due to the ""in cell"" nature of the natural process, the 2-state behavior of maturation (no detectable intermediates) in some viruses in vitro and heterogeneous populations of particle intermediates that are only partially matured in other systems. The non-enveloped, T=4, ssRNA-containing, Nudaurelia capensis omega virus (N{omega}V), is a highly accessible model system that exemplifies the maturation process of a eukaryotic virus. During maturation the particle shrinks in outer diameter from 482 Angstroms (pH 7.5) to 428 Angstroms (pH 5.0). It is possible to mimic the maturation process in vitro by lowering the pH of a population of procapsids produced in heterologous systems. Indeed, by controlling the pH in vitro it is possible to produce homogenous populations of intermediate N{omega}V virus-like particles (VLPs) that occur too fleetingly to be observed in vivo. Here we report structural models, based on cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), of five intermediates in the N{omega}V maturation process. The structures of the intermediate particles reveal unique, quaternary position-dependent trajectories and refolding of subunit N and C-terminal regions, including the formation of the autocatalytic cleavage site at N570. The detailed structures reported here, coupled with previously determined structures of the procapsids and mature particles, allows the maturation pathway to be described in detail for the first time for a eukaryotic virus.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866528

To understand how neurons work together and develop to mediate number sense, we used two-photon fluorescence light sheet microscopy to capture the activity of individual neurons throughout the brain of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), while displaying a visual number stimulus to the animal. We identified number-selective neurons as early as 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) and found a proportional increase of neurons tuned to larger (>2) quantities after 3 dpf. To determine if these neurons are sufficient to encode the correct quantity, we used machine learning to predict the stimulus from the neuronal activity and observed that the prediction accuracy improves with age. Given ethanol's propensity to inhibit cognitive functions, we tested its effect on number sense and found a decrease of active number-selective neurons in the forebrain during ethanol exposure, suggesting cognitive impairment. The findings here are a significant step towards understanding neural circuits devoted to discrete magnitudes and our methodology to track single neuron activity across the whole brain is broadly applicable to other fields in neuroscience.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866528

Understanding drought responses in plants at a cellular level is a crucial first step towards engineering improved drought resilience. However, the molecular responses to drought are complex as they depend on multiple factors including the severity of drought, the profiled organ, its developmental stage or even the cell types therein. Thus, deciphering the transcriptional responses to drought is specially challenging. Here, we investigated tissue-specific responses to mild drought in young Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) leaves using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). To preserve transcriptional integrity during cell isolation, we inhibited RNA synthesis using the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, demonstrating the benefits of transcriptome fixation for studying mild stress responses at single-cell level. We present a curated and validated single-cell atlas comprising 50,797 high-quality cells from almost all known cell types present in the leaf. We show that the mesophyll contains two spatially separated cell populations with distinct responses to drought: one enriched in canonical abscisic acid-related drought-responsive genes, and another one depicting iron starvation responses. Our study thus reveals a dual adaptive mechanism of the leaf mesophyll in response to mild drought and provides a valuable resource for future research on stress responses.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866528

Recently, we developed a technique for tracking rapid (framewise) fluctuations in network connectivity over time. Here, we show that these ""edge time series"" are mathematically equivalent to interaction terms in a specific family of general linear models. We exploit this fact to further demonstrate that time-varying connectivity carries explanatory power above and beyond brain activations.

Modulating stomatal density can alter this exchange, and thus presents a target for engineering improved crop productivity and climate resilience. Here, we show that stomatal density in Arabidopsis thaliana can be decreased by the expression of a water-forming NAD(P)H oxidase targeted to stomatal precursor cells. We demonstrate that this reduction in stomatal density occurs irrespective of whether the expressed enzyme is targeted to the cytosol, chloroplast stroma, or chloroplast intermembrane space of these cells. We reveal that this decrease in stomatal density occurs in the absence of any measurable impact on stomatal dynamics, or the efficiency or thermal sensitivity of photosynthesis. Consequently, overexpression plants exhibit a higher intrinsic water use efficiency due to an increase in CO2 fixed per unit water transpired. Finally, we demonstrate that this enhanced water-use efficiency translates to an improvement in vegetative growth and biomass accumulation under water-deficit conditions. Together, these results thus provide a novel approach for enhancing plant productivity through metabolic engineering of stomatal density.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866528

To date, reported influenza A(H5N1) human cases have typically occurred in the lower respiratory tract with a high case fatality rate. There is prior evidence of some influenza A(H5N1) strains being just five amino acid mutations away from achieving droplet transmissibility, possibly allowing them to be spread between humans. Three of these amino acid mutations must occur within a single human host, though the exact probability of such mutations occurring is not currently known. Here, we present a mechanistic within-host infection model for influenza A(H5N1), novel for its explicit consideration of the biological differences between the upper and lower respiratory tracts. These developments enable us to estimate a distribution of viral lifespans and effective replication rates in human H5N1 influenza cases. We combine our within-host model with a viral mutation model to determine the probability of an infected individual generating a droplet transmissible strain of influenza A(H5N1) through mutation. For three required mutations, we found a peak probability of approximately 10^-3 that a human case of H5N1 influenza produces at least one virion during the infectious period. Our findings provide insights into the risk of differing infectious pathways of influenza A(H5N1) (namely the avian-human vs the avian-mammal-human routes), demonstrating the three-mutation pathway being a cause of concern in human cases. Additionally, our framework - combining a within-host infection model with a branching process model for viral mutation - is generalisable to other pathogens, allowing mutation probabilities to be more easily ascertained. Our findings are a starting point for further modelling of influenza A(H5N1) and other pathogens where differing tissue susceptibilities and human-to-human transmission is of concern.","NA","medrxiv",1725314866528

Here we recorded the paths of desert ants navigating in their natural habitat under various displacement conditions. We demonstrate that ants learn continuously the routes they travel and memorize them in one trial, without the need for reward or punishment, and even if these routes are meandering and do not lead to places of interest: a concept called ""latent learning"", which is typically associated with the formation of map-like representation in vertebrates. Yet, the failure of ants to solve simple artificial navigation tasks -even with the goal being clearly visible- reveals that they relied on egocentric visual memories without map-like representation of the surrounding space. Our results unveil the rules governing the formation and recall of latent memories. A model shows that it can be implemented in the insect's Mushroom bodies brain area through dynamic interactions between short- and long-lasting memories.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866528

Here we use microscopy-based in vitro reconstitutions to demonstrate that NuMA is a dynein adaptor, activating processive dynein motility together with dynein's cofactors dynactin and Lissencephaly-1 (Lis1). Additionally, we find that NuMA binds and stabilizes microtubule minus ends, allowing dynein/dynactin/NuMA to transport microtubule minus ends as cargo to other minus ends. We further show that the microtubule-nucleating {gamma}-tubulin ring complex ({gamma}TuRC) hinders NuMA binding. This shows that either {gamma}TuRC needs to be released or microtubules need to be severed to generate free minus ends before they can be incorporated into spindle poles by dynein/dynactin/NuMA.

Thyroid disorders occur frequently and include congenital hypothyroidism, which occurs due to aberrant thyroid development (thyroid dysgenesis) or impaired hormone synthesis and is particularly prevalent in trisomy 21 (T21). In contrast, thyroid carcinoma, an acquired disorder, is the most common endocrine malignancy in both paediatric and adult populations. Understanding the molecular basis of thyroid dysgenesis and paediatric thyroid carcinoma remains challenging, and requires an improved understanding of foetal thyroid development. To address this, we generated a comprehensive spatiotemporal atlas of the human thyroid during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. Profiling over 200,000 cells with single-cell sequencing revealed key cell types involved in thyroid gland development, including the hormone-producing thyrocytes. We discovered that foetal thyroid follicular cells are heterogeneous epithelial populations consisting of two main functional subtypes (fTFC1, fTFC2), with fTFC2 expressing increased levels of PAX8, and spatial transcriptomics revealed subtype co-occurrence within individual follicles. While both fTFC1 and fTFC2 persist in adult thyroid, fTFC2 is a minor population amongst additional PAX8-positive follicular cell subsets. We observed thyroid dysgenesis in T21 age-matched specimens, and T21 thyrocytes showed transcriptional signatures of cytoskeletal disorganisation and altered interactions with the extracellular matrix, as well as compensatory activation of metabolic stress gene programs and upregulation of thyroid biosynthetic genes. In line with the altered proportions of fTFC2 in healthy foetal and adult thyroid, papillary thyroid cancer in children is transcriptionally enriched for the fTFC2 signature compared to that in adults. All together, these findings reveal thyrocyte heterogeneity across the lifespan and provide insights into thyroid development in health and disease, informing potential therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866528

While the mechanism underlying the dysregulation of alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease is unclear, it is thought that prionoid cell-to-cell propagation of alpha-synuclein has an important role. Through a high throughput screen, we recently identified 38 genes whose knock down modulates alpha-synuclein propagation. Follow up experiments were undertaken for two of those genes, TAX1BP1 and ADAMTS19, to study the mechanism with which they regulate alpha-synuclein homeostasis. We used a recently developed M17D neuroblastoma cell line expressing triple mutant (E35K+E46K+E61K) ""3K"" alpha-synuclein under doxycycline induction. 3K alpha-synuclein spontaneously forms inclusions that show ultrastructural similarities to Lewy Bodies. Experiments using that cell line showed that TAX1BP1 and ADAMTS19 regulate how alpha-synuclein interacts with lipids and phase separates into inclusions, respectively, adding to the growing body of evidence implicating those processes in Parkinson's disease. Through RNA sequencing, we identified several genes that are differentially expressed after knock-down of TAX1BP1 or ADAMTS19. Burden analysis revealed that those differentially expressed genes (DEGs) carry an increased frequency of rare risk variants in Parkinson's disease patients versus healthy controls, an effect that was independently replicated across two separate cohorts (GP2 and AMP-PD). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) showed that the DEGs cluster within modules in regions of the brain that develop high degrees of alpha-synuclein pathology (basal ganglia, cortex). We propose a novel model for the genetic architecture of sporadic Parkinson's disease: increased burden of risk variants across genetic networks dysregulates pathways underlying alpha-synuclein homeostasis, thereby leading to pathology and neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866528

The numerosity of recently viewed images influences our perception of the current image's numerosity: numerosity adaptation. How does numerosity adaptation affect responses to numerosity in the brain? Recent studies show both early visual responses that monotonically increase with numerosity, and later numerosity-tuned responses that peak at different (preferred) numerosities in different neural populations. We have recently shown that numerosity adaptation affects the preferred numerosity of numerosity-tuned neural populations. We have also shown that early visual monotonic responses reflect image contrast, which follows numerosity closely. Here we ask how monotonic responses in the early visual cortex are affected by adaptation to different numerosities, using ultra-high field (7T) fMRI and neural model-based analyses. FMRI response amplitudes increased monotonically with numerosity throughout the early visual field maps (V1-V3, hV4, LO1-LO2 & V3A/B). This increase in response amplitudes becomes less steep after adaptation to higher numerosities, with this effect becoming stronger through the early visual hierarchy. This suppression of responses to numerosity is consistent with perceptual effects where adaptation to high numerosities reduces the perceived numerosity. These results imply that numerosity adaptation effects in later numerosity-tuned neural populations may originate in early visual areas that respond to image contrast in the adapting image.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866528

Here, we establish a method for labeling the differentiating neurons of specific birthdates. Using this method, we traced the four-day differentiation process of in vivo deep-layer excitatory neurons in mouse embryonic cortex and examined the changes in the genome-wide transcription pattern and chromatin accessibility with RNA-seq and DNase-seq, respectively.

Now, we demonstrate that ribosomal biosynthesis generates a key noncanonical 3-nitrotyrosine building block for the nonribosomal synthesis of rufomycin. In this pathway, a biarylitide-type ribosomal peptide is nitrated by a modified cytochrome P450 crosslinking enzyme, with the nitrated residue liberated by the actions of a dedicated protease found within the rufomycin gene cluster before being incorporated into rufomycin by the rufomycin nonribosomal peptide synthetase. This resolves the enigmatic origins of 3-nitrotyrosine within rufomycin biosynthesis and demonstrates unexpected integration of ribosomal peptide synthesis as a mechanism for the generation of noncanonical building blocks within nonribosomal synthesis pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866528

This study investigated the potential of metformin as a novel treatment for IIH, exploring its effects on disease outcomes and safety profile. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX database, analyzing data from 2009 to August 2024. Patients diagnosed with IIH were included, with exclusions for other causes of elevated intracranial pressure and pre-existing diabetes. Propensity score matching was employed to balance cohorts according to age, sex, race, ethnicity, Hemoglobin A1C, and baseline body mass index (BMI) at the time of metformin initiation. Outcomes were assessed at various follow-up points up to 24 months. Results: The study initially comprised 1,268 patients in the metformin group and 49,262 in the control group, with notable disparities in several parameters. Post-matching, both cohorts were refined to 1,267 patients each after matching with metformin group. Metformin-treated patients showed significantly lower risks of papilledema, headache, and refractory IIH status at all follow-up points (p<0.0001). The metformin group also had reduced rates of therapeutic spinal punctures and acetazolamide continuation. BMI reductions were more pronounced in the metformin group, with significant differences observed from 6 months onward (p<0.0001). Notably, metformin's beneficial effects persisted independently of BMI changes. The safety profile of metformin was favorable, with no significant differences in adverse events compared to the control group which did not receive metformin during the study timeframe. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for metformin's potential as a disease-modifying therapeutic approach in IIH, demonstrating improvements across multiple outcomes. The benefits appear to extend beyond weight loss, suggesting complex mechanisms of action. These findings warrant further investigation through prospective clinical trials to establish metformin's role in IIH management and explore its underlying therapeutic mechanisms.","NA","medrxiv",1725314866528

Here, we identify Paralemmin-1 (Palm1) as a new component and regulator of the MPS. Palm1 binds to the N-terminal region of {beta}II-spectrin, a core MPS component, and is periodically organized along the axon in hippocampal neurons. Applying the 3D imaging power of MINFLUX, we locate Palm1 in close proximity (<20 nm) to the actin-capping protein and MPS component adducin. Functionally, Palm1 overexpression enhances the degree of periodicity of several MPS proteins ({beta}II-spectrin, adducin, and ankyrinB) without altering their local concentrations, while the knock-out severely compromises the MPS structure and modifies electrophysiological properties of neurons. Both the MPS-binding and remodelling activities of Palm1 are abolished by mutating a single amino acid (W54A) in the conserved Paralemmin sequence motif. Our findings identify Palm1 as the first protein specifically dedicated to organizing the MPS, and will advance the understanding of the regulation of MPS assembly and remodelling, as well as of the Paralemmin protein family.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866529

We study the material properties of small spheroids of human periosteum-derived cells as they effect spheroid fusion, an elementary operation for constructing large tissue structures. We use two-photon confocal microscopy to measure cell-cell tension and individual cell motility throughout fusion. Cytoskeletal inhibition through Y-27632 (ROCKi) results in more granular tissues with decreased cell rearrangements, but accelerated fusion. Further reducing cell contractility with blebbistatin and ROCKi increases tissue granularity, decreases rearrangements, and slows down fusion. In all conditions, complete fusion is associated with frequent cellular rearrangements. Using a novel computational model that represents tissue material as an active cellular foam, with cells depicted as viscous shells with interfacial tension and persistent, random motility, we construct a phase diagram of spheroid fusion in function of relative cell-cell tension and cell motility. Our results reveal a close relationship between microscopic tissue fluidity and the visco-elastic properties of spheroid fusion. Additionally, we find that cell-cell friction promotes arrested fusion by inducing jamming through a distinct physical mechanism. Combined, our findings offer a framework for understanding spheroid fusion dynamics that can aid in the robust generation of large tissue constructs for regenerative medicine.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866529

However, our understanding of how vision encodes sensory and emotional-affective aspects of observed touch, and the timing of these processes, is still limited. Here we address this gap by investigating the neural dynamics of visual touch observation by analysing electroencephalographic (EEG) data from participants viewing detailed hand interactions from the Validated Touch-Video Database. We examined how the brain encodes basic body cues such as hand orientation and viewing perspective, in addition to sensory aspects, including the type of touch (e.g., stroking vs. pressing; hand vs. object touch) and the object involved (e.g., knife, brush), as well as emotional-affective dimensions. Using multivariate decoding, information about body cues was present within 60 ms, with sensory and emotional details, including valence, arousal, and pain present around 130 ms, demonstrating efficient early visual processing. Threat was most clearly identified by approximately 265 ms, similarly involving visual regions, suggesting that such evaluations require slightly extended neural engagement. Our findings reveal that bottom-up, automatic visual processing is integral to complex tactile assessments, important for rapidly extracting both the personal relevance and the sensory and emotional dimensions of touch.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866529

This study aimed to create normative growth charts for brain structure across the macaque lifespan, enhancing our understanding of neurodevelopment and aging, and facilitating cross-species translational research. Leveraging data from the PRIMatE Data Exchange (PRIME-DE) and other sources, we aggregated 1,522 MRI scans from 1,024 rhesus macaques. We mapped non-linear developmental trajectories for global and regional brain structural changes in volume, cortical thickness, and surface area over the lifespan. Our findings provided normative charts with centile scores for macaque brain structures and revealed key developmental milestones from prenatal stages to aging, highlighting both species-specific and comparable brain maturation patterns between macaques and humans. The charts offer a valuable resource for future NHP studies, particularly those with small sample sizes.

We observed two groups of differentially regulated genes: i) with robust changes in mRNA and protein levels, and ii) with protein/RNA discordances. Many of the latter are classified as interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) but have no reported antiviral activity. This suggests that IFN-dependent changes in mRNA levels do not imply antiviral function. Phosphoproteomics revealed an additional regulatory layer involving non-signalling proteins with altered phosphorylation. Indeed, we confirmed that several permissiveness-associated proteins with changes in abundance or phosphorylation regulate infection fitness.

However, when gene expression is affected jointly by time and cellular identity, analyzing such data -- including conducting cell type annotation and modeling cell type-dependent dynamics -- becomes challenging. To address this problem, we propose SNOW (SiNgle cell flOW map), a deep learning algorithm to deconvolve single cell time series data into time- dependent and time-independent contributions. SNOW has a number of advantages. First, it enables cell type annotation based on the time-independent dimensions. Second, it yields a probabilistic model that can be used to discriminate between biological temporal variation and batch effects contaminating individual timepoints, and provides an approach to mitigate batch effects. Finally, it is capable of projecting cells forward and backward in time, yielding time series at the individual cell level. This enables gene expression dynamics to be studied without the need for clustering or pseudobulking, which can be error prone and result in information loss. We describe our probabilistic framework in detail and demonstrate SNOW using data from three distinct time course scRNA-seq studies. Our results show that SNOW is able to construct biologically meaningful latent spaces, remove batch effects, and generate realistic time-series at the single-cell level. By way of example, we illustrate how the latter may be used to enhance the detection of cell type-specific circadian gene expression rhythms, and may be readily extended to other time-series analyses.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866529

Publicly available data sets of contact data are however typically recorded over short time windows with respect to the duration of an epidemic. To inform models of disease transmission, data are thus often repeated several times, yielding synthetic data covering long enough timescales. Looping over short term data to approximate contact patterns on longer timescales can lead to unrealistic transmission chains because of the deterministic repetition of all contacts, without any renewal of the contact partners of each individual between successive periods. Real contacts indeed include a combination of regularly repeated contacts (e.g., due to friendship relations) and of more casual ones. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to longitudinally extend contact data recorded in a school setting, taking into account this dual aspect of contacts and in particular the presence of repeated contacts due to friendships. To illustrate the interest of such an algorithm, we then simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on our synthetic contacts using an agent-based model specific to the school setting. We compare the results with simulations performed on synthetic data extended with simpler algorithms to determine the impact of preserving friendships in the data extension method. Notably, the preservation of friendships does not strongly affect transmission routes between classes in the school but has a clear impact on the infection pathways between individual students. Our results moreover indicate that gathering contact data during two days in a population is sufficient to generate realistic synthetic contact sequences between individuals in that population on longer timescales. The proposed tool will allow modellers to leverage existing contact data, and contributes to the design of optimal future field data collection.","NA","medrxiv",1725314866529

In zebrafish, these two ribosome types are expressed from different genomic loci and also differ in their ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence. To characterize this dual ribosome system further, we examined the expression patterns of maternal and somatic rRNAs during embryogenesis and in adult tissues. We found that maternal rRNAs are not only expressed during oogenesis but are continuously produced in the zebrafish germline. Proteomic analyses of maternal and somatic ribosomes unveiled differences in core ribosomal protein composition. Most nucleotide differences between maternal and somatic rRNAs are located in the flexible, structurally not resolved expansion segments. Our in vivo data demonstrated that both maternal and somatic ribosomes can be translationally active in the embryo. Using transgenically tagged maternal or somatic ribosome subunits, we experimentally confirm the presence of hybrid 80S ribosomes composed of 40S and 60S subunits from both origins and demonstrate the preferential in vivo association of maternal ribosomes with germline-specific transcripts. Our study identifies a distinct type of ribosomes in the zebrafish germline and thus presents a foundation for future explorations into possible regulatory mechanisms and functional roles of heterogeneous ribosomes.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866529

A large structural intronic variant is associated with a robust reduction of Zhx2 expression in J mice, which we hypothesized enhances OMOR levels and OXY addiction-like behaviors. We tested this hypothesis by restoring the Zhx2 loss-of-function in Js (MVKO) and modeling the loss-of-function variant through knocking out the Zhx2 coding exon (E3KO) in Bys and assessing brain OXY metabolite levels and behavior. Consistent with our hypothesis, Zhx2 E3KO females showed an increase in brain OMOR levels and OXY-induced locomotor activity. However, contrary to our hypothesis, state-dependent expression of OXY-CPP was decreased in E3KO females and increased in E3KO males. We also overexpressed Zhx2 in the livers and brains of Js and observed Zhx2 overexpression in select brain regions that was associated with reduced OXY state-dependent learning. Integrative transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of E3KO mice identified astrocyte function, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix properties, and endothelial cell functions as pathways influencing brain OXY metabolite concentration and behavior. These results support Zhx2 as a quantitative trait gene underlying brain OMOR concentration that is associated with changes in OXY behavior and implicate potential quantitative trait mechanisms that together inform our overall understanding of Zhx2 in brain function.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866529

Accordingly, we performed a multicohort longitudinal analysis between PD and healthy ageing, examining subcortical regions implicated in PD pathology, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, corpus callosum (CC), and cerebellum. Longitudinal volumetric analysis was performed on 56 early PD patients and 53 matched controls, with scans collected 2-3 years apart. At baseline, the PD group showed a greater volume in the pallidum, thalamus, and cerebellar white matter (WM), suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms in prodromal and early PD. After 2-3 years, accelerated atrophy in PD was observed in the putamen and cerebellar WM. Interestingly, healthy controls - but not PD patients - demonstrated a significant decline in Total Intracranial Volume (TIV), and atrophy in the thalamus and mid-CC. Between-group analysis revealed more severe atrophy in the right striatum and cerebellar WM in PD, and in the mid-posterior CC in controls. Using CEREbellum Segmentation (CERES) for lobule segmentation on the longitudinal PD cohort, we found a significant decline in the WM of non-motor regions in the cerebellum, specifically Crus I and lobule IX.

This neural spread of association predicts overgeneralisation errors measured in behaviour, and is predicted by physiological markers for noradrenergic arousal, namely an increase in the pupil dilation response and reduced cortical GABAergic tone. Thus, noradrenaline sets the width of the 'smoothing kernel' for plasticity across the cognitive map.

In this study, we address a key question of the repeatability of molecular evolution by investigating the convergent and lineage-specific molecular mechanisms underlying dietary adaptations in four major sugar-consuming bird lineages: hummingbirds, parrots, honeyeaters, and sunbirds. We assembled nine new genomes for sugar-consuming species and their closely related non-sugar feeding outgroup species and generated 90 tissue-specific transcriptomes for six key species. We identified signatures of positive selection in both protein-coding and non-coding regulatory sequences, and found positive selection targets the same genes more frequently in sugar-feeders compared to non-sugar feeding controls, suggesting that adapting to a high-sugar diet requires changes in a limited number of genetic elements. At the functional level, pathways associated with energy homeostasis, carbohydrate metabolism, heart function, and hormonal regulation showed convergent selection signals in both protein-coding and regulatory evolution, while lipid and amino acid metabolism demonstrated mostly regulatory evolution. Notably, we observed striking evidence for convergent adaptation in MLXIPL, a transcription factor regulating sugar and lipid homeostasis, manifesting in both sequence and regulatory changes across all sugar-feeders. With functional assays, we demonstrated that hummingbird MLXIPL enhances sugar-induced transcriptional activity in HEK239 cells, suggesting its central role in the evolution of adaptations to high-sugar diets. Our findings elucidate the main genomic targets in the evolution of sugar-feeding at both molecular and pathway levels.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866529

The non-structural protein 16 (nsp16) of SARS-CoV-2, in complex with nsp10, catalyses the final step of viral mRNA capping via its 2-O-methylase activity. This function helps the virus evade host immunity and protect viral mRNA from degradation. Current literature has not thoroughly investigated the host factors that regulate nsp16. Although various E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, their specific roles in targeting nsp16 for degradation have not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that nsp16 is ubiquitinated and degraded by host E3 ubiquitin ligases UBR5 and MARCHF7, acting through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). UBR5 and MARCHF7 induce nsp16 degradation via K48-and K27-linked ubiquitination, respectively. Moreover, this degradation by either UBR5 or MARCHF7 is independent, and both processes inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro as well as in vivo. Further, UBR5 and MARCHF7 exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral potential by degrading nsp16 variants from different SARS-CoV-2 strains. Our findings provide novel insights into the role of the UPS in antagonising SARS-CoV-2 replication and open new avenues for therapeutic interventions against COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866529

Differences in copy number and other sources of extrinsic noise generate variance in transgene expression and limit the performance of synthetic gene circuits. In a therapeutic context, supraphysiological expression of transgenes can compromise engineered phenotypes and lead to toxicity. To ensure a narrow range of transgene expression, we design and characterize Compact microRNA-Mediated Attenuator of Noise and Dosage (ComMAND), a single-transcript, microRNA-based incoherent feedforward loop. We experimentally tune the ComMAND output profile, and we model the system to explore additional tuning strategies. By comparing ComMAND to two-gene implementations, we highlight the precise control afforded by the single-transcript architecture, particularly at relatively low copy numbers. We show that ComMAND tightly regulates transgene expression from lentiviruses and precisely controls expression in primary human T cells, primary rat neurons, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and human induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, ComMAND effectively sets levels of the clinically relevant transgenes FMRP1 and FXN within a narrow window. Together, ComMAND is a compact tool well-suited to precisely specify expression of therapeutic cargoes.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866529

However, this level of detail is typically difficult to attain in macromolecular crystallography because the diffracted intensities rapidly fade with increasing resolution. The problem cannot be circumvented by increasing the fluence as this leads to detrimental radiation damage. Previously, we demonstrated that high quality MicroED data can be obtained at low flux conditions using electron counting with direct electron detectors. The improved sensitivity and accuracy of these detectors essentially eliminate the read-out noise, such that the measurement of faint high-resolution reflections is limited by other sources of noise. Inelastic scattering is a major contributor of such noise, increasing background counts and broadening diffraction spots. Here, we demonstrate that a substantial improvement in signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved using an energy filter to largely remove the inelastically scattered electrons. This strategy resulted in sub-atomic resolution MicroED data from proteinase K crystals, enabling accurate structure modelling and the visualization of detailed features. Interestingly, filtering out the noise revealed diffuse scattering phenomena that can hold additional structural information. Our findings suggest that combining energy filtering and electron counting can provide more accurate measurements at higher resolution, providing better insights into protein function and facilitating more precise model refinement.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866529

Determining the origin time of genes facilitates the elucidation of crucial genetic mechanisms underlying significant biological evolutionary questions such as the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life, the emergence of mammals, the origin of humans, as well as the development of species- or lineage-specific traits. However, accurately determining the origin time of these genes in species separated by long evolutionary distances remains a major challenge in bioinformatics as these genes often undergo significant changes in their genome sequences, making it difficult to trace them back to their origin. Here, we proposed a new approach for dating gene age based on the micro- and macro-synteny algorithms. This approach employs the parallel computation of orthologous genome alignments across multiple species. Our method was integrated into the GageTracker (Gene Age Tracker) software, providing a fast and accurate way to trace gene age with minimal user input, available at https://github.com/RiversDong/GageTracker. Benchmarked against the simMammals dataset (Alignathon), GageTracker achieved the same high-quality genome alignments as the optimized LastZ aligner, but improved operation speed by 1.4-7 times. In a separate analysis of 12 Drosophila genomes, GageTracker efficiently assessed the ages of 23,720 genes (including ~13,965 protein-coding genes) in just ~22 hours with default parameters. When comparing with the GenTree database (recognized as the most comprehensive and accurate tool for evaluating gene age), GageTracker achieved an impressive ~94.4% accuracy and ~99% macro consistency in assessing the age of protein-coding genes. Moreover, for the ~5.6% conflicting genes, GageTracker displayed slightly higher support rates than GenTree, as evidenced by data from OrthoDB, FlyBase, and Ensembl ortholog databases. Notably, younger genes identified by GageTracker exhibited a preferential expression pattern in the testis, further reinforcing the reliability of GageTracker in accurately tracing gene age.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866529

We discovered that the SR62 locus consists of a digenic module encoding Sr62TK and an NLR (Sr62NLR). AvrSr62 binds to the N-terminal kinase of Sr62TK. This triggers displacement of the C-terminal kinase allowing it to recruit Sr62NLR for activation of immune responses. Understanding the mechanism of this two-component resistance complex will help engineering and breeding for durable resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866529

For example, p53 deficiency in some mice has been shown to rescue premature aging while others display significant aging phenotype when p53-deficient. This study seeks to elucidate, structurally and mechanistically, p53s roles in longevity. Through a relative evolutionary scoring (RES) algorithm, we quantify the level of evolutionary change in the residues of p53 across organisms of varying average lifespans in six taxonomic orders. Secondly, we used PEPPI to assess the likelihood of interaction between p53-or p53-linked proteins-and known senescence-regulating proteins across organisms in the orders Primates and Perciformes. Our RES algorithm found variations in the alignments within and across orders, suggesting that mechanisms of p53-mediated regulation of longevity may vary. PEPPI results suggest that longer-lived species may have evolved to regulate induction and inhibition of cellular senescence better than their shorter-lived counterparts. With experimental verification, these predictions could help elucidate the mechanisms of p53-mediated cellular senescence, ultimately clarifying our understanding of p53s connection to aging in a multiple-species context.

Author summaryThe p53 tumor suppressor protein protects our genome from cancers by repairing DNA damage, regulating cell death and/or pushing cells to a state where they become permanently unable to divide (known as cellular senescence). An accumulation of senescent cells produces various molecular features of aging in both mouse and human cellular models-thus linking p53 to the aging process. However, the molecular mechanism by which p53 regulates aging and its structural implications on this regulation are not clear. In this study, we assessed quantitatively the evolutionary differences in p53 sequences of organisms across several taxonomical orders to determine if there is a relationship between average lifespan and sequence evolution. In addition, we used a protein-protein interaction tool to assess the likelihood of interaction between p53, or p53-associated protein, and various senescence-associated proteins across organisms of various lifespans in two taxonomic orders: Primates and Perciformes. An elucidation of p53 structural difference and mechanistic proteomic network linked to p53 regulation of cellular senescence could advance therapeutics targeting abnormal aging.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866529

This study aims to determine cost-saving risk thresholds for statin use in Germany to inform better prescription practices and healthcare policies.

MethodsA decision-analytic approach was employed, using secondary data to compare statin use with no statin use from the perspective of German sickness fund insurees. The analysis focused on cost savings from avoided cardiovascular (CV) events, translating these avoided events into net savings after accounting for treatment costs and potential side effects. The study considered the German adult population insured by sickness funds and used a lifetime horizon for the analysis.

ResultsThe maximum number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve cost savings over 10 years was found to be 40, leading to a minimum risk threshold for savings of 9.8%. It was estimated that approximately 22% of the adult population in Germany has a 10-year CV risk of [&ge;]9.8%, potentially avoiding between 307,049 and 705,537 CV events over 10 years, with net population savings of approximately {euro}18 billion.

ConclusionsThe current official threshold for statin prescription in Germany, set at a 20% 10-year risk, is too stringent. Lowering the threshold to 9.8% could significantly increase the number of patients benefiting from statin therapy, reducing CV events and generating substantial cost savings. These findings suggest that adjustments to prescription guidelines could improve cardiovascular outcomes and economic efficiency within the German healthcare system.","NA","medrxiv",1725314866529

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1725314866529

Foremost among these factors are early life influences impacting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. During infancy, both the microbiota and immune system are influenced by maternal factors contributing to key events in the neonatal GI tract. Despite the well-known importance of maternal factors on infant immune development, whether maternal immune dysregulation and dysbiosis can perpetuate the same in offspring remains largely unknown. To explore how these maternal factors impact offspring disease development, we used IgA-deficiency induced maternal dysbiosis in Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) dams to study T1D development in their progeny. We found that maternal dysbiosis led to changes in IgA-sufficient offspring immune development resulting in heightened GI immune activity. Maternal dysbiosis also contributed to altered microbiome establishment in progeny, such that pups exhibited reduced colonic abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Clostridoides difficile. In adulthood, these mice exhibited a lowered incidence of T1D. This protection was replicated by fostering high incidence offspring to dysbiotic dams, prompting us to propose that altered breast milk composition in dysbiotic dams can influence immune development and microbiome establishment in offspring, contributing to T1D resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866529

To date, the cnidarian Turritopsis dohrnii is the only known species capable of undergoing reverse development after the onset of sexual reproduction. Here, we demonstrate that the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi is capable of reversal from mature lobate to early cydippid when fed following a period of stress. Our findings illuminate central aspects of ctenophore development, ecology, and evolution, and show the high potential of M. leidyi as a new model system to study reverse development and rejuvenation. Besides shedding light on the plasticity of developmental programs, our results raise fundamental questions about early animal development, body plans and life cycles.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866529

Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness.

This study compared leading commercial blood tests for amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.

MethodsPlasma samples from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were assayed with AD blood tests from C2N Diagnostics, Fujirebio Diagnostics, ALZPath, Janssen, Roche Diagnostics, and Quanterix. Outcomes measures were amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, cortical thickness, and dementia severity. Logistic regression models assessed the classification accuracies of individual or combined plasma biomarkers for binarized outcomes, and Spearman correlations evaluated continuous relationships between individual plasma biomarkers and continuous outcomes.

ResultsMeasures of plasma p-tau217, either individually or in combination with other plasma biomarkers, had the strongest relationships with all AD outcomes.

DiscussionThis study identified the plasma biomarker analytes and assays that most accurately classified amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1725314866529

From this family, we estimate an average of 192 DNMs per generation, including 75.5 de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 7.4 non-tandem repeat indels, 79.6 de novo indels or structural variants (SVs) originating from tandem repeats, 7.7 centromeric de novo SVs and SNVs, and 12.4 de novo Y chromosome events per generation. STRs and VNTRs are the most mutable with 32 loci exhibiting recurrent mutation through the generations. We accurately assemble 288 centromeres and six Y chromosomes across the generations, documenting de novo SVs, and demonstrate that the DNM rate varies by an order of magnitude depending on repeat content, length, and sequence identity. We show a strong paternal bias (75-81%) for all forms of germline DNM, yet we estimate that 17% of de novo SNVs are postzygotic in origin with no paternal bias. We place all this variation in the context of a high-resolution recombination map ([~]3.5 kbp breakpoint resolution). We observe a strong maternal recombination bias (1.36 maternal:paternal ratio) with a consistent reduction in the number of crossovers with increasing paternal (r=0.85) and maternal (r=0.65) age. However, we observe no correlation between meiotic crossover locations and de novo SVs, arguing against non-allelic homologous recombination as a predominant mechanism. The use of multiple orthogonal technologies, near-telomere-to-telomere phased genome assemblies, and a multi-generation family to assess transmission has created the most comprehensive, publicly available ""truth set"" of all classes of genomic variants. The resource can be used to test and benchmark new algorithms and technologies to understand the most fundamental processes underlying human genetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1725314866529

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1725314866529
