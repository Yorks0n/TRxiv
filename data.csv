Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1740694113801

The first cultured representatives revealed valuable insight3,4 but are distantly related to the first eukaryotic common ancestor (FECA), leaving many unknowns regarding this archaeon's biology. Here, we report isolation of two strains belonging to the order proposed as FECA's closest relative, 'Hodarchaeales',5 as members of a pure co- and tri-culture with methanogenic partners. Both are obligately anaerobic, syntrophic, peptide-degrading, and mesophilic archaea that have simple internal cell structure and produce protrusions and vesicles, like Promethearchaeales3,4. All strains demonstrate behavior focused on cell construction rather than division, unlike typical prokaryotes6. Strain HC1 possesses genes associated with aerobic lifestyles but lacks complete pathways for aerobic respiration and co-cultures cannot grow under (micro)aerobic conditions, suggesting the genes support oxygen detoxification rather than respiration. Reflecting this, HC1 can survive and grow under microaerobic conditions only when aerobic organisms are present. Phylogenetic analyses indicate FECA may have possessed these genes and thus some aerotolerance. Physiological, genomic, and phylogenetic observations indicate FECA was a simple-celled anaerobic syntrophic peptide-degrading archaeon with a non-growth-centric lifestyle and potential adaptations towards an oxygenated planet--the archaea-eukaryote transition was steep in both cell structure and aerobiosis.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

However, due to their limited genome size, viruses must adopt unique strategies to confront cellular sensors. Since emerging in humans, SARS-CoV-2 has accrued multiple mutations throughout its genome, some of which enhanced virus replication and led to the rise of viral variants. However, the biological consequences of many of these changes remain to be discovered. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 produces a truncated form of the nucleocapsid protein, called N*M210. Due to the acquisition of a viral transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) in the N gene, certain variants, such as Omicron, produce a new viral mRNA that markedly increases N*M210 expression. We show that N*M210 is a dsRNA binding protein, which inhibits multiple arms of the cellular antiviral response, including blocking interferon induction and inhibiting stress granule formation. We created a panel of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 viruses (rSARS-2) with mutations in the N gene that increased or decreased N*M210 production. We show that N*M210 production increases virus fitness, as viruses that produce more N*M210 outcompeted wild-type rSARS-2. We demonstrate that the fitness advantage provided by N*M210 is partly due to its ability to potently block stress granules. We propose a model where, to evade the cellular antiviral response, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a mechanism to increase the production of a truncated form of the N protein, which broadly limits the activation of dsRNA-induced antiviral responses, tipping the balance in favour of the virus in the battle for control of the cell.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

Confirmatory bifactor models were used to create harmonized psychiatric phenotypes that capture major dimensions of psychopathology. Following rigorous quality assurance, neuroimaging data were carefully curated and processed using consistent pipelines in a reproducible manner with DataLad, the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC), and FreeSurfer. Initial analyses of RBC data emphasize the benefit of careful quality assurance and data harmonization in delineating developmental effects and associations with psychopathology. Critically, all RBC data - including harmonized psychiatric phenotypes, unprocessed images, and fully processed imaging derivatives - are openly shared without a data use agreement via the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative. Together, RBC facilitates large-scale, reproducible, and generalizable research in developmental and psychiatric neuroscience.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

Nanopore sequencing has long held the promise for such progress, but has had limited market penetration. This is because efficient and accurate nanopore sequencing of nucleic acids has been challenged by fundamental signal-to-noise limitations resulting from the poor spatial resolution and molecular distinction of nucleobases. Here, we describe Sequencing by Expansion (SBX), a single-molecule sequencing technology that overcomes these limitations by using a biochemical conversion process to encode the sequence of a target nucleic acid molecule into an Xpandomer, a highly measurable surrogate polymer. Expanding over 50 times longer than the parent DNA templates, Xpandomers are engineered with high signal-to-noise reporter codes to enable facile, high-accuracy nanopore sequencing. We demonstrate the performance of SBX and present the specialized molecular structures, chemistries, enzymes and methods that enable it. The innovative molecular and systems engineering in SBX create a transformative technology to address the needs of existing and emerging sequencing applications.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

Screening 410 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions revealed substantial variation in growth feedbacks, which we used for genome-wide association mapping to identify Mediator of Microbiome Feedback 1 (MMF1), an immune receptor. Characterisation in the reference accession Col-0 revealed that mmf1 mutants lack the differential growth feedbacks, have an altered root bacterial community, and fail to induce a defence-related transcriptional response observed in wild-type plants. The discovery of MMF1 implies that integration of microbial effector signals optimises host microbiome composition and immune status to enhance growth.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

The central amygdala (CeA), a key brain region for pain, threat-detection, autonomic engagement, and valence assignment, is active during opioid withdrawal. However, the role of molecularly distinct CeA neural populations in withdrawal remains underexplored. Here, we investigated the activity dynamics, brain-wide connectivity, and functional contribution of Protein Kinase C-delta (PKC{delta})-expressing neurons in the CeA lateral capsule (CeLCPKC{delta}) during fentanyl withdrawal in mice. Mapping activity-dependent gene expression in CeLCPKC{delta} neurons revealed a highly withdrawal-active subregion in the anterior half of the CeA. Fiber photometry calcium imaging showed that opioid-naive CeLCPKC{delta} neurons respond to salient noxious and startling stimuli. In fentanyl-dependent mice, naloxone-precipitated withdrawal increased spontaneous neural activity and enhanced responses to noxious stimuli. Chronic inhibition of CeLCPKC{delta} neurons throughout fentanyl exposure, via viral overexpression of the potassium channel Kir2.1, attenuated withdrawal signs in fentanyl-dependent mice. Lastly, we identified putative opioid-sensitive inputs to CeLCPKC{delta} neurons using rabies-mediated monosynaptic circuit tracing and color-switching tracers to map mu-opioid receptor-expressing inputs to the CeLC. Collectively, these findings suggest that the hyperactivity of CeLCPKC{delta} neurons underlies the somatic signs of fentanyl withdrawal, offering new insights into the amygdala cell-types and circuits involved in opioid dependence.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

Whether transient pockets formed within intrinsically disordered and unstructured regions of proteins can be selectively targeted with small molecules remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we developed a bespoke stereochemically-paired spirocyclic oxindole aziridine covalent library and screened this library for degradation of MYC. Through this screen, we identified a hit covalent ligand KL2-236, bearing a unique sulfinyl aziridine warhead, that engaged MYC in vitro as pure MYC/MAX protein complex and in situ in cancer cells to destabilize MYC, inhibit MYC transcriptional activity and degrade MYC in a proteasome-dependent manner through targeting intrinsically disordered C203 and D205 residues. Notably, this reactivity was most pronounced for specific stereoisomers of KL2-236 with a diastereomer KL4-019 that was largely inactive. Mutagenesis of both C203 and D205 completely attenuated KL2-236-mediated MYC degradation. We have also optimized our initial KL2-236 hit compound to generate a more durable MYC degrader KL4-219A in cancer cells. Our results reveal a novel ligandable site within MYC and indicate that certain intrinsically disordered regions within high-value protein targets, such as MYC, can be interrogated by isomerically unique chiral small molecules, leading to destabilization and degradation.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

By automating the design of antibody variants, property prediction, ranking and selection of designs to assay in the lab, and ingestion of in vitro data, we enable a holistic, end-to-end approach to antibody optimization. We apply lab-in-the-loop to four clinically relevant antigen targets: EGFR, IL-6, HER2, and OSM. Over 1,800 unique antibody variants are designed and tested, derived from lead molecule candidates obtained via animal immunization and state-of-the-art immune repertoire mining techniques. Four lead candidate and four design crystal structures are solved to reveal mechanistic insights into the effects of mutations. We perform four rounds of iterative optimization and report 3-100x better binding variants for every target and ten candidate lead molecules, with the best binders in a therapeutically relevant 100 pM range.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

By contrast, many biological and environmental settings---ranging from mucus in the body to ocean sediments and the soil beneath our feet---feature multicellular bacterial populations that are confined to tight spots where essential metabolic substrates (e.g., oxygen) are scarce. What influence does such confinement have on a bacterial population? Here, we address this question by studying suspensions of motile Escherichia coli confined to quasi two-dimensional (2D) droplets. We find that when the droplet size and cell concentration are both large enough, the initially-uniform suspension spatially self-organizes into a concentrated, immotile inner ""core"" that coexists with a more dilute, highly-motile surrounding ""shell"". By simultaneously measuring cell concentration, oxygen concentration, and motility-generated fluid flow, we show that this behavior arises from the interplay between oxygen transport through the droplet from its boundary, uptake by the cells, and corresponding changes in their motility in response to oxygen variations. Furthermore, we use theory and simulations to develop quantitative principles describing this interplay---establishing a biophysical framework that unifies all our experimental observations. Our work thereby sheds new light on the rich collective behaviors that emerge for bacterial populations, and other forms of chemically-reactive living and active matter, in confined environments, and provides a way to predict and control these behaviors more broadly.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

P. aeruginosa is known to be dominant, often compromising S. aureus through the secretion of inhibitory compounds. We previously demonstrated that S. aureus can become resistant to growth-inhibitory compounds during experimental evolution. While resistance arose rapidly, the underlying mechanisms were not obvious as only a few genetic mutations were associated with resistance, while ample phenotypic changes occurred. We thus hypothesize that resistance may result from a combination of phenotypic responses and genetic adaptation. Here, we tested this hypothesis using proteomics. We first focused on an evolved strain that acquired a single mutation in tcyA (encoding a transmembrane transporter unit) upon exposure to P. aeruginosa supernatant. We show that this mutation leads to a complete abolishment of transporter synthesis, which confers moderate protection against PQS and selenocystine, two toxic compounds produced by P. aeruginosa. However, this genetic effect was minor compared to the fundamental phenotypic changes observed at the proteome level when both ancestral and evolved S. aureus strains were exposed to P. aeruginosa supernatant. Major changes involved the downregulation of virulence factors, metabolic pathways, membrane transporters, and the upregulation of ROS scavengers and an efflux pump. Our results suggest that the observed multi-variate phenotypic response is a powerful adaptive strategy, offering instant protection against competitors in fluctuating environments and reducing the need for hard-wired genetic adaptations.

ImportanceDifferent bacterial pathogens can co-occur in infections, where they interact with one another and influence disease severity. Previous research showed that pathogens can evolve and adapt to co-infecting species. Here, we show that evolution through genetic mutations and selection are not necessarily required to change pathogen behavior. Instead, we found that the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is able to plastically respond to the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a competing pathogen. Through proteomics and metabolomics, we demonstrate that S. aureus undergoes substantial proteomic alterations in response to P. aeruginosa by down-regulating virulence factor expression, changing metabolism, and mounting protective measures against toxic compounds. Our work highlights that pathogens possess sophisticated mechanisms to respond to competitors to secure growth and survival in polymicrobial infections. We predict such plastic responses to have significant impacts on infection outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

Here, we address this issue by developing an integrated experimental and computational platform to collect large temporal imaging datasets that allow for the inference of 'digital twins' - mathematically precise computational models that accurately mirror the behavior of individual microorganisms - and show that they can replicate the light response of diverse microorganisms in silico. We show that a generalised phenomenological model of movement can be effectively parameterised from experimental data to capture key behavioural traits of two commonly studied photo-responsive microorganisms (Euglena gracilis and Volvox aureus) and demonstrate our model's ability to accurate reproduce patterns of movement for individuals and populations in response to dynamic and spatially varying light patterns. This work takes steps towards the automated phenotyping of multi-scale behaviours in biology and complements high-throughput genome sequencing efforts by allowing for more comprehensive and quantitative genotype-to-phenotype mappings. It also unlocks new opportunities for the design of spatial control algorithms to guide collective microorganism behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

Human studies on this topic, however, have yielded inconsistent results1,2. We hypothesized that the microbiome would influence innate immune responses, and thus vaccine reactogenicity, more directly than vaccine immunogenicity. To test this, we established the {micro}HEAT (Microbial-Human Ecology And Temperature) study, which longitudinally profiled the fecal microbiota, oral body temperature and serum antibody responses of 171 healthy adults (18-40 years old) before and after vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Increased temperature after vaccination ({Delta}T) was associated with habitual diet and with baseline metabolic and immune markers. The microbiomes of {Delta}T-high ({Delta}Thi) participants were characterized by high expression of flagellin and an overabundance of the flagellated bacterium Waltera. Fecal samples from {Delta}Thi participants induced more inflammation in human cells and stronger post-vaccine temperature responses in mice compared to {Delta}Tlo samples, suggesting a causal role for the microbiome. Moreover, Waltera flagellin replicated the inflammatory phenotypes in vitro and was modulable via a dietary additive. Overall, these data suggest that flagellin from the gut microbiome stimulates innate immunity and vaccine reactogenicity, and that this axis can be manipulated via diet. These findings have implications for improving human vaccine tolerance and immunogenicity.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

However, awake infant fMRI poses significant methodological challenges that have hampered wider adoption. The present work takes stock after the collection of a substantial amount of awake infant fMRI data across multiple studies from two labs at different institutions. These data were leveraged to glean insights on participant recruitment, experimental design, and data acquisition that could be useful to consider for future studies. Across 766 awake infant fMRI sessions, the authors explored the factors that influenced how much usable data were obtained per session (average of 9 minutes). The age of an infant predicted whether they would successfully enter the scanner (younger was more likely) and, if they did enter, the number of minutes of functional data retained after preprocessing. The amount of functional data retained was also influenced by assigned sex (female more), experimental paradigm (movies better than blocks and events), and stimulus content (social better than abstract). In addition, the authors assessed the value of attempting to collect multiple experiments per session, an approach that yielded more than one usable experiment averaging across all sessions (including those with no data). Although any given scan is unpredictable, these findings support the feasibility of awake infant fMRI and suggest practices to optimize future research.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

We recently demonstrated that the loss of biosynthetic pathways for these outsourced AAs is driven by energy-saving selection. Paradoxically, these metabolic simplifications enabled animals to use costly AAs more frequently in their proteomes, allowing them to explore sequence space more freely. Based on these findings, we proposed that environmental AA availability and cellular respiration mode are the two primary factors determining the evolution of AA auxotrophies in animals. Remarkably, our recent analysis showed that bacterial AA auxotrophies are also governed by energy-related selection, thereby roughly converging with animals. However, bacterial AA auxotrophies are highly heterogeneous and scattered across the bacterial phylogeny, making direct ecological and physiological comparisons with the animal AA outsourcing model challenging. To better test the universality of our model, we focused on Bdellovibrionota and Myxococcota--two closely related bacterial phyla that, through aerobic respiration and a predatory lifestyle, best parallel animals. Here, we show that Bdellovibrionota, driven by energy-related selection, outsourced a highly similar set of AAs to those in animals. This sharply contrasts with Myxococcota, which exhibit far fewer AA auxotrophies and rarely show signatures of energy-driven selection. These differences are also reflected in Bdellovibrionota proteomes, which are substantially more expensive than those of Myxococcota. Finally, we found evidence that the expression of costly proteins plays a crucial role in the predatory phase of the Bdellovibrio life cycle. Together, our findings suggest that Bdellovibrionota, through their obligate predatory lifestyle, exhibit the closest analogy to the AA auxotrophy phenotype observed in animals. In contrast, facultative predation, as seen in Myxococcota, appears to substantially limit the evolution of AA auxotrophies. These cross-domain convergences strongly support the general validity of our AA outsourcing model.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

Within the NRC (NLR Required for Cell Death) network, NLRs operate in complex sensor-helper configurations to confer immunity against a diverse array of pathogens, particularly in Asterids. While helper NLRs are typically conserved and evolve slowly, sensor NLRs tend to evolve more rapidly. However, the functional connections between slow and fast-evolving NLRs remain poorly understood, notably in important crop species. We conducted a comparative analysis of NLRs across 40 Solanales and 29 Asterales genomes to explore NRC network expansion and diversification within the less-studied Asterales order. Our findings reveal that the NRC network has expanded less in Asterales compared to Solanales. We functionally validated a minimal Asterales NRC network with 2 helpers and 9 sensors in common lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Through selection and diversification analysis and structural modeling of NRC helper and sensor subclades in the Lactuca genus, we found varying evolutionary diversification rates between NRC helpers and sensors. We found a correlation between sensor diversification rates and helper dependency, with sensors reliant on a phylogenetically conserved helpers experiencing limited diversification pressure. Our results highlight the lineage- and function-specific evolution of the NRC network, offering insights into the evolutionary pressures shaping plant immune receptor networks.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

However positive detection using existing probes has not been confirmed in some geographic regions where they would be expected. Here, we aimed to test whether mutations at key sites have been detrimental to species-specific detection of P. pristis (Linnaeus, 1758) using the existing probe set. To test this hypothesis mitogenomes were assembled that were found to follow the typical pattern of vertebrate mitogenomic organization. Phylogenetic trees showed similar topologies and confirmed geographic mitochondrial variation in P. pristis. Mismatches for the published 12S species-specific probe set for P. pristis were identified that prevent amplification of positive control samples from Brazil. However, ddPCR detection of the positive control was possible using a newly designed species-specific probe set. This study highlights how geographical variation can severely impact the success of generally applying species-specific detection systems developed based on data from only one geographical region. The new mitogenomes and species-specific probe set developed here may also contribute to improving the potential to map and monitor these Critically Endangered species across the globe.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

Since the influenza virus causes respiratory infections in humans, developing mucosal vaccines to protect the entry site of the virus is of high importance. Recombinant NA requires adjuvants to induce a protective immune response after mucosal administration. In the current study, we analyze the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a recombinant NA-based influenza virus vaccine administered intranasally in combination with adjuvants consisting of outer membrane proteins from Neisseria meningitidis complexed with exogenous lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Shigella flexneri or endogenous LPS from N. meningitidis. We evaluated the local and systemic humoral and cellular immune responses to adjuvanted recombinant N1 NA, analyzing the dynamics of local follicular T-helper (Tfh) cells and germinal center B cells (GCB) in nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and tissue-resident memory T cells in lungs, as well as the levels of IgA and IgG in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Finally, we performed a heterologous challenge study to test the ability of the investigated vaccine formulations to induce cross-protection. The study demonstrates that bacterial cell membrane-derived adjuvants significantly improve the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the recombinant N1 NA-based influenza vaccine leading to protection against clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 challenge. This finding supports the potential of these adjuvanted vaccines in providing effective mucosal immunity against influenza virus.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

Analysis of spontaneous events typically requires evaluation of hundreds of events over minutes to hours, and the most common method of analysis, z-scoring, was not designed for this purpose. Here, we compare the accuracy and reliability of three different analysis methods to identify pharmacologically induced changes in dopamine release and uptake in freely moving C57BL/6J mice. The D1-like receptor antagonist SCH23390 was used to prevent dLight sensors from interacting with dopamine in the extracellular space, while cocaine was used to inhibit uptake and raclopride to increase release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. We examined peak-to-peak frequency, peak amplitude, and width, the time spent above an established cutoff. The three methods were 1) the widely-used ""Z-Score Method"", which automatically smooths baseline drift and normalizes recordings using signal-to-noise ratios, 2) a ""Manual Method"", in which local baselines were adjusted manually and individual cutoffs were determined for each subject, and 3) the ""Prominence Method"" that combines z-scoring with prominence assessment to tag individual peaks, then returns to the preprocessed data for kinetic analysis. First, SCH23390 drastically reduced the number of signals detected as expected, but only when the Manual Method was used. Z-scoring failed to identify any changes, due to its amplification of noise when signals were diminished. Cocaine increased signal width as expected using the Manual and Prominence Methods, but not the Z-Score Method. Finally, raclopride- induced increases in amplitude were correctly identified by the Manual and Prominence Methods. The Z-Score Method failed to identify any of the changes in dopamine release and uptake kinetics. Thus, analysis of spontaneous dopamine signals requires assessment of the %{Delta}F/F values, ideally using the Manual Method, and the use of z- scoring is not appropriate.

Data on how this clade differs from others, including the incubation period which both shapes outbreak dynamics and informs epidemic response strategies, remain limited. Methods We use clinical, laboratory and reported exposure data from suspected and qPCR-confirmed mpox cases in Uvira, DRC to estimate the incubation period for MPXV clade 1b. We developed a Bayesian model to estimate incubation periods of various symptom onset definitions (rash, fever, any symptom), demographic factors and putative transmission route (sexual vs. non-sexual). Results Among 92 PCR-confirmed cases, the median incubation period from exposure to rash was 18.6 days (95% CrI: 15.2-22.6). Five percent of cases are expected to develop a rash within 5.4 days (95% CrI; 3.4-7.6) and 95% within 37.6 days (95% CrI: 30.3-47.0). The incubation period differed by putative transmission route: sexual transmission had a shorter median (9.5 days, 95% CrI 3.7-16.4) than non-sexual transmission (18.9 days, 95% CrI: 15.3-23.0). Conclusions Incubation periods for clade Ib are longer than previous estimates for other MPXV clades, but vary strongly by sexual vs. non-sexual exposures, the former closely aligning with observations from the predominantly sexually transmitted clade IIa global outbreak. These findings highlight the significant differences by transmission route, likely reflecting differences in infectious viral dose and suggest the need to revise global post-exposure monitoring recommendations.","NA","medrxiv",1740694113801

This gives rise to size-limited, ordered assemblies, that are 30-45 nm in diameter. Depending on the protein, each microphase comprises several tens to hundreds of molecules. The sub-micron scale territories observed in cells are shown to be clusters of microphases.

MeIQ-Resorufin was used to visualise endogenous hypoxia in lateral root primordia of normoxic A.thaliana seedlings. Oxygen measurement in plants until now has relied on invasive probes or genetic manipulation. Use of these chemical probes to detect applied and endogenous hypoxia has the potential to facilitate a greater understanding of oxygen dynamics in plant cells and tissues, allowing correlation of oxygen concentrations with adaptive and developmental responses to hypoxia.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

Here, we used whole-genome sequence (WGS) data in 672,976 individuals of diverse ancestry to evaluate the contribution and architecture of rare non-coding variants to three commonly studied anthropometric traits: height, body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI). Analysing 447,461 individuals in UK Biobank for discovery and 225,515 individuals in All of Us for replication, we identified 90 novel rare and low-frequency single variant associations. This includes two independent rare variants upstream of IGF2BP2 that both substantially reduce WHRadjBMI, but have distinct effects on other adiposity traits. We identified 135 coding variant aggregates, several of which were missed by exome sequencing studies. For example, UBR3 protein-truncating variants were associated with a 2.7kg/m2 increase in BMI. We additionally identified 51 non-coding variant aggregate associations, including in the 5UTR of FGF18 (a highly constrained gene with no previously reported coding associations) associated with up to 6cm effects on height. We show that 97% of rare variant associations occur near GWAS loci demonstrating convergence of rare and common variant associations. Finally, we show that ultra rare variants (MAF<0.01%) explain a small fraction of heritability (<10%) compared to common variants for these traits, that heritability is largely shared across ancestries, and that this heritability is concentrated at or near common variant loci. Our work demonstrates the importance of large-scale WGS for fully understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

This study investigates an mpox clade 1b outbreak in Uvira, 300 km from Kamituga, where the first case was reported in May 2024. Methods From June-October 2024, clinical and household data from suspected mpox cases were collected at Uvira hospital and through investigations. Laboratory confirmation was performed via PCR. We analyzed demographic, exposure, and clinical data to characterize transmission patterns, severity, and risk factors. Results Among 972 suspected cases, 42.2% (411) had PCR results, with 78.1% positive. The median age was 9 years (IQR: 3-20), with 63.8% under 15 (n=621) and 32.1% under 5 (n=312). Severe cases ([&ge;]100 lesions) were more frequent in children under 15 (25.6%, 142/555) than older individuals (16.2%, 49/303; p<0.001). Acute malnutrition affected 8.6% (14/162) of children under 5. The case fatality ratio was 0.7% (7/972), rising to 4% (5/127) in infants under 1 year. Among HIV-tested individuals, 1.8% (6/329) were HIV-positive. Pregnant women accounted for 14.5% (19/131) of cases. Household exposures dominated (67.9%), with limited sexual (6%) or healthcare worker (0.4%) exposures. Female sex workers represented 1.2% of cases. Animal exposures were predominantly domestic (97.4%, 38/39). Conclusion This child-centered outbreak, driven by household transmission, underscores the need for pediatric vaccines, nutritional support, and household interventions. Adult-focused responses alone may be insufficient. Key words: mpox, clade 1b, children, household transmission","NA","medrxiv",1740694113801

Here we explored whether networks could be precisely estimated solely using data acquired during active task paradigms. The straightforward strategy involved extracting residualized data after application of a task-based general linear model (GLM) and then applying standard functional connectivity analysis. Functional correlation matrices estimated from task data were highly similar to those derived from traditional resting-state fixation data. The largest factor affecting similarity between correlation matrices was the amount of data. Networks estimated within-individual from task data displayed strong spatial overlap with those estimated from resting-state fixation data and predicted the same triple functional dissociation in independent data. The implications of these findings are that (1) existing task data can be reanalyzed to estimate within-individual network organization, (2) resting-state fixation and task data can be pooled to increase statistical power, and (3) future studies can exclusively acquire task data to both estimate networks and extract task responses. Most broadly, the present results suggest that there is an underlying, stable network architecture that is idiosyncratic to the individual and persists across task states.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

In addition, it plays important roles in host cell defenses against pathogenic viruses, and small molecules that activate NRF2 signaling can exert potent antiviral effects. We recently found that the NRF2 activators 4-octyl itaconate (4OI), bardoxolone (BARD), and sulforaphane (SFN) interfere with influenza A virus replication by blocking the nuclear export factor exportin 1 (XPO1), which did not require NRF2 signaling. Here, we have assessed their potential to inhibit highly pathogenic (SARS-CoV-2) and seasonal (hCoV-229E) coronaviruses and begun to elucidate the involved mechanisms of action. Using human cell lines and iPSC-derived vascular endothelial cells, we find that NRF2 knock-out or knock-down enhances infection by both viruses, indicating that physiologic NRF2 signaling restricts human coronavirus infection. 4OI, BARD, SFN, as well as the XPO1 blocker Selinexor (SEL), greatly limit infection by both viruses, but in an NRF2-independent manner. Strikingly, the compounds (particularly 4OI) downregulate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA and protein in Calu3 cells, leading to a >10-fold reduction in viral cell entry by 4OI and SEL, as assessed using SARS-CoV-1 and -2 spike protein VSV pseudotypes. A cycloheximide chase experiment revealed that 4OI dramatically reduces ACE2 half-life, which requires the E3 ligases NEDD4L and MCM1, suggesting that 4OI targets ACE2 for destruction by the proteasome. Moreover, 4OI and SEL reduce XPO1 protein levels, and all compounds reduce XPO1 mRNA levels. Co-incubation experiments of 4OI and the transcription blocker actinomycin D in A549 cells suggest that 4OI acts primarily by interfering with transcription of the XPO1 gene. XPO1 knock-down markedly reduces 229E replication. All four compounds interfere with 229E infection, but do not alter expression of ANPEP, the cellular receptor for this virus. Their anti-229E efficacy depends on expression of XPO1 in host cells in the order of SEL (most dependent) >4OI >SFN >BARD (least dependent), suggesting that especially BARD interferes with 229E infectivity via yet another, unknown, target. Taken together, these results suggest that ""NRF2 activators"" act as potent antivirals against human coronaviruses by targeting diverse host factors which are critical for viral infectivity.

Author summaryHost-directed antiviral compounds act by a variety of mechanisms. For instance, they stimulate cellular antiviral immune responses and target host cell factors which are required for the viral life cycle. Pharmacologic activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway is a particularly attractive antiviral strategy, as this pathway restricts replication of a variety of viruses and also protects cells from excessive inflammation and oxidative stress resulting from accumulation of reactive oxygen species. In our previous study of the NRF2 activators bardoxolone, sulforaphane, and 4-octyl itaconate as host-directed treatments for influenza A virus infection, we found that these compounds interfered with replication of the virus. Unexpectedly, this antiviral activity was completely independent of NRF2 signaling, but resulted from blocking the nuclear export factor XPO1. In the present study, we find that these compounds limit infection by SARS-CoV-2 and hCoV-229E and that, again, this antiviral effect is NRF-independent. Instead, it depends to a large extent on downregulating ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (the major host cell receptors for SARS-CoV-1 and 2) and blocking/downregulating XPO1. Our results underscore the potential of ""NRF2 activators"" as adjunct treatments for viral infections, as they protect the host by anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective mechanisms and also interfere with diverse host factors required for the viral life cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

Increasing attention has focused on the physiological and ecological significance of CPR bacteria, while the potential interactions between CPR bacteria and their phages still need more exploration. Here, we collected 82 groundwater metagenomic datasets and further derived 1,162 phages with the potential to infect 2,439 groundwater CPR metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Notably, the groundwater CPR MAGs were predominantly infected by temperate phages, and the abundance profiles of phage-CPR interactions in groundwater ecosystems supported the ""Piggybacking the Winner"" (PtW) hypothesis, suggesting that lysogenic infection was a strategy co-evolved by CPR bacteria and their phages in groundwater ecosystems. Intriguingly, the groundwater CPR phages encoded various auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) that might promote symbiotic lifestyle and metabolic potential of host CPR MAGs. These included AMGs associated with concanavalin A-like lectin/glucanases superfamily and O-Antigen nucleotide sugar biosynthesis, which could enhance surface adhesion of host CPR MAGs. Moreover, AMGs related to ABC transport system and P-type transporter could strengthen metabolic exchange and uptake of essential nutrients from surroundings. Additionally, AMGs involved in various metabolic pathways might alleviate metabolic deficiencies in host CPR MAGs. This study elucidated the mechanisms of phage-CPR interactions and the potential roles of phages in modulating the physiology and ecology of CPR bacteria within groundwater ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

Actin filaments are continuously displaced from cell periphery, where they assemble, towards the cells center, where they disassemble. Despite this constant flow and turnover, cellular networks maintain their overall architecture constant. How such a flow of material can support dynamic yet steady cellular architectures remains an open question. To investigate the role of myosin-based forces in contractile steady-states of actin networks, we used a reconstituted in vitro system based on a minimal set of purified proteins, namely actin, myosin and actin regulators. We found that, contrary to previous bulk experiments, when confined in microwells, the actin network could self-organize into ordered arrangements of contractile bundles, flowing continuously without collapsing. This was supported by three-dimensional fluxes of actin filaments, spatially separated yet balancing each other. Unexpectedly, maintaining these fluxes did not depend on filament nucleation or elongation, but solely on filament transport. Ablation of the contractile bundles abolished the flux balance and led to network collapse. These findings demonstrate that the dynamic steady state of actin networks can be sustained by filament displacement and recirculation, independently of filament assembly and disassembly.

Significance StatementCellular structures continuously self-renew, with new material constantly being added and removed while maintaining overall structural stability. This is particularly true for the actin cytoskeleton, whose components are continuously assembled, displaced, and reassembled. Understanding this process is fundamental to uncovering how cells regulate their architecture and adapt to stimuli.

Here, we reconstitute an in vitro actomyosin network capable of contracting steadily over time without collapsing, relying solely on myosin-based transport. These findings demonstrate that a minimal system consisting of actin and molecular motors can effectively recapitulate the ability of actin networks to self-organize into stable yet dynamic architectures.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

Here, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the formation of long-term associative memory (LTAM) formed by treating Caenorhabditis elegans with a volatile chemoattractant and heat. Previous work has shown that training animals with a paradigm involving heat and isoamyl alcohol (IAA) simultaneously, causes C. elegans to lose their attraction to IAA. In this study, we elaborate on the mechanism behind this LTAM formation and suggest that during training with heat and IAA, C. elegans release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that upon being taken up by the same trained animals or their untrained counterparts causes the organism to lose attraction to IAA. Our data suggests that the vesicles are highly specific to the training paradigms used and differ with differing cues. Finally, we show that this mechanism of transfer of LTAM appears to be conserved between C. elegans and C. briggsae allowing for both intra and interspecies transfer of memory.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

In this study, we have conducted a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to identify cellular factors that stimulate the degradation of an aggregation-prone reporter protein. Our findings revealed that genes encoding proteins involved in mitochondrial homeostasis, including the translation factor eIF5A, were highly enriched among suppressors of degradation of an aggregation-prone reporter. Conversely, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated ubiquitin ligases facilitated degradation, indicating opposing roles for these cellular compartments in the clearance of aggregation-prone proteins. Genetic or chemical inhibition of eIF5A led to the dissociation of the aggregation-prone substrate from mitochondria, which was accompanied by enhanced degradation through ER-associated ubiquitination. The presence of an aggregation-prone, amphipathic helix that localized the reporter to mitochondria was crucial for the stimulatory effect of eIF5A inhibition. Additionally, the steady-state levels of -synuclein, a disease-associated protein containing an amphipathic helix that mislocalizes to mitochondria, were reduced upon eIF5A inhibition. We propose that mitochondria behave as a holdout compartment for aggregation-prone proteins, keeping them out of reach of ubiquitin ligases that target them for proteasomal degradation. Therefore, preventing mitochondrial localization of aggregation-prone proteins may offer a viable therapeutic strategy for reducing their levels in neurodegenerative disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

A computational network model of the canonical microcircuit consisting of SOM, PV and excitatory neurons reproduced key experimental findings, including: Stochastic gamma oscillations with drive-dependent frequency; precise phase-locking of PV interneurons and delayed firing of SOM interneurons; and the distinct effects of optogenetic perturbations of SOM and PV cells. In CAMINOS, the generation of network oscillations depends on both the precise spike timing of SOM and PV interneurons, with PV cells regulating oscillation frequency and network stability, and delayed SOM firing controlling the oscillation amplitude. The asymmetric PV-SOM connectivity is found to be the key source ingredient to generate these oscillations, that naturally establishes distinct PV and SOM-cell spike timing. The CAMINOS model predicts that increased SOM/PV densities along the cortical hierarchy leads to decreased oscillation frequencies (from gamma to alpha/beta) and increased seizure susceptibility, suggesting a unified circuit model for oscillations across different frequency bands.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

We find, first, that prebreeders average about half of seabird populations (median 47.4%, range 11.2%-66.7%). Second, while seabird population growth is much more sensitive to adult survival than prebreeder survival, human-driven changes may shift the importance of prebreeders for future population stability. Third, lowering the breeding age is a powerful, but underexplored, route to increasing population growth. Managing prebreeders could thus play a key role in protecting seabirds. This task may require answering fundamental questions about the behavior of young birds. Broadly, we suggest that life history characteristics (e.g., breeding age) actively shape both obstacles to, and opportunities for, successful conservation.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

Current treatments often fail to provide sustained relief, highlighting the need to better understand the mechanisms driving discogenic LBP. During disc degeneration, the extracellular matrix degrades, allowing nociceptive nerve fibers to innervate previously aneural disc regions. Persistent mechanical and inflammatory stimulation of nociceptors can induce plastic changes within dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, characterized by altered gene expression, enhanced excitability, and lowered activation thresholds. Although these transcriptional changes have been described in other pain states, including osteoarthritis, they remain underexplored in discogenic LBP. To address this gap, this study represents the first application of comprehensive single-nuclei RNA sequencing of DRG neurons in a rat model of chronic discogenic LBP. Eighteen distinct DRG subpopulations were identified and mapped to existing mouse and cross-species atlases revealing strong similarities in neuronal populations with the mouse. Differential expression analysis revealed increased expression of pain-associated genes, including Scn9a and Piezo2, and neuroinflammatory mediators such as Fstl1 and Ngfr, in LBP animals. Axial hypersensitivity, measured using grip strength, significantly correlated with increased expression of Scn9a, Fstl1, and Ngfr, which suggests their role in maintaining axial hypersensitivity in this model. These findings establish a relationship between DRG transcriptomic changes and axial hypersensitivity in a discogenic LBP model, identifying potential molecular targets for non-opioid treatments and advancing understanding of discogenic LBP mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

However, it has largely been developed using data from individuals of White ethnicity.

MethodsWe utilised data from multiple sources to derive estimates for the distributions of risk factors and their effect sizes in major UK ethnic groups (White, Black, South Asian, East Asian, and Mixed). We combined these with ethnicity-specific population cancer incidences to update BOADICEA so that it provides ethnicity-specific risk estimates. We also developed and included a method for deriving adjusted polygenic scores for individuals of mixed genetic ancestry.

ResultsThe predicted average absolute risks were smaller in all non-White ethnic groups than in Whites, and the risk distributions were narrower. The proportion of women classified as at moderate or high risk of breast or ovarian cancer, according to national guidelines, was considerably smaller in non-White women.

DiscussionThe updated BOADICEA (v7), available in the CanRisk tool (www.canrisk.org), is based on estimates more appropriate for non-White women in the UK. Further validation of the model in prospective studies is required. Considering these findings, risk classification guidelines for non- White women may need to be revised.","NA","medrxiv",1740694113801

Similar to other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 proteins modulate host genomic responses through epigenomic modifications, facilitating viral replication and immune evasion. While the nucleocapsid protein is well known for its role in RNA stability and immune modulation, its impact on host chromatin organization remains unclear. To investigate this, we generated stable human alveolar cell lines expressing nucleocapsid proteins from endemic and pandemic human coronaviruses. Our analysis revealed that nucleocapsid proteins from all tested coronaviruses induced changes in nucleosome positioning and occupancy at specific gene promoters involved in coagulation pathways, hormone signaling, and innate immune responses. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-specific alterations were identified in genes dysregulated in severe infections, suggesting a direct role for epigenomic modifications in disease pathophysiology. We also observed extensive changes in nucleosome susceptibility to nuclease digestion in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 samples that were not observed in common cold cell lines. Promoters with altered sensitivity and resistance to nuclease were linked to innate immune, metabolic, olfactory, and signaling pathways known to be dysregulated in severe COVID-19 and post-acute sequelae (PASC). These findings demonstrate that nucleocapsid protein expression alters chromatin structure at specific loci, implicating viral proteins in host genome dysregulation. Furthermore, we identified both shared and unique chromatin targets of SARS-CoV-2 and common cold coronaviruses, highlighting pathways for further investigation and potential therapeutic intervention.

ImportanceHost chromatin is known to be modulated by coronaviruses during infections. However, the role of the nucleocapsid protein in these alterations are unknown. Here, we show that nucleocapsids from seven human coronaviruses alter nucleosome distribution and susceptibility to enzymatic digestion over specific gene promoters in a human lung cell line. Nucleocapsids from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have the most prominent effects which are seen over genes involved in immune responses, metabolism, hormone signaling, and other pathways that are known to be dysregulated in severe COVID-19 and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.

Bo Yi had two sons who each established a state, one named Huang and the other Xu. After the fall of Huang, its people adopted Huang as their surname and migrated to Hubei. Similarly, after the fall of Xu, its people adopted Xu as their surname, spreading throughout Jiangsu. Further descendants of Bo Yi also gave rise to 12 other surnames, including the Liang surname. Given that the narratives of ancient texts are often regarded as legendary, we aim to independently verify the authenticity of the historical records by analyzing the paternal haplotypes of the Huang surname and its related surnames using scientific methods. We analyzed the surname genetic data of 207,333 Han Chinese males published by 23Mofang and combined it with independent sequencing research. In 189 Y chromosome haplotype branches, each containing at least five individuals with the surnames Huang, Xu, or Liang, and formed around 4,000 years ago, we analyzed the proportion of samples with the Huang surname from Hubei among all samples nationwide with the Huang surname. Branches with a high proportion in Hubei are likely to represent the Hubei-specific lineage of the Huang surname. We similarly analyzed the proportion of samples with the Xu surname in the Jiangsu area and of samples with the Liang surname in the Hebei area. We further applied two criteria to identify the ancestral genotype of a specific surname in a given region: first, the surname should appear at a high frequency among all surnames within that genotype; second, the proportion of samples of the region among nationwide samples should be high. The results showed that the Hubei-specific Huang surname likely carries the MF14296/MF15137 haplotype downstream of the supergrandfather O-M117-F8-F2137-A16635-A16636. Our independent sampling study found that A16636 is the dominant haplotype among the Huang surname population in nine neighboring Huang surname villages around Luohansi in Huangpi, Hubei. The Jiangsu-specific Xu surname likely carries the MF38096/SK1726 haplotype under the A16636 sister branch F15823, while the Hebei-specific Liang surname likely carries the F15823 related MF14287/MF15398/MF14963 haplotype. This conclusion aligns with the historical records, providing strong genetic evidence that supports the authenticity of these ancestral claims regarding the Huang and Xu states and the Xia dynasty.","NA","biorxiv",1740694113801

We quantified 110 MCBAs in 303 stool samples collected longitudinally (3- 36 months) from children who developed one or more islet autoantibodies and controls who remained autoantibody-negative. Stool MCBAs showed distinct age-dependent trajectories and correlated with gut microbiome composition. Altered levels of ursodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acid conjugates were linked to islet autoimmunity as well as modulated monocyte activation in response to immunostimulatory lipopolysaccharide and Th17/Treg cell balance.

C_LIO_LITo address this gap, we conducted an extensive literature review and developed DateBack (https://cloudapps.france-bioinformatique.fr/dateback), a digital open access repository of archaeobotanical remains of Phoenix spp. In its first version, DateBack records macroremains (e.g., seeds, fruits, stems, petioles) from prehistoric to Late Antiquity contexts in Southwest and South Asia.
C_LIO_LIWe assembled 140 entries from 99 archaeological sites across 110 references, along with a separate table of 55 radiocarbon-dated entries from 17 sites, refining chronological assessments. Most entries comprise charred seeds (55.7%), with a smaller proportion of charred vegetative parts or desiccated remains. Our findings highlight regional disparities in remain distribution, concentrated in the Levant and Gulf, while Saudi Arabia and southern Iran are underrepresented, and in data reliability, particularly dating resolution, complicating the reconstruction of date cultivation history. Our evidence shows that the earliest securely dated remains, indicating date consumption, appear in the Gulf around 5000 BCE, while cultivation emerges later, first in southern Mesopotamia and the northern Gulf in the 4th millennium BCE, then in eastern Arabia and the Indus Valley in the 3rd millennium BCE. The Levant presents challenges, with numerous presumed early finds but significant uncertainties, with secure evidence of cultivation only appearing by the late 2nd millennium BCE, as in northwestern Arabia, while in the southern Arabian Peninsula, it is not attested until the 1st millennium BCE.

We conducted an integrated analysis that combines electrophysiological and transcriptomic profiling, along with machine learning, of islet cells from T1D donors to investigate the mechanisms underlying their dysfunction. Surviving {beta}-cells exhibit altered electrophysiological properties and transcriptomic signatures indicative of increased antigen presentation, metabolic reprogramming, and impaired protein translation. In -cells, we observed hyper-responsiveness and increased exocytosis, which are associated with upregulated immune signaling, disrupted transcription factor localization and lysosome homeostasis, as well as dysregulation of mTORC1 complex signaling. Notably, key genetic risk signals for T1D were enriched in transcripts related to -cell dysfunction, including MHC class I which were closely linked with -cell dysfunction. Our data provide novel insights into the molecular underpinnings of islet cell dysfunction in T1D, highlighting pathways that may be leveraged to preserve residual {beta}-cell function and modulate -cell activity.
