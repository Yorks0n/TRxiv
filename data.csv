Although several super-resolution microscopy techniques are available, visualizing PPI below the diffraction limit of light across entire live cells remains a challenge. Here, we introduce an approach that combines the chemogenetic split fluorescent reporter splitFAST2 with STED microscopy for sub-diffraction imaging of PPI. As the fluorescence of splitFAST2 is activated only where the two proteins interact, this system allows for highly precise and unambiguous localization in live cells, enhanced further by the rapid super-resolution imaging capabilities of STED. The improved spatial resolution of our approach enabled us to precisely map the subcellular localization of inducible interactions or constitutive interactions. Beyond simply detecting PPIs below the diffraction limit in whole living cells, we also demonstrated that splitFAST2 can serve as the basis for fluorescent probes with very low background, enabling effective subdiffraction imaging of repetitive cellular structures like filamentous actin and microtubules.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-21-CE11-0010;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2023-321185;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754777339665

Here, we report the first genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen targeting a Gq-coupled GPCR signaling cascade. Using a Drosophila model of adipokinetic hormone receptor (AkhR) signaling, we identified CG34449 (Zdhhc8), encoding a palmitoyl acyltransferase and its adapter protein CG5447, as a top hit required for robust Gq-mediated GPCR signaling. We show that Zdhhc8 enhances GPCR signaling through palmitoylation of Gq, which promotes its membrane localization and function. Loss of Zdhhc8 markedly reduces palmitoylation of Gaq resulting in attenuation of AkhR/Gq signaling and a reduction in receptor stability. Mechanistically, Zdhhc8 is necessary for palmitoylation of Gq. These findings uncover Zdhhc8-dependent Gq palmitoylation as a pivotal regulatory mechanism in GPCR signal transduction and highlight palmitoyl transferase as potential modulators of GPCR pathways.","[{""name"":""American Heart Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013kjyp64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""24PRE1189954;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM084947;R01GM067761;R24OD019847;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754777339665

Using the Cam-CAN dataset, source-space MEG analyses revealed a pronounced posterior-anterior gradient in alpha frequency, alpha power, and aperiodic components, alongside notable age-related changes. Through neurophysiological modelling, we uncover strong corticothalamic interactions in occipital regions, contrasting with predominantly corticocortical interactions in frontal areas. Ageing is associated with reduced intrathalamic activity and increased corticothalamic delay in occipital regions, while fronto-central regions exhibit increased intrathalamic activity. These findings establish how different circuits shape alpha oscillations across posterior-anterior axis and age, providing a mechanistic foundation for targeted clinical interventions and offering benchmarks for future studies in patient populations.","[{""name"":""Krembil Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/037svw098"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Labatt Family Network"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""CAMH Discovery Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754777339665

Codons are translated at different speeds by the ribosome, imposing constraints on codon choice related to the process of translation. The structure and function of a protein may impose pressure to translate the associated mRNA at a particular speed in order to enable proper protein production, but the molecular basis and scope of these evolutionary constraints have remained elusive. Here, we show that information about codon constraints can be extracted from protein sequence alone. We leverage a protein language model to predict codon choice from amino acid sequence, combining implicit information about position and protein structure to learn subtle but generalizable constraints on codon choice in yeast. In parallel, we conduct a genome-wide screen of thousands of synonymous codon substitutions in endogenous loci in yeast, reliably identifying a small set of several hundred synonymous variants that increase or decrease fitness while showing that most positions have no measurable effect on growth. Our results suggest that cotranslational localization and translational accuracy, more than cotranslational protein folding, are major drivers of selective pressure on codon choice in eukaryotes. By considering both the small but wide-reaching effects of codon choice that can be learned from evolution and the strong but highly specific effects determined via experiment, we expose unappreciated biological constraints on codon choice.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754777339665

We find that this variant disrupts the activity of a previously unstudied antisense long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) located between HOXA7 and HOXA9, which we have named HOTSCRAMBL. The HOTSCRAMBL variant disrupts lncRNA function and reduces human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal.

Whether computational prediction tools can identify amyloid-forming potential in thrombus proteomes remains unclear.

MethodsAmyloGram is a computational tool that estimates amyloid-forming potential based on n-gram sequence encoding and random forest classification. Using AmyloGram, we analyzed 204 proteins tagged by humans as amyloidogenic in UniProt. We then applied the same approach to proteins identified in thrombi retrieved using mechanical thrombectomy from patients with cardioembolic and atherothrombotic stroke. In addition we used AmyloGram to analyse the amyloidogenicity of 83,567 canonical human protein sequences.

ResultsAmong the UniProt-annotated  amyloid set, nearly all proteins received AmyloGram scores above 0.7, including 23 of the 24 human proteins. Even the lowest-scoring human protein, lysozyme (scoring 0.675), is known to form amyloid under certain conditions. In thrombi from both stroke subtypes, all detected proteins had AmyloGram scores above 0.7, suggesting a high likelihood of amyloid content. A majority of unannotated proteins also achieve AmyloGram scores exceeding 0.7.

ConclusionsAmyloGram reliably identifies known amyloid-forming proteins and reveals that stroke thrombi are enriched for proteins with high amyloidogenic potential. These findings support the hypothesis that thrombus formation in stroke involves amyloid-related mechanisms and warrant further investigation using histological and functional validation.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754777339665

Traditional approaches for protein sequence representation often rely solely on the 20 canonical amino acids, limiting the representation of non-canonical amino acids and residues that undergo post-translational modifications. This work explores discrete diffusion models for generating novel protein sequences using the all-atom chemical representation SELFIES. By encoding the atomic composition of each amino acid in the protein, this approach expands the design possibilities beyond standard sequence representations. Using a modified ByteNet architecture within the discrete diffusion D3PM framework, we evaluate the impact of this all-atom representation on protein quality, diversity, and novelty, compared to conventional amino acid-based models. To this end, we develop a comprehensive assessment pipeline to determine whether generated SELFIES sequences translate into valid proteins containing both canonical and non-canonical amino acids. Additionally, we examine the influence of two noise schedules within the diffusion process--uniform (random replacement of tokens) and absorbing (progressive masking)--on generation performance. While models trained on the all-atom representation struggle to consistently generate fully valid proteins, the successfully generated proteins show improved novelty and diversity compared to their amino acid-based model counterparts. Furthermore, the all-atom representation achieves structural foldability results comparable to those of amino acid-based models. Lastly, our results highlight the absorbing noise schedule as the most effective for both representations.

Leveraging this starting point, we developed a dual-output sentinel circuit that uses a protease-responsive Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) module to report infection through a virus-triggered spectral shift in luminescence. In the absence of infection, plants emit a stable yellow glow indicating system integrity. Upon infection with potyviruses, cleavage of the BRET fusion by the virus-encoded NIa-Pro protease activates a distinct colour change detectable with low-cost imaging.

To explore the acute response and mechanisms underlying KRAS inhibitor resistance, we used targeted exome sequencing and single-cell spatial transcriptomics to analyze patient-matched pre-treatment, on-treatment, and progression biopsies from patients treated with combined KRASG12C and EGFR inhibition. Acquired genetic events were identified in most patients at progression but were often subclonal and coexisted with transcriptional adaptive states. Mesenchymal, YAP, and fetal-like transcriptional signatures predominated in resistant tumors, while tumor cell-intrinsic inflammatory programs were induced in the early treatment phase. Single-cell spatial analysis revealed significant intratumoral heterogeneity, with diverse adaptive states predominating in different zones of individual tumors. Using human and murine organoid models, we show that these drug-induced inflammatory programs are cancer-cell autonomous and precede the emergence of regenerative fetal-like programs associated with drug resistance. We uncover TBK1 as a promising target to abrogate the early inflammatory adaptive phase and enhance responses to KRAS inhibition.","[{""name"":""Starr Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00gqt9c14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""I16-0062;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K12 CA184746;1K08CA279499;1R21CA292178;P30 CA008748;""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01d35cw23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1250167;""},{""name"":""Emerald Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Distinguished Investigator Award;""},{""name"":""Conquer Cancer Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/027327e78"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754777339665

Recent findings have shown that avirulent strains can engage in sexual reproduction on resistant host plants, even when they fail to cause visible symptoms during the biotrophic phase. The objective was here to examine the (de)coupling of various processes operating during the epidemic period (living plants) and the interepidemic period (crop residues). We assessed whether various encounter scenarios between parental strains, involving co-inoculations performed either simultaneously or sequentially on live and dead wheat plants, could result in successful mating. A two-year experiment accounted for the compatibility between wheat varieties (one carrying the resistance gene Stb16q, the other not) and the strains (virulent or avirulent), and the nature of the inoculum (blastospores or pycnidiospores). The intensity of sexual reproduction was assessed for each scenario through quantification of ascospore production, complemented by genotyping of offspring to confirm their parental origin. The main result is that a Z. tritici strain arriving late on dead host tissues can still mate with a compatible strain that previously colonized the plant, whereas sexual reproduction does not occur if both strains arrive after the plant has dried. Quantitative analysis suggests that although matings initiated by late encounters on wheat residues are possible, they contribute very little to the overall offspring population (< 2%). We discuss the epidemiological implications of this finding for disease management, highlighting both fundamental and applied questions it raises.

This has generated many sequences that have acquired advantageous host functions, but little is known about retrotransposon expression and mobility in adult stem cells or about how these processes might be dynamically regulated. Here we describe the landscape of somatic retrotransposition in haematopoietic stem cells and identify a previously unrecognised pathway which links cytokine signalling, RNA-modulating HNRNP complexes and repression of retrotransposon activity. Activation of JAK2, by thrombopoietin or gain-of-function JAK2 mutations, triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of HNRNPA1 that represses expression of ERVs, LINEs and SINEs and reduces insertional mutagenesis.

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B “Meiosis”;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754777339665

Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone. Because differentially prioritized variants are driven by Borzoi predictions, we leverage attribution techniques to characterize sequence features underlying fine mapping and generate mechanistic hypotheses for GWAS associations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754777339666

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription. Together, these findings redefine H3K4me3 as a post-transcriptional histone mark, revealing an unexpected layer of epigenetic regulation with broad implications for gene expression control.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754777339666

To address this question, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the inner kinetochore (CCAN) from the silkmoth Bombyx mori, an insect that lacks the canonical centromere-specifying histone variant CENP-A and exhibits chromosome-wide centromeric activity (holocentric). Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour l’Education et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754777339666

In unicellular bacteria, the ParMRC DNA partitioning apparatus is well known for forming actin-like filaments that push low copy number plasmids to opposite cell poles. In multicellular cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the presence of a chromosomally encoded ParMR system suggests it may play an analogous role in chromosome segregation. However, we show here that it instead constitutes a novel cytoskeletal system - termed CorMR - whose loss does not impair DNA segregation but leads to severe morphological defects, revealing a role in maintaining cell shape. Using live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that CorM forms dynamically instable filaments. These filaments are recruited to the membrane by CorR, which has acquired a conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that CorM forms antiparallel double-stranded filaments, in contrast to the polar, parallel filament pair seen in ParM. Furthermore, CorMR filaments are excluded from the cell poles and division plane by MinC, via a long N-terminal extension also specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Comparative genomics suggests that cyanobacterial multicellularity co-evolved with the chromosomal relocation of ParMR genes, acquisition of the amphipathic helix in CorR, and functional extension of MinC, supporting an evolutionary link among these features. Our findings uncover a striking repurposing of ancestral biochemical systems, expanding the known roles of ParMR and Min systems beyond plasmid segregation and division site selection to include regulation of cell shape.

ImportanceThe ParMRC system is a well-characterized machinery for the segregation of low-copy-number plasmids to the cell poles and, until now, was primarily described to be encoded on plasmids. We found that during the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, a chromosome-encoded ParMR system has undergone extensive evolutionary and functional repurposing, resulting in a previously undescribed bacterial cytoskeletal system that controls cell shape. We also found that this new cytoskeleton, called CorMR, is under the control of the MinCDE system, which has evolved to not only antagonize Z-ring formation, but also to regulate CorM polymerization. Such interplay between different cytoskeletal systems highlights an intricate regulatory mechanism linking cell division and morphology. As this repurposing of existing cytoskeletal system coincided with the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, it may have played a key role for the evolution of cyanobacteria with distinct cell shapes. Overall, our discovery highlights the plasticity of bacterial polymeric systems and gives insight into the evolution of cellular and multicellular complexity.","[{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Grant Agreement No.101034413;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ActinID, 101076260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754777339666

Here we analyzed evolutionarily unrelated signal-sequestering viral proteins, finding that they share structural and biophysical traits in their genetic organization, ternary structures and binding pocket properties. Based on these traits we developed a structure-guided computational pipeline that can sift through large phage genome databases to unbiasedly predict phage proteins that manipulate bacterial immune signaling. Numerous previously uncharacterized proteins, grouped into three families, were verified to inhibit the bacterial Thoeris and CBASS signaling systems. Proteins of the Sequestin and Lockin families bind and sequester the TIR-produced signaling molecules 3'cADPR and His-ADPR, while proteins of the Acb5 family cleave and inactivate 3'3'-cGAMP and related molecules. X-ray crystallography and structural modeling, combined with mutational analyses, explain the structural basis for sequestration or cleavage of the immune signals. Thousands of these signal-manipulating proteins were detected in phage protein databases, with some instances present in well-studied model phages such as T2, T4 and T6.

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754777339666

However, the regulatory logic and specific gene networks that define cell identities remain poorly resolved across the animal tree of life. As early-branching metazoans, cnidarians can offer insights into the early evolution of cell type-specific genome regulation. Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility in 60,000 cells from whole adults and gastrula-stage embryos of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We identified 112,728 CREs and quantified their activity across cell types, revealing pervasive combinatorial enhancer usage and distinct promoter architectures. To decode the underlying regulatory grammar, we trained sequence-based models predicting CRE accessibility and used these models to infer ontogenetic relationships among cell types. By integrating sequence motifs, transcription factor expression, and CRE accessibility, we systematically reconstructed the gene regulatory networks that define cnidarian cell types. Our results reveal the regulatory complexity underlying cell differentiation in a morphologically simple animal and highlight conserved principles in animal gene regulation. This work provides a foundation for comparative regulatory genomics to understand the evolutionary emergence of animal cell type diversity.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC-StG 851647;""},{""name"":""Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PID2021-124757NB-I00;FPI Severo Ochoa PhD fellowship;""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie INTREPiD co-fund agreement 75442;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie grant agreement 101031767;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754777339666

The components differ in their representational attributes and plasticity, with evidence for sparser, more decorrelated activity and faster plasticity in regions higher up in the hierarchy. How and why did the brain arrive at this organization? We explore the principles that allow such an organization to emerge by simulating a hierarchy of learning subsystems in artificial neural networks (ANNs) using a meta-learning approach. As ANNs optimized weights for a series of tasks, they concurrently meta-learned layer-wise plasticity and sparsity parameters. This approach enhanced the computational efficiency of ANNs, promoting hidden activation sparsity while benefitting task performance. Meta-learning also gave rise to a brain-like hierarchical organization, with higher layers displaying faster plasticity and a sparser, more pattern-separated neural code than lower layers. Early layers peaked early in their plasticity and stabilized, whereas higher layers continued to develop and maintained elevated plasticity over time, mirroring empirical developmental trajectories. Moreover, when trained on dual tasks imposing competing demands for item discrimination and categorization, ANNs with parallel pathways developed distinct representational and plasticity profiles, convergent with the distinct properties observed empirically across intra-hippocampal pathways. These results suggest that the macroscale organization and development of heterogeneous learning subsystems in the brain may emerge in part from optimizing biological variables that govern plasticity and sparsity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754777339666

Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the comparative organization of mouse and human tumor microenvironments (mu/huTMEs). Through immunoprofiling of commonly used mouse models, we found that the immune composition of most muTMEs resemble poorly infiltrated human tumors extensively biased toward high macrophages densities. Relatedly, we discover species-specific biases of chemokine expression networks, factors which drive TMEs assembly. Further, assessing coarse cellular networks, we find conserved correlations between some immune cell frequencies, while other relationships only appear conserved in the huTMEs matching muTME profiles. Despite this variable alignment, we define robust cell type-specific gene expression programs conserved in TMEs across species and cohorts and identify ones that are coordinated between cell populations in both species. Together, we isolate and offer methods to study the multiple areas of hazard and opportunities for using mice to model human cancer.

The persistent infections thought to give rise to these variants, however, have been difficult to identify at scale. This study sought to detect and characterize persistent infection cases in California using routine epidemiologic and genomic surveillance data. We identified 69 persistent infection cases with collection dates between January 2021 and July 2023 ranging from 21 to 400 days in duration, with an average of 44 days. Significant differences were identified in age distribution, sex, hospitalizations, and deaths between persistent infection cases and all sequenced California SARS-CoV-2 cases.

Underlying health conditions were identified for the majority of cases with available medical records. The mutations found in these cases were suggestive of positive selection in the Spike receptor binding domain and convergent evolution toward immune evasion and residues observed in previous persistent infections. We describe a 400-day B.1.429 infection that demonstrates substantial intra-host evolution, and a BA.5.11 persistent infection revealing apparent competition between two intra-host viral subpopulations. By establishing a framework for detecting persistent infections, this study lays the groundwork for other public health organizations to monitor and investigate highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

Author SummaryGenomic surveillance has been used to monitor the evolution and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants throughout the pandemic. When a new variant emerges, it is often due to the accumulation of mutations during a persistent infection, i.e. in an individual who was unable to clear the virus after an infection. Using genomic and epidemiologic surveillance data, we identify 69 of these persistent infections in California and provide demographic and clinical characteristics of these infections compared to the broader population of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The identification of risk factors for persistent infections provides important insight into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, while the identification of shared mutations between these infections enhances our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolution that may result in new variants. Ultimately, our work may help public health labs to better monitor persistent infections in the future, prior to the potential emergence and spread of novel variants into the community.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754777339666

How does the brain use such error signals for learning? While global error signals can be useful, their ability to learn complex computation at the scale observed in the brain is lacking. In comparison, more local, neuron-specific error signals enable superior performance, but their computation and propagation remain unclear. Motivated by the breakthrough of deep learning, this has inspired the  backpropagation and the brain hypothesis, i.e. that the brain implements a form of the error backpropagation algorithm.

In this work, we introduce a biologically motivated, multi-area cortical microcircuit model, implementing error backpropagation under consideration of recent physiological evidence. We model populations of cortical pyramidal cells acting as representation and error neurons, with bio-plausible local and inter-area connectivity, guided by experimental observations of connectivity of the primate visual cortex. In our model, all information transfer is biologically motivated, inference and learning occur without phases, and network dynamics demonstrably approximate those of error backpropagation.

We show the capabilities of our model on a wide range of benchmarks, and compare to other models, such as dendritic hierarchical predictive coding. In particular, our model addresses shortcomings of other theories in terms of scalability to many cortical areas. Finally, we make concrete predictions, which differentiate it from other theories, and which can be tested in experiment.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""225643;""},{""name"":""Volkswagen Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03bsmfz84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754777339666
