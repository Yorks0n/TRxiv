Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Thereafter, JN.1 subvariants, such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1), KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), and KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which convergently acquired a deletion of Serine at the 31st position in S (S:S31del) in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We recently reported the virological features of JN.1 subvariants including KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3.2,3 Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.3.1.1. First, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3.1.1 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model4 based on genome surveillance data from Spain, the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, where this variant has spread as of June 2024. In Spain, the Re of KP.3.1.1 is over 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and even higher than those of KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein show higher Re for KP.3.1.1. However, it must be noted there is the possibility of overestimation in these countries due to more limited KP.3.1.1 sequence numbers. These results suggest that KP.3.1.1 will spread worldwide along with other JN.1 sublineages. We then assessed the virological properties of KP.3.1.1 using pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus of KP.3.1.1 had significantly higher infectivity than that of KP.3. Neutralization of KP.3.1.1 was tested using i) convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or EG.5, ii) convalescent sera after the infection with HK.3 or JN.1, and iii) sera after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.3.1.1 was significantly lower than KP.3 (1.4-1.6-fold) in all four groups of convalescent sera tested. KP.3.1.1 also showed a 1.3-fold lower NT50 against XBB.1.5 vaccine sera than KP.3. Moreover, KP.3.1.1 showed stronger resistance with a 1.3-fold lower NT50 with statistical significances to the convalescent sera infected with EG.5 and HK.3 than KP.2.3. Altogether, KP.3.1.1 exhibited a higher Re, higher pseudovirus infectivity, and higher neutralization evasion than KP.3. These results align with our recent report that the JN.1 subvariants with S:S31del (e.g., KP.2.3 and LB.1) exhibited enhanced Re and immune evasion compared to the other JN.1 subvariants without S:S31del (e.g., JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3), highlighting the evolutionary significance of S:S31del in the JN.1 lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927216

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927216

All five patients were diagnosed with myocarditis, confirmed through endomyocardial biopsy and histochemical staining, which identified inflammatory cell infiltration in their heart tissue. Crucially, electron microscopy revealed widespread mitochondrial vacuolations and the presence of myofilament degradation within the cardiomyocytes of these patients. These findings were mirrored in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, suggesting a potential underlying cellular mechanism for the cardiac effects associated with Long COVID. Our report sheds light on the cardiovascular implications of Long COVID and underscores the importance of further research to understand its cellular underpinnings.","NA","medrxiv",1724450927216

Thus far, only a limited number of Clade I MPXV genomes have been characterized, and they are not representative across different regions and time periods.

MethodsWe conducted whole genome sequencing of 603 mpox-positive samples that were collected from 581 patients between 2018-2024 in 17/26 provinces of the DRC.

ResultsGenome coverage was at least 70% for 423/603 (70.1%) samples and near full-length MPXV genomes (>90% coverage) were obtained for 348/603 (57.7%) samples. All newly generated MPXV sequences belonged to Clade I, among which 17 were Clade Ib strains, all from patients infected in 2024 in the South-Kivu province. The large majority (95%) of the new strains fall within previously described Clade Ia groups and potential new groups have also been observed. Genetically diverse MPXV lineages co-circulate in small geographic areas during the same outbreak suggesting multiple zoonotic introductions over a short period from one or multiple reservoir species. The low number of APOBEC3 mutations found among Clade Ia suggests that most human mpox cases are probably linked to zoonotic transmissions. Recent identification of mpox cases in Kinshasa shows multiple virus lineages being present within a large urban center.

ConclusionThe mpox epidemic in the DRC exhibits two distinct patterns. In traditional endemic regions, the epidemic in DRC is predominated by zoonotic spillover events involving Clade Ia. Conversely, in the eastern part of the country, the Clade Ib outbreak is driven by human-to-human transmission highlighting the need for a coordinated response effort at the national, regional and international levels.","NA","medrxiv",1724450927216

Despite its importance, conducting manual experiments with individual fruit flies can be challenging and time-consuming, especially for studies of individual fly behaviors. Such studies often involve cumbersome preparatory steps, such as manually tethering a fly and then positioning it within an experimental setup1,2. These procedures commonly require the fly to be anesthetized, and, before behavioral assessments begin, the fly must recover from anesthesia. Hence, the introduction of automated phenotyping and behavioral assays would expedite important aspects of fly research, by minimizing manual handling of flies and decreasing the net time needed for experiments. Here, we introduce FlyMAX (Fly Manipulation and Autonomous eXperimentation), an autonomous robotic system for manipulating adult flies without use of anesthesia. FlyMAX collects individual flies from a standard vial, analyzes them with computer vision, and achieves a throughput of >1,000 flies per day for high-throughput inspection and characterization assays. Robotic handling had no detectable adverse effects on fly longevity or our assessments of fly health. Moreover, the behavioral performance of flies, especially of males, was better and less variable than of flies handled manually. Our system employs deep learning-based machine vision for real-time assessments of picking quality and fly phenotypes. This enables fully pipelined, autonomous experimentation for behavioral assays with individual flies in controlled environments, which was previously infeasible. Overall, FlyMAX constitutes a promising technology to enhance the efficiency and reproducibility of research with flies and other insects in fields such as genetics, neuroscience, and drug screening.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927216

Here, we demonstrate a ""brain-to-voice"" neuroprosthesis that instantaneously synthesizes voice with closed-loop audio feedback by decoding neural activity from 256 microelectrodes implanted into the ventral precentral gyrus of a man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and severe dysarthria. We overcame the challenge of lacking ground-truth speech for training the neural decoder and were able to accurately synthesize his voice. Along with phonemic content, we were also able to decode paralinguistic features from intracortical activity, enabling the participant to modulate his BCI-synthesized voice in real-time to change intonation, emphasize words, and sing short melodies. These results demonstrate the feasibility of enabling people with paralysis to speak intelligibly and expressively through a BCI.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Anti-defense proteins have diverse functional domains, sequences, and are typically small, creating a challenge to detect anti-defense homologs across the prokaryotic genomes. To date, no tools comprehensively annotate anti-defense proteins within a desired genome or MGE. Here, we developed ""AntiDefenseFinder"" - a free open-source tool and web service that detects 156 anti-defense systems (of one or more proteins) in any genomic sequence. Using this dataset, we identified 47,981 anti-defense systems distributed across prokaryotes, phage, and MGEs. We found that some genes co-localize in ""anti-defense islands"", including E. coli T4 and Lambda phages, although many are standalone. Out of the 112 systems detected in bacteria, 100 systems localize only or preferentially in prophages, plasmids, phage satellites, integrons, and integrative and conjugative elements. However, over 80% of anti-Pycsar protein 1 (Apyc1) resides in non-mobile regions of bacteria. Evolutionary and functional analyses revealed that Apyc1 likely originated in bacteria to regulate cNMP signaling, but was co-opted multiple times by phages to overcome cNMP-utilizing defenses. With the AntiDefenseFinder tool, we hope to facilitate the identification of the full repertoire of anti-defense systems in MGEs, the discovery of new protein functions, and a deeper understanding of host-pathogen arms race.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Such studies face the central difficulty of distinguishing possible causal influences, in particular genetic and non-genetic ones. When confounding between possible influences is not rigorously addressed, it invites over- and misinterpretation of data. We illustrate the breadth of this problem through a discussion of the literature and a reanalysis of two examples. Clark (2023) suggested that patterns of similarity in social status between relatives indicate that social status is largely determined by one's DNA. We show that the paper's conclusions are based on the conflation of genetic and non-genetic transmission, such as wealth, within families. Song & Zhang (2024) posited that genetic variants underlying bisexual behavior are maintained in the population because they also affect risk-taking behavior, thereby conferring an evolutionary fitness advantage through increased sexual promiscuity. In this case, too, we show that possible explanations cannot be distinguished, but only one is chosen and presented as a conclusion. We discuss how issues of confounding apply more broadly to studies that claim to establish genetic underpinnings to human behavior and societal outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Despite advances in single-cell technologies, the molecular and cellular responses that contribute to long-term post-stroke impairment remain poorly understood. To gain better insight into the underlying mechanisms, we generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from distinct brain regions using a mouse model of permanent focal ischemia at one month post-injury. Our findings reveal cell- and region-specific changes within the stroke-injured and peri-infarct brain tissue. For instance, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons exhibited upregulated genes in signaling pathways involved in axon guidance and synaptic plasticity, and downregulated pathways associated with aerobic metabolism. Using cell-cell communication analysis, we identified increased strength in predicted interactions within stroke tissue among both neural and non-neural cells via signaling pathways such as those involving collagen, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor, neuronal growth regulator, laminin, and several cell adhesion molecules. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between mouse transcriptome responses after stroke and those observed in human nonfatal brain stroke lesions. Common molecular features were linked to inflammatory responses, extracellular matrix organization, and angiogenesis. Our findings provide a detailed resource for advancing our molecular understanding of stroke pathology and for discovering therapeutic targets in the repair phase of stroke recovery.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

The sensors powered a high-throughput small molecule compound library screen, revealing multiple compounds in different chemical classes that strongly modulate cellular polyamine levels.

This is variously interpreted as speed/accuracy, fast/slow, or impulsivity/deliberateness tradeoffs according to different models of behaviour. Regardless, it is generally assumed that decision latency reflects the neural mechanisms underlying behavioural strategy and cognitive investment. However, such investigations have been difficult in mice which are consistently impulsive. Here, we show that manipulating cost, using a novel floating-platform paradigm, overcomes the natural impulsivity of mice, more closely matching human behaviour. Furthermore, this approach allowed us simultaneously to measure the flow of activity from medial to lateral frontal cortex (MFC to LFC) and record sequences of single neuron activity with 2-photon imaging. Surprisingly, MFC display a different mode of operation, with high vulnerability to optical inhibition compared to LFC. Furthermore, the balance in choice coding at the beginning of sequences in MFC correlated with trial history and behavioural strategy. We found that for optimal performance, slow sequences in MFC showed declining numbers of active neurons whereas the opposite was true in LFC. Our results suggest that while LFC acts as an integrative motor threshold, MFC plays a larger cognitive role in the selection and timing of decisions than previously thought. Our study offers a methodological and mechanistic framework in mouse frontal cortex to understand the neural basis of voluntary decision making.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Here, we use a meta-scoring approach to develop a metaPRS for T2D that incorporated genome-wide associations from both European and non-European genetic ancestries and T2D risk factors. We evaluated the performance of this metaPRS and benchmarked it against existing genome-wide PRS in 620,059 participants and 50,572 T2D cases amongst six diverse genetic ancestries from UK Biobank, INTERVAL, the All of Us Research Program, and the Singapore Multi-Ethnic Cohort. We show that our metaPRS was the most powerful PRS for predicting T2D in European population-based cohorts and had comparable performance to the top ancestry-specific PRS, highlighting its transferability. In UK Biobank, we show the metaPRS had stronger predictive power for 10-year risk than all individual risk factors apart from BMI and biomarkers of dysglycemia. The metaPRS modestly improved T2D risk stratification of QDiabetes risk scores for 10-year risk prediction, particularly when prioritising individuals for blood tests of dysglycemia.

To quantify phenotypic adaptation in BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma, we develop a theoretical model that emerges from data analysis of WM239A-BRAFV600E growth rates in response to drug challenge with the BRAF-inhibitor encorafenib. Our model constitutes a cell population model in which each cell is individually described by one of multiple discrete and plastic phenotype states that are directly linked to drug-dependent net growth rates and, by extension, drug resistance. Data-matched simulations reveal that phenotypic adaptation in the cells is directed towards states of high net growth rates, which enables evasion of drug-effects. The model subsequently provides an explanation for when and why intermittent treatments outperform continuous treatments in vitro, and demonstrates the benefits of not only targeting, but also leveraging, phenotypic adaptation in treatment protocols.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

However, whether individual neurons also embed information about their own anatomical location within their spike patterns remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that machine learning models can predict a neurons anatomical location across multiple brain regions and structures based solely on its spiking activity. Analyzing high-density recordings from thousands of neurons in awake, behaving mice, we demonstrate that anatomical location can be reliably decoded from neuronal activity across various stimulus conditions, including drifting gratings, naturalistic movies, and spontaneous activity. Crucially, anatomical signatures generalize across animals and even across different research laboratories, suggesting a fundamental principle of neural organization. Examination of trained classifiers reveals that anatomical information is enriched in specific interspike intervals as well as responses to stimuli. Within the visual isocortex, anatomical embedding is robust at the level of layers and primary versus secondary but does not robustly separate individual secondary structures. In contrast, structures within the hippocampus and thalamus are robustly separable based on their spike patterns. Our findings reveal a generalizable dimension of the neural code, where anatomical information is multiplexed with the encoding of external stimuli and internal states. This discovery provides new insights into the relationship between brain structure and function, with broad implications for neurodevelopment, multimodal integration, and the interpretation of large-scale neuronal recordings. Immediately, it has potential as a strategy for in-vivo electrode localization.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

In neuroscience, this fact has inspired several recent studies in sensory and motor systems. However, less is known about how higher associational cortical areas, such as the hippocampus, modify representations throughout the learning of complex tasks. Here we focus on associative learning, a process that requires forming a connection between the representations of different variables for appropriate behavioral response. We trained rats in a spatial-context associative task and monitored hippocampal neural activity throughout the entire learning period, over several days. This allowed us to assess changes in the representations of context, movement direction and position, as well as their relationship to behavior. We identified a hierarchical representational structure in the encoding of these three task variables that was preserved throughout learning. Nevertheless, we also observed changes at the lower levels of the hierarchy where context was encoded. These changes were local in neural activity space and restricted to physical positions where context identification was necessary for correct decision making, supporting better context decoding and contextual code compression. Our results demonstrate that the hippocampal code not only accommodates hierarchical relationships between different variables but also enables efficient learning through minimal changes in neural activity space. Beyond the hippocampus, our work reveals a representation learning mechanism that might be implemented in other biological and artificial networks performing similar tasks.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Using genetic linkage analysis, we narrowed the associated region to 1cM of the genome and then with a genome editing approach, we show that the mutation, a small complex insertion-deletion, generates a de novo gain-of-function enhancer that drives higher expression of KCNB1 in cardiomyocytes.

Materials and methodsA compartmental Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model was adapted to reflect COVID-19 cases in the UK. Numbers of symptomatic infections, COVID-19- related hospitalizations and deaths, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were predicted using a decision tree. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of an updated Moderna mRNA vaccine (Moderna Autumn 2024 Campaign) was compared to no Autumn 2024 vaccine and to an updated Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA Autumn 2024 vaccine, from a healthcare perspective.

ResultsThe Moderna Autumn 2024 Vaccination Campaign is predicted to decrease the expected 8.3 million symptomatic infections with no vaccination by 19% to 6.7 million. Hospitalizations, long COVID cases, and deaths are expected to decline by 27,000 (-38%), 59,000 (-19%), and 6000 (-43%), respectively. The Moderna Autumn 2024 Campaign will increase QALYs by 78,000 and costs by {pound}665 million, yielding an ICER of {pound}8500/QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses suggest that vaccine effectiveness (VE) and waning, symptomatic infection incidence, hospitalization rates, and mortality rates drive cost-effectiveness. Vaccination remains cost-effective when lowering the target population to [&ge;]50 years. Use of the Moderna vaccine is expected to prevent 8000 more hospitalizations and 1700 more deaths than the updated Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

ConclusionsVaccination of the eligible population would contribute to significant reductions in hospitalizations, deaths, and long COVID in the UK in the 2024-2025 season. Expanding the target population continues to be cost-effective. Use of the Moderna Autumn 2024 Campaign is predicted to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated outcomes in a cost-effective manner and will contribute to a more resilient healthcare system in the UK.","NA","medrxiv",1724450927217

To fill this gap, we studied the interactions between the quadruped ANYmal robot and a group of 37 wild vervet monkeys in South Africa. The ANYmal robot is a remote-controlled sheep-sized robot with an open box of food on its back. We gradually introduced the robot to the monkeys following five different steps over 6 days for a total exposition time of about 10h. The monkeys habituated to the robot very quickly with six individuals eating the food in the robots box from the second day. A few individuals, mostly juveniles, emitted alarm calls towards the robot. In total, seven individuals, high rankers, spent time near the robot and 21 monkeys approached the robot from a greater distance. High rankers displayed significantly more vigilant and self-centered behaviors and they, with females and juveniles, ate more food in the robots box compared to low rankers, males, and adults conversely.

However, directly perturbing these patterns, ideally with great specificity, is required to causally test any particular theory. We combined two-photon imaging and cellular resolution optogenetic photo-stimulation to causally test how neural activity in the mouse visual cortex is read out to detect visual stimuli. Contrary to expectations, targeted activation of highly sensitive neural ensembles did not preferentially modify behavior compared to random ensembles, contradicting a longstanding hypothesis for how neural activity drives stimulus detection. Instead, the main predictor of a targeted neural ensembles impact on perception was its effect on network activity. This argues that downstream regions summate visual cortex activity without preferentially weighting more informative neurons to make sensory detection decisions. Comparing mouse behavioral performance to decoding models of neural activity implies that mice employ this simple, albeit suboptimal strategy to solve the task. This work challenges conventional notions for how sensory representations mediate perception and demonstrates that specific neural perturbations are critical for determining which features of neural activity drive behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms.

This was associated with phenotypic changes including evasion of pre-existing immunity and decreased disease severity. Continuous evolution within the Omicron lineage raised concerns of potential increased transmissibility and/or disease severity. To address this, we evaluated the fitness and pathogenesis of contemporary Omicron variants XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, EG.5.1, and JN.1 in the upper (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT). We compared in vivo infection in Syrian hamsters with infection in primary human nasal and lung epithelium cells and assessed differences in transmissibility, antigenicity, and innate immune activation. Omicron variants replicated efficiently in the URT but displayed limited pathology in the lungs compared to previous variants and failed to replicate in human lung organoids. JN.1 was attenuated in both URT and LRT compared to other Omicron variants and failed to transmit in the hamster model. Our data demonstrate that Omicron lineage evolution has favored increased fitness in the URT.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

The delivery of conventional IgG antibody technologies targeting GD2 is limited clinically by its co-expression on nerves that contributes to toxicity presenting as severe neuropathic pain. To improve the tumor selectivity of current GD2-targeting approaches, a next-generation bispecific antibody targeting GD2 and B7-H3 (CD276) was generated.

MethodsDifferential expression of human B7-H3 (hB7-H3) was transduced into GD2+ B78 murine melanoma cells and confirmed by flow cytometry. We assessed the avidity and selectivity of our GD2-B7-H3 targeting bispecific antibodies (INV34-6, INV33-2, and INV36-6) towards GD2+/hB7-H3- B78 cells relative to GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 cells using flow cytometry and competition binding assays, comparing results an anti-GD2 antibody (dinutuximab, DINU). The bispecific antibodies, DINU, and a non-targeted bispecific control (bsAb CTRL) were conjugated with deferoxamine for radiolabeling with Zr-89 (t1/2 = 78.4 h). Using positron emission tomography (PET) studies, we evaluated the in vivo avidity and selectivity of the GD2-B7-H3 targeting bispecific compared to bsAb CTRL and DINU using GD2+/hB7-H3+ and GD2+/hB7-H3- B78 tumor models.

ResultsFlow cytometry and competition binding assays showed that INV34-6 bound with high avidity to GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 cells with high avidity but not GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 cells. In comparison, no selectivity between cell types was observed for DINU. PET in mice bearing the GD2+/hB7-H3- and GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 murine tumor showed similar biodistribution in normal tissues for [89Zr]Zr-Df-INV34-6, [89Zr]Zr-Df-bsAb CTRL, and [89Zr]Zr-Df-DINU. Importantly, [89Zr]Zr-Df-INV34-6 tumor uptake was selective to GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 over GD2+/hB7-H3- B78 tumors, and substantially higher to GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 than the non-targeted [89Zr]Zr-Df-bsAb CTRL control. [89Zr]Zr-Df-DINU displayed similar uptake in both GD2+ tumor models, with uptake comparable to [89Zr]Zr-Df-INV34-6 in the GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 model.

ConclusionThe GD2-B7-H3 targeting bispecific antibodies successfully improved selectivity to cells expressing both antigens. This approach should address the severe toxicities associated with GD2-targeting therapies by reducing off-tumor GD2 binding in nerves. Continued improvements in bispecific antibody technologies will continue to transform the therapeutic biologics landscape.

Here, we developed a non-invasive astrocyte-specific method utilizing a single AAV vector, which we named GEARBOCS (Gene Editing in AstRocytes Based On CRISPR/Cas9 System). We verified GEARBOCS specificity to mouse cortical astrocytes and demonstrated its utility for three types of gene manipulations: knockout (KO); tagging (TagIn); and reporter knock-in (GeneTrap) strategies. Next, we deployed GEARBOCS in two test cases. First, we determined that astrocytes are a necessary source of the synaptogenic factor Sparcl1 for thalamocortical synapse maintenance in the mouse primary visual cortex. Second, we determined that cortical astrocytes express the synaptic vesicle associated Vamp2 protein and found that it is required for maintaining excitatory and inhibitory synapse numbers in the visual cortex. These results show that the GEARBOCS strategy provides a fast and efficient means to study astrocyte biology in vivo.

MotivationAstrocytes are indispensable for brain development, function, and health. However, molecular tools to study astrocyte biology and function in vivo have been largely limited to genetically modified mice. Here, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing strategy within a single AAV vector that enables efficient genome manipulations in astrocytes. We designed and optimized this easy-to-use viral tool to understand gene expression, protein localization and function in astrocytes in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

The Caribbean harbors a high number of threatened, endangered, and critically endangered coral species compared to reefs of the larger Indo-Pacific. The reef corals of the Caribbean are also long diverged from their Pacific counterparts and may have evolved different survival strategies. Most genomic resources have been developed for Pacific coral species which may impede our ability to study the changes in genetic composition of Caribbean reef communities in response to global change. To help fill the gap in genomic resources, we used PacBio HiFi sequencing to generate the first genome assemblies for three Caribbean, reef-building corals, Colpophyllia natans, Dendrogyra cylindrus, and Siderastrea siderea. We also explore the genomic novelties that shape scleractinian genomes. Notably, we find abundant gene duplications of all classes (e.g., tandem and segmental), especially in S. siderea. This species has one of the largest genomes of any scleractinian coral (822Mb) which seems to be driven by repetitive content and gene family expansion and diversification. As the genome size of S. siderea was double the size expected of stony corals, we also evaluated the possibility of an ancient whole genome duplication using Ks tests and found no evidence of such an event in the species. By presenting these genome assemblies, we hope to develop a better understanding of coral evolution as a whole and to enable researchers to further investigate the population genetics and diversity of these three species.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

However, tools for comprehensive, high-resolution analysis of disease-associated changes at the whole-body scale have been lacking. Here, we developed a suite of deep learning-based image analysis algorithms (MouseMapper) and integrated it with tissue clearing and light-sheet microscopy to enable a comprehensive analysis of diseases impacting diverse systems across the mouse body. This approach enables the quantitative analysis of cellular and structural changes across the entire mouse body at unprecedented resolution and scale, including tracking nerves over several centimeters in whole animal bodies. To demonstrate its power, we applied MouseMapper to study nervous and immune systems in high-fat diet induced obesity. We uncovered widespread changes in both immune cell distribution and nerve structures, including alterations in the trigeminal nerve characterized by a reduced number of nerve endings in obese mice. These structural abnormalities were associated with functional deficits of whisker sensing and proteomic changes in the trigeminal ganglion, primarily affecting pathways related to axon growth and the complement system. Additionally, we found heterogeneity in obesity-induced whole-body inflammation across different tissues and organs. Our study demonstrates MouseMappers capability to discover and quantify pathological alterations at the whole-body level, offering a powerful approach for investigating the systemic impacts of various diseases.

Remarkably, we find WHIX in T6SS effectors that contain a single toxic domain, as well as in effectors that contain two distinct toxic domains fused to either side of WHIX. We demonstrate that the latter, which we name double-edged sword effectors, require two cognate immunity proteins to antagonize their toxicity. Furthermore, we show that WHIX can be used as a chassis for T6SS-mediated secretion of multiple domains.

This can result in serious, potentially deadly, side effects when used therapeutically. Although the mechanism by which CHL and LZD inhibit bacterial ribosomes has been elucidated in detail, their mechanism of action against mitochondrial ribosomes has yet to be explored. CHL and oxazolidinones bind to the ribosomal peptidyl transfer center (PTC) of the bacterial ribosome and prevent incorporation of incoming amino acids under specific sequence contexts, causing ribosomes to stall only at certain sequences. Through mitoribosome profiling, we show that inhibition of mitochondrial ribosomes is similarly context-specific - CHL and LZD lead to mitoribosome stalling primarily when there is an alanine, serine, or threonine in the penultimate position of the nascent peptide chain. We further validate context-specific stalling through in vitro translation assays. A high resolution cryo-EM structure of LZD bound to the PTC of the human mitoribosome shows extensive similarity to the mode of bacterial inhibition and also suggests potential avenues for altering selectivity. Our findings could help inform the rational development of future, less mitotoxic, antibiotics, which are critically needed in the current era of increasing antimicrobial resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Whether growth conditions affect other stages of replication beyond initiation, remains to be systematically studied. To address this, we assess the replication dynamics of Caulobacter crescentus, a bacterium that undergoes only single round of replication per cell cycle, by tracking the replisome across various growth phases and nutrient conditions. We find that the replication elongation rates slowdown as cells transition from exponential (high-nutrient) to stationary (low-nutrient) phase, and this contributes significantly to the overall cell cycle delay. While elongation rates are correlated with growth rates, both properties appear to be differentially influenced by nutrient status. This slowdown in replication progression is not associated with increased mutagenesis or upregulation of the DNA damage responses. We conclude that the growth conditions not only dictate the commitment to replication but also the rates of genome duplication. Such regulation appears to be distinct from stress-induced replication slowdown and likely serves as an adaptive mechanism to cope with fluctuations in nutrient availability in the environment.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Our model further illustrates that NPIs and waning immunity are important factors in driving long delays in epidemic resurgence.","NA","medrxiv",1724450927217

Vagal TRPV1+ nociceptive sensory neurons, which innervate the airways, are known to mediate defenses against harmful agents. However, their function in lung antiviral defenses remains unclear. Our study reveals that both systemic and vagal-specific ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors reduced survival in mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV), despite no significant changes in viral burden or weight loss. Mice lacking nociceptors showed exacerbated lung pathology and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The increased mortality was not attributable to the loss of the TRPV1 ion channel or neuropeptides CGRP or substance P. Immune profiling through flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing identified significant nociceptor deficiency-mediated changes in the lung immune landscape, including an expansion of neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. Transcriptional analysis revealed impaired interferon signaling in these myeloid cells and an imbalance in distinct neutrophil sub-populations in the absence of nociceptors. Furthermore, anti-GR1-mediated depletion of myeloid cells during IAV infection significantly improved survival, underscoring a role of nociceptors in preventing pathogenic myeloid cell states that contribute to IAV-induced mortality.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Here, we established an analytical framework for the joint analysis of large MSI datasets that allows for the construction of multidimensional metabolomic atlases. Employing this framework, we mapped the 4D distribution of over a hundred lipids at quasi-single-cell resolution in Danio rerio embryos. We discovered metabolic trajectories that unfold in concert with morphogenesis and revealed spatially organized biochemical coordination overlooked by bulk measurements. Interestingly, lipid mapping revealed unexpected distributions of sphingolipid and triglyceride species, suggesting their involvement in pattern establishment and organ development. Our approach empowers a new generation of whole-organism metabolomic atlases and enables the discovery of spatially organized metabolic circuits.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

The human FEAR pathway is mediated by the FACT complex, consisting of hSpt16 and SSRP1 subunits, that remodels chromatin to activate expression of the antiviral transcription factor, ETS-1. To counter this pathway, poxvirus A51R proteins tether SUMOylated hSpt16 subunits to microtubules to prevent ETS-1 expression. While these observations indicate a role for the FEAR pathway in DNA virus restriction, it was unclear if RNA viruses interact with this pathway. Here, we show that RNA viruses are also restricted by the FEAR pathway, yet encode mechanisms distinct from poxviruses to counter this response. We show vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a rhabdovirus, utilizes its matrix (M) protein to promote proteasome-dependent degradation of SUMOylated hSpt16 and to block ETS-1 nuclear import. Strains encoding mutant M proteins that cannot antagonize the FEAR pathway exhibit replication defects in human cells that can be rescued by hSpt16 or ETS-1 depletion. Moreover, FACT inhibitor treatment enhanced the replication of oncolytic VSV strains encoding defective M proteins in restrictive cancer cells, suggesting FEAR pathway inhibition may improve oncolytic virotherapy. Strikingly, we provide evidence that the inability of VSV M to degrade SUMOylated Spt16 in lepidopteran insect cells results in abortive infection, suggesting VSV-Spt16 interactions influence virus host range. Lastly, we show that human and murine paramyxovirus target SUMOylated Spt16 proteins for degradation in human and murine cells utilizing a conserved N-terminal motif in their accessory ""C"" proteins. Collectively, our study illustrates that DNA and RNA viruses have independently evolved diverse mechanisms to antagonize SUMOylated host Spt16 proteins, underscoring the physiological importance of the FEAR pathway to antiviral immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

One species of thermophilic cyanobacteria, Thermosynechococcus taiwanensis, has been studied for biomass pyrolysis, estrogen degradation, and the production of bioethanol, monosaccharide, and phycocyanin. To better understand the diversity and evolution of this species, we sampled across different regions in Taiwan for strain isolation and genomic analysis. Results: A total of 27 novel strains were isolated from nine of the 12 hot springs sampled and subjected to whole genome sequencing. Including strains studied previously, our genomic analyses encompassed 32 strains from 11 hot springs. Genome sizes among these strains ranged from 2.64 to 2.70 Mb, with an average of 2.66 Mb. Annotation revealed between 2,465 and 2,576 protein-coding genes per genome, averaging 2,537 genes. Core-genome phylogeny, gene flow estimates, and overall gene content divergence consistently supported the within-species divergence into two major populations. While isolation by distance partially explained the within-population divergence, the factors driving divergence between populations remain unclear. Nevertheless, this species likely has a closed pan-genome comprising approximately 3,030 genes, with our sampling providing sufficient coverage of its genomic diversity. To investigate the divergence and potential adaptations, we identified genomic regions with significantly lower nucleotide diversity, indicating loci that may have undergone selective sweeps within each population. We identified 149 and 289 genes within these regions in populations A and B, respectively. Only 16 genes were common to both populations, suggesting that selective sweeps primarily targeted different genes in the two populations. Key genes related to functions such as carbon fixation, photosynthesis, motility, and ion transport were highlighted. Conclusions: This work provides a population genomics perspective on a hot spring cyanobacterial species in Taiwan. Beyond advancing our understanding of microbial genomics and evolution, the strains collected and genome sequences generated in this work provide valuable materials for future development and utilization of biological resources.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Despite the increased prevalence of experimental studies that interrogate this phenomenon, there remains a lack of applicable quantitative tools to characterise data, and importantly to distinguish between resistance as a discrete phenotype and a (potentially heterogeneous) continuous distribution of phenotypes. To address this, we develop a stochastic individual-based model of adaptive resistance in low-cell-count proliferation assays. That our model corresponds probabilistically to common partial differential equation models of resistance allows us to formulate a likelihood that captures the intrinsic noise ubiquitous to such experiments. We apply our framework to assess the identifiability of key model parameters in several population-level data collection regimes; in particular, parameters relating to the adaptation velocity and within-population heterogeneity. Significantly, we find that heterogeneity is practically non-identifiable from both cell count and proliferation marker data, implying that population-level behaviours may be well characterised by homogeneous ordinary differential equation models. Additionally, we demonstrate that population-level data are insufficient to distinguish resistance as a discrete phenotype from a continuous distribution of phenotypes. Our results inform the design of both future experiments and future quantitative analyses that probe adaptive resistance in cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neuromelanin imaging, and pupillometry, we show that arousal and locus coeruleus (LC) activation transform otherwise continuous experiences into distinct episodic memories. As sequences unfold, encountering a context shift, or event boundary, triggers arousal and LC processes that predict later memory separation. Boundaries furthermore promote temporal pattern separation within left hippocampal dentate gyrus, which correlates with heightened LC responses to those same transition points. We also find that a neurochemical index of prolonged LC activation correlates with diminished arousal responses at boundaries, suggesting a connection between elevated LC output and impaired event processing. These findings align with the idea that arousal processes initiate a neural and memory  reset in response to significant changes, constructing the very episodes that define everyday memory.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Countries that have had recent FMD outbreaks are prohibited from exporting most meat products; this has major economic consequences for farmers in those countries, particularly farmers that experience outbreaks or are near outbreaks. Reducing the number of FMD outbreaks in countries where the disease is endemic is an important challenge that could drastically improve the livelihoods of millions of people. As a result, significant effort is expended on surveillance; but there is a concern that uninformative surveillance strategies may waste resources that could be better used on control management. Rapid detection through sentinel surveillance may be a useful tool to reduce the scale and burden of outbreaks. In this study, we use an extensive outbreak and cattle shipment network dataset from the Republic of Turkiye to test three possible strategies for sentinel surveillance allocation that differ in their data requirements: ranging from low to high data needs, we allocate limited surveillance to [1] farms that frequently send and receive shipments of animals (Network Connectivity), [2] farms near other farms with past outbreaks (Spatial Proximity) and [3] farms that receive many animals from other farms with past outbreaks (Network Proximity). We determine that all of these surveillance methods find a similar number of outbreaks - 2-4.5 times more outbreaks than were detected by surveying farms at random. On average across surveillance efforts, the Network Proximity and Network Connectivity methods each find a similar number of outbreaks and the Spatial Proximity method always finds the fewest outbreaks. Since the Network Proximity method does not outperform the other methods, these results indicate that incorporating both cattle shipment data and outbreak data provides only marginal benefit over the less data-intensive surveillance allocation methods for this objective. We also find that these methods all find more outbreaks when outbreaks are rare. This is encouraging, as early detection is critical for outbreak management. Overall, since the Spatial Proximity and Network Connectivity methods find a similar proportion of outbreaks, and are less data-intensive than the Network Proximity method, countries with endemic FMD whose resources are constrained could prioritize allocating sentinels based on whichever of those two methods requires less additional data collection.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Here, using the MEGA (Memory Episode Gaze Anticipation) paradigm, we show that monitoring anticipatory gaze using eye tracking can quantify memory retrieval without verbal report. Upon repeated viewing of movie clips, eye gaze patterns anticipating salient events can quantify their memory traces seconds before these events appear on the screen. A series of experiments with a total of 126 participants using either tailor-made animations or naturalistic movies consistently reveal that accumulated gaze proximity to the event can index memory. Machine learning-based classification can identify whether a given viewing is associated with memory for the event based on single-trial data of gaze features. Detailed comparison to verbal reports establishes that anticipatory gaze marks recollection of associative memory about the event, whereas pupil dilation captures familiarity. Finally, anticipatory gaze reveals beneficial effects of sleep on memory retrieval without verbal report, illustrating its broad applicability across cognitive research and clinical domains.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Here, we use the UK Biobank to measure the change in PGS prediction accuracy as a continuous function of individuals' genome-wide genetic dissimilarity to the GWAS sample (''genetic distance''). Our results highlight three gaps in our understanding of PGS portability. First, prediction accuracy is extremely noisy at the individual level and not well predicted by genetic distance. In fact, variance in prediction accuracy is explained comparably well by socioeconomic measures. Second, trends of portability vary across traits. For several immunity-related traits, prediction accuracy drops near zero quickly even at intermediate levels of genetic distance. This quick drop may reflect GWAS associations being more ancestry-specific in immunity-related traits than in other traits. Third, we show that even qualitative trends of portability can depend on the measure of prediction accuracy used. For instance, for white blood cell count, a measure of prediction accuracy at the individual level (reduction in mean squared error) increases with genetic distance. Together, our results show that portability cannot be understood through global ancestry groupings alone. There are other, understudied factors influencing portability, such as the specifics of the evolution of the trait and its genetic architecture, social context, and the construction of the polygenic score. Addressing these gaps can aid in the development and application of PGS and inform more equitable genomic research.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

High-accuracy, long-read sequencing can substantially improve SV characterization when coupled with effective calling methods. While state-of the-art long-read SV callers are highly accurate, further improvements are achievable by systematically modeling local haplotypes during SV discovery and genotyping. Results We describe sawfish, an SV caller for mapped high-quality long reads incorporating systematic SV haplotype modeling to improve accuracy and resolution. Assessment against the draft Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) SV benchmark from the T2T-HG002-Q100 diploid assembly shows that sawfish has the highest accuracy among state-of-the-art long-read SV callers across every tested SV size group. Additionally, sawfish maintains the highest accuracy at every tested depth level from 10 to 32-fold coverage, such that other callers required at least 30-fold coverage to match sawfish accuracy at 15-fold coverage. Sawfish also shows the highest accuracy in the GIAB challenging medically relevant genes benchmark, demonstrating improvements in both comprehensive and medically relevant contexts. When joint-genotyping 10 samples from CEPH-1463, sawfish has over 9000 more pedigree-concordant calls than other state-of-the-art SV callers, with the highest proportion of concordant SVs (78%) as well. Sawfish's quality model can be used to select for an even higher proportion of concordant SVs (86%), while still calling over 5000 more pedigree-concordant SVs than other callers. These results demonstrate that sawfish improves on the state-of-the-art for long-read SV calling accuracy across both individual and joint-sample analyses.

Recent evidence suggests that pathological changes in skeletal muscle may contribute significantly to ongoing pain and fatigue, particularly post-exertional malaise. This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of PASC-related fatigue by examining skeletal muscle function and circulating factors in affected individuals.

We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study of patients with fatigue-associated PASC who had experienced mild to moderate COVID-19 without hospitalization. Skeletal muscle biopsies revealed reduced mitochondrial respiration and content in PASC participants compared to healthy controls. This lower respiratory capacity was accompanied by markedly elevated circulating levels of soluble IL-2 receptor alpha subunit (sIL2R), a T cell-specific receptor.

In vitro experiments demonstrated that sIL2R directly impairs mitochondrial oxygen consumption and reduces mitochondrial complex III subunit protein levels in cultured muscle cells. These findings suggest a mechanism linking systemic immune dysregulation to muscle-specific mitochondrial dysfunction in PASC.

This work provides new insights into the pathophysiology of PASC identifying sIL2R as a promising therapeutic target for addressing mitochondrial deficits in PASC-related fatigue and opening avenues for developing targeted interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1724450927217

Various in vitro (display) and in vivo (animal immunization and B cell-sequencing) workflows have led to the discovery of antibodies against diverse antigens. Despite this success, standard display and B-cell sequencing-based technologies are limited to targets that can be produced in a soluble form. This limitation inhibits the screening of function-inducing antibodies, which require the target to be expressed in cells to monitor function or signaling, and antibodies targeting proteins that maintain their physiological structure only when expressed on cell membranes, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). A high-throughput two-cell screening workflow, which localizes an antibody-secreting cell (ASC) and a cell expressing the target protein in a microenvironment, can overcome these challenges. To make function-first plasma cell-based antibody discovery accessible and scalable, we developed hydrogel Nanovials that can capture single plasma cells, target-expressing cells, and plasma cell secretions (antibodies). The detection and isolation of Nanovials harboring the antigen-specific plasma cells are then carried out using a flow cytometry cell sorter - an instrument that is available in most academic centers and biopharmaceutical companies. The antibody discovery workflow employing Nanovials was first validated in the context of two different cell membrane-associated antigens produced in recombinant form. We analyzed over 40,000 plasma cells over two campaigns and were able to identify a diversity of binders that i) exhibited high affinity (picomolar) binding, ii) targeted multiple non-overlapping epitopes and iii) demonstrated high developability scores. A campaign using the two-cell assay targeting the immune checkpoint membrane protein PD-1 yielded cell binders with similar EC50s to clinically used Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab. The highest selectivity for binders was observed for sorted events corresponding with the highest signal bound to target cells on Nanovials. Overall, Nanovials can provide a strong foundation for function-first antibody discovery, yielding direct cell binding information and quantitative data on prioritization of hits with flexibility for additional functional readouts in the future.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction is associated with lack of physical activity and considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs) aflicting our societies such as T2D, CVD, metabolic syndrome, and even AD.

To our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies on the metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular characteristics of ""healthy sedentary"" individuals living without clinical symptoms. Hence, the main aim of our study herein was to characterize multiple metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular bioenergetic signatures in ""healthy sedentary"" individuals which could already be downregulated compared to moderately active individuals.

Nineteen subjects, 9 sedentary (SED) and 10 moderately active (AC) volunteered for multiple assessments including muscle biopsies, in order to assess muscle metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics both at rest and during exercise.

For our exercise studies, we performed graded exercise testing (GXT) to assess carbohydrate and fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity according to our previously developed methodology.

Resting studies showed decreased mitochondrial respiration including decreases in complex I (-36%) and II (-28%) as well as total electron system capacity (-34%) and electron system capacity coupled to ATP production via ATP synthase (-30%). Regarding muscle carbohydrate metabolism, SED individuals showed a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation (-37%) as well as reduced expression (-49%) of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Regarding fatty acid metabolism, SED showed decreased activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1)(-51%) and CPT2 (-44%) as well as decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (-35%). Metabolomics analysis also confirmed downregulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) identified distinct metabolic phenotypes through intermediates of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Further, we found significant differences in cardiolipin (CL) species expression between SED and AC groups, which, due to the important role of CL in mitochondrial structure, function, biogenesis and bioenergetics, deserves further attention.

Exercise studies also showed significant differences in substrate utilization between groups where SED possessed a significantly lower fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity. The correlation of different bioenergetic parameters between resting and exercise conditions were robust, suggesting the possibility of performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as a non-invasive methodology to indirectly assess metabolic function in multiple populations. In summary, in our study herein, we show that ""healthy sedentary"" individuals already possess a significant decrease in cellular metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics compared to moderately active individuals both during resting and exercising conditions.

Since large numbers of sedentary individuals evolve to develop cardiometabolic disease, a better understanding of decreased cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial function is needed in order to improve both diagnosis and treatment of multiple metabolic diseases.

- Despite similar GLUT-4 concentrations, sedentary individuals show significant decreased pyruvate oxidation as well as expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC).
- During exercise studies, sedentary individuals show significantly decreased levels of fat oxidation and lactate clearance capacity which correlate with mitochondrial and bioenergetics parameters from resting muscle biopsies. Hence, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) accompanied by measuring blood lactate levels could be a practical manner to assess muscle mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in a non-invasive and ambulatory manner.
- Identifying early signatures of decreased mitochondrial function and bioenergetics capacity could be an important approach to prevent or improve different metabolic diseases through lifestyle changes mainly from exercise and nutrition.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

The fossil, known on the basis of two specimens, has been historically assigned to seamoths (Pegasidae), then to oarfish and relatives (Lampriformes). We describe its enigmatic skeletal anatomy in detail, and provide a new genus name. ""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Key to this are activation domains, which often fall within disordered regions of transcription factors and recruit co-activators to initiate transcription. These interactions are difficult to characterize via most experimental techniques because they are typically weak and transient. Consequently, we know very little about whether these interactions are promiscuous or specific, the mechanisms of binding, and how these interactions tune the strength of gene activation. To address these questions, we developed a microfluidic platform for expression and purification of hundreds of activation domains in parallel followed by direct measurement of co-activator binding affinities (STAMMPPING, for Simultaneous Trapping of Affinity Measurements via a Microfluidic Protein-Protein INteraction Generator). By applying STAMMPPING to quantify direct interactions between eight co-activators and 204 human activation domains (>1,500 Kds), we provide the first quantitative map of these interactions and reveal 334 novel binding pairs. We find that the metazoan-specific co-activator P300 directly binds >100 activation domains, potentially explaining its widespread recruitment across the genome to influence transcriptional activation. Despite sharing similar molecular properties (e.g. enrichment of negative and hydrophobic residues), activation domains utilize distinct biophysical properties to recruit certain co-activator domains. Co-activator domain affinity and occupancy are well-predicted by analytical models that account for multivalency, and in vitro affinities quantitatively predict activation in cells with an ultrasensitive response. Not only do our results demonstrate the ability to measure affinities between even weak protein-protein interactions in high throughput, but they also provide a necessary resource of over 1,500 activation domain/co-activator affinities which lays the foundation for understanding the molecular basis of transcriptional activation.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Nanopore sequencing operates on electrical signals generated by a nanopore embedded in a membrane separating two electrolyte-filled chambers. When single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) passes through the nanopore, it creates variations in the current that correspond to different DNA bases. By analyzing these current fluctuations with machine learning algorithms, the DNA sequence can be determined.

MethodsWe employed molecular assays, cell and egg culture, Sanger and next generation sequencing to isolate and characterize viruses from multiple farm specimens (cow nasal swab, milk specimens, fecal slurry, and a dead bird).

ResultsWe detected H5N1 HPAIV in 64% (9/14) of milk specimens, 2.6% (1/39) of cattle nasal swab specimens, and none of 17 cattle worker nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We cultured and characterized virus from eight H5N1-positive specimens. Sanger and next-generation sequencing revealed the viruses were closely related into other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. Our isolates had multiple mutations associated with increased spillover potential. Surprisingly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in a nasal swab from a sick cow. Additionally, 14.3% (2/14) of the farm workers who donated sera were recently symptomatic and had elevated neutralizing antibodies against a related H5N1 strain.

ConclusionsWhile our sampling was limited, these data offer additional insight into the large H5N1 HPAIV epizootic which thus far has impacted at least 96 cattle farms in twelve US states. Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few. We need to find ways to work with dairy farms in collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data that are necessary for the design of future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms.","NA","medrxiv",1724450927217

Previous explanations of this phenomenon have posited negative interactions between donor-population alleles and the recipient population's genome or environment, or higher genetic load in the donor population. Here, we show that stabilizing selection on quantitative traits--even around the same optimal trait values in the two populations and when the populations are demographically identical--generates selection against the minor-parent ancestry in a population formed via unequal admixture of the two populations. We calculate the rate at which minor-parent ancestry is purged under this mechanism, both in the early generations after admixture and in the long term, and we verify these calculations with whole-genome simulations. Because of its ubiquity, stabilizing selection offers a general mechanism for the deleterious effect of introgressed ancestry.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

We identified multiple novel epigenetic tumor suppressor and tumor dependency genes. We show that a specific HBO1 complex and the MLL1 complex are among the most impactful tumor suppressive epigenetic regulators in lung. The histone modifications generated by the HBO1 complex are frequently absent or reduced in human lung adenocarcinomas. The HBO1 and MLL1 complexes regulate chromatin accessibility of shared genomic regions, lineage fidelity and the expression of canonical tumor suppressor genes.

This slicing drives post-transcriptional gene-silencing pathways that are essential for many eukaryotes and the basis for new clinical therapies. Despite this importance, structural information on eukaryotic AGOs in a fully paired, slicing-competent conformation--hypothesized to be intrinsically unstable--has been lacking. Here we present the cryogenic-electron microscopy structure of a human AGO-guide complex bound to a fully paired target, revealing structural rearrangements that enable this conformation. Critically, the N domain of AGO rotates to allow the RNA full access to the central channel and forms contacts that license rapid slicing. Moreover, a conserved loop in the PIWI domain secures the RNA near the active site to enhance slicing rate and specificity. These results explain how AGO accommodates targets possessing the pairing specificity typically observed in biological and clinical slicing substrates.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

To fill this technological gap, we have developed the eXtra Large field-of-view Miniscope (MiniXL), a 3.5g lightweight miniaturized microscope with an FOV measuring 3.5 mm in diameter and an electrically adjustable working distance of 1.9 mm {+/-} 200 m. We demonstrated the capability of MiniXL recording the activity of large neuronal population in both subcortical area (hippocampal dorsal CA1) and deep brain regions (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC and nucleus accumbens, NAc). The large FOV allows simultaneous imaging of multiple brain regions such as bilateral mPFCs or mPFC and NAc during complex social behavior and tracking cells across multiple sessions. As with all microscopes in the UCLA Miniscope ecosystem, the MiniXL is fully open-source and will be shared with the neuroscience community to lower the barriers for adoption of this technology.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

However, the behavior and neural representation of ambivalent feelings, particularly during awe, remain elusive. To address this gap, we combined awe-inducing virtual reality clips, electroencephalogram, and a deep learning-based dimensionality reduction technique (N = 43). Behaviorally, awe ratings were precisely predicted by the duration and intensity of ambivalent feelings, not by single valence metrics. In the electrophysiological analysis, we identified participant- and clip-specific latent neural spaces sharing valence representation structures across individuals and stimuli. In these spaces, ambivalent feelings during awe were distinctly represented, and the variability in their distinctiveness specifically predicted awe ratings. Additionally, frontal delta oscillations mainly engaged in differentiating valence representations. Our findings demonstrate that awe is fundamentally an ambivalent experience reflected in both behavior and distinct patterns of electrophysiological activity. This work provides a new framework for understanding complex emotions and their neural underpinnings, with potential implications for affective neuroscience and mental health research.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

International collaboration among numerous research groups yielded a substantial amount of experimental data, which greatly facilitated model validation and led to the development of new mathematical models. The aim of the study is an improvement of system understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the development of a modular mathematical model which provides a foundation for further research on host-pathogen interactions. We utilized the open-source BioUML platform to develop a model using ordinary, delay and stochastic differential equations. The model was validated using experimental data from middle-aged individuals with moderate COVID-19 progression, including measurements of viral load, antibodies, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and interleukin-6 levels. Parameter optimization and sensitivity analysis were conducted to refine the models accuracy. The model effectively reproduces moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 progressions, consistent with experimental observations. We investigated the efficiency and contributions of innate and adaptive immunity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and assessed immune system behavior during co-infection with HIV and organ transplantation. Additionally, we studied therapy methods, such as interferon administration. The developed model can be employed as a framework for simulating other infectious diseases taking into account follow-up immune response.

Author summaryDespite the significant progress reached in understanding of COVID-19, traditional methods still struggle to analyze and interpret the extensive and sometimes controversial experimental data on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mathematical and systems biology approaches attempt to address this challenge by developing mathematical models of the immune response. We aimed not only to investigate the disease at a systemic level but also to provide a framework for further research on host-pathogen interactions, both existing and forthcoming. To achieve this, we constructed a model incorporating both innate and adaptive immunity, as well as cellular and humoral components. This together allowed us to conduct a series of in silico experiments, exploring the immune response across various levels and compartments. The results of these investigations offer valuable insights into the complex dynamics of the immune system and can guide future research and therapeutic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Indeed, a major challenge is that variants do not act in isolation but rather in the framework of highly complex biological networks, such as the human metabolic network, which can amplify or buffer the effect of specific risk alleles on disease susceptibility. In our previous work, we established that metabolic models can be leveraged to simulate the emerging metabolic effects of genetically driven variation in transcript levels and estimate personalized metabolic reaction fluxes. Here we use genetically predicted reaction fluxes to perform a systematic search for metabolic fluxes acting as buffers or amplifiers of coronary artery disease (CAD) risk alleles. Our analysis identifies 30 risk locus - reaction flux pairs with significant interaction on CAD susceptibility involving 18 individual reaction fluxes and 8 independent risk loci. Notably, many of these reactions are linked to processes with putative roles in the disease such as the metabolism of inflammatory mediators and fatty acids. In summary, this work establishes proof of concept that biochemical reaction fluxes can have non-additive effects with risk alleles and provides novel insights into the interplay between metabolism and genetic variation on disease susceptibility.","NA","medrxiv",1724450927217

To contribute to the inward Ca2+ flux that drives Ca2+-induced-Ca2+-release, CaV1.2 channels must be expressed on the sarcolemma; thus the regulatory mechanisms that tune CaV1.2 expression to meet contractile demand are an emerging area of research. A ubiquitously expressed protein called 14-3-3 has been proposed to affect Ca2+ channel trafficking in non-myocytes, however whether 14-3-3 has similar effects on CaV1.2 in cardiomyocytes is unknown. 14-3-3 preferentially binds phospho-serine/threonine residues to affect many cellular processes and is known to regulate cardiac ion channels including NaV1.5 and hERG. Altered 14-3-3 expression and function have been implicated in cardiac pathologies including hypertrophy. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that 14-3-3 interacts with CaV1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and regulates cardiac CaV1.2 trafficking and recycling. Confocal imaging, proximity ligation assays, super-resolution imaging, and co-immunoprecipitation revealed a population of 14-3-3 colocalized and closely associated with CaV1.2. The degree of 14-3-3/CaV1.2 colocalization increased upon stimulation of {beta}-adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol. Notably, only the 14-3-3-associated CaV1.2 population displayed increased cluster size with isoproterenol, revealing a role for 14-3-3 as a nucleation factor that directs CaV1.2 super-clustering. 14-3-3 overexpression increased basal CaV1.2 cluster size and Ca2+ currents in ventricular myocytes, with maintained channel responsivity to isoproterenol. In contrast, isoproterenol-stimulated augmentation of sarcolemmal CaV1.2 expression and currents in ventricular myocytes were abrogated by 14-3-3 inhibition. These data support a model where 14-3-3 interacts with CaV1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner to promote enhanced trafficking/recycling, clustering, and activity during {beta}-adrenergic stimulation.

Significance StatementThe L-type Ca2+ channel, CaV1.2, plays an essential role in excitation-contraction coupling in the heart and in part regulates the overall strength of contraction during basal and fight- or-flight {beta}-adrenergic signaling conditions. Proteins that modulate the trafficking and/or activity of CaV1.2 are interesting both from a physiological and pathological perspective, since alterations in CaV1.2 can impact action potential duration and cause arrythmias. A small protein called 14-3-3 regulates other ion channels in the heart and other Ca2+ channels, but how it may interact with CaV1.2 in the heart has never been studied. Examining factors that affect CaV1.2 at rest and during {beta}-adrenergic stimulation is crucial for our ability to understand and treat disease and aging conditions where these pathways are altered.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Yet it is unknown whether ongoing deliberation can be expressed during movement, following movement onset and prior to any decision. Here we tested the idea that an ongoing deliberation continually influences motor processes--prior to a decision--directing online movements. Over three experiments, we manipulated evidence to influence deliberation during movement. The deliberation process was manipulated by having participants observe evidence in the form of tokens that moved into a left or right target. Supporting our hypothesis we found that lateral hand movements reflected deliberation, prior to a decision. We also found that a deliberation urgency signal, which more heavily weighs later evidence, was fundamental to predicting decisions and explains past movement behaviour in a new light. Our paradigm promotes the expression of ongoing deliberation through movement, providing a powerful new window into understanding the interplay between decision and action.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Quantitative trait phenotyping is essential to understand better the genetic factors underpinning maize root growth and development. Root systems are challenging to phenotype given their below-ground, soil-bound nature. In addition, manual trait annotations of root images are tedious and can lead to inaccuracies and inconsistencies between individuals, resulting in data discrepancies. To address these issues, we have developed an automated phenotyping pipeline for field-grown maize crown roots by leveraging open-source software. Phenotypic variation of 20 maize genotypes from the Wisconsin Diversity panel was significant for numerous root traits, suggesting a genetic basis for the observed developmental deviations. In addition, juvenile root traits from controlled environment conditions exhibited inconsistent correlation with field-grown adult root traits, underscoring the developmental plasticity prevalent during maize root morphogenesis. Transcripts involved in hormone signaling and stress responses were among differentially expressed genes in roots from 20 maize genotypes, suggesting many molecular processes may underlie the observed phenotypic variance. This study furthers our understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships, which is relevant for informing agricultural strategies to improve maize root physiology.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

The dynamics of traits and trait architectures under stabilizing selection have been extensively studied for single populations at steady state. However, natural populations are seldom at steady state and are often structured in some way. Admixture and introgression events may be common, including over human evolutionary history. Because stabilizing selection results in selection against the minor allele at a trait-affecting locus, alleles from the minor parental ancestry will be selected against after admixture. We show that the site-frequency spectrum can be used to model the genetic architecture of such traits, allowing for the study of trait architecture dynamics in complex multi-population settings. We use a simple deterministic two-locus model to predict the reduction of introgressed ancestry around trait-contributing loci. From this and individual-based simulations, we show that introgressed-ancestry deserts are enriched around such loci. When introgression between two diverged populations occurs in both directions, as has been inferred between humans and Neanderthals, the locations of introgressed-ancestry deserts will tend to be shared across populations. We argue that stabilizing selection for shared phenotypic optima may explain recent observations in which regions of depleted human-introgressed ancestry in the Neanderthal genome overlap with Neanderthal-ancestry deserts in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Indeed, systematic analysis showed other DNA motifs to be enriched in auxin-regulated promoters. Neither the basis for this enrichment nor the mechanisms for the activity of composite AuxREs is known. Here, we systematically mined Arabidopsis promoters for composite AuxRE elements enriched in auxin-responsive genes. We identified many and show that their presence is a reliable predictor of auxin response. Through mutating these elements and their higher-order modules, we demonstrate function in promoter activity. Lastly, we identified transcription factors (TFs) that bind AuxRE-associated motifs, showed their involvement in auxin response, and discovered that several of these TFs directly bind ARF proteins.

While important, the development of the hippocampus in the formative period of childhood and adolescence has not been extensively investigated, with most contemporary research focusing on macrostructural measures of volume. Thus, there has been little research on the development of the micron-scale structures (i.e., microstructure) of the hippocampus, which engender its cognitive functions. The current study examined age-related changes of hippocampal microstructure using diffusion MRI data acquired with an ultra-strong gradient (300 mT/m) MRI scanner in a sample of children and adolescents (N=88; 8-19 years). Surface-based hippocampal modelling was combined with established microstructural approaches, such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation Dispersion Density Imaging (NODDI), and a more advanced gray matter diffusion model Soma And Neurite Density Imaging (SANDI). No significant changes in macrostructural measures (volume, gyrification, and thickness) were found between 8-19 years, while significant changes in microstructure measures related to neurites (from NODDI and SANDI), soma (from SANDI), and mean diffusivity (from DTI) were found. In particular, there was a significant increase across age in neurite MR signal fraction and a significant decrease in extracellular MR signal fraction and mean diffusivity across the hippocampal subfields and long-axis. A significant negative correlation between age and MR apparent soma radius was found in the subiculum and CA1 throughout the anterior and body of the hippocampus. Further surface-based analyses uncovered variability in age-related microstructural changes between the subfields and long-axis, which may reflect ostensible developmental differences along these two axes. Finally, correlation of hippocampal surfaces representing age-related changes of microstructure with maps derived from histology allowed for postulation of the potential underlying microstructure that diffusion changes across age may be capturing. Overall, distinct neurite and soma developmental profiles in the human hippocampus during late childhood and adolescence are reported for the first time.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Here we reveal in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana that two distinct oscillatory systems for the phytohormone auxin coordinate the spatial and temporal identity of PBS, jointly defining the lateral root density. We followed auxin signalling dynamics for days and thereby detected a systemic auxin signal oscillating in the mature primary root, which is distinct from the previously described root clock at the root tip. While the root clock spatially primes the PBS in the growing root tip, the systemic oscillatory auxin signal temporally controls the auxin-dependent identity of these PBS. Light perception in the shoot defines the strength of the systemic auxin signal and thereby controls the auxin-reliant ability of PBSs to develop into lateral roots. Moreover, PHYB and CRY1 mediate the light-dependent integration of other environmental signals, such as ambient temperature, into the control systemic auxin signalling and lateral root density. Our work reveals how two spatially distinct oscillatory auxin signals define the plasticity of plant root development in response to fluctuating conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Circulating hematopoietic cells influence risk for CAD, but the role of a key regulating organ, spleen, is unknown. The understudied spleen is a 3-dimensional structure of the hematopoietic system optimally suited for unbiased radiologic investigations toward novel mechanistic insights.

MethodsDeep learning-based image segmentation and radiomics techniques were utilized to extract splenic radiomic features from abdominal MRIs of 42,059 UK Biobank participants. Regression analysis was used to identify splenic radiomics features associated with CAD. Genome-wide association analyses were applied to identify loci associated with these radiomics features. Overlap between loci associated with CAD and the splenic radiomics features was explored to understand the underlying genetic mechanisms of the role of the spleen in CAD.

ResultsWe extracted 107 splenic radiomics features from abdominal MRIs, and of these, 10 features were associated with CAD. Genome-wide association analysis of CAD-associated features identified 219 loci, including 35 previously reported CAD loci, 7 of which were not associated with conventional CAD risk factors. Notably, variants at 9p2 were associated with splenic features such as run length non-uniformity.

ConclusionsOur study, combining deep learning with genomics, presents a new framework to uncover the splenic axis of CAD. Notably, our study provides evidence for the underlying genetic connection between the spleen as a candidate causal tissue-type and CAD with insight into the mechanisms of 9p21, whose mechanism is still elusive despite its initial discovery in 2007. More broadly, our study provides a unique application of deep learning radiomics to non-invasively find associations between imaging, genetics, and clinical outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1724450927217

In this study, we identified Replication Protein A (RPA) as a novel telomerase processivity factor, functioning alongside the telomerase recruitment factor TPP1-POT1. AlphaFold2 predictions revealed that RPA and TPP1 interact with telomerase at distinct binding sites. Using separation- of-function mutants, we discovered that RPA-mediated telomerase stimulation is indispensable for telomere elongation, while TPP1-POT1 primarily functions in recruiting telomerase to telomeres. Furthermore, we demonstrated that short telomere disease-associated telomerase mutations compromise RPAs ability to stimulate telomerase, establishing a link between impaired RPA-dependent processivity and telomeropathies. Our findings redefine human telomerase regulation by establishing RPA as a critical regulator and provide new insights into the molecular basis of telomere-related diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Large-scale studies have been able to detect genetic variants with contributions to height in the range of approximately 1.2 millimetre per allele copy on average. Non-additive genetic interactions may, in part, account for the difference between broad-sense and narrow-sense heritability estimates. However, prior studies have failed to identify variants with non-additive effects, possibly due to the lack of statistical power. Leveraging 3.6M individuals of European genetic ancestry in the 23andMe research cohort, we performed a genome-wide analysis study (GWAS) to select 1,063 independent common SNPs associated with height (p-value < 5e-8), and then screened for evidence of non-additive effects by analysing 564,453 models including a pairwise SNP-SNP interaction term. We identified 69 pairwise models with suggestive evidence of SNP-SNP interaction (p-value < 1e-4) and, for each SNP pair, we evaluated a fully saturated model including additive, dominant, and epistatic (additive-by-additive, additive-by-dominance and dominance-by-dominance) terms. We tested for the presence of epistatic interactions by comparing models with and without epistatic terms using a likelihood ratio test. Assuming a strict Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 8.9e-8 (0.05/564,453), we found no evidence of epistatic interactions (Likelihood ratio test (LRT) p-value < 9e-07 for all models). Our analysis rules out the existence of epistatic interactions between alleles of >1% frequency with effect sizes larger than 2.42mm. Our large-scale analysis provides further evidence of the minimal contribution of non-additivity in the genetic architecture of adult human height.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

We segmented brain images into 4 global tissue types and 98 local structures, and systematically evaluated between-scanner reliability of 64 mT morphometry and correspondence to 3 T measurements, using correlations of tissue volume and Dice spatial overlap of segmentations. We report high 64 mT reliability and correspondence to 3 T across 64 mT scan contrasts and resolutions, with highest performance shown by combining three T2w scans with low through-plane resolution into a single higher-resolution scan using multi-resolution registration.

We conducted city-wide metagenomic surveillance of food-centre microbiomes in Singapore (16 centres, n=240 samples) to provide a detailed map of microbial (bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses) as well as non-microbial DNA abundances across two timepoints. Food-centre microbiomes were found to be enriched in food-related DNA signatures compared to other environments such as hospitals and offices, with specific food-microbe associations (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae and fish) and food DNA providing a partial explanation for the microbial profiles observed (44% of variation explained). Machine learning analysis identified a small set of microbial species (n=22) that serve as highly accurate (>80%) location-specific signatures for various food centres, some of which persist even after 3 years. Profiling of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens identified a surprising enrichment of ARGs in food centres relative to other non-healthcare environments (>2.5{xi}), and an order of magnitude enrichment of key pathogenic species (e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp) even compared to hospital environments.

We hypothesised that the isoforms functionally alter microglia by shaping their transcriptomic and chromatin landscapes. We used RNA- and ATAC-sequencing to profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility of human microglia isolated from a xenotransplantation model of AD. We identified widespread transcriptomic and epigenomic differences which are dependent on APOE genotype, and are corroborated across the profiling assays.

All scans sought matches to the same set of 813,194 40-mer nucleotide queries randomly selected from the genome of Sus scrofa (domestic pig). For each of the two study organisms, mean segmental match rates (MSMRs) were then calculated for all segments in each of three categories: those segments occurring on autosomes, those on the X chromosome, and those on the Y chromosome.

ResultsIn scans of single-copy regions (euchromatin) in both their Y chromosomes and their autosomes, it was found that the number of matches to randomly selected porcine queries was higher in humans than in bonobos. When autosomes were compared, matches were 1.3% higher in humans than in bonobos. This figure is equal to the percentage of human autosomal nucleotide positions bearing nucleotides that match in pig but not in bonobo. Remarkably, it agrees with the percentage of autosomal nucleotides previously reported to differ in bonobos and humans. So, the results of this study indicate that essentially all the nucleotide positions that differ in humans and bonobos, are the same in humans and pigs. In addition, the number of matches to pig queries found on the human Y chromosome was 34.5% higher than on the bonobo Y, and 12.4% higher than on the chimpanzee Y (the chimpanzee figure may be the more reliable of the two, since the bonobo Y nucleotide sequence file scanned contained only unlocalized scaffolds).

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Yet little is known about factors contributing to long-term lack of intimate relationships. We investigated phenotypic and genetic correlates of never having had sex in [~]400,000 UK residents aged 39 to 73 and [~]13,500 Australian residents aged 18 to 89. The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g. upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% and 14% of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56. Polygenic scores predicted a range of related outcomes in the Australian dataset. Our findings uncover multifaceted correlates of human intimacy of evolutionary significance.","NA","medrxiv",1724450927217

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1724450927217

In aged mice, partial reprogramming, characterized by pulsed expression of reprogramming factors, has shown promise in improving function in various tissues, but its impact on the aging brain remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the impact of in vivo partial reprogramming on mature neurons in the dentate gyrus of young and aged mice. Using two different approaches - a neuron-specific transgenic reprogrammable mouse model and neuron-specific targeted lentiviral delivery of OSKM reprogramming factors - we demonstrated that in vivo partial reprogramming of mature neurons in the dentate gyrus, a neurogenic niche in the adult mouse brain, can influence animal behavior, and ameliorate age-related decline in memory and learning. These findings underscore the potential of in vivo partial reprogramming as an important therapeutic intervention to rejuvenate the neurogenic niche and ameliorate cognitive decline associated with aging or neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

As the zebrafish embryo grows into a larva, to improve its heart function, the embryonic myocardial wall transforms into an intricate 3D architecture, composed of an outer compact layer enveloping an inner layer of multicellular trabecular ridges. How these tissue layers acquire their characteristic form suited for their function remains an open question. Here, we find that multiscale mechanochemical coupling and an emergent tissue-scale morphological transition steer functional maturation of the developing zebrafish heart. Single-celled trabecular seeds recruit outer compact layer cells to mature into clonally heterogenous multicellular ridges, thereby amplifying cardiac contractile forces. In response, remaining compact layer cells are stretched, which impedes their further recruitment, thereby constraining trabecular ridge density. Concomitantly, Notch-dependent actomyosin dampening triggers a sharp transition in myocardial tissue area, activating rapid organ growth that expands blood filling capacity. Thus, multiscale self-organizing interactions optimize heart size and contractile efficiency to support embryonic life.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

In this study, we computationally model 1,804 protein complexes consisting of various H5 isolates from 1959 to 2024 against 11 HA1-neutralizing antibodies. This study shows a trend of weakening of the binding affinity of existing antibodies against H5 isolates over time, indicating that the H5N1 virus is evolving immune escape of our medical defenses. We also found that based on the wide variety of host species and geographic locations in which H5N1 was observed to have been transmitted from birds to mammals, there is not a single central reservoir host species or location associated with H5N1s spread. These results indicate that the virus is well on its way to moving from epidemic to pandemic status in the near future. This study illustrates the value of high-performance computing to rapidly model protein-protein interactions and viral genomic sequence data at-scale for functional insights into medical preparedness.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1724450927217

To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Warm White Light-Emitting Diode (LED), Cool White LED, Blue LED, and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic Puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation, and husbandry programs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic Puffin strandings remains to be the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine if aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1724450927217
