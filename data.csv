Estimates of long COVID risk after a first COVID-19 infection vary, and data on risk following reinfections remain lacking.

ObjectiveTo estimate and compare long COVID risk and severity with first COVID-19 infection versus reinfections among healthcare workers (HCWs).

DesignRetrospective cohort study based on an electronic survey among Quebec HCWs conducted between May 16 and June 15, 2023. A short telephone survey among randomly selected non-respondents further assessed potential response bias.

SettingPopulation-based study in Quebec, Canada.

Participants397 222 HCWs were invited to participate in the electronic survey and 10 500 in the telephone survey.

Main outcomes and measuresWe defined long COVID cases as HCWs self-reporting COVID-19-attributed symptoms lasting [&ge;]12 weeks, classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on perceived symptom intensity. We compared self-reported symptoms and functional limitations of cases to COVID controls (infected participants without long COVID) and non-COVID controls (uninfected participants). Risk and prevalence were estimated by number of infections, likely infecting variant and perceived acute COVID-19 severity. We conducted symptom clustering analyses using unsupervised learning techniques.

ResultsEstimated long COVID risk following any COVID-19 infection was similar among 22 496 online survey participants (17.0% [95%CI, 16.3%-17.6%] and 3 978 telephone survey participants (15.9% [14.6%-17.2%]. The cumulative risk increased with the number of infections, but reinfections were associated with three times lower risk of long COVID than first infections.

Pre-Omicron infections and severe acute COVID-19 episodes correlated with higher long COVID risk and severity. Among prevalent long COVID cases, 43% were moderate and 33% severe. Compared to controls, dyspnea, neurocognitive symptoms, post-exertional malaise and smell/taste disturbances were most strongly associated with long COVID. Cluster analysis identified seven symptom groups with systemic, neurocognitive, pulmonary, and mood-related clusters being the most prevalent. Severe long COVID cases exhibited multiple symptom clusters and greater functional limitations.

ConclusionsLong COVID is a common and disabling condition among HCWs. Societal and healthcare burden remains important and will continue to accrue given ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and long COVID risk with reinfections.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes the risk and severity of long COVID differ for first COVID-19 infections versus reinfections among healthcare workers in Quebec, Canada?

FindingsThe risk of long COVID was [~]15% with first COVID-19 infection, but three-fold lower with reinfections. Risk was higher with COVID-19 infections due to ancestral strains and with more severe acute episodes. Long COVID risk and severity compromised self-rated health, physical capacity and cognitive function.

MeaningLong COVID is a common and disabling condition among workers. Societal and healthcare burden remains important and will continue to accrue given ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and long COVID risk with reinfections.","NA","medrxiv",1747346953003

In 2023, external funding accounted for 21% of total TB expenditures, with the U.S. contributing over 55% of these funds. The withdrawal of U.S. support threatens essential TB services, including diagnostics, treatment, TB-HIV co-infection interventions, and research initiatives critical to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for TB eradication.

MethodsThis study analyses the dependency of 26 high-burden TB countries (HBCs) on U.S. funding and models the potential impact of funding cuts on TB incidence and mortality. Countries were classified into low (0-22%), moderate (23-37%), and high (>37%) dependency groups based on three-year expenditure data. A deterministic compartmental model simulated service disruptions under three recovery scenarios: (1) minimal impact (services recover within three months), (2) moderate impact (recovery within one year), and (3) worst-case scenario (permanent service reduction). Extrapolations were made for all 26 HBCs based on representative countries from each dependency category.

FindingsFunding cuts are projected to result in substantial increases in TB cases and deaths across the three scenarios. In a high-dependency country, cumulative TB cases could rise by 2.1% (CI 1.5 - 2.5), 5.4% (CI4 - 6.5), or 36% (CI 25 - 47), and TB deaths by 2.9%(CI 2.2 - 3.5), 7.8%(CI 5.9 - 9.2), 68%(CI 45 - 86), depending on the severity of service disruptions. Across all 26 HBCs, additional TB cases are estimated at 0.63 million (CI 0.45 - 0.81) (minimal impact), 1.66 million (CI 1.2 - 2.1) (moderate impact), and 10.67 million (CI 7.85 - 13.19) (worst-case). Corresponding TB deaths are projected to increase by 99,800 (CI 65,200-130,000), 268,600 (CI 185,800-337,900), and 2,243,700 (CI 1,570,800-2,807,300), respectively. The findings underscore the catastrophic consequences of the funding cut, particularly in countries highly reliant on U.S. support.

InterpretationThe loss of U.S. funding endangers global TB control, jeopardizing End TB and SDG targets. While some nations may adapt, short-term disruptions will severely impact vulnerable populations. Urgent alternative funding is needed to sustain TB prevention and treatment efforts and mitigate the effects of aid withdrawal.

However, little is known about fellowship structure, curricula, and outcomes. This lack of transparency creates challenges for residents choosing programs, institutions developing new fellowships, and existing programs evaluating their outcomes.

MethodAuthors identified 28 United States-based surgical education fellowships and distributed a survey to representatives (directors or fellows) from each program evaluating program structure, educational opportunities, research infrastructure, teaching experiences, and mentorship. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics.

ResultsNineteen fellowship programs (68% response rate) participated. The majority of programs offered full funding (84%). Program length varied from 1 to 2 years, most commonly with one fellow per year. Few (16%) required completion of an advanced degree during the fellowship. The majority mandated teaching (84%) and simulation (89%) responsibilities, though time commitments varied. Most programs (84%) required fellows to attend national conferences. Over half (53%) had an Education PhD advisor within the department, and 63% provided free access to statisticians. Leadership structures varied, with 74% having a single fellowship director. Among directors, 80% were surgical specialists, while all non-surgical directors held Education PhDs. Dedicated faculty time equivalents for directors varied widely.

ConclusionsOur findings highlight significant heterogeneity across U.S. surgical education fellowships. Transparency about fellowship structures could improve prospective fellow decision-making and guide future program development. Further research should focus on the long-term outcomes of fellowship graduates and the impact of accreditation on fellowship success.","NA","medrxiv",1747346953003

This phenomenon, termed fungal morphogenesis, is critical for fungi to survive and colonize diverse ecological niches and establish infections in a variety of hosts. Despite significant advancements in the field with respect to understanding the gene regulatory networks that control these transitions, the metabolic determinants of fungal morphogenesis remain poorly characterized. In this study, we uncover a previously uncharacterized, conserved dependency between central carbon metabolism and de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids that is critical for fungal morphogenesis, in two key fungal species. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrate that glycolytic flux is crucial to drive fungal morphogenesis and perturbation of this pathway leads to a significant downregulation in the expression of genes involved in de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids. Remarkably, exogenous supplementation of sulfur-containing amino acids (cysteine/methionine) or inorganic sulfate, robustly rescues the morphogenesis defect induced by the perturbation of glycolysis in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, underscoring the pivotal role of de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acid as a downstream effector of morphogenesis. Furthermore, a C. albicans mutant lacking the glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase (Pfk1) exhibited significantly reduced survival within murine macrophages and attenuated virulence in a murine model of systemic candidiasis. Overall, our research elucidates a previously uncharacterized coupling between glycolysis and sulfur metabolism that is critical for driving fungal morphogenesis, contributing to our understanding of this conserved phenomenon.","NA","biorxiv",1747346953003

Acinetobacter sp. Tol 5 is notable for its strong adhesiveness and potential as a biocatalyst for toluene degradation; however, its toluene metabolic pathway has not been fully elucidated. In this study, genomic analysis identified a cluster of genes in Tol 5 highly similar to the well-known tod operon of Pseudomonas putida, encoding enzymes responsible for toluene metabolism. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that these tod genes, unusual among Acinetobacter species, were likely acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that todF and todC1 are co-transcribed, while the adjacent fadL2 gene, encoding a putative outer membrane transporter corresponding to P. putida todX, is independently transcribed. Functional characterization using gene-knockout mutants revealed that TodC1, the large subunit of dioxygenase, is essential for growth on toluene, whereas FadL2 is not essential. Growth experiments further showed that the todC1 knockout mutant could metabolize benzoate, but not toluene or benzene, confirming that the TOD pathway is the primary route for toluene and benzene degradation in Tol 5. The identification of the functional TOD pathway, which is unique within Acinetobacter, provides genetic and biochemical insights for the development of Tol 5 as an efficient immobilized biocatalyst for the bioremediation and bioconversion of aromatic compounds.","NA","biorxiv",1747346953003

To understand the extent to which biophysics modulates model performance compared to genomic conservation, we model biophysics of IDRs explicitly for improved interpretation of variant effects. We develop MDmis, a method that uses biophysical features extracted from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of IDRs to predict pathogenicity. We find that pathogenic variants in Long IDRs manifest differently, with transient order and depleted solvent access, compared to those in Short IDRs. Using MD simulations of sequences with single missense variants, we identify stronger evidence for pathogenic effects in Long IDRs compared to Short IDRs. MDmis, when combined with conservation information, achieves strong predictive accuracy of pathogenicity of variants in Long IDRs. Overall, extracting information from MD simulations can help understand the drivers of predictive performance and elucidate biophysical behaviors affected by pathogenic variants.","NA","biorxiv",1747346953003

We propose Joint Pleiotropic and Epigenomic Partitioning (J-PEP), a clustering framework that integrates pleiotropic SNP effects on auxiliary traits and tissue-specific epigenomic data to partition disease-associated loci into biologically distinct clusters. To benchmark J-PEP against existing methods, we introduce a metric--Pleiotropic and Epigenomic Prediction Accuracy (PEPA)--that evaluates how well the clusters predict SNP-to-trait and SNP-to-tissue associations using off-chromosome data, avoiding overfitting. Applying J-PEP to GWAS summary statistics for 165 diseases/traits (average N=290K), we attained 16-30% higher PEPA than pleiotropic or epigenomic partitioning approaches with larger improvements for well-powered traits, consistent with simulations; these gains arise from J-PEPs tendency to upweight correlated structure--signals present in both auxiliary trait and tissue data--thereby emphasizing shared components. For type 2 diabetes (T2D), J-PEP identified clusters refining canonical pathological processes while revealing underexplored immune and developmental signals. For hypertension (HTN), J-PEP identified stromal and adrenal-endocrine processes that were not identified in prior analyses. For neutrophil count, J-PEP identified hematopoietic, hepatic-inflammatory, and neuroimmune processes, expanding biological interpretation beyond classical immune regulation. Notably, integrating single-cell chromatin accessibility data refined bulk-based clusters, enhancing cell-type resolution and specificity. For T2D, single-cell data refined a bulk endocrine cluster to pancreatic islet {beta}-cells, consistent with established {beta}-cell dysfunction in insulin deficiency; for HTN, single-cell data refined a bulk endocrine cluster to adrenal cortex cells, consistent with a GO enrichment for neutrophil-mediated inflammation that implicates feedback between aldosterone production in the adrenal gland and local immune signaling. In conclusion, J-PEP provides a principled framework for partitioning GWAS loci into interpretable, tissue-informed clusters that provide biological insights on complex disease.","NA","medrxiv",1747346953003

Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1747346953003

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]). Negative control outcomes did not show any indication of meaningful unobserved residual confounding.

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. They underscore the need to evaluate vaccines using clinical endpoints that extend beyond their targeted diseases.

Standard wastewater surveillance workflows typically involve wastewater concentration, nucleic acid extraction, and pathogen quantification. While various concentration methods are used, most comparisons of concentration methods have focused primarily on SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the need for further research to guide method selection for monitoring a suite of diverse pathogens. In this study, a head-to-head comparison of six different concentration methods was performed, including direct extraction (with and without bead beating), electronegative (HA) filtration, solids concentration, and magnetic bead-based concentration (using Nanotrap(R) particles; with and without bead beating). Methods were assessed for sensitivity, inhibitor removal, and recovery rates of fourteen microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria, and fungal pathogens. The cost of each method was also estimated. Results showed that the concentration method selection significantly impacts the sensitivity and economic costs of the wastewater monitoring workflow. Based on the results, a concentration approach that combines HA filtration and solids concentration is recommended to optimize detection across various pathogens. This study provides data-driven insights to enhance the reliability and cost-effectiveness of wastewater surveillance systems that can support public health responses for a broad range of diseases.

However, isolating individual-level vocalizations in complex settings is challenging due to background noise and frequent overlaps of coincident signals from multiple vocalizers. A promising solution lies in multimodal recordings that combine traditional microphones with animal-borne sensors, such as accelerometers and directional microphones. These sensors, however, are constrained by strict limits on weight, size, and power consumption and often lead to noisy or unstable signals. In this work, we introduce a neural network-based system for sound source separation which leverages multi-channel microphone recordings and body-mounted accelerometer signals. Using a multimodal dataset of zebra finches recorded in a social setting, we demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional microphone array-based systems. By enabling the separation of overlapping vocalizations, our approach offers a valuable tool for studying animal communication in complex naturalistic environments.","NA","biorxiv",1747346953003

A major problem is that the slow waning of antibody titers requires the collection of data for decades post-infection or vaccination. Our analysis of the largest existing dataset shows that a power-law model describes antibody waning better than other frequently used models. Our analysis suggests: (i) Protective levels of antibodies to many vaccine/virus antigens may be maintained for longer than previously estimated. (ii) The rate of waning of antibodies to protein toxoid vaccines such as tetanus may be similar to those elicited by live virus infections. (iii) The long-term waning of antibodies can be estimated from data for a much shorter time-frame of about 1-3 years following immunization, suggesting that using a power-law analysis could allow rapid estimation for the waning of immunity to new vaccines.","NA","medrxiv",1747346953003

The original DeepDrug framework by Li et al. (2025) relied on somatic mutation data and emphasized long genes to guide AD drug repurposing. However, emerging evidence suggests that germline genetic variants play a more central role in AD pathogenesis. In response, we develop DeepDrug2, an enhanced AI-driven framework for AD drug repurposing centered on germline mutations and validated using real-world electronic health records (EHRs). DeepDrug2 introduces four major innovations. First, it proposes a different hypothesis prioritizing germline over somatic mutations in influencing AD risk. Second, it updates the signed directed heterogeneous biomedical graph by removing somatic mutations, long genes, and expert-led genes from the previous version, and incorporating new genes identified in recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. Third, it generates a new list of drug candidates by encoding this updated graph into a new embedding space via a graph neural network (GNN) and calculating drug-gene scores. Fourth, it performs real-world clinical validation using EHR data from over 500,000 individuals (including more than 4,000 AD cases) in the UK Biobank, evaluating associations between drug usage and AD onset while controlling for demographic and comorbidity factors. DeepDrug2 has identified several promising drug candidates. Among the top 15 candidates with sufficient medication records to support statistically powered analysis, Amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker), Indapamide (a thiazide-like diuretic), and Atorvastatin (a statin) were significantly associated with reduced AD risk (p < 0.05). These findings highlight the role of germline mutations in guiding AD drug repurposing and emphasize the value of integrating real-world clinical data into AI-driven drug discovery. To further validate these candidates, future work will involve experimental studies using mouse and zebrafish models of AD. DeepDrug2 offers a promising strategy to support future clinical studies and expand therapeutic options for AD.","NA","medrxiv",1747346953003

By applying model to cross-sectional and longitudinal data from ADNI cohort, we estimated predicted age differences (PADs) and their change rates at individual level. Distinct network-specific brain ageing trajectories with disease progression were identified. Progressive MCI individuals showed early PAD deviations in the default mode network and accelerated changes in attention networks. Network-wise PAD dynamics mediated the effect of AD genetic risk and pathology on cognitive decline. Finally, integrating PAD features can improve predictive accuracy of MCI-to-AD conversion (AUC = 0.95). These findings highlight network-specific brain age PAD as sensitive biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of individualized AD risk.","NA","medrxiv",1747346953003

However, many patients exhibit features of an underlying predisposition but lack CPG PV. This observation suggests the presence of unidentified cancer predisposing variants and/or genes. To address this gap, we interrogated genes implicated in DNA damage repair (DDR) as a source of novel cancer predisposing signals that could account for this missing heritability. Methods: We examined germline data from 5,993 childhood cancer cases and 14,477 adult non-cancer controls for damaging variants among 189 DDR genes. Damaging variants were defined as rare (allele frequency <0.05% in the gnomAD v2.1 non-cancer subset), nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice site, and missense with REVEL scores >0.7. Enrichment of damaging variants was determined using logistic and firth regression models. Putative novel CPG were replicated using data from 1,494 additional childhood cancer cases in three independent cohorts. Findings: Pan-cancer analyses revealed enrichment of germline TP53 variants (false discovery rate [FDR]logistic=0.0066, FDRFirth=0.0064). Cancer-specific analyses demonstrated significant associations for TP53 in adrenocortical carcinoma (37%, FDRlogistic<0.0001, FDRFirth=0) and high-grade glioma (2.4%, FDRlogistic=0.0022, FDRFirth=0.1082), as well as BARD1 in neuroblastoma (1.2%, FDRlogistic=0.0341, FDRFirth=0.2682). Three novel gene-tumor associations were identified, including POLL in Ewing sarcoma (1.7%, FDRlogistic=0.0319, FDRFirth=0.3101), SMC5 in medulloblastoma (1.6%, FDRlogistic=0.0005, FDRFirth=0.0499) and SMARCAL1 in osteosarcoma (2.6%, FDRlogistic=0.0250, FDRFirth=0.2180). Among these new putative CPG, enrichment of SMARCAL1 PV in osteosarcoma was replicated across all three additional pediatric cancer cohorts (2.5%, PFisher <0.0001). All osteosarcoma tumors (n=3) with whole genome sequencing data available exhibited deletion of the wild-type SMARCAL1 allele. Interpretation: We report a catalogue of germline SMARCAL1 variants in pediatric osteosarcoma and demonstrate potential molecular effects in tumor formation through the presence of second somatic SMARCAL1 hits. The contribution of germline POLL and SMC5 variants in Ewing sarcoma and medulloblastoma, respectively, warrants further investigation. Our study highlights the power of unbiased genomic investigations to uncover novel CPG, providing insights into tumor biology and creating opportunities for therapeutic intervention, surveillance, and prevention.

However, the association of neighborhood deprivation with disease progression in behavioral-variant frontotemporal degeneration (bvFTD) is unknown.

METHODSWe examined associations between tertiles of neighborhood deprivation, using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), and survival in 311 individuals clinically diagnosed with bvFTD from the Penn Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD) Center. In a subset of participants with complete baseline data across measures of global cognition, executive function, and language (n=163), we examined the association of ADI with longitudinal change.

RESULTSHigher neighborhood deprivation was associated with shorter survival after symptom onset and faster decline in global cognition, executive and language functions, independent of genetic risk.

DISCUSSIONLiving in more deprived neighborhoods (i.e. above the 50th percentile nationally) was associated with an accelerated disease course in bvFTD, highlighting an important socioeconomic disparity in disease prognosis.

Yet, these neural signatures are dissociable at the single-cell level: Specific cells within these visuo-oculomotor areas are exclusively involved in either motor preparation or covert attention. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that many cells in visuo-oculomotor areas are involved in both motor preparation and covert attention, and consequently their neural signatures should functionally overlap to a large degree. Here, we put this proposal to the test: we combined EEG with sensitive decoding techniques to investigate whether the neural signatures of preparatory overt and covert attention are dissociable across large-scale neuronal populations. We found that neural decoding reliably discerned whether overt or covert attention was shifted well before saccade initiation. Further, inverted encoding modeling revealed sharper spatially tuned activity in preparatory overt than in covert attention. We then asked whether preparatory overt attention achieved sharper spatially-tuned activity by using  more-of-the-same covert attention, or by recruiting additional spatially selective neural processing. Crossdecoding results demonstrated that preparatory overt attention recruited at least one additional, frontal process. This additional spatially selective process emerged early and likely reflects motor preparation or predictive remapping. To summarize, we found that the neural signatures of overt and covert attention overlap, yet diverge rapidly, in part because overt attention employs an additional spatially selective neural process. Extending beyond a dissociation on the single-cell level, our findings demonstrate that population-level neural activity dissociates preparatory overt from covert attention.","NA","biorxiv",1747346953003

In CASP16, blind predictions for 42 targets canvassing a full array of nucleic acid functions, from dopamine binding by DNA to formation of elaborate RNA nanocages, were submitted by 65 groups from 46 different labs worldwide. In contrast to concurrent protein structure predictions, performance on nucleic acids was generally poor, with no predictions of previously unseen natural RNA structures achieving TM-scores above 0.8. Even though automated server performance has improved, all top-performing groups were human expert predictors: Vfold, GuangzhouRNA-human, and KiharaLab. Good performance on one template-free modeling target (OLE RNA) and accurate global secondary structure prediction suggested that structural information can be extracted from multiple sequence alignments. However, 3D accuracy generally appeared to depend on the availability of closely related 3D structures, and predictions still did not achieve consistent recovery of pseudoknots, singlet Watson-Crick-Franklin pairs, non-canonical pairs, or tertiary motifs like A-minor interactions. For the first time, blind predictions of nucleic acid interactions with small molecules, proteins, and other nucleic acids could be assessed in CASP16. As with nucleic acid monomers, prediction accuracy for nucleic acid complexes was generally poor unless 3D templates were available. Accounting for template availability, there has not been a notable increase in nucleic acid modeling accuracy between previous blind challenges and CASP16.","NA","biorxiv",1747346953003

Few data are available on the combined effect of concurrent underlying conditions on risk of severe outcomes from RSV disease among inpatients.

ObjectiveTo identify underlying condition profiles associated with increased risk of severe outcomes among adults hospitalized with RSV.

DesignWe applied Bayesian profile regression, an outcome-informed statistical clustering model, to identify profiles of conditions associated with increased risk of RSV-associated severe outcomes separately among adults aged 18-59 and [&ge;]60 years. Seventeen underlying conditions were selected after excluding those with rare prevalence ([&le;]1%) or high pairwise tetrachoric correlation ([&ge;]0.7).

Setting26 hospitals in 20 U.S. states

ParticipantsProspectively enrolled adults hospitalized with RSV disease admitted January 2022-July 2024

Main Outcomes and MeasuresRisks of ICU admission, acute organ failure, and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death

ResultsWe analyzed data from 1111 adults hospitalized with RSV (median age [IQR] = 66 [53-75]). Among 397 adults aged 18-59 years, two profiles were identified characterized by (1) fewer underlying conditions (""minimal prevalence"" profile; 308 cases [78%]; median number of conditions = 1; IQR 1-2) with a posterior median ICU admission risk of 20.5% (95% credible interval = [16.1{square}25.0]), and (2) a cardiorenal/diabetes profile (89 cases [22%]) with frequent heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and increased ICU admission risk (37.1% [27.3{square}47.6]). Among 714 adults aged [&ge;]60 years, four profiles were identified: (1) minimal condition prevalence (460 cases [64%]; ICU admission risk = 21.6% [18.4{square}25.5]), (2) cardiorenal/diabetes (183 cases [26%]; 27.3% [21.4{square}33.6]), (3) hematologic malignancy and transplant receipt (52 cases [7%]; 11.8% [5.7{square}21.0]), and (4) chronic pulmonary disease with home oxygen dependence (19 cases [3%]; 44.0% [24.5{square}65.8]). Similar differences in risk were observed for acute organ failure and IMV or death.

Conclusion and RelevanceDistinct underlying condition profiles with varying risks of severe outcomes were identified in adults hospitalized with RSV. These findings could support recognition of high-risk patients to inform RSV prevention strategies and suggest that the role of multimorbidity in increasing severe RSV disease risk warrants further attention.

Key pointsQuestion: How does multimorbidity influence risk of severe outcomes among adults hospitalized with RSV?

Findings: In this cohort study of 1,111 U.S. adults hospitalized with RSV during 2022-2024, approximately one in four patients aged 18-59 and [&ge;]60 years had a profile of frequent heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and elevated risk of ICU admission and acute organ failure. Adults aged [&ge;]60 years with chronic pulmonary disease with home oxygen dependence had the highest risk for ICU admission and acute organ failure.

Meaning: The role of distinct multimorbidity profiles in increasing severe RSV disease risk warrants further attention.","NA","medrxiv",1747346953003

The analysis incorporated imputation for missing data on race and parametric bootstrapping to account for sampling and imputation uncertainty. We found that legal intervention injury rates remained relatively stable over time, with Black individuals consistently experiencing rates over five times higher than White individuals, and Latinx individuals showing moderately higher rates than Whites with some evidence of decline. These findings suggest that, despite heightened public scrutiny and advocacy following nationwide protests against racialized policing, rates of nonfatal injuries from law enforcement have remained high and unequally distributed by race.","NA","medrxiv",1747346953003

In coral reefs, dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by benthic primary producers such as algae fuels heterotrophic microbial growth, which can be detrimental to corals. While this microbialization process has been associated with the abundance and replication strategies of bacteriophages, the direct relationship between reef DOM composition and bacteriophage communities remains unclear. Here, we combine metabolomics, metagenomes, and viromes to demonstrate that phage abundances have significant relationships with DOM composition on the reefs of Curacao, Southern Caribbean. By constructing co-occurrence networks between free or cell-associated viruses and exometabolites, we identified thousands of statistically significant associations between phages and organic compounds. While total viral abundances did not significantly correlate with overall dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, cell-associated phages had significantly more positive associations with compounds that had a reduced nominal oxidative state of carbon (NOSC). Furthermore, temperate phages were more frequently correlated with metabolites exhibiting higher Gibbs energy than lytic phages. Six of the ten viruses with the highest number of positive associations with metabolites were temperate (i.e., encoded an integrase or were identified as a prophage), despite this network consisting of approximately 90% lytic viruses. These temperate viruses were predicted to infect members of the genus Sphingobium. Together, these findings reveal a connection between phage replication strategies and DOM energy availability with potential implications for coral reef biogeochemistry.

SignificanceCoral reefs are highly dynamic ecosystems where microbial communities and organic matter cycles are intricately linked. This study provides new insights into how bacteriophages interact with dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition, revealing that cell-associated bacteriophages, particularly temperate phages, are associated with more energy-rich organic compounds. These findings suggest that DOM may have a bottom-up influence on the lysis-lysogeny decision of temperate phages infecting their host or that lysogeny may play an underappreciated role in shaping the reef carbon cycle. Energy-rich organic compounds have generally been associated with increased algal abundances and coral decline. By demonstrating significant connections between viral infection strategies and the energy content of DOM, our results highlight the potential for phages to influence coral reef biogeochemistry and health.","NA","biorxiv",1747346953003

Here, we quantify the nonlinear, flow-dependent resistance of ETTs with and without a bronchoscope by analyzing pressure-flow relationships across multiple tube-bronchoscope configurations. We find that with bronchoscope insertion, tube resistance increases with the inverse fifth power of the effective tube diameter, defined as the diameter of a circular tube with the same cross-sectional area as the remaining lumen. Using an intensive care ventilator in combination with an active lung simulator, we demonstrate that the increased resistance during bronchoscopy causes dynamic hyperinflation and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) buildup in volume-controlled modes, and reduced tidal volumes in pressure-controlled modes. Numerical simulations using a simple scaling law relating resistance to effective tube diameter accurately reproduce the observed impairments. This demonstrates that the impact of tube narrowing during bronchoscopy can be reliably predicted from ventilator settings and patient respiratory mechanics. We present a predictive model that allows clinicians to anticipate and manage ventilation impairments, supporting evidence-based selection of endotracheal tubes and bronchoscopes. In addition, we provide proof of principle that combining pressure-controlled ventilation with automatic tube compensation can fully prevent these impairments, pointing to a technically feasible solution to an underrecognized clinical problem.","NA","medrxiv",1747346953003

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1747346953003

They responded to three behavioural economic tasks: a simulated COVID-19 Vaccine Purchase Task (CVPT), HIV Vaccine Purchase Task (HVPT), and the Monetary Probability Discounting Task (MPDT). Demand curves were fitted using an exponentiated model with both purchase tasks demonstrating excellent fit (R2 = .98). Multiple regression analyses examined relationships between behavioral economic indices and demographic factors. Nigerian participants showed significantly higher price sensitivity for both COVID-19 ({beta} = 1.10, p < .001) and HIV vaccines ({beta} = 0.90, p = .001) compared to U.S. participants, while baseline demand intensity and risk tolerance were similar between countries. Monetary risk-taking behavior predicted HIV vaccine demand ({beta} = -1.10, p = .02), and higher socioeconomic status was associated with lower price sensitivity ({beta} = -1.09, p = .04). The study demonstrates the utility of behavioral economic frameworks in modeling vaccine demand across cultures, revealing cross-cultural differences in price sensitivity and the potential relationship between COVID-19 and future HIV vaccine acceptance.

Sex and gender mandates were introduced in grant competitions to increase womens health research. This study aimed to understand what type of womens health research is being funded and prioritized in open grant competitions in Canada.

MethodsPublicly available funded Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) project grant abstracts from 2020 and 2023 were coded for the mention of sex, gender, two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer plus (2S/LGBTQ+), and female-specific research and assessed for changes in research representation and funding. A deeper analysis of funded female-specific grant abstracts from 2023 and 2009-2020 was conducted to assess if grant abstracts focused on the 11 areas of global disease burden and death that disproportionately affect females, and if this has evolved over time.

ResultsThe percentage of abstracts mentioning sex, gender and 2S/LGBTQ+ doubled or quadrupled from 2020 to 2023, but remained at under 10% of overall funded abstracts. In contrast, female-specific research representation did not change over time, and remained at [~]7% of all research. Importantly, female-specific research largely focused on cancers (breast, gynecologic) or pregnancy. We also examined research funding representation for the top 11 global burden of disease or death for females across the 13 years and observed that cancer accounted for 2.07% of funding, whereas the other top 10 collectively accounted for 2.21% across 13 years.

ConclusionsDespite mandates for integrated sex and gender based analyses in Canada, research acknowledging which population is explored remains under 10%. Mandates are not affecting the percentage of funding for womens health grants. More efforts and support beyond sex and gender mandates are needed to increase funding for and to diversify female-specific research beyond pregnancy and cancer.

Nasal anti-CD3 treats animal models of progressive MS by inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and lessen clinical disease.

MethodsTen patients with non-active secondary progressive MS (naSPMS) that continued to progress on B cell therapy were treated with nasal anti-CD3 (foralumab) for a minimum of six months in an open label study. Safety monitoring included otolaryngology evaluation and neurologic assessments including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC-4), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) and Low Contract Visual Acuity (LCVA). MRI and microglial translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging with [F-18]PBR06 were conducted. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic biomarkers and single cell RNA sequencing of blood was performed to evaluate foralumab-induced immunomodulation. The endpoints of our study were safety, clinical effects, microglial signal and immune measures.

ResultsAll patients stabilized on EDSS scores and three of four patients treated continuously for 12 months had improvement on EDSS. Six of 10 patients had improvement in fatigue on the MFIS scale. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) or severe AEs and no new T2 lesions were observed on MRI. There was a reduction in TSPO-PET signal over six months (p<0.05). Changes in peripheral blood gene expression occurred as early as three months and affected antigen presentation, interferon responses and regulatory pathways in multiple cell types including FoxP3+ Tregs, CD4+ Tcm cells, CD8+ Tem cells, CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes and B cells. TGF{beta} expression was increased across cell multiple subsets.

InterpretationThese findings identify a novel, non-toxic immune based therapy for the treatment for PIRA that acts by the induction of a regulatory immune responses and dampens microglial inflammation. Double blind placebo-controlled trials are warranted to explore nasal foralumab for the treatment of naSPMS.","NA","medrxiv",1747346953003

The disease mechanism of ME/CFS is unknown, with no effective curative treatments. In this study, we present a multi-site ME/CFS whole-genome analysis, which is powered by a novel deep learning framework, HEAL2. We show that HEAL2 not only has predictive value for ME/CFS based on personal rare variants, but also links genetic risk to various ME/CFS-associated symptoms. Model interpretation of HEAL2 identifies 115 ME/CFS-risk genes that exhibit significant intolerance to loss-of-function (LoF) mutations. Transcriptome and network analyses highlight the functional importance of these genes across a wide range of tissues and cell types, including the central nervous system (CNS) and immune cells. Patient-derived multi-omics data implicate reduced expression of ME/CFS risk genes within ME/CFS patients, including in the plasma proteome, and the transcriptomes of B and T cells, especially cytotoxic CD4 T cells, supporting their disease relevance. Pan-phenotype analysis of ME/CFS genes further reveals the genetic correlation between ME/CFS and other complex diseases and traits, including depression and long COVID-19. Overall, HEAL2 provides a candidate genetic-based diagnostic tool for ME/CFS, and our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the genetic, molecular, and cellular basis of ME/CFS, yielding novel insights into therapeutic targets.
