We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1724105351779

During REM sleep, the brain's internal representation of direction keeps shifting like that of an awake animal moving through its environment. What causes these shifts, given the immobility of the sleeping animal? Here we show that the superior colliculus of the mouse, a motor command center involved in orienting movements, issues motor commands during REM sleep, e.g. turn left, that are similar to those issued in the awake behaving animal. Strikingly, these motor commands, despite not being executed, shift the internal representation of direction as if the animal had turned. Thus, during REM sleep, the brain simulates actions by issuing motor commands that, while not executed, have consequences as if they had been. This study suggests that the sleeping brain, while disengaged from the external world, uses its internal model of the world to simulate interactions with it.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Thereafter, JN.1 subvariants, such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1), KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), and KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which convergently acquired a deletion of Serine at the 31st position in S (S:S31del) in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We recently reported the virological features of JN.1 subvariants including KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3.2,3 Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.3.1.1. First, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3.1.1 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model4 based on genome surveillance data from Spain, the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, where this variant has spread as of June 2024. In Spain, the Re of KP.3.1.1 is over 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and even higher than those of KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein show higher Re for KP.3.1.1. However, it must be noted there is the possibility of overestimation in these countries due to more limited KP.3.1.1 sequence numbers. These results suggest that KP.3.1.1 will spread worldwide along with other JN.1 sublineages. We then assessed the virological properties of KP.3.1.1 using pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus of KP.3.1.1 had significantly higher infectivity than that of KP.3. Neutralization of KP.3.1.1 was tested using i) convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or EG.5, ii) convalescent sera after the infection with HK.3 or JN.1, and iii) sera after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.3.1.1 was significantly lower than KP.3 (1.4-1.6-fold) in all four groups of convalescent sera tested. KP.3.1.1 also showed a 1.3-fold lower NT50 against XBB.1.5 vaccine sera than KP.3. Moreover, KP.3.1.1 showed stronger resistance with a 1.3-fold lower NT50 with statistical significances to the convalescent sera infected with EG.5 and HK.3 than KP.2.3. Altogether, KP.3.1.1 exhibited a higher Re, higher pseudovirus infectivity, and higher neutralization evasion than KP.3. These results align with our recent report that the JN.1 subvariants with S:S31del (e.g., KP.2.3 and LB.1) exhibited enhanced Re and immune evasion compared to the other JN.1 subvariants without S:S31del (e.g., JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3), highlighting the evolutionary significance of S:S31del in the JN.1 lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

How such intricate, self-replicating lichen architectures develop from simple microbial components remains unknown because of their recalcitrance to experimental manipulation. Here we report a metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the lichen Xanthoria parietina at different developmental stages. We identified 168 genomes of symbionts and lichen-associated microbes within a lichen thallus, including representatives of green algae, three different classes of fungi, and 14 bacterial phyla. By analyzing occurrence of individual species across lichen thalli from diverse environments, we defined both substrate-specific and core microbial components of the lichen. Meta-transcriptomic analysis of the principal fungal symbiont from three different developmental stages of a lichen, compared to axenically grown fungus, revealed differential gene expression profiles indicative of lichen-specific transporter functions, specific cell signalling, transcriptional regulation and secondary metabolic capacity. Putative immunity-related proteins and lichen-specific structurally conserved secreted proteins resembling fungal pathogen effectors were also identified, consistent with a role for immunity modulation in lichen morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

The results indicate that Omicron BA.1.1 and its pure reverse mutants were widely distributed throughout the United States from the early days of their emergence, showing a statistically significant difference compared to other major variants, which spread from a small number of sources. The peak emergence of BA.1.1 and BA.1.1.18 pure reverse mutants occurred a few weeks before the peak of all collected samples, whereas the peak of pure reverse mutants in major BA.1 variants and BA.2 coincides with the overall sampling peak. Although the peaks of BA.1.x collections are not all synchronous, the peaks of pure reverse mutants in the BA.1 lineage completely overlap, with the number of such mutants declining abruptly after the peak. These regional and temporal anomalies in the Omicron BA.1 lineage, especially in the BA.1.1 lineage, are virtually impossible to explain by current theories of natural mutation and spread by human-to-human infection.","NA","medrxiv",1724105351779

MethodsWe used Australian census data linked to the Australian Immunisation Register and death registrations to estimate COVID-19 booster effectiveness according to booster type and recency in adults aged 65+ years in Australia during August 2023-February 2024, a period dominated firstly by XBB-related SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants and then the BA.2.86-related JN.1. Survival analysis, adjusted for age, sex, and other sociodemographic and health measures, was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness.

ResultsWe followed 4.12 million adults aged 65+ years from 1 August 2023 to 29 February 2024. By 29 February, 581146 doses of the XBB.1.5 vaccine were administered, and 1620 COVID-19-specific deaths occurred. COVID-19 mortality rates were 72/100000 person-years in people who received a COVID-19 booster >365 days earlier, and 21/100000 in those who received the XBB.1.5 booster in the last 3 months. The relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of XBB.1.5 booster receipt in the last 3 months against COVID-19 mortality was 74.7% (95%CI 59.9-84.1%). The rVE for those receiving other booster types in the last 3 months was 51.6% (39.3-61.4%). Booster rVE against COVID-19 mortality waned. Compared to those who received a COVID-19 booster >365 days earlier, rVE for a booster within 3-6 months earlier was 31.2% (18.9-41.6%) and for a booster received 6-12 months earlier rVE was 13.1% (1.8-23.2%). rVE estimates were similar in analyses restricted to 1 December 2023 to 29 February 2024 when the dominant Omicron subvariant was JN.1.

ConclusionsRecent booster vaccination with the XBB.1.5 monovalent COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective in preventing COVID-19 mortality including in the period when the JN.1 subvariant circulated, supporting recommendations for 6-monthly boosting in older adults. Evaluation of vaccination effectiveness against other health outcomes, such as COVID-19 hospitalisations and ICU admission, would help further document vaccination benefits.","NA","medrxiv",1724105351779

Contractile forces generated by myosin motor proteins mediate these mechanical signal transduction processes through unclear protein structural mechanisms. Here, we show that myosin forces elicit structural changes in actin filaments (F-actin) that modulate binding by the mechanosensitive adhesion protein -catenin. Using correlative cryo-fluorescence microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, we identify F-actin featuring domains of nanoscale oscillating curvature at cytoskeleton-adhesion interfaces enriched in zyxin, a marker of actin-myosin generated traction forces. We next introduce a reconstitution system for visualizing F-actin in the presence of myosin forces with cryo-electron microscopy, which reveals morphologically similar superhelical F-actin spirals. In simulations, transient forces mimicking tugging and release of filaments by motors produce spirals, supporting a mechanistic link to myosin's ATPase mechanochemical cycle. Three-dimensional reconstruction of spirals uncovers extensive asymmetric remodeling of F-actin's helical lattice. This is recognized by -catenin, which cooperatively binds along individual strands, preferentially engaging interfaces featuring extended inter-subunit distances while simultaneously suppressing rotational deviations to regularize the lattice. Collectively, we find that myosin forces can deform F-actin, generating a conformational landscape that is detected and reciprocally modulated by a mechanosensitive protein, providing a direct structural glimpse at active force transduction through the cytoskeleton.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neuromelanin imaging, and pupillometry, we show that arousal and locus coeruleus (LC) activation transform otherwise continuous experiences into distinct episodic memories. As sequences unfold, encountering a context shift, or event boundary, triggers arousal and LC processes that predict later memory separation. Boundaries furthermore promote temporal pattern separation within left hippocampal dentate gyrus, which correlates with heightened LC responses to those same transition points. We also find that a neurochemical index of prolonged LC activation correlates with diminished arousal responses at boundaries, suggesting a connection between elevated LC output and impaired event processing. These findings align with the idea that arousal processes initiate a neural and memory reset in response to significant changes, constructing the very episodes that define everyday memory.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

We characterised phenotypic changes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in three age groups: newborn (cord blood), adults aged 20-30 years, and adults aged 70-80 years, focusing on innate-like T cells and innate cells, including MAIT cells, NKT cells, {gamma}{delta} T cells, ILCs, and Natural Killer (NK) cells.

Innate-like T cell subsets express similar patterns of the chemokine receptors and maturation markers CCR4, CCR6, CD27, CD38, CD57 and CD45RA, and resemble memory subsets of conventional CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. We could detect ILCs in all age ranges, although the frequency of ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3 subsets decreased with age.

AlphaFold2 predictions revealed that RPA and TPP1 interact with telomerase at distinct binding sites. Using separation-of-function mutants, we discovered that RPA-mediated telomerase stimulation is indispensable for telomere elongation, while TPP1-POT1 primarily functions in recruiting telomerase to telomeres. Furthermore, we demonstrated that short telomere disease-associated telomerase mutations compromise RPA's ability to stimulate telomerase, establishing a link between impaired RPA-dependent processivity and telomeropathies. Our findings redefine human telomerase regulation by establishing RPA as a critical regulator and provide new insights into the molecular basis of telomere-related diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Manual scoring of liver biopsies, currently the gold standard for clinical trial enrollment and endpoint assessment, suffers from high reader variability. This study represents the most comprehensive multi-site analytical and clinical validation of an AI-based pathology system, Artificial Intelligence-based Measurement of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (AIM-NASH), to assist pathologists in MASH trial histology scoring. AIM-NASH demonstrated high repeatability and reproducibility compared to manual scoring. AIM-NASH-assisted reads by expert MASH pathologists were superior to unassisted reads in accurately assessing inflammation, ballooning, NAS >= 4 with >=1 in each score category, and MASH resolution, while maintaining non-inferiority in steatosis and fibrosis assessment. These findings suggest AIM-NASH could mitigate reader variability, providing a more reliable assessment of therapeutics in MASH clinical trials.","NA","medrxiv",1724105351779

Mx proteins arose within the Dynamin superfamily of proteins (DSP), mediating critical cellular processes, such as endocytosis and mitochondrial, plastid, and peroxisomal dynamics. And yet, the evolutionary origins of Mx proteins are poorly understood. Using a series of phylogenomic analyses with stepwise increments in taxonomic coverage, we show that Mx proteins predate the interferon signaling system in vertebrates. Our analyses find an ancient monophyletic DSP lineage in eukaryotes that groups vertebrate and invertebrate Mx proteins with previously undescribed fungal MxF proteins, the relatively uncharacterized plant and algal Dynamin 4A/4C proteins, and representatives from several early-branching eukaryotic lineages. Thus, Mx-like proteins date back close to the origin of Eukarya. Our phylogenetic analyses also reveal that host-encoded and NCLDV (nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses)-encoded DSPs are interspersed in four distinct DSP lineages, indicating recurrent viral theft of host DSPs. Our analyses thus reveal an ancient history of viral and antiviral functions encoded by the Dynamin superfamily in eukaryotes.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

How such mutualism has evolved between originally unrelated organisms is of interest. Here we report that, using an experimental symbiotic system between the stinkbug Plautia stali and the model bacterium Escherichia coli, disruption of a single bacterial gene tnaA encoding tryptophanase makes E. coli mutualistic to P. stali. Survey of natural bacterial mutualists across wild populations of P. stali and other stinkbug species uncovered that their Pantoea-allied symbionts consistently lack tnaA gene. Some Pantoea species like P. ananatis retain tnaA gene and cannot establish symbiosis with P. stali, but tnaA-disrupted P. ananatis partially restored the symbiotic capability. When a natural Pantoea mutualist of P. stali was transformed with a functional tna operon, its symbiotic capability reduced significantly. Our finding suggests that tryptophanase disruption may have facilitated the evolution of gut bacterial mutualists in insects.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

We evaluate key evidence relating to the Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill that was discussed in the UK Parliament between 2022 and 2024. We characterize the UKs role in international hunting trophy trade by analyzing CITES trade data for 2000-2021 and 2015-2021. For CITES-listed species imported to/exported from the UK as hunting trophies in these periods we use data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species to determine whether hunting designated as ""trophy hunting"" is i) likely a major threat contributing to species being of elevated conservation concern, ii) likely or possibly causing localized declines, or iii) not a threat. We then use the Red List to determine whether such hunting provides, or potentially provides, benefits for species and/or people. Finally, we evaluate the UK Governments impact assessment of the bill. In 2000-2021 an estimated 3494 hunting trophies from 73 CITES-listed species and subspecies were exported to the UK involving an estimated 2549 whole organism equivalents (WOEs), i.e. individual animals. Imports involved 158.86 {+/-} 66.53 (mean {+/-} SD) trophies/year (115.83 {+/-} 32.27 WOEs/year). In 2015-2021, 79% of imports were from countries where populations of the hunted species are stable, increasing, or abundant. Legal hunting for trophies is not a major threat to any of the species or subspecies imported to the UK, but likely or possibly represents a local threat to some populations of nine species. This hunting does, or could potentially, benefit 20 species and subspecies, and people. Among other concerns, the impact assessment failed to adequately consider the costs and benefits to local communities in countries where such hunting occurs. Informed by these analyses we discuss alternative regulatory options.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

However, findings are heterogeneous, potentially due to differing methodologies and sample characteristics. Here, we investigate the cross-cohort replicability of gray matter correlates of childhood maltreatment across large clinical and non-clinical adult samples using harmonized assessment, preprocessing and analysis pipelines. Methods: Three independent adult cohorts comprising a total of N=3225 individuals (healthy control [HC]: n=1898 and participants with major depressive disorder [MDD]: n=1327) underwent structural MRI and maltreatment assessment via the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Associations between childhood maltreatment and voxel-based gray matter volume (GMV) were tested on a wholebrain level in two steps: 1) pooling all three cohorts together to harvest maximum statistical power (applying a voxel-wise FWE-corrected threshold of pFWE<.05) and 2) investigating the replicability of effects by assessing cross-cohort spatial overlap of significant voxels at two liberal uncorrected thresholds (punc<.001 and punc<.01). Twelve statistical models were tested, that varied in maltreatment operationalizations, subsamples and covariates. Results: Pooling cohorts yielded no significant maltreatment-GMV associations when controlling for lifetime MDD diagnosis. Dropping MDD diagnosis as a covariate yielded significant negative effects of maltreatment within widespread clusters across temporal regions, a fusiform-lingual-parahippocampal complex, the thalamus and the orbitofrontal cortex (k=4970, pFWE<.05). Including only HC subsamples, small clusters emerged either when using the CTQ sum score (k=99, pFWE<.05, orbitofrontal) or when investigating severe forms of maltreatment in HCs (k=132, pFWE<.05, cerebellum). The largest effect size when pooling all three cohorts was partial R2=.022. Replicability analyses using a liberal uncorrected thresholding at punc<.001 yielded maltreatment-GMV associations within all single cohorts and across all statistical models. However, these associations were effectively non-replicable across cohorts, which was largely consistent across statistical models. Even extending the significance threshold to a liberal threshold of punc<.01 yielded only marginal replicability across cohorts. Conclusions: Gray matter correlates of childhood maltreatment, measured with the CTQ, are non-replicable across large cohorts when adequately controlling for depression diagnosis, even when employing harmonized study protocols, lenient statistical thresholds and exploring various maltreatment operationalizations and subgroups. Previous findings may have been inflated by inadequate control for confounding diagnosis effects or due to publication bias. Our findings underscore the importance of a paradigm shift towards investigating the replicability of neuroimaging findings.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterium responsible for TB, and HIV-1 target macrophages. Understanding how Mtb subverts these cells may facilitate the identification of new druggable targets. Here, we explored how TB can induce macrophages to form tunneling nanotubes (TNT), promoting HIV-1 spread. We found that TB triggers metabolic rewiring of macrophages, increasing their glycolytic ATP production. Using pharmacological inhibitors and glucose deprivation, we discovered that disrupting aerobic glycolysis significantly reduces HIV-1 exacerbation in these macrophages. Glycolysis is essential for tunneling nanotubes (TNT) formation, which facilitates viral transfer and cell-to-cell fusion and induces the expression of the sialoadhesin Siglec-1, enhancing both HIV-1 binding and TNT stabilization. Glycolysis did not exacerbate HIV-1 infection when TNT formation was pharmacologically prevented, indicating that higher metabolic activity is not sufficient per se to make macrophages more susceptible to HIV-1. Overall, these data might facilitate the development of targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting glycolytic activity in TB-induced immunomodulatory macrophages to ultimately halt HIV-1 dissemination in co-infected patients.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

One limitation of using TPD therapeutically is that most E3 ligases have broad tissue expression, which can contribute to toxicity via target degradation in healthy cells. Many pathogenic and oncogenic viruses encode E3 ligases (vE3s), which de facto have strictly limited expression to diseased cells. Here, we provide proof-of-concept for Viral E3 Pan-Essential Removing Targeting Chimeras (VIPER-TACs) that are bi-functional molecules that utilize viral E3 ubiquitin ligases to selectively degrade pan-essential proteins and eliminate diseased cells. We find that the human papillomavirus (HPV) ligase E6 can degrade the SARS1 pan-essential target protein in a model of HPV-positive cervical cancer to selectively kill E6 expressing cancer cells. Thus, VIPER-TACs have the capacity to dramatically increase the therapeutic window, alleviate toxicity concerns, and ultimately expand the potential target space for TPD.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Joint species-level analysis with other Asian cohorts identified a distinct age-associated shift in Asian gut metagenomes, characterized by a reduction in microbial richness, and enrichment of specific Alistipes and Bacteroides species (e.g. Alistipes shahii and Bacteroides xylanisolvens). Functional pathway analysis confirmed that these changes correspond to a metabolic potential expansion in aging towards alternate pathways that synthesize and utilize amino-acid precursors, relative to the dominant microbial guilds that typically produce butyrate in the gut from pyruvate (e.g. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia inulinivorans).

Recent advances in neuronal recording techniques aim to progress towards this milestone, yet the resulting high dimensional responses are challenging to interpret and link to relevant variables. In this work, we introduce SPARKS, a model capable of generating low dimensional latent representations of high dimensional neural recordings. SPARKS adapts the self-attention mechanism of large language models to extract information from the timing of single spikes and the sequence in which neurons fire using Hebbian learning. Trained with a criterion inspired by predictive coding to enforce temporal coherence, our model produces interpretable embeddings that are robust across animals and sessions. Behavioural recordings can be used to inform the latent representations of the neural data, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive capabilities across diverse electrophysiology and calcium imaging datasets from the motor, visual and entorhinal cortices. We also show how SPARKS can be applied to large neuronal networks by revealing the temporal evolution of visual information encoding across the hierarchy of the visual cortex. Overall, by integrating biological mechanisms into a machine learning model, we provide a powerful tool to study large-scale network dynamics. SPARKS capacity to generalize across animals and behavioural states suggests it is capable of estimating the internal latent generative model of the world in animals, paving the way towards a foundation model for neuroscience.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

To address this challenge, we labeled primary mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) subclones with DNA barcodes to characterize their pre-metastatic state using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq and determine their relative in vivo metastatic potential prospectively. We identified a gene signature separating metastasis-high and metastasis-low subclones orthogonal to the normal-to-PDAC and classical-to-basal axes. The metastasis-high subclones feature activation of IL-1 pathway genes and high NF-{kappa}B and Zeb/Snail family activity and the metastasis-low subclones feature activation of neuroendocrine, motility, and Wnt pathway genes and high CDX2 and HOXA13 activity. In a functional screen, we validated novel mediators of PDAC metastasis in the IL-1 pathway, including the NF-{kappa}B targets Fos and Il23a, and beyond the IL-1 pathway including Myo1b and Tmem40. We scored human PDAC tumors for our signature of metastatic potential from mouse and found that metastases have higher scores than primary tumors. Moreover, primary tumors with higher scores are associated with worse prognosis. We also found that our metastatic potential signature is enriched in other human carcinomas, suggesting that it is conserved across epithelial malignancies. This work establishes a strategy for linking cancer cell state to future behavior, reveals novel functional regulators of PDAC metastasis, and establishes a method for scoring human carcinomas based on metastatic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Unfortunately, for higher taxonomic ranks such as genus, establishing a generally accepted approach based on genome analysis is challenging. While core-genome phylogenies depict the evolutionary relationships among species, determining the correspondence between clades and genera may not be straightforward. For genotypic divergence, percentage of conserved proteins (POCP) and genome-wide average amino acid identity (AAI) are commonly used, but often do not provide a clear threshold for classification. In this work, we investigated the utility of global comparisons and data visualization in identifying clusters of species based on their overall gene content, and rationalized that such patterns can be integrated with phylogeny and other information such as phenotypes for improving taxonomy. As a proof of concept, we selected 177 representative genome sequences from the Mycoplasmatales-Entomoplasmatales clade within the class Mollicutes for a case study. We found that the clustering patterns corresponded to the current understanding of these organisms, namely the split into three above-genus groups: Hominis, Pneumoniae, and Spiroplasma-Entomoplasmataceae-Mycoides (SEM). However, at the genus level, several important issues were found. For example, recent taxonomic revisions that split the Hominis group into three genera and Entomoplasmataceae into five genera are problematic, as those newly described or emended genera lack clear differentiations in gene content from one another. Moreover, several cases of mis-classification were identified. These findings demonstrated the utility of this approach and the potential application for other bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Some theory and evidence suggest that polyploids have a greater accumulation and tolerance of gene presence-absence and genomic structural variation, but it is unclear to what extent either is true. To test how recent polyploidy may influence pangenomic variation, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated twelve complete, chromosome-scale genomes of Camelina sativa, an allohexaploid biofuel crop with three distinct subgenomes. Using pangenomic comparative analyses, we characterized gene presence-absence and genomic structural variation both within and between the subgenomes. We found over 75% of ortholog gene clusters are core in Camelina sativa and <10% of sequence space was affected by genomic structural rearrangements. In contrast, 19% of gene clusters were unique to one subgenome, and the majority of these were Camelina-specific (no ortholog in Arabidopsis). We identified an inversion that may contribute to vernalization requirements in winter-type Camelina, and an enrichment of Camelina-specific genes with enzymatic processes related to seed oil quality and Camelinas unique glucosinolate profile. Genes related to these traits exhibited little presence-absence variation.

However, naturally occurring AAV serotypes are limited in their ability to target skeletal muscle, an important gene therapy target for many neuromuscular disorders. This means that high doses of AAV are often required to achieve therapeutically effective doses in muscle. To overcome this, novel AAV vector capsids have been engineered by inserting targeting peptides into the AAV9 capsid variable region VIII (VRIII) to achieve greater muscle transduction efficiency. Here we describe investigation of a newly reported capsid, called MyoAAV1A combined with clinically validated muscle-specific promoters. We profiled the efficiency of in vivo delivery to murine skeletal muscle and found that the optimal combination of MyoAAV1A capsid with MHCK7 promoter maintains transgene expression in skeletal muscle, and reduces expression in off-target tissues, particularly the liver. This highlights a promising capsid-promoter combination to progress in further preclinical research for skeletal muscle gene therapy.

Hungry animals prioritize food seeking and feeding behaviors, while sated animals suppress these behaviors to engage in other activities. Additionally, neuronal activity and synaptic transmission are among the most energy expensive processes. Yet neurons do not uptake nutrients from the circulation. Instead, glia fulfill this highly evolutionary conserved function. Recent studies have shown that glia can modulate neuronal activity and behavior. However, how different glia subtypes sense metabolic state and modulate neurons and behavior is incompletely understood. Here, we unravel two types of glia-mediated modulation of metabolic state-dependent behavior. In food-deprived flies, astrocyte-like and perineurial glia promote foraging and feeding, respectively, while cortex glia suppress these behaviors. We further show that adenosine and adenosine receptor modulate intracellular calcium levels in these glia subtypes, which ultimately controls behavior. This study reveals a new mechanism how different glia subtypes sense the metabolic state of the animal and modulate its behavior accordingly.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

In particular, red-shifted opsins offer access deeper within the brain tissue. It is however crucial to consider the potential unintended back-activation of endogenous opsins due to laser light striking the back of the retina. Here, we found that in complete darkness and with no expression of exogenous opsins, optical fiber laser stimulation at wavelengths of 637 nm (red), 594 nm (orange), or 473 nm (blue) from within the ipsilateral mouse visual cortex resulted in a strong neuronal response in its contralateral counterpart. This neuronal activation occurred even at low laser intensities (1 mW at the fiber tip, ~31.8 mW/mm2) and was most pronounced using red wavelengths. We therefore took advantage of retinal light adaptation using external illumination with a relatively dim ambient light source (20 lux) which was found to completely abolish orange and blue laser-evoked neuronal activation from within the brain, even at high laser intensities (15 mW, ~477.3 mW/mm2). To prevent red laser-evoked retinal activation, however, only much lower intensities (2.5 mW, ~79.6 mW/mm2) combined with external illumination (20 lux) could be used. These findings demonstrate the critical need for careful selection of light wavelengths and intensities for laser stimulation during optogenetic experiments in the mouse brain in vivo. Additionally, light adaptation of the retina through ambient light exposure offers an effective solution to minimize unintended retinal activation.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

We first characterise single-cell clock dynamics in clock mutants using a microfluidics device that allows precise control of the microenvironment. We find known clock regulators are dispensable for clock robustness, whilst perturbations of the core clock reveal that the wild-type operates at a noise optimum that we can reproduce in a stochastic model of just the core phosphorylation loop. We then examine how the clock responds to noisy environments, including natural light conditions. The model accurately predicts how the clock filters out environmental noise, including fast light fluctuations, to keep time while remaining responsive to environmental shifts. Our findings illustrate how a simple clock network can exhibit complex noise filtering properties, advancing our understanding of how biological circuits can perform accurately in natural environments.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Every muscle displays the same type of organisation, they are innervated in the middle and attached at both extremities to tendons. Myonuclei are heterogeneous along myotubes and regionalised according to these middle and tip domains. During development, as soon as myotubes are formed, myonuclei at muscle tips facing developing tendons display their own molecular program. In addition to molecular heterogeneity, a subset of tip myonuclei has a fibroblastic origin different to the classical somitic origin, highlighting a cellular heterogeneity of myonuclei in foetal myotubes. To gain insights on the functional relevance of myonucleus heterogeneity during limb development, we used 2D culture and co-culture systems to dissociate autonomous processes (occurring in 2D-cultures) from 3D-spatial environment of tissue development. We also assessed the role of mechanical parameters in myonucleus heterogeneity in paralysed limb muscles. The regionalisation of cellular heterogeneity was lost in 2D cell culture systems and paralyzed muscles. The molecular signature of MTJ myonuclei was also lost a dish and paralysed muscles indicating a requirement of spatial and mechanical input for MTJ formation. Tip genes that maintain their expression in a dish are involved in myofibrillogenesis and myotube attachments. The behaviour of regionalized markers in cultured myotubes and paralyzed muscles allows us to deduce whether the genes intervene in myogenesis, myotube attachment or MTJ formation.

To address this question, we optogenetically silenced the dHPC or the vHPC while simultaneously recording from the PFC of mice performing a SWM task. We found that whereas both HPC subregions were necessary during the encoding phase of the task, only the dHPC was necessary during the choice phase.

Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases.

Each of the two genomes were broken up into 100-kB segments, each of which was searched for matches to a large set of porcine queries. All scans sought matches to the same set of 813,194 40-mer nucleotide queries randomly selected from the genome of Sus scrofa (domestic pig). For each of the two study organisms, mean segmental match rates (MSMRs) were then calculated for all segments in each of three categories: those segments occurring on autosomes, those on the X chromosome, and those on the Y chromosome. Results: In scans of single-copy regions (euchromatin) in both their Y chromosomes and their autosomes, it was found that the number of matches to randomly selected porcine queries was higher in humans than in bonobos. When autosomes were compared, matches were 1.3% higher in humans than in bonobos. This figure is equal to the percentage of human autosomal nucleotide positions bearing nucleotides that match in pig but not in bonobo. Remarkably, it agrees with the percentage of autosomal nucleotides previously reported to differ in bonobos and humans. So, the results of this study indicate that essentially all the nucleotide positions that differ in humans and bonobos, are the same in humans and pigs. In addition, the number of matches to pig queries found on the human Y chromosome was 34.5% higher than on the bonobo Y, and 12.4% higher than on the chimpanzee Y (the chimpanzee figure may be the more reliable of the two, since the bonobo Y nucleotide sequence file scanned contained only unlocalized scaffolds). MSMRs for the human and bonobo X chromosomes did not significantly differ.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Methanogenesis inhibitors such as 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) decrease methane emissions in ruminants when supplemented in feed. Yet we lack a system-wide, species-resolved understanding of how the rumen microbiota remodels following inhibition and how this influences animal production. Here, we conducted a large-scale trial with 51 dairy calves to analyse microbiota responses to 3-NOP, pairing host performance, emissions, and nutritional profiles with genome-resolved metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. 3-NOP supplementation decreased methane emissions by an average of 62%, modulated short-chain fatty acid and H2 levels, and did not affect dietary intake or animal performance. We created a rumen microbial genome catalogue with an unprecedented mapping rate. We observed a strong reduction of methanogens and stimulation of reductive acetogens, primarily novel uncultivated lineages such as Candidatus Faecousia. However, there was a shift in major fermentative communities away from acetate production in response to hydrogen gas accumulation. Thus, the divergent responses of the fermentative and hydrogenotrophic communities limit potential productivity gains from methane reduction. Reporting one of the largest reductions in methane emissions in a field trial to date, this study links ruminant greenhouse gas emissions and productivity to specific microbial species. These findings also emphasise the importance of microbiota-wide analysis for optimising methane mitigation strategies and identify promising strategies to simultaneously reduce emissions while increasing animal production.

Significance StatementOne strategy to increase the sustainability and productivity of livestock production is to modulate ruminant microbiota to produce absorbable nutrients rather than the potent greenhouse gas methane. Previous studies show supplementing feed with methanogenesis inhibitors such as 3-nitrooxypropanol reduces methane emissions, but also leads to inconsistent productivity gains. Here we report a definitive field trial, combining animal data, meta-omics, and structural modelling, to resolve the key microbes and pathways controlling nutrient and methane production in ruminants. We show that shifts in composition and gene expression of hydrogen-cycling microbes reduce emissions but limit productivity gains. These findings offer insights at unprecedented resolution, while the data and analytical framework provide valuable resources to develop solutions to enhance livestock productivity and sustainability.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Here we introduce machine learning-assisted genomics-and-imaging convergence (MAGIC), an autonomously operated platform that integrates automated live-cell imaging of micronucleated cells, machine learning in real-time, and single-cell genomics to investigate de novo CA formation at scale. Applying MAGIC to near-diploid, non-transformed cell lines, we track CA events over successive cell cycles, highlighting the common role of dicentric chromosomes as an initiating event. We determine the baseline CA rate, which approximately doubles in TP53-deficient cells, and show that chromosome losses arise more rapidly than gains. The targeted induction of DNA double-strand breaks along chromosomes triggers distinct CA processes, revealing stable isochromosomes, amplification and coordinated segregation of isoacentric segments in multiples of two, and complex CA outcomes, depending on the break location.

Leveraging previous work on precision network estimation and recent advances in network-level TMS targeting, we demonstrate that clinical TMS approaches target different functional networks between individuals. Homotopic scalp positions (left F3 and right F4) target different networks within and across individuals, and right F4 generally favors a right-lateralized control network. We also modeled the impact of targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) zone anticorrelated with the sgACC and found that the individual-specific anticorrelated region variably targets a network coupled to reward circuitry.

Cells lost by abrasion are replaced by division of both corneal epithelial cells and populations of stem cells around the corneal periphery, the limbus. Limbal-derived epithelial cells migrate into the cornea, retaining equal cell loss and replacement rates (the 'XYZ hypothesis'). This process leads to a striking stable spiral cell motion pattern across the corneal surface, with a central vortex. Here, we show that the emergence of the spiral pattern can be explained by the interplay of the position of the limbus, cell division, extrusion, and collective cell migration along the curved surface of the cornea. Using dissected LacZ mosaic murine corneas, we inferred the flow field on the curved surface by following stripe edges, revealing a tightening spiral. To explain the flow fields, we developed a cell-level, in silico model of the mouse cornea. Corneal epithelial cells were treated as mechanically soft, self-propelled particles with density-dependent proliferation and extrusion rates, and noisy alignment of the direction of migration. Even without any global guidance cues, the model predicted that migration patterns form stripes and spirals closely recapitulating those in the experiment. To understand the origin and properties of this flow field, we complemented the particle-based model with a continuum description of cell flux on the cornea that generalises the XYZ hypothesis of steady-state balance between cell divisions and extrusions. The work, therefore, demonstrates how the physics of swarms on curved surfaces can provide quantitative explanations of biological processes at the tissue scale.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Resection lengths are reduced to varying degrees in MRN hypomorphs or if MRE11 nuclease activity is attenuated in a conditional nuclease-dead Mre11 model. These findings unexpectedly establish that MRN is needed for longer-range extension of resection, not just resection initiation. Finally, resection defects are additively worsened by combining MRN and Exo1 mutations, and mice that are unable to initiate resection or have greatly curtailed resection lengths experience catastrophic spermatogenic failure. Our results elucidate multiple functions of MRN in meiotic recombination, uncover unanticipated relationships between short- and long-range resection, and establish the importance of resection for mammalian meiosis.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Pallatom directly learns and models the joint distribution P(structure, seq) by focusing on P(all-atom), effectively addressing the interdependence between sequence and structure in protein generation. To achieve this, we propose a novel network architecture specifically designed for all-atom protein generation. Our model employs a dual-track framework that tokenizes proteins into tokenlevel and atomic-level representations, integrating them through a multi-layer decoding process with ""traversing"" representations and recycling mechanism. We also introduce the atom14 representation method, which unifies the description of unknown side-chain coordinates, ensuring high fidelity between the generated all-atom conformation and its physical structure. Experimental results demonstrate that Pallatom excels in key metrics of protein design, including designability, diversity, and novelty, showing significant improvements across the board. Our model not only enhances the accuracy of protein generation but also exhibits excellent training efficiency, paving the way for future applications in larger and more complex systems.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Neuronal subtypes in the ENS have been distinguished by their electrophysiological properties, morphology, and expression of characteristic markers, notably neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Here we investigated synaptic cell adhesion molecules as novel cell type markers in the ENS. Our work identifies two Type II classic cadherins, Cdh6 and Cdh8, specific to sensory neurons in the mouse colon. We show that Cdh6+ neurons demonstrate all other distinguishing classifications of enteric sensory neurons including marker expression of Calcb and Nmu, Dogiel type II morphology and AH-type electrophysiology and IH current. Optogenetic activation of Cdh6+ sensory neurons in distal colon evokes retrograde colonic motor complexes (CMCs), while pharmacologic blockade of rhythmicity-associated current IH disrupts the spontaneous generation of CMCs. These findings provide the first demonstration of selective activation of a single neurochemical and functional class of enteric neurons, and demonstrate a functional and critical role for sensory neurons in the generation of CMCs.

One-Sentence SummaryIntrinsic sensory neurons of the enteric nervous system in the mouse distal colon exclusively express synaptic cell adhesion molecules Cdh6 and Cdh8, evoke retrograde colonic motor complexes (CMCs) when stimulated, and possess rhythmicity-associated IH current, which is necessary for the production of spontaneous CMCs.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Cleavage of mature heparan sulfate chains, knockout of N- and 6-O-sulfotransferases, overexpression of endo-6-O-sulfatases, or the addition of exogenous heparan sulfate chains with high 2-O sulfation result in marked loss in glycoRNA-csRBP clustering in U2OS cells.

To better understand the regulation of carbon metabolism by Tre6P in monocot C4 species we used Setaria viridis, which has been widely adopted as a model for the major C4 NADP-malic enzyme subtype crop species, such as maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum). In this work, we analysed the levels of transcripts encoding Tre6P-related enzymes in different tissues and cell types from S. viridis. The TREHALOSE-6-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE1 transcript, its encoded protein (TPS1, the enzyme responsible for Tre6P synthesis) and Tre6P were mainly located in bundle sheath cells of S. viridis.

Individuals with pathological MAPT variants exhibit behavioural changes, cognitive impairment and signs of parkinsonism. Missense mutations of residue P301, which are the most common MAPT mutations associated with FTDP-17, give rise to the assembly of mutant four-repeat tau into filamentous inclusions, in the absence of extracellular deposits. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from five individuals belonging to three unrelated families with mutation P301L and from one individual belonging to a family with mutation P301T. A novel three-lobed tau fold resembling the two-layered tau fold of Pick's disease was present in all cases with the P301L tau mutation. Two different tau folds were found in the case with mutation P301T, the less abundant of which was a variant of the three-lobed fold. The major P301T tau fold was V-shaped, with partial similarity to the four-layered tau folds of corticobasal degeneration and argyrophilic grain disease. These findings suggest that FTDP-17 with mutations in P301 should be considered distinct inherited tauopathies and that model systems with these mutations should be used with caution in the study of sporadic tauopathies.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

To contribute to the inward Ca2+ flux that drives Ca2+-induced-Ca2+-release, CaV1.2 channels must be expressed on the sarcolemma; thus the regulatory mechanisms that tune CaV1.2 expression to meet contractile demand are an emerging area of research. A ubiquitously expressed protein called 14-3-3 has been proposed to affect Ca2+ channel trafficking in non-myocytes, however whether 14-3-3 has similar effects on CaV1.2 in cardiomyocytes is unknown. 14-3-3 preferentially binds phospho-serine/threonine residues to affect many cellular processes and is known to regulate cardiac ion channels including NaV1.5 and hERG. Altered 14-3-3 expression and function have been implicated in cardiac pathologies including hypertrophy. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that 14-3-3 interacts with CaV1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and regulates cardiac CaV1.2 trafficking and recycling. Confocal imaging, proximity ligation assays, super-resolution imaging, and co-immunoprecipitation revealed a population of 14-3-3 colocalized and closely associated with CaV1.2. The degree of 14-3-3/CaV1.2 colocalization increased upon stimulation of {beta}-adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol. Notably, only the 14-3-3-associated CaV1.2 population displayed increased cluster size with isoproterenol, revealing a role for 14-3-3 as a nucleation factor that directs CaV1.2 super-clustering. 14-3-3 overexpression increased basal CaV1.2 cluster size and Ca2+ currents in ventricular myocytes, with maintained channel responsivity to isoproterenol. In contrast, isoproterenol-stimulated augmentation of sarcolemmal CaV1.2 expression and currents in ventricular myocytes were abrogated by 14-3-3 inhibition. These data support a model where 14-3-3 interacts with CaV1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner to promote enhanced trafficking/recycling, clustering, and activity during {beta}-adrenergic stimulation.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Recent evidence suggests that pathological changes in skeletal muscle may contribute significantly to ongoing pain and fatigue, particularly post-exertional malaise. This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of PASC-related fatigue by examining skeletal muscle function and circulating factors in affected individuals. We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study of patients with fatigue-associated PASC who had experienced mild to moderate COVID-19 without hospitalization. Skeletal muscle biopsies revealed reduced mitochondrial respiration and content in PASC participants compared to healthy controls. This lower respiratory capacity was accompanied by markedly elevated circulating levels of soluble IL-2 receptor alpha subunit (sIL2R), a T cell-specific receptor. In vitro experiments demonstrated that sIL2R directly impairs mitochondrial oxygen consumption and reduces mitochondrial complex III subunit protein levels in cultured muscle cells. These findings suggest a mechanism linking systemic immune dysregulation to muscle-specific mitochondrial dysfunction in PASC. This work provides new insights into the pathophysiology of PASC identifying sIL2R as a promising therapeutic target for addressing mitochondrial deficits in PASC-related fatigue and opening avenues for developing targeted interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1724105351779

One of its increasingly prevalent applications is in isobaric reagent-based quantitation such as the iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) and TMT (tandem mass tag) approaches. In these methods, labelling on the primary amines of lysine residues and N-termini of tryptic peptides via amide formation (N-derivatives) from corresponding NHS ester reagents is the intended reactive outcome. However, the role of NHS esters as activated carboxyls can also drive the formation of serine-, tyrosine-, and threonine- derived esters (O-derivatives). These O-derivative peptides are typically classed as over-labelled and are disregarded for quantification, leading to loss of information and hence potential sensitivity. Their presence also unnecessarily increases sample complexity, which reduces the overall identification rates. One common approach for removing these unwanted labelling events has involved a quench with hydroxylamine. We show here that this approach is not fully efficient and can still leave substantial levels of unwanted over-labelled peptides. Through systematic screening of nucleophilic aminolysis reagents and reaction conditions, we have now developed a robust method to efficiently remove over-labelled peptides. The new method reduces the proportion of over-labelled peptides in the sample to less than 1% without affecting the labelling rate or introducing other modifications, leading to superior identification rates and quantitation precision.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

It imposes an enormous symptomatic burden on patients, leaving many with residual disease despite optimal procedural therapy, and up to 1/3 with debilitating angina amenable neither to procedures, nor to current pharmacologic options. Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist originally approved for management of diabetes, has garnered substantial attention for its capacity to attenuate cardiovascular risk. Although subgroup analyses in patients indicate promise, studies explicitly designed to isolate the impact of semaglutide on the sequelae of CAD, independently of comorbid diabetes or obesity, are lacking. Approach and Results: Yorkshire swine (n=17) underwent placement of an ameroid constrictor around the left circumflex coronary artery to induce CAD. Oral semaglutide was initiated postoperatively at 1.5 mg and scaled up in 2 weeks to 3 mg in treatment animals (SEM, n=8) for a total of 5 weeks, while control animals (CON, n=9) received no drug. All then underwent myocardial harvest with acquisition of perfusion and functional data using microsphere injection and pressure-volume loop catheterization. Immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were performed on the most ischemic myocardial segments for mechanistic elucidation. SEM animals exhibited improved left ventricular ejection fraction, both at rest and during rapid myocardial pacing (both p<0.03), accompanied by increased perfusion to the most ischemic myocardial region at rest and during rapid pacing (both p<0.03); reduced perivascular and interstitial fibrosis (both p <0.03); and apoptosis (p=0.008). These changes were associated with increased activation of the endothelial-protective AMPK pathway (p=0.005), coupled with downstream increases in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p=0.014). Conclusion: This study is the first to reveal the capacity of oral semaglutide to augment cardiac function in the chronically ischemic heart in a highly translational large animal model, likely through AMPK-mediated improvement in endothelial function and perfusion to the ischemic myocardium.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

This regulation is thought to define the spatio-temporal patterns of Ca2+ signals necessary for the appropriate activation of downstream effectors. The binding of both IP3 and Ca2+ are obligatory for IP3R channel opening, however, Ca2+ regulates IP3R activity in a biphasic manner. Mutational studies have revealed that Ca2+ binding to a high-affinity pocket formed by the ARM3 domain and linker domain promotes IP3R channel opening without altering the Ca2+ dependency for channel inactivation. These data suggest a distinct low-affinity Ca2+ binding site is responsible for the reduction in IP3R activity at higher [Ca2+]. We determined the consequences of mutating a cluster of acidic residues in the ARM2 and central linker domain reported to coordinate Ca2+ in cryo-EM structures of the IP3R type 3. This site is termed the CD Ca2+ binding site and is well-conserved in all IP3R sub-types. We show that the CD site Ca2+ binding mutants where the negatively charged glutamic acid residues are mutated to alanine exhibited enhanced sensitivity to IP3-generating agonists. Ca2+ binding mutants displayed spontaneous elemental Ca2+ events (Ca2+ puffs) and the number of IP3-induced Ca2+ puffs was significantly augmented in cells stably expressing Ca2+ binding site mutants. When measured with on-nucleus patch clamp, the inhibitory effect of high [Ca2+] on single channel-open probability (Po) was reduced in mutant channels and this effect was dependent on [ATP]. These results indicate that Ca2+ binding to the putative CD Ca2+ inhibitory site facilitates the reduction in IP3R channel activation when cytosolic [ATP] is reduced and suggest that at higher [ATP], additional Ca2+ binding motifs may contribute to the biphasic regulation of IP3-induced Ca2+ release.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

We introduce CauFinder, an advanced framework designed to accurately identify causal regulators of these transitions and further precisely steer such transitions by integrating causal disentanglement modelling with network control based solely on observed data. By leveraging do-calculus and optimizing information flow metrics, CauFinder can distinguish causal factors from spurious ones, ensuring precise control over desired state transitions. One significant advantage of CauFinder is its ability to identify those variables causally affecting the cell-state/phenotype transitions among all observed variables, both theoretically and computationally, leading to the identification of their master regulators when combined with network control. Consequently, by employing a counterfactual algorithm, CauFinder is able effectively to facilitate desirable state transitions or steer these transitional trajectories/paths by modulating these causal drivers. Beyond its theoretical advantages, CauFinder outperforms existing approaches computationally in both simulated and real-world settings. CauFinder is able to not only reveal natural biological transition processes such as (a) cell differentiation, (b) lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) to lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) transdifferentiation and (c) drug-sensitive to drug-resistant transitions but also identify the causal regulators of their reverse transition processes, such as (A) cell dedifferentiation, (B) LUSC to LUAD transdifferentiation and (C) drug-resistant to drug-sensitive transitions. These findings highlight its superior ability to causally uncover essential regulatory mechanisms and accurately steer cell-state/phenotype transitions, thus providing novel therapeutic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

During adolescence, the maturation of PFC is proposed to be a critical period (CP) for executive function, driven by a break in balance between glutamatergic excitation and GABAergic inhibition (E/I) neurotransmission. During CPs, cortical circuitry fine-tunes to improve information processing and reliable responses to stimuli, shifting from spontaneous to evoked activity, enhancing the SNR, and promoting neural synchronization. Harnessing 7T MR spectroscopy and EEG in a longitudinal cohort (N = 164, ages 10-32 years, 283 neuroimaging sessions), we outline associations between age-related changes in glutamate and GABA neurotransmitters and EEG measures of cortical SNR. We find developmental decreases in spontaneous activity and increases in cortical SNR during our auditory steady state task using 40 Hz stimuli. Decreases in spontaneous activity were associated with glutamate levels in DLPFC, while increases in cortical SNR were associated with more balanced Glu and GABA levels. These changes were associated with improvements in working memory performance. This study provides evidence of CP plasticity in the human PFC during adolescence, leading to stabilized circuitry that allows for the optimal recruitment and integration of multisensory input, resulting in improved executive function.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Brain state-dependent TMS approaches are a promising solution to this problem, but inter-individual variation in lesion location and oscillatory dynamics can make translating them to the poststroke brain challenging. Personalized brain state-dependent approaches specifically designed to address these challenges are therefore needed. METHODS: As a first step towards this goal, we tested a novel machine learning-based EEG-TMS system that identifies personalized brain activity patterns reflecting strong and weak corticospinal tract (CST) output (strong and weak CST states) in healthy adults in real-time. Participants completed a single-session study that included the acquisition of a TMS-EEG-EMG training dataset, personalized classifier training, and real-time EEG-informed single pulse TMS during classifier-predicted personalized CST states. RESULTS: MEP amplitudes elicited in real-time during personalized strong CST states were significantly larger than those elicited during personalized weak and random CST states. MEP amplitudes elicited in real-time during personalized strong CST states were also significantly less variable than those elicited during personalized weak CST states. Personalized CST states lasted for ~1-2 seconds at a time and ~1 second elapsed between consecutive similar states. Individual participants exhibited unique differences in spectro-spatial EEG patterns between personalized strong and weak CST states. CONCLUSION: Our results show for the first time that personalized whole-brain EEG activity patterns predict CST activation in real-time in healthy humans. These findings represent a pivotal step towards using personalized brain state-dependent TMS interventions to promote poststroke CST function.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Effective integration of these data by considering the shared and specific information from each data source can help us better understand different types of cancer. In this study we propose a novel autoencoder (AE) structure with explicitly defined orthogonal loss between the shared and specific embeddings to integrate different data sources. We compare our model with previously proposed AE structures based on simulated data and real cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Using simulations with different proportions of differentially expressed genes, we compare the performance of AE methods for subsequent classification tasks. We also compare the model performance with a commonly used dimension reduction method, joint and individual variance explained. In terms of reconstruction loss, our proposed AE models with orthogonal constraints have a slightly better reconstruction loss. All AE models achieve higher classification accuracy than the original features, demonstrating the usefulness of the embeddings extracted by the model. Particularly, we show that the proposed models have consistently high classification accuracy on both training and testing sets. In comparison, the recently proposed MOCSS model that imposes an orthogonality penalty in the post-processing step has lower classification accuracy that is on par with JIVE.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Defects and wear in the cartilage of the joint, condyle, and fibrocartilage disc lie at the heart of many common TMJ disorders. During postnatal development the condyle acts as a growth centre for the mandible with cells moving as a conveyor belt away from the top of the condyle as they differentiate. The superficial layers of the condyle have been proposed to contain stem/progenitor populations to allow growth and maintain homeostasis. Here we have focused on the role of FSP1 (also known as S100a4), as a key fibroblast stem/progenitor marker for the condyle. Lineage tracing using FSP1-Cre;mTmG mice revealed that FSP1-positive cells were restricted to the superficial fibroblast zone giving rise to all layers of the condyle over time. The FSP1-expressing cells overlapped with other putative stem cell markers of the condyle, Gli1 and Scleraxis. BrdU pulse chase experiments highlighted that a subset of FSP1 fibrocartilage were label-retaining, suggesting that FSP1 labels a novel stem/progenitor cell population in the condyle. Destruction of FSP1-expressing cells by conditional diphtheria toxin activity in FSP1-Cre;DTA mice resulted in severe TMJ osteoarthritis (TMJOA) with loss of the cartilage structure. Lgr5 expressing cells in the superficial layer of the condyle, have previously been shown to create a Wnt inhibitory niche. FSP1 expression postnatally was associated with a reduction in canonical Wnt activity in the condyle. Importantly, constitutive activation of Wnt/{beta} catenin in FSP1 cells, led to a downregulation of FSP1 and progressive postnatal loss of TMJ condylar hyaline cartilage due to loss of the superficial stem/progenitor cells. These data demonstrate a novel role for FSP1-expressing cells in the superficial zone in growth and maintenance of the TMJ condylar cartilage and highlight the importance of regulating Wnt activity in this population.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Lateral and ventral OFC contained opposing representations of an encountered reward's subjective benefit and its associated opportunity costs, respectively. These representations directly competed to make accept-reject decisions during reward evaluation. If a poor-quality reward was mistakenly accepted, ventral and medial OFC participated in reevaluation processes during change-of-mind decisions.

Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has advanced our understanding of immune responses across various diseases or conditions, currently there lacks a method to systematically examine cytokine effects and immune cell polarization. To address this gap, we developed Single-cell unified polarization assessment (Scupa), the first computational method for comprehensive immune cell polarization analysis. Scupa is trained on data from the Immune Dictionary, which characterizes 66 cytokine-driven polarization states across 14 immune cell types. By leveraging the cell embeddings from the Universal Cell Embeddings model, Scupa effectively identifies polarized cells in new datasets generated from different species and experimental conditions. Applications of Scupa in independent datasets demonstrated its accuracy in classifying polarized cells and further revealed distinct polarization profiles in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells across cancers. Scupa complements conventional single-cell data analysis by providing new insights into immune cell polarization, and it holds promise for assessing molecular effects or identifying therapeutic targets in cytokine-based therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

We identified 69 pairwise models with suggestive evidence of SNP-SNP interaction (p-value < 1e-4) and, for each SNP pair, we evaluated a fully saturated model including additive, dominant, and epistatic (additive-by-additive, additive-by-dominance and dominance-by-dominance) terms.

To better understand the molecular and functional changes associated with TREM2 signalling, we generated a TREM2 reporter mouse model and observed a gradual upregulation of reporter expression with increasing plaque proximity. Isolated microglia were sorted based on reporter expression and their transcriptomic profiles acquired in both wildtype and APP transgenic animals, allowing us to disentangle TREM2 versus pathology-specific effects. Bulk RNA-sequencing highlighted TREM2 level-dependent changes in major immunometabolic pathways, with enrichment of genes in oxidative phosphorylation and cholesterol metabolism in microglia with increased TREM2 expression. To confirm these findings, we next analysed uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and examined metabolomic and lipidomic profiles. Again, independent of A{beta} pathology, TREM2 expression correlated with uptake of FDG as well as increased cellular redox, energetics, and cholesterol homeostasis. Finally, we performed chronic treatment with a brain penetrant TREM2 agonist and identified a window of TREM2 expression where microglia are most responsive. Thus, our data provide novel insights into TREM2-mediated regulation of microglial metabolic function and informs current efforts to bring TREM2 agonists into clinical application.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Understanding how environmental factors shape the genetic differentiation of natural populations and identifying the genetic basis of local adaptation will provide insights into how species may cope with environmental changes. The buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) has a wide natural distribution range and has been successfully domesticated to produce commercial colonies for greenhouse pollination. Previous population genetics studies on B. terrestris have mainly focused on populations in Europe; however, populations in Asia, representing the eastern side of its natural distribution, have been less thoroughly sampled. To fill this gap, we collected wild B. terrestris samples from Asia, as well as wild B. terrestris from Europe and samples from domesticated colonies. We conducted whole-genome resequencing for 77 collected B. terrestris workers and performed population genomics analysis. Our results revealed significant genetic differentiation (FST= 0.076) between buff-tailed bumblebees in Europe and Asia, along with notable morphological and physiological differences, indicating that B. terrestris in Asia represents a distinct new genetic resource. Demographic analysis suggested that the population size of buff-tailed bumblebees had increased during historic cold periods, confirming their cold-adapted characteristics. Selective sweep analysis identified 331 genes under selection in the genomes of Asian B. terrestris, likely involved in their adaptation to high ultraviolet radiation, low temperature, and low precipitation in their habitats. Our research provides insights into the population genetic structure and genetic basis of local adaptation in the buff-tailed bumblebee, which will be useful for its conservation and management.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

ODAs are inhibited by the packaging chaperone Shulin during ciliogenesis in T. thermophila. How Shulin is released for ODAs to become active inside cilia remains unclear. We establish interactions between DNAAF9 (human Shulin) and mammalian ODA subunits, IFT proteins and the ciliary small GTPase ARL3 using proteomics and in vitro reconstitutions. Mutagenesis combined with biochemical and structural studies reveal that DNAAF9 and Shulin preferentially bind the active Arl3-GTP state. GTP-loaded Arl3 can access, bind and displace Shulin from the packaged ODA-Shulin complex. We propose that once the inhibited ODA complex enters growing cilia, Arl3-GTP displaces Shulin (DNAAF9) and sequesters it away from ODAs promoting activation of their motility specifically inside cilia.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

Using their surface bound T cell antigen receptors (TCRs), these cells screen millions of antigens presented by major histocompatability complex (MHC) or MHC-like molecules. In other protein families, the dynamics of protein-protein interactions have important implications for protein function. Case studies of TCR:class I peptide-MHCs (pMHC-Is) structures have reported mixed results on whether the binding interfaces undergo conformational change during engagement and no robust statistical quantification has been done to generalise these results. It thus remains an open question if movement occurs in the binding interface that enables recognition and activation of T cells. In this work, we quantify the conformational changes in the TCR:pMHC-I binding interface by creating a dataset of 358 structures, comprising 25 TCRs, 20 MHC alleles, and 58 peptide structures in both unbound (apo) and bound (holo) conformations. In support of some case studies, we demonstrate that all complimentary determining region (CDR) loops move to a certain extent but only CDR3 and CDR3{beta} loops modify their shape when binding pMHC-Is. We also map out the contacts between TCRs and pMHC-Is, generating a novel fingerprint of TCRs on MHC molecules and show that the CDR3 tends to bind the N-terminus of the peptide and the CDR3{beta} tends to bind the C-terminus of the peptide. Finally, we show that the presented peptides can undergo conformational changes when engaged by TCRs, as has been reported in past literature, but novelly show these changes depend on how the peptides are anchored in the MHC binding groove. Our work has implications in understanding the behaviour of TCR:pMHC-I interactions and providing insights that can be used for modelling T cell antigen specificity, an ongoing grand challenge in immunology.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

We compared A{beta} production across all missense PSEN2 variants in the Alzforum database and, when possible, to corresponding PSEN1 variants.

METHODSWe expressed 74 PSEN2 variants, 21 of which had homologous PSEN1 variants with the same amino acid substitution, in HEK293 cells lacking PSN1/2. A{beta} production was compared to age at symptom onset (AAO) and between homologous PSEN1/2 variants.

RESULTSA{beta}42/40 and A{beta}37/42 ratios were associated with AAO across PSEN2 variants, strongly driven by PSEN2 variants with PSEN1 homologs. PSEN2 AAO was 18.3 years later compared to PSEN1 homologs. A{beta} ratios from PSEN1/2 homologs were highly correlated, suggesting a similar mechanism of {gamma}-secretase dysfunction.

DISCUSSIONThe existence of a PSEN1 homolog and patterns of A{beta} production are important considerations in assessing the pathogenicity of previously-reported and new PSEN2 variants.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

In our study, we aimed to identify how these different representations of speech are spatially and temporally distributed throughout the depth of the brain. By considering multiple representations from the same exact data, we can limit potential con-founders to better understand the different aspects of speech production and acquire crucial complementary information for speech brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Intracranial speech production data was collected of 15 participants, recorded from 1647 electrode contacts, while they overtly spoke 100 unique words. The electrodes were distributed across the entire brain, including sulci and subcortical areas. We found a bilateral spatial distribution for all three representations, although there was a stronger tuning in the left hemisphere with a more widespread and temporally dynamic distribution than in the right hemisphere. The articulatory and acoustic representations share a similar spatial distribution surrounding the Sylvian fissure, while the semantic representation appears to be widely distributed across the brain in a mostly distinct network. These results highlight the distributed nature of the speech production process and the potential of non-motor representations for speech BCIs.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

MethodsWe employed molecular assays, cell and egg culture, Sanger and next generation sequencing to isolate and characterize viruses from multiple farm specimens (cow nasal swab, milk specimens, fecal slurry, and a dead bird).

ResultsWe detected H5N1 HPAIV in 64% (9/14) of milk specimens, 2.6% (1/39) of cattle nasal swab specimens, and none of 17 cattle worker nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We cultured and characterized virus from eight H5N1-positive specimens. Sanger and next-generation sequencing revealed the viruses were closely related into other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. Our isolates had multiple mutations associated with increased spillover potential. Surprisingly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in a nasal swab from a sick cow. Additionally, 14.3% (2/14) of the farm workers who donated sera were recently symptomatic and had elevated neutralizing antibodies against a related H5N1 strain.

ConclusionsWhile our sampling was limited, these data offer additional insight into the large H5N1 HPAIV epizootic which thus far has impacted at least 96 cattle farms in twelve US states. Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few. We need to find ways to work with dairy farms in collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data that are necessary for the design of future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms.","NA","medrxiv",1724105351779

For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila.

Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

We present ESM3, a frontier multimodal generative language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to biological alignment. We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins with a chain of thought. Among the generations that we synthesized, we found a bright fluorescent protein at far distance (58% identity) from known fluorescent proteins. Similarly distant natural fluorescent proteins are separated by over five hundred million years of evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

We investigated phenotypic and genetic correlates of never having had sex in [~]400,000 UK residents aged 39 to 73 and [~]13,500 Australian residents aged 18 to 89. The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g. upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% and 14% of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56. Polygenic scores predicted a range of related outcomes in the Australian dataset.

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1724105351779

As the zebrafish embryo grows into a larva, to improve its heart function, the embryonic myocardial wall transforms into an intricate 3D architecture, composed of an outer compact layer enveloping an inner layer of multicellular trabecular ridges. How these tissue layers acquire their characteristic form suited for their function remains an open question. Here, we find that multiscale mechanochemical coupling and an emergent tissue-scale morphological transition steer functional maturation of the developing zebrafish heart. Single-celled trabecular seeds recruit outer compact layer cells to mature into clonally heterogenous multicellular ridges, thereby amplifying cardiac contractile forces. In response, remaining compact layer cells are stretched, which impedes their further recruitment, thereby constraining trabecular ridge density. Concomitantly, Notch-dependent actomyosin dampening triggers a sharp transition in myocardial tissue area, activating rapid organ growth that expands blood filling capacity. Thus, multiscale self-organizing interactions optimize heart size and contractile efficiency to support embryonic life.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

MethodsPlasma samples from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were assayed with AD blood tests from C2N Diagnostics, Fujirebio Diagnostics, ALZPath, Janssen, Roche Diagnostics, and Quanterix. Outcomes measures were amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, cortical thickness, and dementia severity. Logistic regression models assessed the classification accuracies of individual or combined plasma biomarkers for binarized outcomes, and Spearman correlations evaluated continuous relationships between individual plasma biomarkers and continuous outcomes.

ResultsMeasures of plasma p-tau217, either individually or in combination with other plasma biomarkers, had the strongest relationships with all AD outcomes.

In aged mice, partial reprogramming, characterized by pulsed expression of reprogramming factors, has shown promise in improving function in various tissues, but its impact on the aging brain remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the impact of in vivo partial reprogramming on mature neurons in the dentate gyrus of young and aged mice. Using two different approaches - a neuron-specific transgenic reprogrammable mouse model and neuron-specific targeted lentiviral delivery of OSKM reprogramming factors - we demonstrated that in vivo partial reprogramming of mature neurons in the dentate gyrus, a neurogenic niche in the adult mouse brain, can influence animal behavior, and ameliorate age-related decline in memory and learning. These findings underscore the potential of in vivo partial reprogramming as an important therapeutic intervention to rejuvenate the neurogenic niche and ameliorate cognitive decline associated with aging or neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

In this study, we computationally model 1,804 protein complexes consisting of various H5 isolates from 1959 to 2024 against 11 HA1-neutralizing antibodies. This study shows a trend of weakening of the binding affinity of existing antibodies against H5 isolates over time, indicating that the H5N1 virus is evolving immune escape of our medical defenses. We also found that based on the wide variety of host species and geographic locations in which H5N1 was observed to have been transmitted from birds to mammals, there is not a single central reservoir host species or location associated with H5N1's spread. These results indicate that the virus is well on its way to moving from epidemic to pandemic status in the near future.

However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779

To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Warm White Light-Emitting Diode (LED), Cool White LED, Blue LED, and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic Puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation, and husbandry programs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic Puffin strandings remains to be the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine if aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1724105351779
