Meaning that signals flow from early sensory areas to later regions and back. Yet, between connected areas there exist some but not all pathways. How does this structure, somewhere between feedforward and fully recurrent, shape circuit function? To address this question, we designed a new recurrent neural network model in which a set of weight matrices (i.e. pathways) can be combined to generate every network structure between feedforward and fully recurrent. We term these architectures partially recurrent neural networks (pRNNs). We trained over 25,000 pRNNs on a novel set of reinforcement learning tasks, designed to mimic multisensory navigation, and compared their performance across multiple functional metrics. Our findings reveal three key insights. First, many architectures match or exceed the performance of fully recurrent networks, despite using as few as one-quarter the number of parameters; demonstrating that partial recurrence enables energy efficient, yet performant solutions. Second, each pathway's functional impact is both task and circuit dependent. For instance, feedback connections enhance robustness to noise in some, but not all contexts. Third, different pRNN architectures learn solutions with distinct input sensitivities and memory dynamics, and these computational traits help to explain their functional capabilities. Overall, our results demonstrate that partial recurrence enables robust and efficient computation - a finding that helps to explain why neural circuits are sparse and bidirectional, and how these principles could inform the design of artificial systems.","[{""name"":""Schmidt Sciences"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219077

Multipass transmembrane proteins have increased propensity to be targeted by the RQC, raising the question of whether problems in transmembrane domain insertion and assembly can also cause RQC-eliciting translational arrests. Here, we investigate RQC-mediated quality control of CFTR, a large transmembrane protein mutated in cystic fibrosis. Reporter assays show that although a sizeable fraction of nascent CFTR expressed in HEK293 cells arrests during translation and activates the RQC, multiple interventions compromising CFTR folding and membrane insertion do not exacerbate this response. CFTR translation abortion was also largely unaffected by regulators of translation kinetics such as codon usage, the ribosome collision sensor GCN1, and the SRP ER targeting complex. We propose that the RQC can be triggered by the inherent difficulties in synthesizing transmembrane segments, resulting from their inappropriate interaction with the protein synthesis machinery. Our study uncovers a novel physiological role for the RQC and points to new therapeutic targets for cystic fibrosis.","[{""name"":""Fritz Thyssen Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00f3sc705"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""10.22.2.029MN;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""540625656;CRC1678 project number 520471345;""},{""name"":""Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JRG-05 and CAP-33;""},{""name"":""Köln Fortune Program, Faculty of Medicine, University of Cologne"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""376/2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

Inspired by ecological principles, this multi-strike approach aims to eradicate tumors not through a singular ""magic bullet"" but through a series of therapies after standard frontline treatment when the tumor is still, and perhaps most, vulnerable. We present a framework leveraging mathematical modeling (MM) to develop personalized multi-strike protocols for HGSOC. Key contributions include: 1) An ""IMOme"" score using liquid biopsy data to assess patient-specific hematopoietic toxicity risk, guiding the timing and selection of subsequent therapies, 2) MM strategies to design effective lowdose combinations of targeted agents to achieve synthetic lethality while managing toxicity, and 3) A MM framework to analyze the interplay between chemotherapy, gut microbiome toxicity, and immunotherapy, demonstrating how mitigating microbiome damage could enhance immune response.

One of these cues, carbon dioxide (CO2), gates odorant and heat pathways and activates host-seeking behavior. The neuronal circuits underlying processing of CO2 information remain unclear. We used automated serial-section transmission electron microscopy (EM) to image and reconstruct the circuitry of the glomeruli that are innervated by the Ae. aegypti maxillary palp, including the glomerulus that responds to CO2. Notably, CO2-sensitive olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) make high levels of recurrent synaptic connections with one another, while making a low density of feedforward synapses. At some of these contacts between CO2 OSNs, we observe ribbon- like presynaptic structures, which may further enhance recurrent signaling. We compared both feedforward and recurrent connectivity with all olfactory glomeruli in Drosophila melanogaster, and we found more recurrent connections between the Ae. aegypti CO2-responsive OSNs than in any D. melanogaster glomeruli. We developed a computational circuit model that demonstrates recurrent synapses are necessary for robust CO2 detection under normal physiological conditions. Together, elevated levels of recurrent connectivity and ribbon-like structures may amplify sensory information detected by CO2-sensitive OSNs to support mosquito activation and sensitization by CO2, even in the presence of high levels of other odorants in the environment. We propose that this circuit organization supports the salience of CO2 as a mosquito host cue.

High genomic instability of these cancers leads to chromosomal breaks (breakpoints), which disrupt the physical connection between genes and adjacent regulatory elements. Standard molQTL methods are unable to accommodate breakpoint information and would therefore indiscriminately test associations across breakpoints, leading to spurious signals and reduced biological relevance. To address these challenges, we developed SegmentQTL, a segmentation-aware molQTL analysis tool, designed to improve the accuracy of association testing in unstable cancer genomes by incorporating sample-specific breakpoint information. Results: SegmentQTL applies an integrated purifying filtering step that removes associations spanning breakpoints, ensuring that only variants within the same segment as the phenotype are tested. This prevents false discoveries and reduces background noise. We evaluated SegmentQTL on selected genes from stable and unstable genomic regions and compared its results with a previously published state-of-the-art tool. In stable regions, SegmentQTL produced similar results, validating its approach. In unstable regions, however, the filtering step refined detected associations by shifting peak locations and removing artefactual signals that would arise if genomic instability were not properly accounted for.

Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour l’Education et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

With the advancements of large-scale recordings, efficient and precise automated spike sorting methods have become essential. Existing approaches face challenges with channel quality variability, neuron-specific waveform drifts, and nonlinear changes in spike shapes that depend on neuronal morphology and electrode proximity. We introduce KIASORT (Knowledge-Integrated Automated Spike Sorting), which integrates knowledge from channel-specific classifiers trained on clustered spike waveforms to sort the data. KIASORT evaluates channel quality, automatically excludes noisy recordings, and identifies spike classes using a hybrid dimensionality reduction approach combining linear with nonlinear embeddings. To validate our approach against existing methods, we developed biophysical simulations demonstrating that conventional one-dimensional drift correction methods cannot address heterogeneous neuron-specific drift and nonlinear waveform changes. KIASORTs geometry-free, per-neuron tracking approach overcomes these limitations without assumptions about cluster shape or temporal stability. Specifically, KIASORT identified significantly greater number of high-quality units than Kilosort4 in ground-truth simulations with neuron-specific drift, while maintaining real-time processing capability.

An example highlighting this difficulty was a discovery in the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) of a regeneration-associated gene that has been identified as either Kazald1 or Kazald2. Since orthology inference of genes across species is crucial to identifying gains and losses of gene functions, and thus if gene usage is likely to be consistent across species, we investigated the evolution of the axolotl genes using an extensive cross-species analysis. Molecular phylogeny inference conclusively identified the regeneration-associated gene as Kazald2, but also revealed an undescribed four-member Kazald gene family in jawed vertebrates. Moreover, synteny comparisons demonstrated that this family originated in the ancestral two-rounds of whole genome duplication. Additionally, we performed vertebrate-wide comparisons of Kazald gene expression profiles, employing available RNA-Seq which we validated in whole tissues of axolotl, zebrafish, and sharks. This uncovered seemingly ancestral connections conserved over jawed vertebrate evolution, such as Kazald1 with skeletogenesis and odontogenesis and Kazald2 with regeneration. It also suggested novel putative roles within specific lineages, including Kazald3 in teleost fish skeletogenesis and Kazald4 within avian brains. Our study thus demonstrates the establishment of a Kazald gene quartet in the jawed vertebrate ancestor, and elucidates the asymmetry of gene fates of its members, including deeply ancestral roles and comparably recent innovations. This provides a comprehensive report of this formerly undescribed gene family, offering a solid foundation for future studies of these genes in diverse species.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AI 214/1-1;""},{""name"":""Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012kf4317"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PRT 1208176 HFST-P;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

Reptiles are often infected by parasites. One common taxon is Oxyuroidea superfamily, which has a direct life cycle that promotes easy transmission in enclosed environments. Due to limited ecological knowledge, inappropriate husbandry practices are common in reptiles causing stress and increased parasite loads leading to severe health issues. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how routine captive procedures may influence parasite infections. In this study, we exposed captive bred tokay geckos (Gekko gecko) to two stressors common in the reptile trade, cohabitation with a novel conspecific and a change in diet. We tested their effect on fecal oxyurid output compared to a control group as well as their combined effect. We found that a single stressor had no effect on fecal parasite load while both combined did significantly increase parasite load. However, we did not find a detectable change in the lizards general condition. Our study shows that seemingly minor changes in housing and husbandry can exert stress and increase parasite load in tokay geckos. Further studies are needed to determine which other procedures (e.g. confinement, transport, novel environments) affect health and when combined could lead to more severe changes in health in reptiles.","[{""name"":""Ghent University"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cv9y106"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""01M00221;""},{""name"":""University of Bern"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02k7v4d05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NA;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

To date, little is known about the structure and underlying biology of GPR75, which is classified as an orphan GPCR and has low homology to other GPCRs.

Here, we describe the cryoEM structure of ICL3-BRIL-fused, unliganded human GPR75, together with functional data on G-protein coupling and effects of its putative ligands. GPR75 is present in an active-like state probably induced by the structure of its extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) which folds back deeply into the orthosteric pocket. This feature is important for both receptor integrity and signaling, as shown by mutagenesis studies. This structural finding is consistent with moderate constitutive activity for Gi1, while Gq does not seem to be recruited. Furthermore, functional data indicate that the putative ligands 20-HETE and CCL5 have no measurable effect on GPR75.

Significance StatementObesity is a major global health crisis which will affect a quarter of the worlds population by 2035. Many existing therapies have significant shortcomings, including emetic effects and the need for frequent injections. GPR75 is an understudied orphan GPCR which has recently emerged as one of the most promising novel obesity targets based on large-scale human genetic studies. However, the sparse knowledge we currently have about this receptor presents a major roadblock for the development of effective GPR75-based therapies. This study investigates the basic biology of GPR75 on a molecular level, including its structure and downstream signaling. These findings provide the groundwork for future efforts targeting GPR75 to fight the obesity pandemic.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

To understand the structure and function relationships of different SARS-CoV-2 variants that have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed high-throughput structure probing and modelling of the genomic structures of the wildtype (WT), Alpha, Beta, Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2. We observed that genomes of SARS-CoV-2 variants are generally structurally conserved, and that single-nucleotide variations and interactions with RNA binding proteins can impact RNA structures across the viruses. Importantly, using proximity ligation sequencing, we identified many conserved ultra-long-range RNA-RNA interactions, including one that spans more than 17 kb in both the WT virus and the Omicron variant. We showed that mutations that disrupt this 17 kb long-range interaction reduce viral fitness at later stages of its infection cycle, while compensatory mutations partially restore virus fitness. Additionally, we showed that this ultra-long-range RNA-RNA interaction structure binds directly to ADAR1 to alter the RNA editing levels on the viral genome. These studies deepen our understanding of RNA structures in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and their ability to interact with host factors to facilitate virus infectivity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

The Scopus database was used for publications from each country. Fractional counts were assigned for publications co-authored by authors from different countries. Full articles, reviews, conference papers, books and book chapters were included. In 2024, countries characterized as full democracies produced only 22% of the Scopus-indexed publications, versus 66% in 2006. There was no correlation between the ratio of publications indexed in 2024 versus 2006 and the absolute or relative change in Democracy Index between 2006 and 2024 (r=0.02 and r=0.00, respectively). 78% of publications in 2024 came from countries with problematic (including USA) or worse (including China) freedom of press.

Yet growing evidence suggests that their function may extend beyond the nucleus. Here, we systematically characterise the decay kinetics of eRNAs across human cell types using time-resolved transcriptomics and kinetic modelling. While most eRNAs undergo canonical exponential decay, a subset displays non-linear dynamics, suggesting context-dependent degradation mechanisms. Perturbation of core decay regulators, including components of the m6A and CCR4-NOT pathways, reveals that eRNA stability is modulated by a patchwork of pathways governing mRNA turnover. Integrating transcriptome-wide ribosome profiling, RNA-Seq, and half-life data, we identify eRNAs associated with changes in mRNA stability and translation efficiency of their target protein-coding transcripts. Functional validation of one such eRNA, en4528, shows it regulates CDKN2C mRNA independently of transcription and impacts cell migration. These findings redefine the regulatory scope of eRNAs, positioning them as active participants in post-transcriptional gene control and cellular behaviour. The resulting decay profiles and regulatory annotations have been incorporated into the eRNAkit database, available at https://github.com/AneneLab/eRNAkit, enhancing its capacity for integrative systems-level analysis of eRNA function.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

While it is in principle possible to estimate this effect from genome sequence data, interactions between selection, demography and inbreeding are expected to make inference less reliable. Here we investigate whether the genome-wide reduction in diversity due to background selection ([B]) can be accurately estimated when populations are at demographic non-equilibrium and/or reproduce by partial self-fertilisation. We show that the classic-BGS model is surprisingly robust to both demographic non-equilibrium and low rates of selfing, although both processes do lead to biased estimation of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of deleterious mutations. A high rate of selfing leads to poor estimation of both[B] and DFE parameters. We propose an alternative inference approach where background selection, demography and partial selfing are jointly estimated from windowed site frequency spectra. This approach, while approximate in nature, resolves most of the bias observed under the classic-BGS model and can also generate estimates of past demography that account for the effect of background selection and partial selfing. We apply the approach to genome sequence data from Capsella grandiflora and C. orientalis, which have contrasting mating systems and display a forty-fold difference in nucleotide diversity. Our results suggest that background selection has a weak effect on levels of genetic diversity in the outcrosser C. grandiflora ([B] = 0.89) and a more substantial effect in the predominantly selfing species C. orientalis ([B] = 0.44), but that background selection alone cannot explain their disparity in genetic diversity.","[{""name"":""Swedish Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03zttf063"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-03099;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

Yet, how sap feeders affect floral attractiveness to pollinators remains poorly understood, despite the critical role of this tripartite interaction in natural and agricultural ecosystems. These intricate interactions may be further enriched by pronounced sexual dimorphisms in dioecious species. In this study, we examined how infestation by the oligophagous aphid Brachycaudus lychnidis affects sex-specific interactions among the dioecious plant Silene latifolia and its specialist moth pollinator Hadena bicruris. We exposed male and female plants to aphid herbivory and evaluated its effects on floral traits (visual cues, floral scent, and nectar chemistry) and pollinator behaviour. Contrary to sexual selection theory, female plants were not less attractive than males under control conditions. Instead, our results suggest that females exhibit plasticity in floral trait expression depending on pollination success. Moreover, both sexes produced a diverse array of potentially bioactive nectar metabolites, with females showing higher abundances of many compounds that may influence female pollinator behaviour. Aphid infestation altered floral traits differently between sexes, with stronger declines in female floral attractiveness, suggesting sex-specific defence strategies and possible involvement of indirect defences in stabilizing this specialized plant-pollinator- herbivore system.

HighlightAphid infestation alters multiple visual and chemical floral traits in a plant sex-specific manner, leading to reduced attractiveness to moth pollinators in female plants, but not in males.

Understanding spatial factors may have implications for urban rewilding, as its success will depend on local tolerance of wildlife and may potentially increase human-wildlife interactions, such as bin-raiding and public wildlife feeding. We examined how urbanisation, geographic region, and public wildlife feeding influence reported bin-raiding, public attitudes, and the use of control measures towards the worlds most urbanised terrestrial carnivore, the red fox, Vulpes vulpes. Online survey data were obtained from 1,275 participants in the United Kingdom. Fox bin-raiding was associated with increased levels of public wildlife feeding, more negative attitudes towards foxes, and greater use of professional and do-it-yourself pest control measures. However, the role of urbanisation and geographic differences varied among these relationships. Specifically, urbanisation and geographic region significantly predicted reports of fox bin-raiding, with urban residents - particularly those living in London - more likely to report such behaviour. Urbanisation influenced peoples use of professional pest control of foxes within their area, and geographic region influenced the use of do-it-yourself control measures. Neither urbanisation nor geographic region significantly predicted public attitudes towards foxes. Together, these findings highlight the complex interactions between spatial context, human attitudes and behaviour, and animal ecology, underscoring the importance of nuanced, context-specific strategies to support human-wildlife coexistence and urban rewilding initiatives.

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.

Horizontal transfer of transposons (HTT) is important for their long-term persistence, but has only been systematically studied in animals, and thus the abundance, impact, and factors that shape HTTs in lineages outside animals is unknown. Fungi are at least as ancient and diverse as animals and are characterized by extensive genome size variation caused by transposons. Here, we screened 1,348 genomes across fungal biodiversity, genome sizes, and lifestyles to detect extensive HTTs, that generated on average 7% but up to 70% of the transposon content in some taxa. We in total identified at least 5,518 independent HTTs, mostly involving Tc1/Mariner DNA transposons. While the majority of HTTs occur between closely related taxa, irrespective of their lifestyles, HTTs were particularly common in Mucoromycotina, Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes, and Leotiomycetes. Importantly, species lacking fungal-specific defense mechanisms against transposons and those with gene-sparse and repeat-rich genomic compartments are involved in significantly higher number of HTTs, unveiling ecological and genomic factors shaping HTTs. Our findings thus illuminate the dynamic landscape of HTTs in fungi, providing the framework to further study the impact of HTTs on genome evolution and the processes that mediate transposon transfers within and between eukaryotic lineages.","[{""name"":""Utrecht University, Incentive Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

In this regard, harnessing the inherent ability of cellular tissues to self-organize and generate robust force fields offers a promising strategy for creating self-shaping living surfaces. However, achieving precise control over tissue mechanics to direct specific morphogenetic outcomes remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a strategy to program tissue shape transformations through the nematic organization of cellular forces. By precisely controlling nematic order and topological defects, we generate millimeter-scale tissues programmed with specific multicellular tension fields. Using a theoretical framework that integrates contractile nematics with thin sheet mechanics, we explore the role of nematically guided tensions in shape morphogenesis. Experimentally, upon tissue detachment, nematically guided tension fields drive out-of-plane deformations, generating reproducible 3D shapes. By integrating tissue contractility and nematic patterning, our approach offers a robust framework for the rational design of shape-programmable living surfaces.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B “Meiosis”;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

The mechanism by which ectopic gene activation occurs through these gain-of-function enhancer mutations remains poorly understood. Using the ZRS, a benchmark disease-associated enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), as a model, we demonstrate that poised (i.e., accessible but inactive) chromatin sensitizes Shh to aberrant activation in anterior limb bud, leading to polydactyly. In the anterior limb cells of wild-type mice, Shh is inactive, but the ZRS is accessible and marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. We demonstrate that this poising signature explains how over 20 independent rare variants within the ZRS cause Shh misexpression in the same anterior limb bud cell population, resulting in similar limb malformations, despite affecting binding sites for different activators and repressors. Disabling pioneer transcription factor binding to the ZRS suppresses its poised state in anterior cells, prevents aberrant activation of the ZRS by rare variants, and fully rescues limb malformations in variant knock-in mice. A thorough examination of other disease-associated enhancers with pathogenic gain-of-function variants revealed that they are all poised in tissues with ectopic activity. We use this poising signature to predict and validate in vivo ectopic forebrain activity of previously uncharacterized autism-associated non-coding variants. Our findings suggest that spatial enhancer poising, likely a byproduct of development, creates a susceptibility to non-coding mutations and offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the burden of disease-associated non-coding variants.","[{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD115268;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2. These structural predictions were based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database, together with corresponding protein sequences obtained from UniProt. We then assessed the predicted interaction structures through various confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we performed a limited evaluation against experimentally determined human protein complex structures not included in the Boltz-2 training regimen, which indicated prediction accuracy consistent with AlphaFold3. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, while highlighting both strengths and limitations. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","[{""name"":""Levy-Longenbaugh Donor-Advised Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DBI-2321666;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bj3aw27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0019749;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM157729;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

We find that the two primates and mouse share similar X chromosome expression dynamics, including X chromosome reactivation (XCR), and that in Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) testes, germ cells undergo female-like XCR and escape of X inactivation. New male-specific regulatory regions have emerged progressively during mammalian evolution, especially on the X following sex chromosome origination. Further analyses revealed that male-specific regulatory regions evolved faster than female-specific ones in both supporting and pre-meiotic germ cells. However, female meiotic germ cells show even higher rates of molecular evolution and exhibit a permissive chromatin state that facilitates the birth of new genes, thus resembling their adult spermatogenic counterparts. Finally, we traced both conserved and species-specific gene expression trajectories across the three mammals, uncovering candidate genes for disorders of sex development that are typically central to cell-type-specific regulatory networks. Together, our study unveils both ancestral mammalian and recently evolved gene regulatory programs that control human- and primate-specific aspects of gonadal development in both sexes.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""615253, OntoTransEvol;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB 873;INST 35/1503-1 FUGG;INST 35/1597-1 FUGG;""},{""name"":""Klaus Tschira Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/052jep661"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Joint MRC/Wellcome"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/R006237/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone. Because differentially prioritized variants are driven by Borzoi predictions, we leverage attribution techniques to characterize sequence features underlying fine mapping and generate mechanistic hypotheses for GWAS associations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription. Together, these findings redefine H3K4me3 as a post-transcriptional histone mark, revealing an unexpected layer of epigenetic regulation with broad implications for gene expression control.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

In unicellular bacteria, the ParMRC DNA partitioning apparatus is well known for forming actin-like filaments that push low copy number plasmids to opposite cell poles. In multicellular cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the presence of a chromosomally encoded ParMR system suggests it may play an analogous role in chromosome segregation. However, we show here that it instead constitutes a novel cytoskeletal system - termed CorMR - whose loss does not impair DNA segregation but leads to severe morphological defects, revealing a role in maintaining cell shape. Using live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that CorM forms dynamically instable filaments. These filaments are recruited to the membrane by CorR, which has acquired a conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that CorM forms antiparallel double-stranded filaments, in contrast to the polar, parallel filament pair seen in ParM. Furthermore, CorMR filaments are excluded from the cell poles and division plane by MinC, via a long N-terminal extension also specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Comparative genomics suggests that cyanobacterial multicellularity co-evolved with the chromosomal relocation of ParMR genes, acquisition of the amphipathic helix in CorR, and functional extension of MinC, supporting an evolutionary link among these features. Our findings uncover a striking repurposing of ancestral biochemical systems, expanding the known roles of ParMR and Min systems beyond plasmid segregation and division site selection to include regulation of cell shape.

ImportanceThe ParMRC system is a well-characterized machinery for the segregation of low-copy-number plasmids to the cell poles and, until now, was primarily described to be encoded on plasmids. We found that during the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, a chromosome-encoded ParMR system has undergone extensive evolutionary and functional repurposing, resulting in a previously undescribed bacterial cytoskeletal system that controls cell shape. We also found that this new cytoskeleton, called CorMR, is under the control of the MinCDE system, which has evolved to not only antagonize Z-ring formation, but also to regulate CorM polymerization. Such interplay between different cytoskeletal systems highlights an intricate regulatory mechanism linking cell division and morphology. As this repurposing of existing cytoskeletal system coincided with the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, it may have played a key role for the evolution of cyanobacteria with distinct cell shapes. Overall, our discovery highlights the plasticity of bacterial polymeric systems and gives insight into the evolution of cellular and multicellular complexity.","[{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Grant Agreement No.101034413;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ActinID, 101076260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

We identify thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that exhibit altered patterns of methylation up to 10 years before acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) diagnosis. Most of these DMRs are strongly associated with expanding clones carrying somatic driver mutations. We identify a subset of  epigenetic driver DMRs characterised by recurrent CpG alterations that are highly shared across pre-AML cases. These are likely to reflect early epigenetic reprogramming associated with AML development. We also reveal large numbers of stochastic  passenger CpGs whose differential methylation results from hitch-hiking with clonal expansions driven by somatically acquired genetic events. These passenger CpGs can be exploited for lineage tracing to discover clonal expansions driven by missing driver mutations.

Accurate perturbation response models could drastically accelerate drug discovery by reducing the space of interventions that need to be tested in the wet lab.

Here we analyzed evolutionarily unrelated signal-sequestering viral proteins, finding that they share structural and biophysical traits in their genetic organization, ternary structures and binding pocket properties. Based on these traits we developed a structure-guided computational pipeline that can sift through large phage genome databases to unbiasedly predict phage proteins that manipulate bacterial immune signaling. Numerous previously uncharacterized proteins, grouped into three families, were verified to inhibit the bacterial Thoeris and CBASS signaling systems. Proteins of the Sequestin and Lockin families bind and sequester the TIR-produced signaling molecules 3'cADPR and His-ADPR, while proteins of the Acb5 family cleave and inactivate 3'3'-cGAMP and related molecules. X-ray crystallography and structural modeling, combined with mutational analyses, explain the structural basis for sequestration or cleavage of the immune signals. Thousands of these signal-manipulating proteins were detected in phage protein databases, with some instances present in well-studied model phages such as T2, T4 and T6.

Most current methods fall at one of two extremes: either opaque deep learning models that obscure biological meaning, or simplified frameworks that treat genes as isolated units. As such, these approaches overlook a crucial insight: gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cellular states can be harnessed to model perturbation responses. Here we present CIPHER (Covariance Inference for Perturbation and High-dimensional Expression Response), a conceptual framework leveraging linear response theory from statistical physics to predict transcriptome-wide perturbation outcomes using gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cells. We validated CIPHER on synthetic regulatory networks before applying it to 11 large-scale single-cell perturbation datasets covering 4,234 perturbations and over 1.36M cells. CIPHER robustly recapitulated genome-wide responses to single and double perturbations by exploiting baseline gene covariance structure. Importantly, eliminating gene-gene covariances, while retaining gene-intrinsic variances, reduced model performance by 11-fold, demonstrating the rich information stored within baseline fluctuation structures. Moreover, gene-gene correlations transferred successfully across independent experiments of the same cell type, revealing stereotypic fluctuation structures. Furthermore, CIPHER outperformed conventional differential expression metrics in identifying true perturbations while providing uncertainty-aware effect size estimates through Bayesian inference. Finally, most genome-wide responses propagated through the covariance matrix along approximately three independent and global gene modules. CIPHER underscores the importance of theoretically-grounded models in capturing complex biological responses, highlighting fundamental design principles encoded in cellular fluctuation patterns.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DMS-2235451;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MPTMPS-00005320;""},{""name"":""NUCATS T32, Northwestern University"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ryan Fellowship, Northwestern University"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""CSB postdoc fellowship, Northwestern University"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""IVADO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Canada First Research Excellence Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM147400;""},{""name"":""Pew-Stewart Scholars Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Awards at the Scientific Interface"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

Identifying phage triggers is crucial to our understanding of immune signaling, however, they are challenging to predict. Here we used an expansive plasmid library that expressed 400 phage protein-coding genes from 6 different phages to identify novel triggers of known and undiscovered antiphage systems. We transformed our library into 72 diverse strains of E. coli. Each strain natively harbors a different suite of antiphage systems whose activation typically inhibits growth. By tracking plasmids that were selectively depleted, we identified over 100 candidate phage trigger-E. coli pairs. Two phage trigger proteins were investigated in detail, revealing a novel antiphage system that detects multiple phage tail fiber proteins and identifying major capsid protein as the activating ligand of the antiphage system Avs8. These experiments provide a unique dataset for continued definition of the molecular details of the bacterial immune system.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Pew Charitable Trusts"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02xhk2825"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Boettcher Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0277pn602"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01d35cw23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

The mechanisms that initiate endocytic actin assembly are incompletely understood. In the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, actin assembly is initiated by Dip1, an Arp2/3 activator. In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the initiation of actin assembly has remained a mystery. Here we show that S. cerevisiae Ldb17, the homolog of Dip1, functions as an on-switch for endocytic actin assembly. Unexpectedly, the regulation of Ldb17 is more complicated than that of constitutively active Dip1. Ldb17 is controlled by a coat protein, Sla1, via separate recruitment and activation steps. This regulation was likely lost in the S. pombe lineage and this simplification may be related to other changes in actin assembly between these species. Our findings add a key missing piece in the understanding of endocytosis in S. cerevisiae and reveal an intriguing evolutionary tinkering of the actin on-switch.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""212288;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

We combined chemically imposed immune activation with single-cell transcriptomics to profile ETI responses across all leaf cell types in Arabidopsis. Despite uniform ETI perception, we find striking divergence between transcriptional outputs: a core set of defense genes is broadly induced, while distinct cell types activate specialized immune modules. We infer that downstream immune execution is shaped not only by immune receptor activation, but also by cell identity and its associated transcriptional regulatory context, including local transcription factor availability and chromatin accessibility. We further demonstrate that transcriptional regulators preferentially induced in epidermal cells are required to restrict invasion by non-adapted pathogens. Their absence permits pathogen entry into deeper tissues despite intact recognition, revealing a spatial division of immune functions. Our findings uncover a layered immune architecture in plants, challenges the assumption of uniform immune execution, and provides a framework for exploring cell-type-specific resistance logic in multicellular hosts.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101039824;""},{""name"":""Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.193.104;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF-842-2015;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

SINEs retain sequence features recognized by the POL III machinery and constitute a substantial portion of vertebrate genomes. Despite their impact on genome stability and evolution, the mechanisms governing SINE transcription remain poorly understood. Although DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation have been implicated in their repression, we find these pathways play only a minor role in mouse embryonic stem cells. Instead, we identify the ChAHP complex as a key repressor of SINE B2 elements. ChAHP directly inhibits POL III transcription by blocking TFIIIB recruitment without affecting TFIIIC binding. This selective interference prevents transcription initiation and highlights a distinct regulatory mechanism. Our findings establish ChAHP as a non-canonical repressor of POL III-dependent SINE transcription, offering new insights into the control of this pervasive class of non-coding genomic elements.","[{""name"":""Novartis Research Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""n.a.;""},{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""grant 10.001.858;""},{""name"":""EMBO Postdoctoral Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 705-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078

However, the regulatory logic and specific gene networks that define cell identities remain poorly resolved across the animal tree of life. As early-branching metazoans, cnidarians can offer insights into the early evolution of cell type-specific genome regulation. Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility in 60,000 cells from whole adults and gastrula-stage embryos of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We identified 112,728 CREs and quantified their activity across cell types, revealing pervasive combinatorial enhancer usage and distinct promoter architectures. To decode the underlying regulatory grammar, we trained sequence-based models predicting CRE accessibility and used these models to infer ontogenetic relationships among cell types. By integrating sequence motifs, transcription factor expression, and CRE accessibility, we systematically reconstructed the gene regulatory networks that define cnidarian cell types. Our results reveal the regulatory complexity underlying cell differentiation in a morphologically simple animal and highlight conserved principles in animal gene regulation. This work provides a foundation for comparative regulatory genomics to understand the evolutionary emergence of animal cell type diversity.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC-StG 851647;""},{""name"":""Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PID2021-124757NB-I00;FPI Severo Ochoa PhD fellowship;""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie INTREPiD co-fund agreement 75442;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie grant agreement 101031767;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754086219078
