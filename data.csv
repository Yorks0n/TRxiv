This assumption underpins predictions about evolutionary dynamics, epistatic interactions, and the maintenance of genetic diversity in populations. Here, we systematically test this assumption using beneficial mutations from early generations of the Escherichia coli Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE). Using flow cytometry-based competition assays, we find that frequency-dependent fitness effects are the norm rather than the exception, occurring in approximately 80% of strain pairs tested. Most competitions exhibit negative frequency-dependence, where fitness advantages decline as mutant frequency increases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strength of frequency-dependence is predictable from invasion fitness measurements, with invasion fitness explaining approximately half of the biological variation in frequency-dependent slopes. Additionally, we observe violations of fitness transitivity in several strain combinations, indicating that competitive relationships cannot always be predicted from fitness relative to a single reference strain alone. Through high-resolution measurements of within-growth cycle dynamics, we show that simple resource competition explains a substantial portion of the frequency-dependence: when faster-growing genotypes dominate populations, they deplete shared resources more rapidly, reducing the time available for fitness differences to accumulate. Our results demonstrate that even in a simple model system designed to minimize ecological complexity, subtle ecological interactions between closely related genotypes create frequency-dependent selection that can fundamentally alter evolutionary dynamics.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755986854439

We leverage high-speed quantitative live imaging to extract the spectrum of possible ciliary beating patterns, and derive a dispersion relation coupling the temporal frequency and spatial wavelength of cilia oscillations. We further reconstruct the attractor manifold embedded in the behavioural space, showing that despite the range and complexity of ciliary beating modes, the underlying behavioural manifold is intrinsically low-dimensional with elaborate topological structure.

HPAI viruses readily exchange gene segments with low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses via reassortment, a mechanism that facilitates pronounced phenotypic change. Observations suggest changes in the seasonality and host range of panzootic viruses, however, data on the role of reassortment in determining such features are limited. Using phylodynamic approaches, we describe the emergence of the panzootic lineage and using a novel global genotype classification system we describe the subsequent emergence and global structuring of genotypes generated by reassortment. Focusing on evolutionary dynamics in Europe, we show reassortment has produced high fitness genotypes with enhanced capacity for transmission and further we show such advantages can be host-dependent, contrasting successful generalist genotypes with a specialist lineage (EA-2022-BB) adapted to birds of the order Charadriiformes. Experimental investigation of NS1-mediated shutoff indicates this Charadriiformes-specialist does not inhibit host cellular gene expression and hamper the defences of more typical hosts such as water- and land-fowl. We attribute this primarily to variation at position 127 of the NS1 protein. Our results emphasise that reassortment has driven phenotypic change, affected viral fitness, and caused diversification of host specificity and seasonality. Such factors should be considered in studies that seek to identify drivers of HPAI spread and map spillover risk. Additionally, relaxation of host specialisation, ecological diversification, and potential endemicity in atypical host populations present new reassortment opportunities that could result in further novel phenotypes.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X006204/1;BB/X006166/1;BB/Y007271/1;BB/Y007298/1;BB/V011286/1;""},{""name"":""BBSRC Institute Strategic Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BBS/E/RL/230002C;BBS/E/RL/230002D;BBS/E/PI/230002A;BBS/E/PI/230002B;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/Y03368X/1;""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""874735;""},{""name"":""Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00tnppw48"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SE2223;SE2230;SV3400;SV3032;SV3006;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755986854439

The latter two proteins are essential for natural transformation, whereas ComFB is dispensable. We show here that ComFB binds specifically and with high affinity to the second messenger c-di-GMP and that ComFB acts as a c-di-GMP receptor to inhibit swarming and swimming motility, apparently by interfering with flagellar activity. We show further that in the absence of ComFC, swarming is completely abrogated by a mechanism that requires FB. These results reveal a new c-di-GMP regulatory system that controls motility independently of MotI.

IMPORTANCEBacterial motility is subject to tight regulation, and the second messenger c-di-GMP is often involved in the production and activity of flagella. Revealing the mechanisms of these regulatory pathways is broadly important for understanding bacterial motility and of c-di-GMP-related processes. We show that ComFB is a specific, high-affinity receptor for c-di-GMP that decreases the activity of flagella to control swarming and swimming motility in Bacillus subtilis.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755986854439

REM sleep comprises about twenty percent of adult sleep, alternates between phasic and tonic periods, and includes delta waves (1-4Hz) in two forms: fast sawtooth waves and slower, NREM-like waves, whose expression dynamically varies across REM periods. Yet, the functional relevance of these REM sleep delta waves remains unknown. Here, using two independent cohorts, we show that aging is associated with a shift from fast sawtooth to slow NREM-like delta waves, particularly during phasic REM sleep, a period typically marked by high cortical activation. Beyond chronological age, this shift is associated with amyloid-beta and tau burden, suggesting that AD pathology disrupts REM-specific oscillatory patterns. Furthermore, this shift in REM oscillations is linked to impaired overnight memory consolidation, independent of NREM sleep quality. Moreover, variation in ApoE alleles, a major genetic risk factor for AD, was independently associated with a reduction in fast sawtooth wave density, thereby linking a genetic predisposition for AD to these specific REM microstructural changes. These findings identify a novel signature of memory decline in aging and implicate REM sleep as a distinct vulnerable substrate through which AD pathology may impair brain function.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RF1AG054106;""},{""name"":""Glenn Foundation for Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebg5q27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755986854439

Players often rely on caffeinated or sugary drinks to combat fatigue, but regular use poses health risks. Sparkling water, a sugar- and caffeine-free beverage, stimulates brainstem and prefrontal activity via sensory pathways mediated by transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in the throat. We here tested the hypothesis that sparkling water mitigates cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play. Fifteen young adult players participated in a randomized crossover trial, each completing two 3-hour sessions of a virtual football game while consuming either sparkling water or plain water. Subjective fatigue, enjoyment, and executive function (via a flanker task) were measured at baseline and hourly, while pupil diameter and heart rate were monitored continuously. Blood glucose and salivary cortisol were also assessed periodically.

Compared to plain water, sparkling water significantly attenuated increases in subjective fatigue, enhanced enjoyment, and preserved executive function, along with preventing pupil constriction. Heart rate, blood glucose, and salivary cortisol levels did not differ between conditions. Notably, players committed fewer in-game fouls with sparkling water, while offensive and defensive performance remained unchanged. These findings demonstrate that sparkling water alleviates both subjective and objective signs of cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play, supporting our hypothesis. This non-caffeinated intervention may help sustain inhibitory control and promote fair behavior, offering a safe and sustainable strategy for managing mental fatigue in modern life.

However, the evolutionary forces shaping CNV and its ecological relevance remain a key question in evolutionary biology. Here, we investigated CNV across four Brassicaceae species, Arabidopsis thaliana, A. lyrata, A. halleri, and Arabis alpina, to identify gene families undergoing rapid expansion or contraction. Using annotated proteomes and a birth-death model of gene family evolution, we identified 231 rapidly evolving gene families, enriched in functions related to regulation, information processing, multifunctional domains, and defense and stress responses. Focusing on defense- and stress-related gene families, we assessed CNV within populations of A. thaliana and A. lyrata using long-read assemblies. We identified 29 gene families exhibiting CNV both within and between species. These families showed frequent pseudogenization in roughly two-thirds of cases and functional divergence among paralogs, yet retained signatures of strong purifying selection, highlighting ecological constraint despite structural variation. Population clustering based on CNV patterns revealed distinct geographic structuring. In A. thaliana, populations from Cape Verde, Madeira, and Japan formed divergent clusters, while A. lyrata showed separation between North American, Siberian, and European populations, mirroring patterns observed from SNP data. Ecological modeling further revealed significant associations between CNV and bioclimatic variables, particularly more temperature-derived-variables than precipitation-derived-variables in A. lyrata. Additionally, unexplained CNV divergence in A. thaliana suggests additional local environmental drivers, such as edaphic conditions or biotic interactions. Our findings demonstrate that CNV in gene families that experienced rapid expansion and contraction among Arabidopsis species, contribute to local adaptation across complex environmental gradients.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""56082119;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755986854439

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755986854439

To address this relationship and to explore antibody responses against the microbiota, we isolated bacteria from duodenal biopsies and assessed antibody reactivity. Systemic IgA showed reactivity to bacteria of the upper gastrointestinal tract with a preference for binding Neisseria species, while duodenal IgA showed broader reactivity. We found limited clonal overlap between gut and bone marrow plasma cells of individual donors, yet a few shared clones specific to bacterial antigens were identified. Despite showing clonal overlap, gut and bone marrow plasma cells have distinct IgA subclass distributions, and they likely depend on B-cell activation at discrete anatomical sites.","[{""name"":""Kristian Gerhard Jebsen Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021g6tq38"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SKGJ-MED-017;""},{""name"":""Southern and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qx2s478"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022071;""},{""name"":""University of Oslo"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01xtthb56"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""WL-IMMUNOLOGY;Scientia Fellows II;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755986854439

This shift increases throughput, improves reproducibility, and expands the functional capabilities of microscopes. However, the current landscape is highly fragmented. Academic researchers often develop custom solutions for specific scientific needs, while industry offerings are typically proprietary and tied to specific hardware. This diversity, while fostering innovation, also creates major challenges in interoperability, reproducibility, and standardization, which slows progress and adaption. This article presents a collaborative effort between academic and industry leaders to survey the current state of smart microscopy, highlight representative implementations, and identify common technical and organizational barriers. We propose a framework for greater interoperability based on shared standards, modular software design, and community-driven development. Our goal is to support collaboration across the field and lay the groundwork for a more connected, reusable, and accessible smart microscopy ecosystem. We conclude with a call to action for researchers, hardware developers, and institutions to join in building an open, interoperable foundation that will unlock the full potential of smart microscopy in life science research.","[{""name"":""Uniscientia"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""187-2021;""},{""name"":""SNF Sinergia"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRSII5_183550;""},{""name"":""Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RIF-2;""},{""name"":""Swedish National Microscopy Infrastructure, NMI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VR-RFI 2023-00163;""},{""name"":""Marie Sklodowska-Curie"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Swedish Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03zttf063"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2023-05450;2019-02355;2023-02387;""},{""name"":""IngaBritt and Arne Lundberg foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Crafoord Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02hwwbr17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Seydlitz foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Magnus Bergvall foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Berta Kamprad Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Swedish Cancer Foundation (Cancerfonden)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/004hzzk67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755986854439

Yet, the diversity of major plant-associated bacteria groups like Hyphomicrobiales (Alphaproteobacteria) remain largely uncharacterized in the phyllosphere, due to limitations of 16S rRNA metabarcoding and biases in reference databases toward model taxa and environments. Using a meta-analysis combining metabarcoding, metagenomics and phylogenomics, we explored the worldwide diversity of leaf-associated Hyphomicrobiales. We confirmed Methylobacterium was ubiquitous in the phyllosphere and revealed the dominance of two under-characterized Hyphomicrobiales taxa: Lichenibacterium, a recently described genus of lichen-associated bacteria previously identified as 1174-901-12 in taxonomic databases, and RH-AL1, an undescribed genus of bacteria related to Beijerinckiaceae, previously isolated from coal slag. Despite their abundance in the phyllosphere, Lichenibacterium and RH_AL1 could not be properly detected by classical 16S rRNA gene barcoding, underlining biases in reference databases and a lack of taxonomic resolution for this marker gene. As for Methylobacterium, a significant proportion of Lichenibacterium and RH-AL1 were also detected in association with lichens and in environments with harsh conditions like exposed surfaces, air and snow, suggesting airborne or waterborne dispersal and high resilience in harsh environments. Overall our study stresses the need to move toward metagenomics and culturomics to increase the representativeness of leaf-associated bacterial taxa in reference databases, and to improve our understanding of the evolutionary and functional mechanisms underpinning bacteria adaptations to living on plants.","[{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN-2024-05825;RGPIN-2025-05608;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755986854439

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2 based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database. We assessed the predicted interaction structures through different confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we examined annotated protein domains and found that 679 of the predicted structural complexes contained a variety of domains with putative interaction involvement on the basis of interaction interface proximity. Furthermore, our analyses revealed intricate interaction networks within the context of biological function and cancer. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, highlighting both strengths and limitations, while also providing a novel view of broad functional contextualization. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","[{""name"":""Levy-Longenbaugh Donor-Advised Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DBI-2321666;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bj3aw27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0019749;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM157729;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755986854439

We identified dynamic changes in physiological aging highlighting differences in synaptic maintenance and energy-allocation. These were linked to changes associated with fundamental protein biochemical properties such as size and net charge. Network analysis highlighted a decrease in mitochondrial complex I proteins not compensated at the mRNA level.

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B “Meiosis”;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755986854439

Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour l’Education et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755986854439

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755986854439

Cryo-EM structures of SlNRC3 in AVRcap1b-bound and unbound states reveal that AVRcap1b bridges multiple protomers, stabilizing a stalled intermediate and preventing formation of a functional resistosome. Leveraging AVRcap1b as a molecular tool, we also capture an additional SlNRC3 resistosome intermediate showing that assembly proceeds in a stepwise manner from dissociated monomers. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized vulnerability in NLR activation and reveal a pathogen strategy that disrupts immune complex assembly.

ResultsA disease trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B was identified connecting DC maturation, homing and the expression of Il17-inducing genes. Disease progression was associated with numeric exhaustion of mature cDC2B and recruitment of DC precursors.{gamma}{delta} T cells were the main Il17 producers and were subtyped into Il17ahigh Scart1+ V{gamma}6+ and Il17low Scart2+ V{gamma}4+ populations exhibiting cDC2-directed communication and divergent TF regulon activity. Spatial proximity and conserved molecular interactions of cDC2 and{gamma}{delta} T cells were confirmed in human cholangitis. Il17-deficiency resulted in reduced liver fibrosis in mice, while cDC2B depletion attenuated{gamma}{delta} T17 cell states.

ConclusionsIn cholangitis, a profibrogenic function of{gamma}{delta} T cells is contingent on the induction by peribiliary cDC2B, thereby highlighting relevant disease determinants within the immunobiliary and liver-draining LN niche.

Impact and ImplicationsThe immunobiliary niche contains rare immune cells such as conventional dendritic cells and unconventional T cells, however, the function of these cell types in liver inflammation remains poorly understood. Mirroring human biliary diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, we induced experimental cholangitis in a mouse model to generate a site-specific single-cell sequencing atlas resource resolving underexplored cell populations. Our data capture a profibrotic hepatic disease state trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B inducing a{gamma}{delta} T cell-specific Il17-response, which is attenuated upon cDC2B depletion and in DC precursors, which are characterized by reduced genomic accessibility of{gamma}{delta} T cell-interacting genes.

These results highlight the importance of portal niche residing underexplored immune cell populations and the necessity to further resolve immunobiliary niche responses and crosstalk in inflammatory settings such as in cholangitis.
