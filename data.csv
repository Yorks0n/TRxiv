Two-part population-based surveys, which test the infection status and also assess symptoms, have been used to estimate{psi} . Here, we identified a widely prevalent confounding effect that compromises these estimates and devised a formalism to adjust for it. The symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are not all specific to SARS-CoV-2. They can be triggered by a host of other conditions, such as influenza virus infection. By not accounting for the source of the symptoms, the surveys may misclassify individuals experiencing symptoms from other conditions as symptomatic for SARS-CoV-2, thus underestimating{psi} . We developed a rigorous formalism to adjust for this confounding effect and derived a facile formula for the adjusted prevalence,{psi} adj. We applied it to data from 50 published serosurveys, conducted on the general populations from 28 nations. We found that{psi} adj was significantly higher than the reported prevalence,{psi} c (P=3x10-8). The median{psi} adj was [~]60%, whereas the median{psi} c was [~]40%.

Our formalism can be readily deployed to obtain more accurate estimates of{psi} from standard population-based surveys, without additional data collection. The findings have implications for understanding COVID-19 epidemiology and devising more effective interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1726351575706

Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects.

As the foundation for lifelong mental health is established during childhood and adolescence, early prevention and treatment of mental health problems, such as through psychotherapy, are crucial. In Germany, current outpatient psychotherapeutic care capacities appear inadequate, while systematic evaluations of the care situation are lacking. This study investigates the state of statutory health insurance-funded outpatient psychotherapeutic care for children and adolescents in Germany and evaluates various methodological approaches for its assessment. We conducted a scoping review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Publications from January 2018 to December 2023 were sourced from PubPsych, PubMed, APA PsycInfo, Google Scholar, and ProQuest. Included studies reported quantitative primary data on the mental health of community samples of children and adolescents in Germany or their outpatient psychotherapeutic care. We included 41 publications comprising epidemiological studies, administrative data, and psychotherapist and patient reports. A lack of systematic and standardized research approaches resulted in significant variance in data. Nonetheless, qualitative analysis revealed that approximately one four children and adolescents in Germany is affected by mental health problems, while one in six to seven children and adolescents requires psychotherapeutic treatment. Yet, only up to one in fifty receives guideline-based psychotherapy. Most requests for initial psychotherapeutic consultations are unmet, with waiting times for guideline-based psychotherapy exceeding six months for at least half of the patients. Overall, our findings suggest that outpatient psychotherapeutic care for children and adolescents in Germany is still insufficient. They advocate for a systematic, multimodal, and longitudinal assessment of statutory health insurance-funded outpatient psychotherapeutic care, along with an expansion of treatment capacities to enhance access for children and adolescents in Germany.","NA","medrxiv",1726351575706

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1726351575706

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

While TET2 inactivation is associated with monocyte-derived inflammation and improved chimeric antigen-receptor-T cell function, its impact on immunotherapy response is unknown. In our mouse model, hematopoietic Tet2 mutation enhanced immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response. Enhanced ICB response with Tet2 mutation required phagocytes, CD4 and CD8 T cells. Mechanistically, in Tet2-mutant tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs), ICB preferentially induced anti-tumor states and restricted cell states linked to tumor progression. Tet2-mutant monocytes activated costimulatory programs, while Tet2-mutant T cells showed enhanced T cell memory signatures, lesser exhaustion and decreased regulatory phenotype. Our murine data was clinically relevant, since we found that melanomas from patients with TET2 driver mutation-CH (TET2-CH) showed enhanced immune infiltration, T cell activation, and T cell memory programs. In melanoma patients treated with ICB, TET2-CH was associated with 6-fold greater odds of clinical benefit. Collectively, our data establishes that hematopoietic Tet2 inactivation primes leukocytes for anti-tumor states associated with immunotherapy response and provides a potential biomarker for personalized therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1726351575706

In particular, clustering remains one of the most common tools to dissect the chemical space. Unfortunately, most current approaches present unfavorable time and memory scaling, which makes them unsuitable to handle million- and billion-sized sets. Here, we propose to bypass these problems with a time- and memory-efficient clustering algorithm, BitBIRCH. This method uses a tree structure similar to the one found in the Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies (BIRCH) algorithm to ensure O(N) time scaling. BitBIRCH leverages the instant similarity (iSIM) formalism to process binary fingerprints, allowing the use of Tanimoto similarity, and reducing memory requirements. Our tests show that BitBIRCH is already > 1,000 times faster than standard implementations of the Taylor-Butina clustering for libraries with 1,500,000 molecules. BitBIRCH increases efficiency without compromising the quality of the resulting clusters. We explore strategies to handle large sets, which we applied in the clustering of one billion molecules under 5 hours using a parallel/iterative BitBIRCH approximation.","NA","biorxiv",1726351575706

In these patients, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is immunomodulatory, however increased infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs) may limit the antitumor immune effects of ADT. We designed a neoadjuvant clinical trial to test whether BMS-986218 - a next-generation non-fucosylated anti-CTLA-4 antibody engineered for enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis (ADCC/P) - depletes intratumoral Tregs and augments the response to ADT. In this single-center, two-arm, open-label study, 24 men with high-risk localized prostate cancer were randomized to receive a single dose of ADT with or without two pre-operative doses of BMS-986218 (anti-CTLA4-NF) prior to radical prostatectomy. Treatment was well tolerated and feasible in the neoadjuvant setting. A secondary clinical outcome was the rate of disease recurrence, which was lower than predicted in both arms. Mechanistically, anti-CTLA4-NF reduced ADT-induced Treg accumulation through engagement of CD16a/FCGR3A on tumor macrophages, and depth of Treg depletion was quantitatively associated with clinical outcome. Increased intratumoral dendritic cell (DC) frequencies also associated with lack of recurrence, and pre-clinical data suggest ADCC/P-competent anti-CTLA-4 antibodies elicit activation and expansion of tumor DCs. Patients receiving anti-CTLA4-NF also exhibited phenotypic signatures of enhanced antitumor T cell priming. In total, this study provides the first-in-human evidence of Treg depletion by glycoengineered antibodies targeting CTLA-4 in humans and their potential in combination with ADT in prostate cancer patients with high-risk of recurrence.","NA","medrxiv",1726351575706

Presently, brain tumours are routinely classified based on their epigenetic signatures, leading to a paradigm shift in diagnostic pathways. Such testing can be performed so rapidly using nanopore sequencing that results can be provided intraoperatively. This information greatly improves upon the fidelity of smear diagnosis and can help surgeons tailor their approach, balancing the risks of surgery with the likely benefit. Nevertheless, full integrated diagnosis may require subsequent additional assays to detect pathognomonic somatic mutations and structural variants, thereby delaying the time to final diagnosis.

MethodsHere, we present ROBIN, a tool based upon PromethION nanopore sequencing technology that can provide both real-time, intraoperative methylome classification and next-day comprehensive molecular profiling within a single assay. ROBIN uniquely integrates three methylation classifiers 1-3 to improve diagnostic performance in the intraoperative setting.

FindingsWe demonstrate classifier performance on 50 prospective intraoperative cases, achieving a diagnostic turnaround time under 2 hours and generating robust tumour classifications within minutes of sequencing. Furthermore, ROBIN can detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variants (CNVs) and structural variants (SVs) in real-time, and is able to inform a complete integrated diagnosis within 24 hours. Classifier performance demonstrated concordance with final integrated diagnosis in 90% of prospective cases.

InterpretationNanopore sequencing can greatly improve upon the turnaround times for standard of care diagnostic testing, including sequencing, and is furthermore able to reliably provide clinically actionable intraoperative tumour classification.

Therefore, there is a need to quantify any damage that microelectrodes sustain when they are chronically implanted in the human cortex.

MethodsUsing scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we imaged 980 microelectrodes from Neuroport arrays chronically implanted in the cortex of three people with tetraplegia for 956-2246 days. We analyzed eleven multi-electrode arrays in total: eight arrays with platinum (Pt) electrode tips and three with sputtered iridium oxide tips (SIROF); one Pt array was left in sterile packaging, serving as a control. The arrays were implanted/explanted across three different clinical sites surgeries (Caltech/UCLA, Caltech/USC and APL/Johns Hopkins) in the anterior intraparietal area, Brodmanns area 5, motor cortex, and somatosensory cortex.

Human experts rated the electron micrographs of electrodes with respect to five damage metrics: the loss of metal at the electrode tip, the amount of separation between the silicon shank and tip metal, tissue adherence or bio-material to the electrode, damage to the shank insulation and silicone shaft. These metrics were compared to functional outcomes (recording quality, noise, impedance and stimulation ability).

ResultsDespite higher levels of physical degradation, SIROF electrodes were twice as likely to record neural activity than Pt electrodes (measured by SNR), at the time of explant. Additionally, 1 kHz impedance (measured in vivo prior to explant) significantly correlated with all physical damage metrics, recording, and stimulation performance for SIROF electrodes (but not Pt), suggesting a reliable measurement of in vivo degradation.

We observed a new degradation type, primarily occurring on stimulated electrodes (""pockmarked"" vs ""cracked"") electrodes; however, tip metalization damage was not significantly higher due to stimulation or amount of charge. Physical damage was centralized to specific regions of an array often with differences between outer and inner electrodes. This is consistent with degradation due to contact with the biologic milieu, influenced by variations in initial manufactured state. From our data, we hypothesize that erosion of the silicon shank often precedes damage to the tip metal, accelerating damage to the electrode / tissue interface.

ConclusionsThese findings link quantitative measurements, such as impedance, to the physical condition of the microelectrodes and their capacity to record and stimulate. These data could lead to improved manufacturing or novel electrode designs to improve long-term performance of BMIs making them are vitally important as multi-year clinical trials of BMIs are becoming more common.","NA","medrxiv",1726351575706

We address this central issue by investigating the RNA binding activity of the Drosophila Hox TF Ultrabithorax (Ubx) in alternative splicing and morphogenesis. Relying on molecular and genetic interactions, we uncover a homodimerization-dependent mechanism by which Ubx regulates splicing. Notably, this mechanism enables the decoupling of Ubx-DNA and -RNA binding activity in splicing. We identify a critical residue for Ubx-RNA binding and demonstrate the essential role of Ubx-RNA binding ability for its homeotic functions. Overall, we uncover a unique mechanism for Ubx-mediated splicing and underscore the critical contribution of synergistic DNA/RNA binding for its morphogenetic functions. These findings advance our understanding of co-transcriptional regulation and highlight the significance of TF-DNA/RNA synergistic function in shaping gene regulatory networks in living organisms.

GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA), predominantly in use as a type 2 diabetes treatment, are a promising pharmacological approach for weight loss, while bariatric surgery (BS) remains a durable, but invasive, intervention. Despite observed heterogeneity in weight loss effects, the genetic effects on weight loss from GLP1-RA and BS have not been extensively explored in large sample sizes, and most studies have focused on differences in race and ethnicity, rather than genetic ancestry. We studied whether genetic factors, previously shown to affect body weight, impact weight loss due to GLP1-RA therapy or BS in 10,960 individuals from 9 multi-ancestry biobank studies in 6 countries. The average weight change between 6 and 12 months from therapy initiation was -3.93% for GLP1-RA users, with marginal differences across genetic ancestries. For BS patients the weight change between 6 and 48 months from the operation was -21.17%. There were no significant associations between weight loss due to GLP1-RA and polygenic scores for BMI or type 2 diabetes or specific missense variants in the GLP1R, PCSK1 and APOE genes, after multiple-testing correction. However, a higher polygenic score for BMI was significantly linked to lower weight loss after BS (+0.7% for 1 standard deviation change in the polygenic score, P = 1.24x10-4). In contrast, higher weight at baseline was associated with greater weight loss. Our findings suggest that existing polygenic scores related to weight and type 2 diabetes and missense variants in the drug target gene do not have a large impact on GLP1-RA effectiveness. Our results also confirm the effectiveness of these treatments across all major continental ancestry groups considered.","NA","medrxiv",1726351575706

Lacking recent comprehensive reviews, the field of Hill-type modelling is however dense and hard-to-explore, with detrimental consequences on innovation. Here we present the first systematic review of Hill-type muscle modelling. It aims to clarify the literature by detailing its contents and critically discussing the state-of-the-art by identifying the latest advances, current gaps, and potential future directions in Hill-type modelling. For this purpose, fifty-seven criteria-abiding Hill-type models were assessed according to a completeness evaluation, which identified the modelled muscle properties, and a modelling evaluation, which considered the level of validation and reusability of the models, as well as their modelling strategy and calibration. It is concluded that most models (1) do not significantly advance beyond historical gold standards, (2) neglect the importance of parameter identification, (3) lack robust validation, and (4) are not reusable in other studies. Besides providing a convenient tool supported by extensive supplementary material for navigating the literature, the results of this review highlight the need for global recommendations in Hill-type modelling to optimize inter-study consistency, knowledge transfer and model reusability.","NA","biorxiv",1726351575706

MR relies on a set of assumptions to obtain unbiased effect estimates, one of these assumptions is that there is no pathway from the genetic variants to the outcome that does not act through the exposure. Increasing genome-wide association study (GWAS) sample sizes for the exposure enables discovery of instrumental variables with smaller effect sizes. We illustrate through simulations how smaller effect sizes could arise from genetic variants that act through traits that have greater liability to confound an exposure-outcome relationship. When such genetic variants are selected as instruments this can bias the MR effect estimate obtained from that instrument in the same direction as the confounded observational association but with larger magnitude. Through simulation we illustrate how the total bias of the MR estimates increases across a range of standard MR estimation methods increases as the proportion of the genetic instruments that are associated with the confounder increases. However, if such heritable confounders are known and can be instrumented, the confounder free effect estimate can be obtained through applying a pre-estimation filtering to standard MR methods, removing instruments that explain more variation in that confounder than the exposure, or by estimating effects through multivariable MR. We highlight the potential for SNPs identified in GWAS to be associated with potential confounders through examination of a recent GWAS of C-Reactive Protein. Finally, we illustrate our approach through estimation of the causal effect of age at menarche on type 2 diabetes, hypothesising that the MR effect estimate may be biased by confounding due to the inclusion of genetic variants associated with early life adiposity as instruments.","NA","medrxiv",1726351575706

Here, we define the INV proteome and find that it is molecularly heterogeneous, and enriched for transmembrane cargo molecules including integrins, transporters, and ATG9A, a lipid scramblase associated with autophagy. ATG9A is known to reside in  ATG9 vesicles: small vesicles that contribute to autophagosome formation.

First, fai allows the identification of orthologous instances of a query gene cluster of interest amongst a database of target genomes. Subsequently, zol enables reliable, context-specific inference of ortholog groups for individual protein-encoding genes across gene cluster instances. In addition, zol performs functional annotation and computes a variety of evolutionary statistics for each inferred ortholog group. Importantly, in comparison to tools for visual exploration of homologous relationships between gene clusters, zol can scale to thousands of gene cluster instances and produce detailed reports that are easy to digest. To showcase fai and zol, we apply them for: (i) longitudinal tracking of a virus in metagenomes, (ii) discovering novel population-level genetic insights of two common BGCs in the fungal species Aspergillus flavus, and (iii) uncovering large-scale evolutionary trends of a virulence-associated gene cluster across thousands of genomes from a diverse bacterial genus.","NA","biorxiv",1726351575706

Even when accounting for PBC effects, the corrected lipid diffusion coefficients often severely overshoot the experimental estimates. Here, we investigate the underlying reasons for the exaggerated dynamics, and suggest potential ways for improvement. To this end, we examine the diffusion of four lipid types in both bilayers and monolayers using the CHARMM36 force field. We account for PBC effects using the full hydrodynamic treatment: for bilayers we use non-equilibrium simulations to extract the interleaflet friction parameter used in the correction; whereas monolayer hydrodynamics are treated by setting this parameter to zero. Our results suggest that the dynamics of bilayers are too fast, even if interleaflet friction is accounted for. However, the change of the water model to OPC leads to an excellent agreement with experiments. For monolayers, the dynamics with the TIP3P water model agree well with experiments, whereas they are undershot with OPC. As OPC and TIP3P differ in both shear viscosity and surface tension, we develop two new mass-scaled water models to clarify the roles of the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the water model on lipid dynamics. Our results indicate that both of these quantities play a major role in lipid dynamics. Moreover, it seems that the accurate description of diffusion in both lipid bilayers and monolayers cannot be accounted for by changes in the water model alone, but likely also requires modifications in the lipid model.","NA","biorxiv",1726351575706

These predictions are commonly performed using polygenic scores computed with DNA information from ancient humans along with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from present-day humans. However, numerous evolutionary processes could impact the prediction of phenotypes from ancient humans based on polygenic scores. In this work we investigate how natural selection impacts phenotypic predictions on ancient individuals using polygenic scores. We use simulations of an additive trait to analyze how natural selection impacts phenotypic predictions with polygenic scores. We simulate a trait evolving under neutrality, stabilizing selection and directional selection. We find that stabilizing and directional selection have contrasting effects on ancient phenotypic predictions. Stabilizing selection accelerates the loss of large-effect alleles contributing to trait variation. Conversely, directional selection accelerates the loss of small and large-effect alleles that drive individuals farther away from the optimal phenotypic value. These effects result in specific shared genetic variation patterns between ancient and modern populations which hamper the accuracy of polygenic scores to predict phenotypes. Furthermore, we conducted simulations that include realistic strengths of stabilizing selection and heritability estimates to show how natural selection could impact the predictive accuracy of ancient polygenic scores for two widely studied traits: height and body mass index. We emphasize the importance of considering how natural selection can decrease the reliability of ancient polygenic scores to perform phenotypic predictions on an ancient population.","NA","biorxiv",1726351575706

In this context, concepts of symmetry and symmetry-breaking in distinct biological cell features or components have been examined as an approach to cancer investigation. However, there can be possible limitations in directly interpreting the symmetry-based approach from a physical viewpoint due to the lack of understanding of physical laws governing symmetry in complex systems like cancer.

MethodsFractal geometry and DNA walk representation were employed to investigate the geometric features i.e., self-similarity and heterogeneity in DNA nucleotide coding sequences of wild-type and mutated oncogenes, tumour-suppressor, and other unclassified genes. The mutation-facilitated self-similar and heterogenous features were quantified by the fractal dimension and lacunarity coefficient measures, respectively. Additionally, the geometrical orderedness and disorderedness in the analyzed sequences were interpreted from the combination of the fractal measures.

ResultsThe findings showed distinct fractal geometric features in the case of fusion mutations. It also highlights the possible interpretation of the observed fractal features as geometric analogues concerning explicit observations corresponding to specific cancer types. In addition, the two-dimensional multi-fractal analysis highlighted the presence of a single exponent in the scaling of mutation-mediated gene sequence self-similarity/complexity and heterogeneity.

ConclusionsThe approach identified mutation-induced geometric features in gene sequences, demonstrating the potential of DNA walks and fractal analysis in translational research regarding cancer. The findings suggest that investigating fractal parameters can capture unique geometric features in nucleotide sequences, contributing to the understanding of cancers molecular complexity.","NA","biorxiv",1726351575706

We furthermore establish that multiple chemical stimuli that perturb lysosomal homeostasis also converge on CASM to activate LRRK2. Although CASM results in the lipidation of multiple ATG8 protein family members, we establish that LRRK2 lysosome recruitment and kinase activation is highly dependent on interactions with the GABARAP member of this family.

Even when effective vaccines became available, many communities remained at high risk of surges in COVID-19-related hospitalizations due to waning immunity, low uptake of booster vaccinations, and the continual emergence of new variations of SARS-CoV-2. Some risk metrics, such as the CDC's Community Levels, were developed to predict the impact of COVID-19 on the community-level healthcare system based on routine surveillance data. However, they had limited utility as they were not routinely updated based on accumulating data and were not directly linked to specific outcomes, such as surges in COVID-19 hospitalizations beyond local capacities. Regression models could resolve these limitations, but they have limited interpretability and do not convey the reasoning behind their predictions. In this paper, we evaluated decision tree classifiers that were developed in ""real-time"" to predict surges in local hospitalizations due to COVID-19 between July 2020 and November 2022. These classifiers would have provided visually intuitive and interpretable decision rules for local decision-makers to understand and act upon, and by being updated weekly, would have responded to changes in the epidemic. We showed that these classifiers exhibit reasonable predictive ability with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) >80%. These classifiers maintained their performance temporally (i.e, over the duration of the pandemic) and spatially (i.e., across US counties).

This report explores the prevalence of these viruses in Iran through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: The present survey was performed with a systematic review and meta-analysis method on the seroprevalence of WNV, CHIKV, and DENV using the ELISA test. Based on this, by search in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, and Google Scholar scientific databases, all relevant published papers were sorted out and reviewed. Power ratification of data was carried out with a random effects model in meta-analysis, meta-regression, I2 index, and Egger test. Results: Twelve published papers between 2000 and 2024 were embodied in this meta-analysis report. The seroprevalence of positive ELISA test for WNV in Iran was estimated at 12.9% (CI=95%: 7.4-18.4), and for CHIKV at 6.2% (CI=95%: 0.6-11.8). Regarding DENV, only two studies were conducted with a zero prevalence in one study, and a seroprevalence of 5.6% in another study. Conclusion: According to these data, WNV, CHIKV, and DENV fevers have been detected in Iran using ELISA test. Considering the seropositivity of WNV and CHIKV, and the finding of these viruses from several provinces, it could be for granted that these two viruses are ubiquitous and DENV fever is sporadic in Iran.

DesignRetrospective cross-sectional study.

Participants5,351 patients (9,564 eyes) who underwent macular OCT imaging and Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) tests (24-2 or 10-2 test patterns) at a university hospital from 2006 to 2023. The dataset included 47,653 paired OCT-VF data points, including various ocular conditions.

MethodsWe trained a segmentation-free 3DCNN model based on the EfficientNet3D-b0 architecture on a comprehensive OCT dataset to estimate VF. We evaluated the models performance using Pearsons correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. We assessed residual variability using a jackknife resampling approach and compared OCT-VF and HFA datasets using generalized estimating equations (GEE), adjusting the number of VF tests, follow-up duration, age, and clustering by eye and patient.

Main Outcome MeasuresCorrelations between estimated and measured VF thresholds and mean deviations (MDs), and residual variability of OCT-VF and HFA.

ResultsWe observed strong correlations between the estimated and measured VF parameters (Pearsons r: 24-2 thresholds 0.893, MD 0.932; 10-2 thresholds 0.902, MD 0.945; all p < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between the estimated and measured MD, with a slight proportional bias. GEE analysis demonstrated significantly lower residual variability for OCT-VF than for HFA (24-2 thresholds: 1.10 vs. 2.48 dB; 10-2 thresholds: 1.20 vs. 2.48 dB; all p < 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected), with lower variability across all test points, severities, and ages, thus highlighting the robustness of the segmentation-free 3DCNN approach in a heterogeneous clinical sample.

ConclusionsA segmentation-free 3DCNN model objectively estimated VF from OCT images with high accuracy and significantly lower residual variability than subjective HFA measurements in a heterogeneous clinical sample, including patients with glaucoma and individuals with other ocular diseases. The improved reliability, lower variability, and objective nature of OCT-VF highlight its value for enhancing VF assessment and monitoring of various ocular conditions, potentially facilitating earlier detection of progression and more efficient disease management.","NA","medrxiv",1726351575706

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of COVID-19 articles that had corrections made and reported in the NYT ""corrections page"". We categorized authors in a NYT COVID-19 article as a NYT reporter, NYT other, or independent author. We calculated the number and type of corrections by author type (NYT reporter, NYT other, and independent author) and number and percentage of corrections indicating an over- or under-statement of the COVID-19 situation.

ResultsThere were 576 total corrections for the included 486 articles. Forty-three percent (n=245) corrections specifically pertained to COVID-19. Compared to corrections not pertaining to COVID-19, corrections pertaining to COVID-19 were less likely to be about spelling (0% vs 23.6%), locations (1.2% vs 16.3%), or title/degree (0% vs 10.6%), and more likely to be about a vaccine/vaccination (21.2% vs 0.3%), incidence/cases of conditions (12.2% vs 0.3%), or disease testing (7.8% vs 0.3%; p<0.001).

Compared to corrections not pertaining to COVID-19, corrections pertaining to COVID-19 were less likely to result in an equivocal tone (16.7% vs 88.8%), but they were more likely to both overstate (54.7% vs 8.5%) and understate (23.7% vs 2.4%) the situation in the original text (p<0.001). Ten reporters (of 346) accounted for 24% of the corrections. The reporter with the single most corrections accounted for 7% of the corrections.

The fossil, known on the basis of two specimens, has been historically assigned to seamoths (Pegasidae), then to oarfish and relatives (Lampriformes). We describe its enigmatic skeletal anatomy in detail, and provide a new genus name. ""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1726351575706

However, it is not well understood which mechanisms are driving changes in reward sensitivity, specifically regarding food. Here, we used a sample of 117 participants (54 patients with MDD; 63 healthy control participants, HCP) who completed a food cue reactivity (FCR) task with ratings of wanting and liking for 60 food and 20 non-food items. To evaluate which components of the food may contribute to altered ratings in depression, we tested for associations with macronutrients of the depicted items. In line with previous studies, we found reduced ratings of food wanting (p = .003), but not liking (p = .23) in patients with MDD compared to matched HCPs. Adding macronutrient composition to the models of wanting and liking substantially improved their fit (ps < .001). Compared to carbohydrate-rich foods, patients with MDD reported lower liking and wanting ratings for high-fat and high-protein foods. Moreover, patients with MDD showed weaker correlations in their preferences for carbohydrate-versus fat- or protein-rich foods (ps < .001), pointing to potential disturbances in metabolic signaling. To conclude, our results suggest that depression-related alterations in food reward ratings are more specific to the macronutrient composition of the food than previously anticipated, hinting at disturbances in gut-brain signaling. These findings raise the intriguing question whether interventions targeting the gut could help normalize aberrant reward signals for foods rich in fat or protein.

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1726351575707

DWV infects bees at all life stages, but is most noticeable in adult bees, where clinical symptoms include shriveled, non-functional wings, and a drastically shortened lifespan. DWV is recorded in upwards of 90% of honey bee colonies worldwide, and has been linked to colony loss in symptomatic hives. DWV is primarily spread by Varroa destructor mites, who feed on the fat bodies of honey bee adults and pupae. There is currently no direct treatment or preventative for DWV, with the primary method of reduction being vector control using acaracides. In this study, we tested the effect that vaccinating honey bee queens using killed Paenibacillus larvae bacterin, the causative agent of the honey bee disease American Foulbrood, had on deformed wing virus load in honey bee colonies. We placed vaccinated queens in 200 honey bee colonies, and unvaccinated queens in 200 colonies, and measured quantities of DWV-B in both groups immediately before, and 4 months after vaccination. We found that levels of DWV-B were identical before vaccination, but were significantly reduced in colonies 4 months post vaccination. This change was found despite no difference in mite quantities between groups. Overall, these data provide evidence that vaccination of queens with P. larvae bacterin is an effective method for reduction of DWV-B quantities in honey bee colonies in a commercially relevant field setting.","NA","biorxiv",1726351575707

The rapid evolution of H5 HPAIVs continues to raise concern with heightened zoonotic and pandemic risks. The immunodominant haemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA) is crucial for influenza virus receptor binding and pH-induced fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Mutations in HA are frequent due to polymerase error, immune pressure and host adaptation, resulting in antigenic modulation and/or an expansion of host tropism, respectively, ultimately hindering control strategies. We evaluated a comprehensive panel of H5 viruses representing prevalent genotypes from UK outbreaks spanning 2020 to 2022 for HA functionality. HA genes from each genotype were assessed through receptor binding, pH of fusion, thermostability and HA inhibition assays to evaluate factors contributing to zoonotic potential, stability, and antigenicity. The viruses only bound to avian receptors and exhibited fusion at a pH of 5.8, above the pH range (pH 5.0 to 5.5) associated with efficient human-to-human transmission. Therefore, these H5 viruses have low immediate zoonotic threat. Contemporary H5 viruses were more thermostable and showed antigenic drift compared to the earlier 2017-2018 clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 viruses, and N236D in HA was identified as a significant antigenic epitope. The findings of this study underscore the evolving nature of the HA of these viruses and highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance and characterisation efforts to identify factors that might contribute to zoonotic risk.","NA","biorxiv",1726351575707

ME diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME patients low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1726351575707

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1726351575707

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1726351575707

As IP occurs only in recall immune responses, we investigated the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of unvaccinated individual to determine whether their immune response aligned with the primary or recall immune response patterns.

Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases. The levels of antibodies correlated positively with the severity of the condition rather than a milder course. High-resolution flow cytometry of fresh PBMNCs showed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cell subsets, and cTfh, suggesting a recall response. The transcriptomic profile demonstrated that this group was directly comparable to other contemporary cohorts. Overall, these findings support the idea that the response to SARS-CoV-2 is, in most cases, a recall response, likely due to B and T memory cells to CCCV, and therefore susceptible to immune imprinting and antibody-dependent enhancement.","NA","medrxiv",1726351575707
