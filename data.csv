ObjectiveTo estimate the impacts of federal policy changes on PrEP coverage, new HIV infections and costs associated with new HIV infections

DesignEstimation of excess HIV infections under different policy impacts were conducted using parameters from a previously published ecological model of the relationship between PrEP coverage and new HIV infections. Costs were estimated for the treatment of infections not averted under different scenarios.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsThere was no individual participation in research activities; population-based data sources were used to describe the population-level PrEP use and new diagnoses under different hypothetical changes in PrEP coverage.

ExposuresPercent of people with indications for PrEP who are taking PrEP

Main Outcome and MeasuresEstimated change in new HIV infections under different assumptions of change in PrEP coverage; costs of treatment for avoidable HIV infections and net costs of avoidable infections after accounting for costs of PrEP medications.

ResultsEven modest reductions in PrEP coverage would result in thousands of avoidable HIV infections. An absolute 3.3% annual reduction in PrEP coverage over the next decade would result in 8,618 avoidable HIV infections, with lifetime medical costs of over $3.6 billion (discounted) for treatment of the unaverted HIV infections.

Conclusions and RelevanceChanges in policy that reduce PrEP uptake would result in avoidable HIV infections and increased costs for HIV treatment. Maintaining policies and programs that support PrEP uptake offers benefits for health and is estimated to result in net cost savings.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the likely impacts on HIV transmissions and healthcare costs if policy changes result in decreased PrEP utilization in the United States?

FindingsUnder assumptions of even modest reductions in PrEP use, we estimated thousands of HIV infections would fail to be averted over the next decade, and billions of dollars of additional treatment costs would accrue to the healthcare system.

Results of the studyWe used historical descriptive data on the US HIV epidemic to quantify the relationship between PrEP coverage and trends in HIV diagnoses and to estimate future trends in HIV infections if PrEP coverage were to be rolled back. If PrEP use declines modestly - about 3% annually - we estimate that 8,618 new infections would fail to be averted in a decade because of lowered PrEP uptake, and the estimated lifetime medical costs of these unaverted infections would be $3.6 billion (discounted) and $9.3 billion (undiscounted).

MeaningChanges in healthcare priorities and policies, especially those that increase out of pocket costs of PrEP or reduce the convenience of engaging in PrEP care, risk rolling back our progress in ending the HIV epidemic, accruing avertable HIV infections, and incurring increased costs for medical care of people whose HIV infections were avoidable.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527962

During the tumult of war they are, however, challenging to obtain due to the conflicts themselves. The Gaza Ministry of Health (GMoH) has provided regular updates to their post-October-7 violent death tally for the Gaza Strip. However, GMoH reports have attracted both criticism and support. Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures. Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods. We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527962

However, the seasonality of COVID-19 remains in dispute, with significant waves of cases across the United States occurring in both winter and summer. Using wavelet analysis of COVID-19 cases, we find that the periodicity of epidemic COVID-19 varies markedly across the U.S. and correlates with winter temperatures, indicating seasonal forcing. However, seasonal forcing alone cannot explain the pattern of multiple waves per year that has been so disruptive and unique to COVID-19. Using a modified SIRS model that allows specification of the tempo of waning immunity, we show that specific forms of non-durable immunity can sufficiently explain the sub-annual waves characteristic of the COVID-19 epidemic.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527962

Furthermore, we found evidence that music listening experience predicted agreement with animals. These results are consistent with theories arguing that biases in sensory and cognitive processing sculpt acoustic preferences and confirm Darwin's century-old hunch about the conservation of aesthetics and beauty in nature.","NA","biorxiv",1751148527962

We reconstructed 972 cells, including syncytial neurons that form a nerve net. The syncytial neurons synapse on the balancer cells and also form reciprocal connection with the bridge cells that span the statocyst. High-speed imaging revealed that balancer cilia beat and arrest in a coordinated manner but with differences between the sagittal and tentacular planes of the animal, reflecting nerve-net organisation.

Discrepancies between these predictions and actual inputs, sensory prediction errors, guide perceptual inference. A fundamental yet largely unresolved question is which stimulus features the brain predicts, and therefore, what kind of surprise drives neural responses. Here, we investigated this question using EEG and computational modelling based on deep neural networks (DNNs). Participants viewed object images whose identity was probabilistically predicted by preceding cues. We then quantified trial-by-trial surprise at both low-level (early DNN layers) and high-level (late DNN layers) visual feature representations. Results showed that stimulus-evoked responses around 200ms post-stimulus onset over parieto-occipital electrodes were increased by high-level, but not by low-level visual surprise. These findings demonstrate that high-level visual predictions are rapidly integrated into perceptual inference, suggesting that the brains predictive machinery is finely tuned to utilize expectations abstracted away from low-level sensory details to facilitate perception.","NA","biorxiv",1751148527962

Its importance is reflected by the severe, congenital LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2 MD) caused by loss-of-function mutations in the LAMA2 gene. While laminin-2 has an established role in structurally supporting muscle fibers, it remains unclear whether it exerts additional functions that contribute to the maintenance of skeletal muscle integrity. Here, we report that in healthy muscle, activated muscle stem cells (MuSCs) express Lama2 and remodel their microenvironment with laminin-2. By characterizing LAMA2 MD-afflicted MuSCs and inducing MuSC-specific Lama2 knockouts, we show that MuSC-derived laminin-2 is essential for rapid MuSC expansion and regeneration. In humans, we identify LAMA2 expression in MuSCs and demonstrate that loss-of-function mutations impair the cell-cycle progression of myogenic precursors. In summary, we show that self-secreted laminin-2 supports MuSC proliferation post-injury, thus implicating MuSC dysfunction in LAMA2 MD pathology.","NA","biorxiv",1751148527962

However, research on the performance of Elicit is limited. Objectives: To determine whether Elicit AI is a viable tool for systematic literature searches. Methods: We compared the included studies in four systematic reviews to those identified searching with Elicit. We calculated sensitivity, precision and observed patterns in the performance of Elicit. Results: Elicit had an average of 39.6% precision (26.7% - 46.2%) which was higher than the 7.55% average of the original reviews (0.65% - 14.7%). However, the sensitivity of Elicit was poor, averaging 37.9% (25.5% - 69.2%) compared to 93.5% (87.2% - 98.0%) in the original reviews. Elicit also identified some included studies not identified by the original searches. Discussion: At the time of this evaluation, Elicit did not search with high enough sensitivity to replace traditional literature searching. However, the high precision of searching in Elicit could prove useful for preliminary searches, and the unique studies identified mean that Elicit can be used by researchers as a useful adjunct. Conclusion: Whilst Elicit searches are currently not sensitive enough to replace traditional searching, Elicit is continually improving, and further evaluations should be undertaken as new developments take place.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527962

ObjectivesTo evaluate IgG/IgA/IgM responses targeting the enteric nerve and non-myelin antigens in RRMS and investigate associations with EBV and HHV-6 markers and explore molecular mimicry between viral and host antigens.

MethodsThe study included 55 RRMS patients and 63 matched healthy controls. ELISA is used to examine IgG/IgA/IgM levels against nine non-myelin self-epitopes and viral proteins (EBNA-1, dUTPases of EBV and HHV-6). Luminex immunoassay is used to quantify cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Disability was evaluated using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS). In-silico molecular mimicry was analyzed using UniProt, AlphaFold, PyMol, Alignmentaj, and the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), comparing 41 viral and 36 ENS non-myelin antigens.

ResultsIgG/IgA/IgM levels targeting the enteric nerve and non-myelin antigens were significantly higher in RRMS than in controls. A large part of the variance in the EDSS and MSSS scores (>60%) was explained by IgG-chondroitin sulfate, IgM-Asialo-ganglioside, and IgG-enteric nerve. There were highly significant correlations between autoimmunity to those self-antigens and either immune profiles indicating immune activation or Ig-responses to EBNA-1, and EBV/HHV-6 DUTPases. Molecular mimicry analysis confirmed the association between EBV/HHV-6 and the self-antigens by identifying shared pentapeptides, which might cause T-cell immunogenicity.

ConclusionRRMS is characterized by autoimmune responses targeting the enteric nerve and non-myelin proteins. EBV and HHV-6 reactivation contribute via molecular mimicry mechanisms.

An infectious etiology is strongly suspected, but no causative microorganism has yet been identified. We therefore conducted an age- and sex-matched case-control culturomics study to isolate bacterial species associated with noma and assess their cytotoxicity, their genomic toxin content, and their antibiotic susceptibility.

MethodsA case-control study was conducted in 2023 in the Diourbel region (Senegal) among children aged 5 to 9 years. Gingival plaque samples were analyzed by microbial culturomics. In addition, cytotoxic tests were performed on MRC5 cells, followed by analysis of the toxin and antimicrobial resistance genomic content.

ResultsA total of five cases of noma and five age- and sex-matched controls were included. 102 species were isolated, including five previously unknown species. The cariogenic species Streptococcus mutans and Scardovia wiggsiae were only detected in cases. Interestingly, all seven strains of S. wiggsiae were cytotoxic. Similarly, eight strains of the Bacillus cereus group were only identified in cases, including six cytotoxic strains. After genomic sequencing, six strains of Bacillus pacificus and two strains of Bacillus anthracis (pXO1 and pXO2 negative) were identified. Genes encoding typical toxins (hbl, nhe, ces, entFM, bceT, hlyIII) and penicillin-specific {beta}-Lactamase (bla2) were found in all eight strains of the B. cereus group, but the bla gene and the necrotizing cytotoxins K1 (cytK-1) and K2 (cytK-2) were only identified in the two B. anthracis strains. Among the five new species, Ferdinandcohnia sokhnae sp. nov. was isolated from a child with noma and was cytotoxic. Overall, at least one cytotoxic strain was isolated from each case, but none were found in the controls. B. anthracis, B. pacificus and F. sokhnae strains were all susceptible to clindamycin and vancomycin but resistant to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid and metronidazole. In contrast, all S. wiggsiae strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, but resistant to metronidazole.

ConclusionA microbial specificity was observed in noma characterized by cytotoxic strains with the unexpected isolation of B. anthracis whose genome encoded a previously described necrotizing toxin gene (CytK1). Antimicrobial resistance results did not support the use of amoxicillin nor metronidazole. Microbiota analysis using microbial culturomics was instrumental in these findings, which opens new avenues for understanding the mechanisms of the disease, and for improving WHO and UNICEF guidelines. Future precision medicine based on microbiological knowledge and diagnosis may improve its future clinical management.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

In this study, we aimed to determine the similarities and differences between the unconsciousness states caused by sleep and that caused by anaesthesia, and to investigate gene expression profiles by applying tensor decomposition-based unsupervised feature extraction to the two gene expression profiles. One of the two expression profiles was composed of mice treated with sevoflurane, a type of inhaled anaesthesia, whereas the other two expression profiles were composed of sleeping and awake mice. We selected two sets of genes (507 and 1048 genes), which are distinctly expressed between sleep or anaesthesia-induced unconsciousness and the awake or control groups. Both sets of genes include various distinct genes which are common to the state of unconsciousness between sleep and anaesthesia. The former is enriched in GABAergic synapses and layer one of the frontal cortex, whereas the latter is enriched in glutamatergic synapses and layer six of the prefroncal cortes. Additionally, both sets of genes were enriched in the RHO GTPase pathway. Based on these results, we hypothesized that L1 GABAergic neurones in the frontal cortex and L6 glutamatergic neurones in the prefrontal cortex use RHO GTPase to differentiate states of unconsciousness induced with general anaesthesia and sleep.","NA","biorxiv",1751148527963

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

In low-risk surgical settings such as surgical hubs, accurate risk prediction is particularly valuable. The aim of this review was to identify and map the evidence for 14 validated pre-operative surgical risk prediction tools currently used in Wales within any elective, or non-emergency surgical setting, and to provide a more in-depth look at the findings for a selection of tools deemed to be the most applicable on a population level to the context of surgical hubs. Included studies were published between 1999 and 2024. No evidence was found for two of the risk prediction tools however, a total of 118 studies were identified across 12 risk prediction tools. None of the evidence found was looking at the predictive ability of risk prediction tools for selecting patients suitable for surgical hubs. The tools were used across a range of surgical specialties and measured composite complications, individual complications, and healthcare utilisation and recovery measures. No risk prediction tool adequately predicted complications across all surgical specialties. Among the included studies, there was considerable heterogeneity in which surgical specialties the risk prediction tools were used for, how complications were defined, and which measures were used to determine a tools predictive ability. This makes direct comparisons very challenging. Four tools were selected as being potentially the most impactful at a population level for a more in-depth look at the findings: ACS NSQIP, P-POSSUM, RCRI, ASA classification system. A total of 76 studies were identified across these 4 tools. Key findings for the four risk prediction tools of interest are described. Overall, no one tool was identified that adequately predicted complications across all surgical specialties. The predictive ability of the tools varied across different surgical specialties. Further research using consistent methods is needed to better understand the predictive ability of risk prediction tools and allow a robust evaluation. Given no single risk prediction tool adequately predicted complications across all surgical specialties, it may be likely that some tools are better suited for specific surgery types or that a combination of risk prediction tools may be needed to adequately assess an individuals level of risk.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

Understanding RSI incidence can inform quality improvement aimed at prevention and patient safety. Objective: To estimate the incidence of retained surgical items in the United States from 2016 to 2023 overall, annually, and stratified by state and surgery category. Design: This was a longitudinal retrospective cohort study utilizing de-identified healthcare claims data from 2016 to 20243. Setting: Data were from the Komodo Research Dataset, which aggregates medical and pharmacy claims from US commercial and government insurance sources. Participants: 198,619,904 surgeries between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2023 where the patient had at least six months of prior continuous medical and pharmacy insurance enrollment. Surgeries were excluded if there was evidence of RSI before surgery or present on admission, surgery was performed in a US territory, or the patient was aged < 2 on the surgery date. Exposure: Surgical procedures identified by administrative codes categorized as broad or narrow by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The primary outcome was the incidence proportion of RSIs, identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes up to 365 days after surgery. Incidence was estimated overall, annually, and stratified by state and surgical category. Data were analyzed from March 2025 to May 2025. Results: The overall RSI incidence was 1.34 (95% CI: 1.32 to 1.36) per 10,000 surgeries, decreasing from 1.63 (95% CI: 1.58 to 1.70) in 2016 to 1.08 (95% CI: 1.04 to 1.12) in 2023. The 5 highest state-stratified RSI incidences were in the District of Columbia, Maine, Nebraska, Ohio, and West Virginia. Exploratory laparotomies and transplant surgeries had the highest surgery category-stratified RSI incidence. Conclusion and Relevance: This large national claims-based study estimated RSI incidence and describes associated patterns in the US, confirming a persistent but declining annual incidence across the 8-year period. These findings highlight the ongoing need for targeted prevention strategies and system-wide efforts to reduce RSIs and improve surgical care.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

Yet, despite growing clinical use, little is known about how sex assigned at birth shapes symptom-specific responses to these interventions, a critical gap in the move toward personalized psychiatry. Methods We conducted a pooled analysis of five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in which adults with TRD received intranasal esketamine or placebo twice weekly for four weeks, alongside a newly initiated oral antidepressant. We evaluated the effects of sex assigned at birth on overall depression severity, measured via total Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores, and across four symptom factors: sadness, negative thoughts, detachment, and neurovegetative symptoms. Rates of clinical response and remission were also analyzed by sex assigned at birth. Findings Overall, esketamine treatment improved total MADRS scores in both sexes; however, significant sex-specific patterns emerged. Females showed greater improvement in total MADRS scores than males towards the end of the trials, in both the placebo and esketamine arms. Females also showed more pronounced reductions in the sadness and detachment factors at the end of the trials, as well as in the neurovegetative factor on day 15, regardless of the treatment group. On the other hand, males showed a significant reduction in sadness symptoms after esketamine on day 2 of the treatment. Females had higher odds of responding, regardless of treatment arm, during later time points. Interpretation These findings reveal that sex assigned at birth influences overall antidepressant response and shapes the trajectory and symptom profile of improvement. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of incorporating sex assigned at birth as a key variable, essential for optimizing TRD treatment strategies and advancing individualized mental healthcare.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

Quantitative meta-analysis reveals moderate effect sizes (SMD 0.30-0.45) for AI-driven interventions, comparable to low-intensity clinician treatments, particularly in CBT-based approaches for mild-to-moderate depression. Advanced NLP models achieve over 90% intent recognition accuracy, and personalized AI leveraging Big Five traits enhances user engagement and disclosure. However, significant challenges persist, including up to 25% performance drop in non-English contexts, inconsistent crisis protocols in only 40% of clinical settings, and pervasive data privacy concerns with 70% of users worried and only 30% of apps providing clear policies. Attrition rates average 14.7%, with notable dropouts among youngest and oldest users. Qualitative analysis of 4,200+ pages of transcripts and 10,700 feedback logs uncovers barriers including cultural mismatch, algorithmic bias, and limited long-term data beyond six months. Hybrid clinician-AI models show promise in improving adherence and reducing dropout. The study underscores the urgent need for large-scale, multicultural trials, comprehensive ethical frameworks, and culturally adapted AI to optimize safety, efficacy, and equity in digital mental health care globally. This work sets a benchmark for evidence-based deployment of conversational agents, highlighting both transformative potential and critical limitations in current AI-mediated mental health interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

Here, we use the Drosophila melanogaster midgut model to investigate SARS-CoV-2-induced GI pathogenesis. The fly midgut exhibits susceptibility to orally administered virus, resulting in disrupted epithelial architecture, reduced organ size, and altered visceral muscle dynamics. These effects are accompanied by sustained proliferation of intestinal stem cells alongside decreased replenishment and viability of differentiated cells. Transcriptomic profiling reveals biphasic perturbations in midgut gene expression, particularly in pathways related to lipid metabolism. Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a dichotomous effect on lipid homeostasis, with lipid droplet accumulation in the posterior midgut and depletion in anterior segments. Treatment with Plitidepsin, a COVID-19 drug candidate, mitigates most SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic features in both the Drosophila midgut and human pulmonary cells, while modulating basal lipid droplet homeostasis in uninfected conditions. These findings establish the Drosophila midgut as a potent model for studying SARS-CoV-2 GI pathogenesis and evaluating antiviral compounds.","NA","biorxiv",1751148527963

Methods: Veterans (n=180) age 65+ were recruited from Madison VA Hospital. Resting supine brachial BP and central BP (estimated from radial artery waveforms, Atcor Medical) were obtained. CAS (Peterson's elastic modulus [PEM], Young's elastic modulus [YEM]) and distensibility coefficient (DC) were calculated using brachial and central BP. Differences in CAS were compared using paired Wilcoxon tests. Linear regression models evaluated associations with cardiovascular risk factors. Results: Participants were 70.4 (7.7) years old and 27.8% were female. Average brachial systolic BP was significantly higher than central (132.3 [18.6] mmHg vs 123.8 [17.7] mmHg p<0.001). Compared to brachial BP, using central BP to calculate stiffness measures resulted in significantly lower YEM and PEM and significantly higher DC (PEM: 480.6 [209.5] mmHg vs 378.3 [178.4] mmHg; YEM: 2220.2 [926.6] mmHg vs 1746.9 [785.4] mmHg; DC: 2.4 [1.0] x10-3 mmHg-1 vs 3.1 [1.1] x10-3 mmHg-1; all p<0.001).

Despite its recognition by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD), epidemiological data on SE remain scarce in Ghana, particularly in communities fringing protected forest areas such as the Kakum Conservation Area (KCA). Objective This study aimed to quantify and characterize the epidemiology of snakebite envenomation and explore the health-seeking behaviours among residents in the fringe communities of the KCA in the Central Region of Ghana. Methods A cross-sectional household survey was conducted between April and May 2024 in 18 communities fringing the KCA in Ghana's Central Region. A two-stage sampling approach was employed to enumerate a total of 1,445 households for snakebite victims. The survey instrument was programmed into KoBoCollect software and administered to snakebite victim of household heads using the one-on-one interview method. Mainly descriptive statistical analytical analyses were conducted using STATA version 14.0. Results In this study, the lifetime number of snakebites reported was 394 (4.6%), while 164 (1.9%) and 41 (0.5%) snakebites reported in the last 5 years and one (1) year preceding the survey, respectively. The average age of a snakebite victim was 44 years. Snakebite victims were typically female (54%), married (59%), and mainly engaged in farming (73%) for livelihood. Most snakebites occurred during the morning (42%), in the farm field/forest (66%) and along the victims lower limbs (88%). Over seven-in-ten victims sought first aid, with tourniquet (35%) mostly applied. Majority (69%) of victims sought treatment in a healthcare facility, mostly in Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) compounds (32%). Conclusion Snakebites constitute a major public health concern in communities fringing the KCA, especially for those whose livelihoods revolve around agricultural activities. There is the need to establish and strengthen collaborative efforts among primary health authorities, forest conservation managers, and community leaders in the design and implementation of effective interventions to avert snakebite incidents and improve outcomes for victims.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

However, athletes' sleep is impaired in both quality and quantity. Previous research has shown athletes' sleep quality and quantity to be improved using sleep interventions, however very few studies have evaluated sleep and investigated it among female athletes. Therefore, this exploratory study aimed to evaluate the sleep of adult female team-sport athletes over a match week in an ecological context and to assess the effects of a one-to-one sleep intervention (comprising both educational and practical components). Methods: Nine female rugby players completed a two-week protocol including a sleep evaluation (PRE week) and an intervention (POST week). The first week was dedicated to sleep assessment via both actigraphy and self-report questionnaires, and during the second week, players received educational and practical sleep interventions. Results: During the PRE week, 88.9% of the participants were classified as poor sleepers, compared to only 44% during the POST week. A significant positive effect of sleep interventions was particularly found on subjective sleep (from 10.3 +/- 1.1 to 8.8 +/- 1.8, p = 0.03, n2 = 0.38) and psychological state (from 3.7 +/- 0.6 to 2.9 +/- 0.9, p = 0.002, n2 = 0.55). Conclusion: These positive effects highlight the need for sleep among female athletes and the potential benefits of targeted sleep interventions, though confirmation in larger samples of athletic women is needed. This feasible and tailored approach could be effectively implemented among female team-sport athletes over the competitive season.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

Despite progress towards reducing rates of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV, global progress toward EMTCT of syphilis and HBV remains suboptimal. We systematically searched records in PubMed capturing the synergistic challenges and potential strategies in achieving triple EMTCT between January 1, 2013, and April 27, 2023. After screening 547 records, 50 reports met inclusion criteria. Overall, testing for HIV was well-established within antenatal care but limited for syphilis and HBV due to poor political support, inadequate funding, and insufficient operational guidance on how to deliver integrated testing within maternal and child health care. MTCT of syphilis and HBV appears to be impeded by lack of integrated systems to enable test-and-treat approaches with same-day test results and immediate treatment initiation, gaps in linkage to care, frequent stockouts of essential drugs and other commodities, prohibitive user fees, and limited clinical familiarity and training of staff in managing syphilis and HBV positive cases. To achieve triple EMTCT, co-strategies that leverage success of HIV programs to gain momentum towards prevention of congenital syphilis and MTCT of HBV, that break down siloed programs by co-delivery of testing, treatment, and training and that are supported through political will, advocacy, policy and funding are critical.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

Contributing to the ongoing debate, we investigated whether treatment response to a highly standardized one-session virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) was predicted by 5-HTTLPR genotype. N=194 patients with arachnophobia (spider phobia) were genotyped for 5-HTTLPR and the functionally related single nucleotide polymorphism rs25531 and grouped into high- (LA/LA), and low-expression (S/S, S/LG, LG/LG, S/LA, LG/LA) genotype. At baseline, after VRET, and at a 6-month follow-up, participants underwent a standardized behavioral avoidance task (BAT) and the spider phobia questionnaire (SPQ) to assess symptom severity. Chi-square tests revealed a significant association between 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 and behavioral treatment outcome, that remained significant at the 6-month follow-up. No association was found between genotype and self-reported symptom severity measured with the SPQ. Our results support the idea that while LA/LA genotype carriers might benefit from highly standardized treatment, lower 5-HTT expression may convey risk to poorer treatment response, likely necessitating more tailored psychotherapeutic interventions to promote sufficient response.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

Yet, the effectiveness across different patient subgroups is often poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate how one can use causal machine learning (ML) together with real-world data to identify which patient groups are most likely to benefit from off-label use. Specifically, we assessed the effectiveness of off-label use of amiodarone in patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF). NOAF can often lead to hemodynamic instability and rapid ventricular response, so that hemodynamic stability should be restored. We developed a causal ML model to predict individualized treatment effects (ITEs) of off-label amiodarone use on the probability of returning to hemodynamic stability. We used real-world data from the U.S. to develop the causal ML model and externally evaluated that model on real-world data from the Netherlands. Our predicted ITEs show that 44.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38.4% to 51.0%) of patients benefit from off-label use of amiodarone with large heterogeneity: amiodarone is predicted to increase the probability of restoring hemodynamic stability by a mean of 0.5 percentage points (pp), with an interquartile range (IQR) of -1.1 pp to 1.0 pp, in the external dataset from the Netherlands. Using these ITEs, we defined a personalized treatment rule, which could increase the number of patients achieving hemodynamic stability by 4.4% (95% CI: 1.0% to 7.8%) compared to current practice. Additionally, we studied which biomarkers are predictive of treatment effect heterogeneity and found that patients with higher blood pressure may benefit most from off-label use of amiodarone. Altogether, our study shows the potential of causal ML together with real-world data in identifying patients who benefit from off-label drug use.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

Dynamic prediction models update survival curves as new disease progression data become available, often by summarizing the data into scalar values. To reduce data compression, we propose a sparse multivariate functional Cox landmarking model. At each landmark time, our approach first applies sparse multivariate functional principal component analysis (FPCA) to estimate individual disease progression trajectories and then uses a linear functional Cox model to dynamically predict individual survival curves. Simulation studies demonstrate the models ability to recover functional coefficients in different scenarios and its superior predictive performance. Our model is applied to Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) National History Consortium (NHC) data to dynamically predict risk incorporating the full trajectory of disease progression.

To investigate the underlying mechanism, we performed complexome profiling on interferon-{gamma}-stimulated fibroblasts harboring the p.(Ala235Asp) variant. This variant, located at the {beta}-ring interface, disrupted proper assembly of the immunoproteasome, resulting in reduced levels of fully assembled 20S and 26S immunoproteasomes and accumulation of assembly intermediates.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

While machine learning holds promise for early sepsis detection by leveraging the multimodal time series data prevalent in ICUs, the field faces significant methodological challenges, such as class imbalance and temporal misalignment. These issues have spurred growing interest in case control matching strategies. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of how commonly used case control matching methods affect model performance and introduce potential biases, highlighting a critical gap in current knowledge. Methods: We investigated how matched training data affect both the performance of various machine learning architectures and the predictive importance of individual clinical features. Three harmonized large scale ICU cohorts were used: the high time resolution ICU dataset (HiRID) from Bern University Hospital, Switzerland (29,698 stays, 2008 to 2019), with a sepsis prevalence of 6.3%; the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC IV) database from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, USA (63,425 stays, 2008 to 2019), with a sepsis prevalence of 5.2%; and the eICU Collaborative Research Database from 208 US hospitals (123,413 stays, 2014 to 2015), with a sepsis prevalence of 4.6%. Each dataset included hourly observations. both with and without incorporating demographic variables, and compared the results to unmatched and undersampled cohorts with equivalent ratios. To evaluate how matching strategies influenced feature relevance, we applied a Linear Mixed Effects Model (LMEM) to assess changes in the predictive significance of individual features. Finally, we trained machine learning models, including random forests and gradient boosted trees, and evaluated their performance on the original test sets using the AUROC and normalized AUPRC metrics. Findings: The LMEM results demonstrated that case control matching led to a substantial reduction in the number of features identified as significant, based on multiple testing corrected p values, across all three cohorts. Specifically, the number of significant features declined from 35 to 43 range in the original datasets to 24 to 29 range as the matching ratio increased from 1:10 to 1:2. In the machine learning experiments, models trained on undersampled data achieved strong performance, with AUROC values exceeding 0.90 and normalized AUPRC scores above 41. In contrast, models trained on the original (imbalanced) datasets performed robustly (AUROC up to 0.82, normalized AUPRC up to 4.2), whereas those trained on matched datasets showed significant performance degradation, with AUROC values below 0.50 and normalized AUPRC scores falling below baseline. These patterns were consistent across all three cohorts and a wide range of evaluation setups. Interpretation: This multi cohort analysis highlights a methodological paradox: while case control matching can mitigate class imbalance and help disentangle sepsis specific patterns from general ICU trajectories, overly strict matching criteria may significantly impair predictive performance. These findings underscore the need for more nuanced matching strategies that balance bias reduction with the preservation of critical clinical signals, ultimately enhancing the reliability and real world applicability of sepsis prediction models.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

Rationally predicting individual-specific success or failure of probiotic and prebiotic interventions remains an outstanding challenge. In this study, we leverage microbial community-scale metabolic models (MCMMs) to predict probiotic engraftment and shifts in microbiota-mediated short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in response to a synbiotic intervention. Using data from a placebo-controlled synbiotic intervention trial, involving a cocktail of five probiotic strains and the prebiotic inulin, we validate model engraftment predictions with quantitative PCR (qPCR), demonstrating that MCMMs accurately predict probiotic engraftment outcomes in the treatment group with over 85% accuracy. Engraftment varied by species, with Akkermansia muciniphila and Bifidobacterium infantis displaying higher engraftment rates than Clostridium beijerinckii, Anaerobutyricum hallii, and Clostridium butyricum. Furthermore, MCMMs predicted significant increases in butyrate and propionate production following synbiotic treatment. MCMM-predicted changes in propionate production in the treatment group were negatively associated with changes in C-reactive protein (CRP), a blood marker of systemic inflammation, from baseline to 12 weeks after the synbiotic intervention. Finally, we explore MCMM-predicted responses to a wider range of synbiotic combinations in a larger observational cohort, suggesting that personalized prebiotic selection can augment probiotic efficacy. These findings highlight the potential of metabolic modeling to inform precision microbiome therapeutics.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

Timely VSL-specific VE estimates are essential, but study-specific VSL identification by whole genome sequencing (the ""gold standard"") is expensive and time-consuming. Alternatively, VSL-specific VE has been estimated from external sequencing data (VSL predominance period by proxy: PP). We propose two novel approaches for use in test-negative design (TND) studies to estimate VSL-specific VE when study-specific VSL identification is not possible. Methods We demonstrate the variant category model (VCM) and the variant proportion model (VPM) approaches. Using data from a hospital-based TND study among adults [&ge;]65 years, during the period of sequential predominance of XBB and BA.2.86 in 2023/24, we estimated the VE as (1-OR) x 100%. For the VCM, we used a binary variable categorising ""most likely underlying sublineage"" based on publicly available sequencing data. For the VPM, we used a continuous variable with values from 0 to 1 representing the weekly proportion of BA.2.86. We validated results using study-specific VSL identification from sequenced study data (SD) and the standard PP approach. Results Overall, at 14-59 days post vaccination, VE point estimates against XBB were within {+/-}3% absolute for the VE estimated using both models, with an equivalent standard PP validation. We could not validate using SD, as there were no vaccinated XBB cases. Against BA.2.86, VE was lower than against XBB, and the VCM and VPM results were within {+/-}7% absolute of each other, with lowest validation results from SD but equivalent results from the PP. Conclusions Both proposed approaches produced similar VE estimates to those from well-known methods. The VPM could also provide VE estimates when the validation techniques were limited by low sample size.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

It carries significant social, emotional, and health consequences for women, their children, families, and communities. In Ethiopia, approximately one-third of married women report that their pregnancies are unintended. Despite the considerable burden of unintended pregnancies in the country, there remains limited evidence on the factors contributing to this issue, particularly at Lemi Kura sub city. This study, therefore, aimed to identify the determinants of unintended pregnancy among women attending antenatal care services in health facilities within Lemi Kura sub-city, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods : We conducted a facility-based case-control study in Lemi Kura sub-city, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from January 3 to February 18, 2022. Cluster random sampling technique was used to select 103 cases (women with unintended pregnancies attending antenatal care unit) and 197 controls (women with planned pregnancies attending antenatal care unit). Data were collected through interviewer-administered, pretested questionnaires. The sample size was calculated using Epi-Info version 7. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS version 20, applying multivariable logistic regression to identify determinants of unintended pregnancy. Results were reported as adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and statistical significance was declared at p < 0.05. Results: The Muslim women (AOR: 3.33, 95% CI: 1.21-9.15) ; Protestant women (AOR: 3.06, 95% CI: 1.07-8.75); reduced women's autonomy (AOR: 16.58, 95% CI: 2.40-114.15); residing 4 km or more from the antenatal care facility (AOR: 2.70, 95% CI: 1.07-8.75); having two or more living children(parity) (AOR: 5.37, 95% CI: 1.60-18.15); desiring two or fewer children(Ideal) (AOR: 3.63, 95% CI: 1.50-9.01); and having multiple sexual partners (AOR: 4.25, 95% CI: 1.38-30.38) were significant predictors of unintended pregnancy. Conclusion : Women with Low knowledge about FPMs, unmarried, Protestant and Muslim religious, low autonomy, multiparous, used natural FPM, health service inaccessibility and having multiple sexual partners were primary predicators of the unintended pregnancy.

The ICH E9(R1) addendum lists five attributes that should be described when defining an estimand. However, the addendum was primarily developed for individually randomised trials. Cluster randomised trials (CRTs), in which groups of individuals are randomised, have additional considerations for defining estimands, such as how individuals and clusters are weighted. We aimed to identify a list of additional items that may need to be considered when defining estimands in CRTs.

Study designWe conducted a systematic search of multiple databases as well as the authors personal libraries to identify articles that described an aspect of an estimand definition for CRTs which was not explicitly covered by one of the five attributes listed in the ICH E9 (R1) addendum. From this, we generated a list of items that may require consideration when defining estimands for CRTs beyond the five attributes listed in the ICH E9(R1) addendum.

ResultsFrom 46 eligible articles, we identified 8 items that may need to be considered when defining estimands in CRTs: (i) population of clusters; (ii) population of individuals under selection bias; (iii) exposure time of individuals/clusters on treatment; (iv) how individuals and clusters are weighted (e.g. individual-average vs. cluster-average); (v) whether summary measures are marginal or cluster-specific; (vi) strategies used to handle cluster-level intercurrent events; (vii) how interference/spillover is handled; and (viii) how individuals who leave or change clusters are handled.

ConclusionThis review has identified additional items that may need to be considered when defining estimands for CRTs.

The purpose of this scoping review is to describe the evidence of implicit bias as it relates to cancer clinical trial enrollment.

MethodsSystematic methods were followed to search online databases for publications that assessed provider bias and cancer clinical trial offers through August 1, 2023. Variables of interest included how implicit bias was defined or measured, what type of bias was examined, and if provider implicit bias was identified or described in the cancer clinical trial enrollment process.

ResultsWe identified 10 publications that met the inclusion criteria. Nine of ten studies were conducted in the United States, and all studies utilized observational or qualitative study design. Most assessed the provider perspective, and one study used a validated measure to identify implicit bias. Some studies identified evidence of implicit provider bias in clinical trial discussions and offers; however, it was observed in situations where system constraints, such as lack of resources or time were present that may be common in oncological settings.

ConclusionsMultilevel support and dedication to improving racial, ethnic, and other patient-level representativeness are required to mitigate the influence of implicit bias in resource-poor and stressful clinical settings to ensure equitable access to and enrollment in clinical trials for all patients with cancer.

We performed a randomized, waitlist-controlled study (LEANER study), with 38 healthy participants completing a 5-day-fasting intervention with 12-week follow-up. Fasting acutely lowered body mass index (BMI), via fat mass loss. These changes partially persisted at follow-up. Fasting altered the gut microbiome composition and induced metabolite shifts in plasma and feces. Changes to gut microbiome alpha diversity after fasting correlated with baseline microbiome diversity. Long-term BMI response at follow-up could be predicted through machine learning (ML) using baseline microbiome and clinical data, highlighting an unknown Faecalibacterium sp., Oscillibacter sp. 50_27, LDL cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure as key predictors. This ML model was validated in independent patient cohorts with metabolic syndrome and multiple sclerosis. These findings support prolonged fasting as an effective metabolic intervention and demonstrate that individual responses to fasting interventions can be predicted using pre-intervention features.

MethodsWe used a validated SBayesR-based genome-wide polygenic score, leveraging information from 905,707 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, to measure CRF genetics (PGS CRF). Associations with register-based incident cardiovascular disease, cancer, pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and all-cause mortality were analysed using Cox proportional hazards models in the FinnGen cohort (N=262,137; 53.5-y at baseline, 52.0% women) and replicated in the HUNT3 cohort (N=26,115; 59.0-y, 52.4% women). In HUNT3, we also compared the health characteristics and disease risk of individuals having age- and sex-specific high CRF ([V]O2max) and high PGS CRF (group ""inherited"" CRF) to those having high CRF but low PGS CRF (group ""gained"" CRF), N=375 vs. 279, respectively.

ResultsHigher PGS CRF was associated with lower risk of lung cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.93-0.98), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 0.98, 0.96-1.00), T2D (HR 0.98, 0.96-0.99), and all-cause mortality (HR 0.98, 0.98-0.99) in the most adjusted model per each standard deviation increase in PGS. In sensitivity analyses including never-smokers, the association between PGS CRF and T2D remained statistically significant. Replication analyses supported main observations. No differences in health outcomes were observed between individuals with ""inherited"" and ""gained"" CRF.

ConclusionsPGS CRF requires further development, but the findings suggest genetic predisposition accounts for some, albeit a limited proportion, of the public health benefits observed with CRF.

Summary boxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSCardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is a well-known correlate of health and longevity, with an expected strong genetic component. However, it is not known to what extent genetics explain the health benefits of CRF or if ""inherited"" CRF is more health-protective than CRF ""gained"" through exercise.

What this study addsWe found that current polygenic metrics for CRF show modest protective associations against type 2 diabetes, but not against cardiovascular disease, cancers, pulmonary disease or all-cause mortality after controlling for potential covariates. We did not observe differential associations between ""inherited"" and ""gained"" CRF with health outcomes.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyGenetic confounding is expected to play a limited role in the relationship between CRF and the risk of common NCDs and mortality. Therefore, promotion of CRF remains a viable public health strategy.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

Here we present and evaluate a new method based on CO2 rebreathing and end-tidal CO2 monitoring using simple equipment and procedure applicable at bedside.

Ten healthy subjects with diverse anthropometric and respiratory parameters were studied in the sitting position. Reference FRC (RefFRC) and tidal volume (TV) were measured with the Cosmed Quark CPET unit using the single-breath helium dilution technique. Rebreathing through a dead space of precisely known volume and recording the resulting rise in the end-tidal CO2 value for the first two breaths allows the determination of ELV. FRC is then calculated from ELV. Two sets of measurements were made on each subject 15 minutes apart.

Bland-Altman analysis of a comparison between FRC and RefFRC shows a bias= 0.08 l and SD=0.67 l. Comparing the first set of data to the second, (alfa =0.05) paired t-test shows the two sets to be independent. When the mean value of two observations is calculated (meanFRC) and compared to RefFRC we obtain bias= -0.04 l with SD=0.38 l which results in a percentage error PE=0.23

The FRC data obtained has good absolute accuracy. Due to the short measuring time, a mean of two observations can be formed that has sufficient precision to meet criteria for exchangeability with reference. The simplicity of equipment and procedure, could make this method attractive both in the pre-operative and the post-operative setting.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

New strategies are needed to improve the screening of migrants for active TB disease. Current sputum-based testing methods are logistically challenging in many settings. Alternative sampling with tongue swabs is designed to be easier than sputum collection and exhibits acceptable accuracy. This study characterized the acceptability of supervised self-swabbing (SSS) for TB screening in migrant settings in Northern Italy.

MethodsMigrants arriving through the Central Mediterranean route to Italy were purposely sampled to participate in in-depth interviews (IDIs), which were conducted with the support of a cultural mediator. Data was analyzed using a rapid qualitative analysis approach. The Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behavior (COM-B) model guided the systematic assessment of potential barriers and facilitators to SSS.

ResultsBetween November 2023 and June 2024, we conducted 24 IDIs with migrant men and women. Most participants preferred SSS over sputum production and found it relatively easy. Reasons for preferring SSS included its simplicity, privacy, and aversion to sputum collection. Discomfort during swabbing was rare. However, a few participants preferred sputum collection and cited oral hygiene-related complications. Participants highlighted language barriers, trust deficits with the healthcare system, and limited health literacy on infectious diseases, including TB, as factors that could limit the uptake of SSS. Participants also reported that their willingness to participate in TB screening may be driven by a need to comply with immigration rules.

ConclusionSSS is a promising and acceptable method for collecting samples for TB screening. To strengthen TB mitigation strategies in this population, future efforts should focus on developing culturally and linguistically tailored educational materials that address the specific concerns and informational needs of migrants.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

South Africa is unique in the region because its HIV programme is largely domestically funded, although donor funds and partnerships support key components. We estimated the epidemiological impact of ceased PEPFAR support for specific services and the costs and cost-effectiveness of the South African government (SAG) potentially taking over these services.

MethodsWe used a costed version of Thembisa, a South African HIV transmission model, to simulate four scenarios: a minimum scenario assuming intervention coverage reducing proportional to PEPFARs funding share of specific activities in 2023; a maximum scenario assuming additional health system impacts; and sub-scenarios either with 3-year recovery (2029-2031) or no recovery to previous coverage. HIV programme costs were estimated from the provider perspective (SAG) in 2024/25 US dollars.

ResultsOver 2025-2028, discontinuing PEPFAR funding in South Africa without replacement by SAG would result in 150,000-296,000 additional new HIV infections (29-56% increase) and 56,000-65,000 additional AIDS-related deaths (33-38%). Permanent discontinuation of currently PEPFAR-supported services over the next 20 years increases this to 1.1-2.1 million additional new HIV infections and 519,000-712,000 additional AIDS deaths. To sustain services, SAG needs to spend an additional $710 million to $1.5 billion between 2025 and 2028. Under a reduced budget, the most cost-effective interventions to preserve are ART and PrEP.

ConclusionUnmanaged PEPFAR exit from South Africa threatens to undo a decade of progress towards ending AIDS as a public health threat unless services are taken over by other funders, including SAG.","10.1097/QAD.0000000000004272","medrxiv",1751148527963

Recently, a novel approach for the fast and efficient differentiation of ovarian support cells (OSCs) to generate a versatile platform for basic research and clinical applications was demonstrated. This study details the clinical process development and application of an OSC product, known as Fertilo, to improve the in vitro maturation (IVM) of human oocytes, a method referred to as OSC-IVM. First, transcription factor (TF) mediated OSC differentiation using research-grade raw materials was shown to produce granulosa-like cells that improve the MII maturation rate of human oocytes. To support clinical application, several raw material upgrades were initiated, including substitution of the differentiation matrix with a higher-quality alternative, laminin-521, and the generation of a clinically suitable hiPSC seed bank and master cell bank. Single cell RNA sequencing of OSCs generated using the updated protocol for clinical translation demonstrated the consistency and reproducibility of cellular outcomes. Next, analytical release testing of the clinical product was performed and a murine oocyte maturation assay was developed to establish the potency of OSCs for use in OSC-IVM. Finally, the qualified Fertilo product was applied in a two-phase longitudinal cohort analysis, with the results showing improvement in key outcomes compared to traditional IVM treatment.

Symptoms of sympathetic dysfunction are prevalent in diabetes, affecting up to 90% of patients. The molecular and cellular composition of the human SCG and its alteration in diabetes remains poorly defined. To address this gap, we performed spatial transcriptomic profiling of lumbar SCGs from diabetic and non-diabetic organ donors. We identified 3 three distinct neuronal populations, two noradrenergic (NA1 and NA2) and one cholinergic (CHO), based on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and SLC18A3 expression, respectively. We also characterized 9 non-neuronal populations consisting of Schwann cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, adipocytes, and endothelial cells. In diabetic SCGs, we observed a significant loss of myelinating Schwann cells and a phenotypic shift of cholinergic neurons toward a noradrenergic identity. Additionally, diabetes was associated with a significant reduction in the transcripts of vasodilatory neuropeptides, such as VIP and CALCA, suggesting a mechanism for impaired vascular control. Upstream regulator analysis highlighted altered neurotrophic signaling in diabetes, with enhanced NGF/TRKA and diminished BDNF/TRKB activity, potentially driven by target-derived cues. Comparison between SCG and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons revealed ganglia-specific genes, like SCN3A and NPY (SCG) versus SCN10A and GPX1 (DRG), offering specific therapeutic targets for autonomic dysfunction or pain. Our findings provide a transcriptomic characterization of human SCG, revealing molecular signatures that underlie diabetic autonomic dysfunction. This work lays a foundation for the development of therapies to restore sympathetic function and avoid unintended autonomic effects in the development of analgesics.

Significance StatementAutonomic dysfunction affects up to 90% of people with diabetes, yet the human sympathetic nervous system remains poorly molecularly defined. To address this gap, we present a spatial transcriptomic profile of the human sympathetic chain ganglia (SCG), revealing how diabetes affects the human autonomic nervous system. We show that diabetes shifts the cholinergic neuronal population to a noradrenergic phenotype and reduces vasodilation neuropeptide expression, potentially explaining impaired vascular control and thermoregulation. Comparative analysis of sympathetic and sensory ganglia reveals distinct gene profiles that may inform novel therapeutic strategies. These findings offer critical insight into the molecular drivers of diabetic autonomic neuropathy and lay the groundwork for safer, more precise treatments that selectively modulate autonomic or sensory function in chronic disease.","NA","biorxiv",1751148527963

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

ObjectiveTo examine the utility of the HEI-2020 to create benchmarks for national diet quality monitoring.

MethodsThis serial cross-sectional study used data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Nationally representative data for 22,168 US adults ([&ge;]20 years) who completed two 24-hour recalls were analyzed. We derived HEI-2020 scores (0-100) from participants two 24-hour dietary recalls. Diet quality categories were established: high diet quality (>70-100), marginal (>60-70), low (>50-60), and very low (0-50).

ResultsOnly 13% of US adults had high diet quality while nearly two-thirds had low or very low diet quality. Diet quality was higher for older adults, female, ""Other"" race or ethnicity, born outside of the US, have higher education attainment, higher income, and food security. Compared to adults with high diet quality, adults with very low diet quality had lower intakes of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and seafood and the highest intakes of ultra-processed foods, refined grains, and red and processed meats (all P-trends <0.01). Adults with very low diet quality were more likely to have elevated adiposity, lower HDL cholesterol, and higher triglycerides, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c (all P-trends [&le;]0.01).

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

This qualitative study explores the lived experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) following the implementation of Covid-19 vaccine mandates in Albertas health sector. It draws on 80 responses to a single open-ended question from a survey of 190 HCWs in the province across vaccination statuses. We performed a manual sentiment analysis, classifying entries as positive, neutral, or negative - depending on their normative orientation towards vaccination mandates - using Weberian ideal types as a conceptual framework.

Most respondents (82.5%) expressed negative sentiments, with close to one fifth (17.5%) offering positive views; no entries were coded as neutral. Themes within negative responses included coercion, ethical conflict, professional exclusion, institutional betrayal, and suppression of dissent. Many vaccinated HCWs described complying under duress, challenging the assumption that uptake signals endorsement. The most salient theme was that of moral injury - defined as the distress caused by acting against ones conscience, witnessing perceived harm, or remaining silent under institutional pressure. In contrast, positive responses emphasized professional duty and public safety, often rejecting the legitimacy of dissenting perspectives.

Our findings underscore the deeply polarizing nature of vaccination mandates and complicate dominant narratives that equate compliance with consent. Further, in contrast to clinical conceptions rooted in combat or bedside trauma, our analysis situates moral injury in the structural conditions created by public health policies, offering a lens for assessing their implications for the wellbeing of HCWs, quality care, and ethical healthcare practice and policy. We conclude that future public health policies, especially those justified under claims of emergency, must include built-in safeguards for ethical integrity and democratic participation.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1751148527963
