Here, we conducted a comprehensive three-year longitudinal study examining T cell and antibody responses in 78 vaccinated individuals without reported symptomatic infections. We observed distinct dynamics in Spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across multiple vaccine doses. While antibody titers incrementally increased and stabilized with each booster, T cell responses rapidly plateaued, maintaining remarkable stability across CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Notably, approximately 30% of participants showed CD4+ T cell reactivity to non-Spike antigens, consistent with asymptomatic infections. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a diverse landscape of Spike-specific T cell phenotypes, with no evidence of increased exhaustion or significant functional impairment. However, qualitative changes were observed in individuals with evidence of asymptomatic infection, exhibiting unique immunological characteristics, including increased frequencies of Th17-like CD4+ T cells and GZMKhi/IFNR CD8+ T cell subsets. Remarkably, repeated vaccinations in this group were associated with a progressive increase in regulatory T cells, potentially indicating a balanced immune response that may mitigate immunopathology. By regularly stimulating T cell memory, boosters contribute to a stable and enhanced immune response, which may provide better protection against symptomatic infections.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

Remarkably, Starships dominate the plastic genomic compartments involved in host colonization, are enriched in virulence-associated genes, and exhibit genetic and epigenetic characteristics associated with adaptive genome evolution. We further uncover extensive horizontal transfer of Starships between Verticillium species and, strikingly, from distantly related Fusarium fungi.

By integrating taxonomic, genomic and predicted functional annotations, we uncover how Bifidobacterium adapts to host-specific environments, shaped by vertical transmission, dietary influences, and host phylogeny. Our findings reveal that host phylogeny is a major determinant of gut microbiota composition. Distinct microbial networks in mammalian and avian hosts reflect evolutionary adaptations to dietary niches, such as carnivory, and ecological pressures. At a strain-resolved level, we identify strong co-phylogenetic associations between Bifidobacterium strains and their hosts, driven by vertical transmission and dietary selection, underscoring the intricate co-evolutionary dynamics between these microbes and their hosts. Functional analyses highlight striking host-specific metabolic adaptations in Bifidobacterium, particularly in carbohydrate metabolism and oxidative stress responses. In mammals, we observe an enrichment of glycoside hydrolases (GH) tailored to complex carbohydrate-rich diets, including multi-domain GH13_28 -amylases featuring diverse carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM25, CBM26, and the novel CBM74). These adaptations emphasise the ecological flexibility of Bifidobacterium in breaking down alpha-linked glucose polysaccharides, such as resistant starch. Together, our study provides new insights into the evolutionary trajectories and ecological plasticity of Bifidobacterium, revealing how host phylogeny and dietary ecology drive microbial diversity and function. These findings deepen our understanding of host-microbe co-evolution and the critical role of microbiota in shaping animal health and adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

Computational workflows for discovering condition-specific differences in tissue organization typically rely on pairwise comparisons or unsupervised clustering. In many cases, these approaches are computationally expensive, lack statistical rigor, and are insensitive to low-prevalence cellular niches that are nevertheless highly discriminative and predictive of patient outcomes. Here, we present QUICHE - an automated, scalable, and statistically robust method that can be used to discover cellular niches differentially enriched in spatial regions, longitudinal samples, or clinical patient groups. In contrast to existing methods, QUICHE combines local niche detection with interpretable statistical modeling using graph neighborhoods to detect differentially enriched cellular niches, even at low prevalence. Using in silico models and spatial proteomic imaging of human tissues, we demonstrate that QUICHE can accurately detect condition-specific cellular niches occurring at a frequency of 0.5% in fewer than 20% of patient samples, outperforming the next best method which required a patient prevalence of 60% for detection. To validate our approach and understand how tumor structure influences recurrence risk in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), we used QUICHE to comprehensively profile the tumor microenvironment in a multi-center, spatial proteomics cohort consisting of primary surgical resections, analyzing over 2 million cells from 314 patients across 5 medical centers. We discovered cellular niches that were consistently enriched in key regions of the tumor microenvironment, including the tumor-immune border and extracellular matrix remodeling regions, as well as niches statistically-associated with patient outcomes, including recurrence status and recurrence-free survival. The majority of differential niches (74.2%) were specific to patients that did not relapse and formed a robust interconnected network enriched in monocytes, macrophages, APCs, and CD8T cells with tumor and stroma cells. In contrast, the interaction network for patients that relapsed was notably sparse and enriched in B cells, CD68 macrophages and neutrophils. We validated these findings using two independent cohorts, observing similar cellular interactions and predictive power. Collectively, these results suggest that salient, generalized profiles of productive anti-tumor immune responses are defined by a network of structural engagement between innate and adaptive immunity with tumor and stromal cells, rather than by any single specific cell population.

Avian influenza A viruses of the H5 subtype circulate globally among birds and are classified into distinct clades based on their hemagglutinin (HA) genetic sequences. Thus, the ability to accurately and rapidly assign clades to newly sequenced isolates is key to surveillance and outbreak response. Co-circulation of endemic, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A(H5) lineages in North American and European wild birds necessitates the ability to rapidly and accurately distinguish between infections arising from these lineages and epizootic HPAI A(H5) viruses. However, currently available clade assignment tools are limited and often require command line expertise, hindering their utility for public health surveillance labs. To address this gap, we have developed datasets to enable A(H5) clade assignments with Nextclade, a drag-and-drop tool originally developed for SARS-CoV-2 genetic clade classification. Using annotated reference datasets for all historical A(H5) clades, clade 2.3.2.1 descendants, and clade 2.3.4.4 descendants provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization/World Organisation for Animal Health (FAO/WHO/WOAH) H5 Working Group, we identified clade-defining mutations for every established clade to enable tree-based clade assignment. We then created three Nextclade datasets which can be used to assign clades to A(H5) HA sequences and call mutations relative to reference strains through a drag-and-drop interface. Nextclade assignments were benchmarked with 19,834 unique sequences not in the reference set using a pre-released version of LABEL, a well-validated and widely used command line software. Prospective assignment of new sequences with Nextclade and LABEL produced very well-matched assignments (match rates of 97.8% and 99.1% for the 2.3.2.1 and 2.3.4.4 datasets, respectively). The all-clades dataset also performed well (94.8% match rate) and correctly distinguished between all HPAI and LPAI strains. This tool additionally allows for the identification of polybasic cleavage site sequences and potential N-linked glycosylation sites. These datasets therefore provide an alternative, rapid method to accurately assign clades to new A(H5) HA sequences, with the benefit of an easy-to-use browser interface.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

We developed a tool to estimate the extent of this bias. The benefits of giving intravenous immunoglobulin in streptococcal toxic shock syndrome have likely been overstated

BackgroundImmortal time bias is a spurious or exaggerated protective association that commonly arises in naive analyses of observational data. It occurs when people receive the intervention because they survive, rather than survive because they received the intervention. Studies in conditions with substantial early mortality, such as acute severe infections, are particularly vulnerable. The bias can be avoided by fitting the intervention as a time-varying exposure.

MethodsWe developed IMMORTOOL, an R package accessible via a user-friendly web interface. This tool will estimate the potential for immortal time bias using empiric or assumed data on the distributions of time to intervention and time to event. Assumptions are that no other biases are present and that the intervention does not impact the outcome. The tool was benchmarked using studies presenting both naive analyses and analyses with the intervention fit as a time-varying exposure. We applied IMMORTOOL to a set of influential observational studies that used naive analyses when estimating the impact of polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) on survival in streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS).

ResultsIMMORTOOL demonstrated that published estimates suggesting a survival advantage from giving IVIG in STSS are explained, at least in part, by immortal time bias.

ConclusionsIMMORTOOL can quantify the potential for immortal time bias in observational analyses. This may help readers interrogate published studies. We do not advocate IMMORTOOL being used to justify naive analyses where the intervention could be fit as a time-varying exposure. To what extent giving IVIG in STSS improves survival remains uncertain.","NA","medrxiv",1736633251837

Despite this close interdependency between proteasome subunits, we demonstrate that knockouts from different proteasome subcomplexes result in distinct highly cellular phenotypes. In particular, depletion of 19S PSMD lid proteins, but not that of other proteasome subunits, prevents bipolar spindle assembly during mitosis, resulting in a mitotic arrest. We find that the monopolar spindle phenotype is caused by ubiquitin- independent proteasomal degradation of the motor protein KIF11 upon loss of 19S proteins. Thus, negative regulation of 20S-mediated proteasome degradation is essential for mitotic progression and 19S and 20S proteasome components can function independently outside of the canonical 26S structure. This work reveals a role for the proteasome in spindle formation and identifies the effects of ubiquitin- independent degradation on cell cycle control.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

The rate of mutations depends on the mutation type (e.g., A[-&gt;]C, A[-&gt;]G, etc.) and can vary between sites in the viral genome. Understanding this variation can shed light on the mutational processes at play, and is crucial for quantitative modeling of viral evolution. Using the millions of available SARS-CoV-2 full-genome sequences, we estimate rates of synonymous mutations for all 12 possible nucleotide mutation types and examine how much these rates vary between sites. We find a surprisingly high level of variability and several striking patterns: the rates of four mutation types suddenly increase at one of two gene boundaries; the rates of most mutation types strongly depend on a sites local sequence context, with up to 56-fold differences between contexts; consistent with a previous study, the rates of some mutation types are lower at sites engaged in RNA secondary structure. A simple log-linear model of these features explains [~]15-60% of the fold-variation of mutation rates between sites, depending on mutation type; more complex models only modestly improve predictive power out of sample. We estimate the fitness effect of each mutation based on the number of times it actually occurs versus the number of times it is expected to occur based on the model. We identify several small regions of the genome where synonymous or noncoding mutations occur much less often than expected, indicative of strong purifying selection on the RNA sequence that is independent of protein sequence. Overall, this work expands our basic understanding of SARS-CoV-2s evolution by characterizing the viruss mutation process at the level of individual sites and uncovering several striking mutational patterns that arise from unknown mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

This was echoed in Prof. Rita Contis September 17, 2024, Senate Finance Committee testimony.

MethodsTo test the IRAs impacts on early-stage investments targeting therapeutics for the Medicare-aged population, a longitudinal dataset of commercially sponsored clinical trials by companies with a market valuation < $2 billion was obtained from the BioMedTracker database from January 1, 2018, to May 6, 2024. These trials were filtered to match early-stage investments to lead assets undergoing clinical development.

ResultsFrom 161 lead assets with 897 investments, we find the aggregated total into large molecules in 2024 was 10 times larger than that for small molecules, which underwent a 70% decline after passage of the IRA. Individual investments made into small molecules decline by minus one-half as exposure to the Medicare-aged population increases after the passage of the IRA (p < 0.0018). Testing large molecule investments by their exposure to Medicare post IRAs passage is statistically inconclusive.

Research ConclusionsThis study presents evidence of a decline in the development of new therapies targeting the Medicare-aged population since the passage of the IRA. If these impacts were due to the economic downturn post-pandemic, we would observe statistically similar results in both large and small molecules. However, the results by molecule type diverge. Investors perceive large molecules to be of a lower investment risk relative to small molecules after IRAs passage.","NA","medrxiv",1736633251837

A key question is how self-identification with discrete, predefined race and ethnicity categories compares to genetic diversity at continental and subcontinental levels. To contextualize the genetic diversity in All of Us, we analyzed ~2 million common variants from unrelated 230,016 whole genomes using classical population genetics methods, alongside reference panels such as the 1000 Genomes Project, Human Genome Diversity Project, and Simons Genome Diversity Project. Our analysis reveals that participants within self-identified race and ethnicity groups exhibit a gradient of genetic diversity rather than discrete clusters. The distributions of continental and subcontinental ancestries show considerable variation within race and ethnicity, both nationally and across states, reflecting the historical impacts of U.S. colonization, the transatlantic slave trade, and recent migrations. All of Us samples filled most gaps along the top five principal components of genetic diversity in current global reference panels. Notably, Hispanic or Latino participants spanned much of the three-way (African, Native American, and European) admixture spectrum. Ancestry was significantly associated with body mass index (BMI) and height, even after adjusting for socio-environmental covariates. In particular, West-Central and East African ancestries showed opposite associations with BMI. This study emphasizes the importance of assessing subcontinental ancestries, as the continental approach is insufficient to control for confounding in genetic association studies.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

However, due to the non-linear relationship between disease liability and disease prevalence, risk variants have more severe phenotypic consequences in high-risk polygenic backgrounds. Consequently, selecting individuals with appropriate polygenic backgrounds may improve variant characterization experiments, as disease-relevant phenotypes may be masked or revealed in different genomic contexts. Simultaneously, selection has limited power to eliminate risk variants because they have minimal impact in low polygenic risk backgrounds, yet is more powerful with higher polygenicity because more individuals achieve genetic and phenotypic extremes. This dependence on polygenic background means that selection acting on an allele should be modeled as a distribution that differs across populations, time, environments, and individuals rather than as a single value. Overall, considering polygenic backgrounds will be critical when investigating the origins of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

Developing such strategies requires a thorough understanding of the complex roles and interactions of key inhabitants within coral holobionts. Using a metatranscriptomics approach, we investigated the transcriptionally active microbiome of the healthy stony coral Porites lutea, focusing on the coral tissue, the green endolithic algal layer (Ostreobium layer), and the deeper coral skeleton. We show distinct, metabolically active communities within these compartments and highlight substantial metabolic redundancy across carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur pathways. Our study provides the first transcriptomic evidence of the ability of Ostreobium to transfer fixed carbon to other members of the holobiont and the coral host. Additionally, we identified critical roles of diverse coral holobiont members in nutrient cycling and maintaining homeostasis through scavenging of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. This study provides novel molecular-level understanding of the functional roles played by diverse coral holobiont members in their respective compartments and underscores that corals harbour several distinct microbiomes with a wide array of functions.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

Cardiovascular involvement is frequently reported in LC, often accompanied by a spectrum of related symptoms. Dysregulated lipid profiles and elevated atherogenic indices have been implicated in LC, yet no comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis has specifically addressed these biomarkers.

ObjectiveThis study aims to systematically evaluate atherogenic indices and lipid-related biomarkers in individuals with LC compared to healthy controls.

MethodsA systematic search was conducted in databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, SCOPUS, and SciFinder from September to November 2024. Eligible studies reported lipid biomarker data for LC patients and controls, yielding 44 studies encompassing 8,114 participants (3,353 LC patients and 4,761 controls).

ResultsLC patients exhibited significant elevations in Castelli Risk Indexes 1 (standardized mean difference, SMD = 0.199; 95% confidence intervals, CI: 0.087-0.312) and 2 (SMD = 0.202; 95% CI: 0.087-0.318). Atherogenic ratios, including triglyceride (TG)/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (SMD = 0.294; 95% CI: 0.155-0.433), (TG + low-density lipoprotein, LDL + very low-density lipoprotein, VLDL)/(HDL + apolipoprotein, ApoA) (SMD = 0.264; 95% CI: 0.145-0.383), and ApoB/ApoA (SMD = 0.515; 95% CI: 0.233-0.796), were also significantly elevated. Additionally, LC patients demonstrated increased levels of LDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and ApoB, alongside reduced HDL and ApoA levels. Results were free from publication bias.

ConclusionLC is associated with a pro-atherogenic lipid profile, marked by increased atherogenic components and decreased protective lipid biomarkers. These findings highlight a potential heightened risk for cardiovascular complications in LC patients, warranting further clinical and mechanistic investigations.","NA","medrxiv",1736633251837

However, the diversity of bat-borne coronaviruses remains poorly characterized in many geographical areas. Here, we recovered six complete coronavirus genomes by performing a metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from hundreds of individual bats captured in Spain, a country with high bat species diversity. Three of these genomes corresponded to potentially novel coronavirus species belonging to the alphacoronavirus genus. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that some of these viruses are closely related to coronaviruses previously described in bats from other countries, suggesting the existence of a shared viral reservoir worldwide. Using viral pseudotypes, we investigated the receptor usage of the identified viruses and found that one of them can use human and bat ACE2, highlighting its zoonotic potential. However, the receptor usage of the other viruses remains unknown. This study broadens our understanding of coronavirus diversity and identifies research priorities for the prevention of zoonotic viral outbreaks.

Author summaryBats carry many viruses, some of which can cross the species barrier and infect humans, a process known as zoonosis. In particular, bat-borne coronaviruses pose a significant threat to human health. To improve our pandemic preparedness, it is essential to characterize the diversity and zoonotic potential of bat coronaviruses. However, such research efforts have historically suffered from a strong geographical bias. For example, despite the rich bat diversity in Spain, few studies have searched for coronaviruses in Iberian bats. Here, we used viral metagenomics to test for the presence of coronaviruses in more than 200 bat samples collected across Spain. We detected six complete coronaviruses, three of which were proposed to be new viral species. We characterized their relationship to previously identified viruses and their ability to use known coronavirus receptors to enter cells, demonstrating that one virus could use human ACE2 as a receptor. Our results highlight the diversity of bat-borne coronaviruses in Spain, their zoonotic potential, and the need to better characterize coronavirus diversity worldwide.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

Using scRNA-sequencing we identify a type of deep layer near projecting neuron that is most robustly regulated in the medial prefrontal cortex of female mice 24h after psilocybin. We show that this cell-type specificity does not align with 5-HT2A receptor expression but is consistent with the integrated signaling via cell-type specific 5-HT receptor co-expression patterns. Cell-cell communication reveals that psilocybin also broadly suppresses GABAergic inhibition. Ultimately, psilocybin induces plasticity-related genes in subsets of excitatory neurons suggesting that psilocybin induces sustained increases in neuroplasticity in the mouse mPFC. Our findings point to L5/6NP neurons as a key mediator of psilocybins neuroplastic effects.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

Using live imaging of second trimester human fetal tissue and cortical organoids, we identify two independent translocation modes for bRG cell colonization of the human neocortex. On top of an actomyosin-dependent movement called mitotic somal translocation (MST), we identify a microtubule-dependent motion occurring during interphase, that we call interphasic somal translocation (IST). We show that IST is driven by the LINC complex, through the nuclear envelope recruitment of the dynein motor and of its activator LIS1. Consequently, IST severely altered in LIS1 patient-derived cortical organoids. We also demonstrate that MST occurs during prometaphase and is a mitotic spindle translocation event. MST is controlled by the mitotic cell rounding molecular pathway, via Moesin and Vimentin, driving translocation. We report that 85% of bRG cell translocation is due to IST, for a total movement of 0,67 mm per month of human fetal gestation. Our work identifies how bRG cells colonize the human fetal cortex, and further shows that IST and MST are conserved in bRG-related migrating glioblastoma cells.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

In both injuries, de novo hepatocytes emerged alongside existing ones. Single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing with Cre-driver lines generated by genome editing identified cholangiocytes as the source of de novo hepatocytes.

In Ireland, limited genetic data are available regarding the diversity of Culicoides species. This study represents the first attempt to characterise Culicoides in this region using molecular techniques.

MethodsAdult Culicoides samples were captured using Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OVI) traps across six locations in Ireland. Subsequent molecular analyses involved polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) and the internal transcriber spacer (ITS) barcoding regions to obtain species identities. Additionally, using both markers, we inferred the population genetic structure and potential colonisation pathways of Culicoides obsoletus sensu stricto (s. str.), the major vector species in Ireland.

ResultsDNA barcoding facilitated identification of 177 specimens. Eight common Culicoides species were identified through DNA barcoding of CO1 and ITS gene regions. The presence of putative vectors of Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) were also confirmed, including species in the subgenus Avaritia (C. obsoletus s. str., C. scoticus, C. chiopterus, and C. dewulfi) and subgenus Culicoides s. str. (C. pulicaris and C. punctatus). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the relationship between these vector species and facilitated the placement of Culicoides sp. which could not be identified to species level through DNA barcoding. Haplotype network analysis of C. obsoletus showed that some haplotypes of these species are shared between Continental Europe, the UK, and Ireland, suggesting a possible incursion pathway for this vector.

ConclusionDNA barcoding employing a combination of two barcodes, CO1 and ITS, proved effective in identifying Culicoides, especially species within the obsoletus complex, which are difficult to morphologically distinguish. Our findings also suggest that investigation of the population genetic structure of Culicoides spp. could be used to model the potential introduction routes of midge-borne pathogens into the country.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

Axon diameter and myelination are closely interlinked, with axon diameter exerting a strong influence on myelination. Conversely, myelinating Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system can both positively and negatively affect axon diameter. However, whether axon diameter is regulated by CNS oligodendrocytes is less clear. Here, we investigated CNS axon diameter growth in the absence of myelin using mouse (Mbpshi/shi and Myrf conditional knockout) and zebrafish (olig2 morpholino) models. We find that neither the ensheathment of axons, nor the formation of compact myelin are required for CNS axons to achieve appropriate and diverse diameters. This indicates that developmental CNS axon diameter growth is independent of myelination, and shows that myelinating cells of CNS and PNS differentially influence axonal morphology.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

However, certain pathogens remain underexplored as targets for phage therapy, including the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis which causes infections in pigs and humans. Despite global efforts, the genome of only one infective S. suis phage has been described. Here, we report the isolation of two phages that infect S. suis: Bonnie and Clyde. The phages infect 58% of 100 S. suis strains tested, including representatives of seven different serotypes and thirteen known sequence types from diverse geographical origins. Clyde suppressed bacterial growth in vitro within two multi-strain mixes designed to simulate a polyclonal S. suis infection. Both phages demonstrated stability across various temperatures and pH levels, highlighting their potential to withstand storage conditions and maintain viability in delivery formulations. Genome comparisons revealed that neither phage shares significant nucleotide identity with any cultivated phages in the NCBI database and thereby represent novel species belonging to two distinct novel genera. This study is the first to investigate the adhesion devices of S. suis infecting phages. Structure prediction and analysis of adhesion devices with AlphaFold2 revealed two distinct lineages of S. suis phages: Streptococcus thermophilus-like (Bonnie) and S. suis-like (Clyde). The structural similarities between the adhesion devices of Bonnie and S. thermophilus phages, despite the lack of nucleotide similarity and differing ecological niches, suggest a common ancestor or convergent evolution, highlighting evolutionary links between pathogenic and non-pathogenic streptococcal species.

Using state-of-the-art knock-in zebrafish models and single-cell transcriptomics we reveal the differential expression patterns of the different her genes, of which her2, her6, and her9, were identified as specific molecular signatures for distinguishing different ductal cell types with unique morphology and spatial distribution. Particularly, her9 serves as a pan-ductal marker and shows responsiveness to the synergistic effect of Notch and BMP signaling. By analyzing multiple single-cell RNA-seq datasets, we identify numerous ductal markers which are functional proteins for ductal integrity, and most notably CRISPR mutagenesis demonstrates that her9 is essential for hepatocyte recovery. Using multiple transgenic and knock-in zebrafish lines and genetic fate mapping, we provide a detailed characterization of the ductal remodeling process under development and extreme loss of intra-hepatic duct, highlighting the remarkable ductal cell plasticity.

However, it has hitherto been difficult to uncouple the importance of these two advantages of dioecy. Here, we estimate the selfing rate and fitness gain curves with and without inbreeding depression in wind-pollinated Mercurialis annua, based on variation in sex allocation among hermaphrodites that evolved from dioecy following the experimental removal of males. Because males had been removed, we could rule out any important contribution to disruptive selection due to advantages of sexual specialisation, allowing us to focus in inbreeding effects. Our results confirm a tradeoff between male and female allocation in M. annua, as assumed in sex-allocation theory. The individual selfing rates increased with male allocation, greatly altering the female and male fitness gain curves under strong inbreeding depression. There was strong disruptive selection on sex allocation due to its interaction with the mating system. Taken together, our study demonstrates that inbreeding avoidance on its own can lead to disruptive selection on sex allocation and thus the selection and maintenance of dioecy under wind pollination.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is important early in metastasis to enable cancer cells to detach from neighboring cells, become migratory, and escape the primary tumor. While different phases of metastasis expose cells to variable nutrient environments and demands, the metabolic requirements and plasticity of each step are uncertain. Here we show that EMT and primary tumor escape are stimulated by disrupted oxidative metabolism. Using Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) patient samples, we identified the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor NDUFA4L2 as upregulated in cells undergoing EMT. Deletion of NDUFA4L2 enhanced oxidative metabolism and prevented EMT and metastasis while NDUFA4L2 overexpression enhanced these processes. Mechanistically, NDUFA4L2 suppressed oxidative phosphorylation and caused citric acid cycle intermediates to accumulate, which modified chromatin accessibility of EMT-related loci to drive primary tumor escape. The effect of impaired mitochondrial metabolism to drive EMT appeared general, as renal cell carcinoma patient tumors driven by fumarate hydratase mutations with disrupted oxidative phosphorylation were highly metastatic and also had robust EMT. These findings highlight the importance of dynamic shifts in metabolism for cell migration and metastasis, with mitochondrial impairment driving early phases of this process.

In this study, we report that during implantation, endometrial LE cells undergo partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) specifically at the implantation sites. This pEMT in the LE is critical, as the in vivo knockdown of the EMT transcription factor Twist2 inhibits embryo implantation. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in the expression of the transcription factor HOXA10 in LE cells at the implantation sites. Interestingly, LE cells from HOXA10-hypomorphic mice and human endometrial epithelial cells (RL95-2) with HOXA10 knockdown (HOXA10KD) also undergo pEMT and acquire a migratory phenotype in vitro, suggesting that the loss of HOXA10 drives pEMT in the endometrial epithelium. Transcriptome analysis of HOXA10KD cells revealed a higher pEMT score and differential expression of genes associated with cell migration and TGF-{beta} signaling pathways. We also identified the genome-wide occupancy sites of HOXA10 in human endometrial epithelial cells, uncovering 1,246 genes whose promoters are occupied by HOXA10 and are dysregulated in HOXA10KD cells. Functionally, these HOXA10 target genes fall into two broad categories: those involved in epithelial functions and those associated with mesenchymal functions. Collectively, our findings suggest that HOXA10 directly regulates genes to maintain endometrial cells in an epithelial state. Its loss activates mesenchymal genes while maintaining or inducing a distinct subset of epithelial genes, resulting in a pEMT phenotype. In summary, our study establishes pEMT in the LE as a critical step and reveals that the loss of HOXA10 triggers this process, enabling embryo implantation.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

Division of labour in synthetic microbial communities offers a promising approach to enhance metabolic efficiency and resilience in bioproduction. By distributing complex metabolic pathways across multiple subpopulations, the resource competition and metabolic burden imposed on an individual cell is reduced, potentially enabling more efficient production of target compounds. Violacein is a high-value pigment with anti-tumour properties that exemplifies such a challenge due to its complex bioproduction pathway, imposing a significant metabolic burden on host cells. In this study we investigated the benefits of division of labour for violacein production by splitting the violacein bioproduction pathway between two subpopulations of Escherichia coli based synthetic communities. We tested several pathway splitting strategies and reported that splitting the pathway into two subpopulations expressing VioABE and VioDC at a final composition of 60:40 yields a 2.5 fold increase in violacein production as compared to a monoculture. We demonstrated that the coculture outperforms the monoculture when both subpopulations exhibit similar metabolic burden levels, resulting in comparable growth rates, and when both subpopulations are present in sufficiently high proportions.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

This might directly impact myelinating oligodendrocytes as these are particularly vulnerable to metabolic insults. Importantly, oligodendroglial dysfunction and myelin alterations occur in most, if not all neurodegenerative diseases, and are associated with axonal pathology/loss. Thus, elucidating metabolic mechanisms required for oligodendroglial myelin maintenance and axonal support might be crucial to identify therapeutic targets to achieve neuroprotection. While monocarboxylates are important energy fuels for the CNS, their role in myelinating oligodendrocyte function remains unclear. Here we show that, just like neurons, myelinating oligodendrocytes express high affinity monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2) both in mice and humans, which is downregulated in progressive MS. While deletion of MCT2 in mouse oligodendrocytes did not affect the survival of these cells, it resulted in downregulation of lipid synthesis-associated enzymes and failure of myelin maintenance. Moreover, axonal upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase A concomitant with axonal damage was observed but could be alleviated by ketogenic diet. We conclude that oligodendroglial MCT2 is required for myelin maintenance and axonal support, which becomes altered in progressive MS, but may be compensated for by specific metabolic therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

However, challenges such as drug resistance remain significant in clinical applications. During mitosis, mRNA translation is generally downregulated, while non-canonical translation of specific transcripts proceeds. Here, we demonstrate that mitotic cancer cells redistribute ribosomes toward the 5 untranslated region (5 UTR) and the start of the coding sequence (CDS), enhancing the translation of thousands of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and upstream overlapping open reading frames (uoORFs). This mitotic induction of uORF/uoORF enriches the presentation of immunopeptides at the surface of cancer cells following treatment with mitotic inhibitors. Functional assays indicate the potential of such neoepitopes to provoke cancer-cell killing by T cells.

Synthetic promoters (SPs) designed to respond to the desired TFs can provide this regulation with compactness, specificity, and orthogonality. T cells display differentially expressed TFs according to the functional state. In solid tumors, the highly immunosuppressive TME and the chronic exposure to antigens lead to a progression of T cells from a functional to a dysfunctional state known as exhaustion (Tex), in which their power against cancer cells is strongly compromised. Importantly, this transition is accompanied by a marked increase of several TFs, among other factors, that drive targeted genetic programs. Strategies to detect and mitigate Tex are extremely needed. Here, we design SPs that respond to TFs differentially expressed in activated and exhausted T cells to enable new classifiers of the functional/dysfunctional states. We developed a library of over 80 SPs responsive to 7 TFs. The SPs showed broad strength of activation of reporter genes or immunomodulatory molecules in HEK293 and Jurkat T cell lines. Moreover, using a transfer learning strategy we show SPs strength predictability. By combining SPs responding to different TFs, we created Boolean logic gates and implemented a feed-forward design that was previously shown to reduce noise in the OFF-state. Finally, as proof of principle, we demonstrate the dynamic activation of the NR4A2-responsive SP according to the T cell state in primary human CD8+ T cells. Collectively we present a sensing platform that provides a versatile tool to study and monitor the dynamic changes occurring in T cells.

However, this phenomenon has yet to be documented for compounds that inhibit translation by the human ribosome. Here we use structure-based design to guide synthesis of molecules called interdictors that bind to the human ribosome PTC and act in a context-selective manner to inhibit translation elongation. Using ribosome profiling, in combination with in vitro biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy, we characterize the context selectivity of unique analogues and observe their preferred interactions with nascent chain residues with complementary properties. Furthermore, we present a structure for an interdictor bound to a portion of the MYC protein at [~] 1.9 [A] resolution and identify resulting structural rearrangements in both the nascent chain and ribosomal RNA.

Whereas RNAPII is very processive during mRNA transcription, it terminates rapidly during synthesis of many ncRNAs, particularly those that arise opportunistically from accessible chromatin at gene promoters or enhancers. The divergent fates of mRNA versus ncRNA species raise many questions about how RNAPII and associated machineries discriminate functional from spurious transcription. The Restrictor complex, comprised of the RNA binding protein ZC3H4 and RNAPII-interacting protein WDR82, has been implicated in restraining the expression of ncRNAs. However, the determinants of Restrictor targeting and the mechanism of transcription suppression remain unclear. Here, we investigate Restrictor using unbiased sequence screens, and rapid protein degradation followed by nascent RNA sequencing. We find that Restrictor promiscuously suppresses early elongation by RNAPII, but this activity is blocked at most mRNAs by the presence of a 5' splice site. Consequently, Restrictor is a critical determinant of transcription directionality at divergent promoters and prevents transcriptional interference. Finally, our data indicate that rather than directly terminating RNAPII, Restrictor acts by reducing the rate of transcription elongation, rendering RNAPII susceptible to early termination by other machineries.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

One of the hallmarks of ageing is stem cell exhaustion which occurs due to dynamic changes in the stem cell - niche microenvironment. Ageing affects stem cell potency impacting self-renewal and differentiation trajectories. Blood cell homeostasis in the hematopoietic system is tightly regulated by a fine balance between stemness and differentiation. Here, we employ the Drosophila hematopoietic organ, the larval lymph gland (LG) to investigate the impact of modulating cellular ageing on organ homeostasis. LG consists of a Posterior Signalling Center (PSC) that acts as a stem cell niche and maintains the prohemocytes housed in the Medullary Zone (MZ). Cortical Zone (CZ) consists of differentiated hemocytes namely plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes. Intricate signalling networks active in the PSC and MZ orchestrate and regulate homeostasis. In this study, we characterize the effect of genetic perturbation of the molecular circuitry of ageing locally and systemically to investigate its effect on LG blood cell homeostasis. Genetic modulation of cellular ageing displays traditional hallmarks of ageing validating our model in the LG. Our results indicate that induction of accelerated ageing both locally and systemically leads to a reduction in stem cell niche size, DNA damage accumulation and increased progenitor differentiation whereas decelerated ageing shows an opposite trend. We show that the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) pathway is activated upon inducing accelerated ageing in the LG hemocytes possibly to recoup back to homeostatic conditions. Furthermore, LGs of ISR pathway mutants or upon perturbation of ISR pathway components in prohemocytes show increased blood cell differentiation indicating disruption of homeostasis. Genetic epistasis analysis shows that ectopic over-expression of ISR pathway genes in an accelerated ageing scenario over and above the existing levels can rescue the defects in blood cell homeostasis. Overall, our study explores how modulation of cellular aging locally or systemically can impact tissue homeostasis. Our research paves way to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying an aged versus young stem cell-niche microenvironment and how its abrogation may lead to onset of disease.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

The hosts nutritional immunity restrict access to metals, while a successful pathogen overcomes these restrictions using dedicated uptake pathways. Pseudopaline is a high-affinity metallophore allowing Pseudomonas aeruginosa to acquire zinc in chelated environments. We demonstrate that this pathway is the last-resort solution to acquire zinc for this dreadful pathogen. The capacity to provide this metal to zinc-metalloproteins drives clinically relevant phenotypes, such as the capacity to form a mature and antibiotic-tolerant biofilm, or to affect the outcome of an infection. These results place pseudopaline as a potential drug target for blocking P. aeruginosa pathogenic capacity and resensitizing established biofilm to classic antibiotic treatment.

ABSTRACTBiological metals are essential trace elements which are required by metalloproteins, involved in virtually every cellular, structural and catalytic function of the bacterial cell. Bacterial pathogenesis involves a tug-of-war between the host nutritional immunity, sequestering essential metals and the invading pathogens that deploy high-metal affinity uptake strategies in order to overcome these defence mechanisms. Metallophores are high-affinity, low-molecular mass metal chelators produced and secreted by bacteria to access chelated metals from the environment. Pseudopaline is a metallophore produced and secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa to acquire zinc when the bioavailability of this metal is severely restricted, as in the presence of a strong metal chelator such as EDTA, or during infections when the nutritional immunity of the host is active, in mammals through the production of the zing binding protein calprotectin. We show that under the conditions of metal deprivation, a pseudopaline-deficient P. aeruginosa strain exhibit a severe intracellular zinc deficiency, establishing that the pseudopaline pathway is the last-resort and unique pathway for the bacteria to acquire zinc under these restricted growth conditions. The present study explores the pleiotropic role of pseudopaline-mediated zinc acquisition on several clinically relevant phenotypes and its capacity to drive infection outcomes, placing this machinery as a promising therapeutic target for P. aeruginosas infection, acting synergistically as a pathogenicity determinant as well as an adaptative trait allowing the establishment of a mature and antibiotic resistance biofilm necessary for recalcitrant chronic infections.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

Here we developed novel settlement substrates that modify the local chemical and hydrodynamic environments and provide local alkalinity enhancement (AE) within the laminar boundary layer to aid in coral restoration. Cement tiles with four different chemistries and two different surface topographies were tested in a novel flume system to quantify their ability to change local pH under reef-like conditions and their effect on larval settlement, survivorship, and growth of the endangered Caribbean coral, Orbicella faveolata. Chemistry had a minimal effect on the initial settlement of coral larvae, with textured tiles preferred over smooth tiles. However, substrates that created a more alkaline local environment increased post-settlement survivorship. The increased survivorship of O. faveolata recruits on AE tiles was not due to increased growth on AE tiles, although trends in growth were dependent on chemistry and topography of tiles. Our results indicate that mixing sodium bicarbonate into the cement used to fabricate artificial reef structures could be an effective means to enhance the development of coral cover.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

This includes loss of cell volume whilst maintaining membrane integrity to allow the expansion of the underlying LR primordia (LRPs). These accommodation responses are regulated by auxin-mediated signaling, specifically through Aux/IAA proteins, involving IAA3/SHY2. Plants that express a stabilized version of SHY2, shy2-2, in differentiated endodermal cells, CASP1pro::shy2-2 plants, fail to make LRs. Exogenous treatment with 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) was reported to partially restore LR formation in this spatial accommodation mutant. Using treatments with auxins with different transport properties, such as NAA, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), we assessed the ability of each auxin to rescue LR formation in CASP1pro::shy2-2 roots. This revealed that IAA is the most effective in partially restoring LR development, NAA is effective in inducing LRPs but cannot maintain their canonical phenotype, whereas 2,4-D induces non-controlled cell divisions. In addition, we show that in CASP1pro::shy2-2 roots, AUX1 appears to be repressed in the zone where oscillation of the auxin response have been described. Our study advances the understanding of auxin-regulated spatial accommodation mechanisms during LRP formation and highlights the complex interplay of auxin transport and signaling in bypassing the endodermal constraints.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

This process involves significant gene expression changes regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. We have previously shown that a transcript encoding the subunit 3 of the Superkiller Complex (SKI), which guides mRNAs to the exosome for 3'-to-5' degradation, is required for nodule formation and bacterial persistence within the nodule, as well as the induction of early nodulation genes (e.g. MtENOD40) during the Medicago truncatula-Sinorhizobium meliloti symbiosis. Here, we reveal through transcript degradome analysis that knockdown of MtSKI3 impairs the miR172-directed endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA encoding Nodule Number Control 1 (MtNNC1), an APETALA2 transcription factor that negatively modulates nodulation. Specific silencing of MtNNC1 enhances nodule number, bacterial infection, and the induction of MtENOD40 upon inoculation with S. meliloti whereas overexpression of a miR172-resistant form of MtNNC1 significantly reduces nodule formation. This work identifies miR172 cleavage of MtNNC1 and its control by MtSKI3, a component of the 3'-to-5' mRNA degradation pathway, as a new regulatory hub controlling indeterminate nodulation.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

Different signals, including auxin, extracellular ATP and RALF1 peptide, all induce cytosolic calcium transients and apoplastic ROS bursts. Genetic and optogenetic manipulations identified calcium transients as necessary and sufficient for ROS bursts via activation of NADPH oxidases RBOHC and RBOHF. Apoplastic ROS bursts are not required but rather limit the gravity-induced root bending. Root bending is sensed by stretch-activated calcium channel MCA1 leading to NADPH oxidase activation at the stretched side. The resulting ROS production stiffens cell wall for better soil penetration. Apoplastic ROS thus provides a means to balance tissue flexibility and stiffness to efficiently navigate soil.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

Current methods for quantifying bacterial biomass in stool, such as flow cytometry, qPCR, or spike-ins (i.e., adding cells or DNA from an organism not normally found in a sample), can be labor-intensive, costly, and confounded by factors like water content, DNA extraction efficiency, PCR inhibitors, and other technical challenges that add bias and noise. We propose a simple, cost-effective approach that circumvents some of these technical challenges: directly estimating bacterial biomass from metagenomes using bacterial-to-host (B:H) read ratios. We compare B:H ratios to the standard methods outlined above, demonstrating that B:H ratios are useful proxies for bacterial biomass in stool and possibly in other host-associated substrates. We show how B:H ratios can be used to track antibiotic treatment response and recovery in both mice and humans, which showed 403-fold and 45-fold reductions in bacterial biomass during antibiotic treatment, respectively. Our results indicate that host and bacterial metagenomic DNA fractions in human stool fluctuate longitudinally around a stable mean in healthy individuals, and the average host read fraction varies across healthy individuals by < 8-9 fold. B:H ratios offer a convenient alternative to other absolute biomass quantification methods, without the need for additional measurements, experimental design considerations, or machine learning algorithms, enabling retrospective absolute biomass estimates from existing stool metagenomic data.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

Ablation of all three neuronal subtypes reduced the oscillation frequency. Activation of excitatory V2a neurons enhanced the oscillation frequency, while activating inhibitory V1 neurons caused atonia. These findings required the development of a novel neuromechanical model that consists of flexor and extensor modules coupled via inhibition, in which rhythm in each module is generated by self-bursting excitatory populations and accelerated by intra-module inhibition. Inter-module inhibition coordinates the phases of flexor and extensor activity and slows the oscillations, while facilitation mechanisms in excitatory neurons explain the V2a activation-driven increase in frequency.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

Changes in gene expression play a critical role in the cellular response to hypoxia, enabling cells to adapt to reduced oxygen availability by regulating metabolism, angiogenesis, and survival pathways. These changes are primarily mediated by the HIF family of transcription factors, however other transcription factors such as NF-{kappa}B, are also activated in the hypoxic response. Although NF-{kappa}B is known to be activated under hypoxic conditions the extent of NF-{kappa}B contributions to the hypoxic response remains poorly understood. In this study we analyse hypoxia-induced NF-{kappa}B dependent gene expression, to define the NF-{kappa}B-dependent hypoxic signature. Our analysis reveals that a significant proportion of hypoxia-induced gene expression changes are NF-{kappa}B dependent, with majority of the hypoxia downregulated genes requiring NF-{kappa}B for their repression. We show that, while the NF-{kappa}B-mediated hypoxic response may vary between cell types, there are a core subset of hypoxia inducible genes that require NF-{kappa}B across multiple cell backgrounds. We demonstrate that NF-{kappa}B is critical for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and regulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation under hypoxic conditions. This work highlights that NF-{kappa}B has a central role in hypoxia response, regulating a broader set of genes than previously thought, providing new understanding into the gene expression regulation by hypoxia and NF-{kappa}B.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

Our SAR116 isolates belonged to three groups within subclade I representing distinct genera with different morphologies and varied phenotypic responses to salinity and temperature. Overall, SAR116 genomes encoded differences in vitamin and amino acid synthesis, trace metal transport, and osmolyte synthesis and transport. They also had genetic potential for diverse sulfur oxidation metabolisms, placing SAR116 at the confluence of the organic and inorganic sulfur pools. SAR116 subclades showed distinct patterns in habitat preferences across open ocean, coastal, and estuarine environments, and three of our isolates represented the most abundant coastal and estuarine subclade.

However, the absence of structural information on how the enzyme binds inhibitors has made optimization of lead compounds challenging. We used electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of NDH-2 from Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fast-growing non-pathogenic model for respiration in M. tuberculosis, both alone and in complex with a 2-mercapto-quinazolinone inhibitor. The structure shows that active mycobacterial NDH-2 is dimeric, with the dimerization interface stabilized by an extended C-terminal  helix not found in NDH-2 from other bacterial genera.

The arrangement of monomers in the dimer differs from the arrangement described for other prokaryotic NDH-2 dimers, instead resembling dimers formed by NDH-2 in eukaryotes. Density for the 2-mercapto-quinazolinone in the menaquinone-binding site shows that the inhibitor blocks menaquinone reduction through direct interaction with the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor.

We evaluated the performance of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) guided by prompt instructions and chain of thought (CoT) for this task.

MethodsFrom consecutive transthoracic echocardiographies performed in our center, we utilized 200 random reports from 2019 for prompt optimization and 1000 from 2023 for evaluation. Five instruction-tuned LLMs (Qwen2.0-72B, Llama3.0-70B, Mixtral8-46.7B, Llama3.0-8B, and Phi3.0-3.8B) were guided by prompt instructions with and without CoT to classify prosthetic valve presence and VHD severity. Performance was evaluated using classification metrics against expert-labeled ground truth. Mean Squared Error (MSE) was also calculated for predicted severitys deviation from actual severity.

ResultsWith CoT prompting, Llama3.0-70B and Qwen2.0 achieved the highest performance (accuracy: 99.1% and 98.9% for VHD severity; 100% and 99.9% for prosthetic valve; MSE: 0.02 and 0.05, respectively). Smaller models showed lower accuracy for VHD severity (54.1-85.9%) but maintained high accuracy for prosthetic valve detection (>96%). CoT reasoning yielded higher accuracy for larger models while increasing processing time from 2-25 to 67-154 seconds per report. Based of CoT reasonings, the wrong predictions were mainly due to model outputs being influenced by irrelevant information in the text or failure to follow the prompt instructions.

ConclusionsOur study demonstrates the near-perfect performance of open-source LLMs for automated echocardiography report interpretation with purpose of registry formation and disease surveillance. While larger models achieved exceptional accuracy through prompt optimization, practical implementation requires balancing performance with computational efficiency.","NA","medrxiv",1736633251837

To address this, we tagged engram cells in the auditory cortex during tone fear conditioning and compared their dendritic and somatic properties with neighbouring non-engram cells. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we show that tuft dendrites of engram cells had dampened, but synchronous, activity during recall. Ex vivo patch-clamp recordings illustrated that engram cells were preferentially connected with neighbouring engram cells and had decreased excitability due to a transient increase in Ih current. Together, these findings reveal Ih-driven intrinsic plasticity which leads to specific information processing in engram cells.","NA","biorxiv",1736633251837

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1736633251837

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1736633251837
