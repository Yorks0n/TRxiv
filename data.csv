Differences in the cell of origin provide a potential explanation, but these assays have traditionally relied on surface markers, lacking the clonal resolution to distinguish heterogeneous subsets of stem and progenitor cells. To address this challenge, we developed STRACK, an unbiased framework to longitudinally trace clonal gene expression and expansion dynamics before and after acquisition of cancer mutations. We studied two different leukemia driver mutations, Dnmt3a-R882H and Npm1cA, and found that the response to both mutations was highly variable across different stem cell states. Specifically, a subset of differentiation-biased stem cells, which normally become outcompeted with time, can efficiently expand with both mutations. Npm1c mutations surprisingly reversed the intrinsic bias of the clone-of-origin, with stem-biased clones giving rise to more mature malignant states. We propose a clonal reaction norm, in which pre-existing clonal states show different cancer phenotypic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Here, as proof of concept, we searched for viral remnants in sequencing reads of Neanderthal genome data by mapping to adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus, which are double stranded DNA viruses that may establish lifelong latency and can, produce persistent infections. The reconstructed ancient viral genomes of adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus revealed conserved segments, with nucleotide similarity to extant viral genomes, and variable regions in coding regions with substantial divergence to extant close relatives. Sequencing reads mapped to extant viral genomes showed deamination patterns of ancient DNA and that these ancient viral genomes showed divergence consistent with the age of these samples ({approx}50,000 years) and viral evolutionary rates (10-5 to 10-8 substitutions/site/year). Analysis of random effects shows that the Neanderthal mapping to genomes of extant persistent viruses is above the expected by random similarities of short reads. Also, negative control with a nonpersistent DNA virus does not yield statistically significant assemblies. This work demonstrates the feasibility of identifying viral genome remnants in archaeological samples with signal-to-noise assessment.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

LiftOn's protein-centric algorithm considers both types of alignments, chooses optimal open reading frames, resolves overlapping gene loci, and finds additional gene copies where they exist.

These neurological symptoms frequently persist for months (post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 or PASC). The molecular origins of neuro-COVID and how it contributes to PASC are unknown, however a growing body of research highlights that the self-assembly of protein fragments from SARS-CoV-2 into amyloid nanofibrils may play a causative role. Previously, we identified two fragments from the proteins Open Reading Frame 6 (ORF6) and ORF10 that self-assemble into neurotoxic amyloid assemblies. Here we further our understanding of the self-assembly mechanisms and nano-architectures formed by these fragments as well as performing a more in-depth study of the biological responses of co-cultured neurons. By solubilising the peptides in a fluorinated solvent we eliminate insoluble aggregates in the starting materials (seeds) that change the polymorphic landscape of the assemblies. The resultant assemblies are dominated by structures with higher free energies (e.g. ribbons and amorphous aggregates) that are less toxic to cultured neurons. We also show the first direct evidence of cellular uptake by viral amyloids. This work highlights the importance of understanding the polymorphic behaviour of amyloids particularly in the context of neuro-COVID and PASC.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

However, if cellular environment is the only determinant of glycosylation, all sites should receive the same glycans on average. This template-free assertion is inconsistent with observations of microheterogeneity-wherein each site receives distinct and reproducible glycan structures. Here, we test the assumption of template-free glycan biosynthesis. Through structural analysis of site-specific glycosylation data, we find protein-sequence and structural features that predict specific glycan features. To quantify these relationships, we present a new amino acid substitution matrix that describes glycoimpact-how glycosylation varies with protein structure. High-glycoimpact amino acids co-evolve with glycosites, and glycoimpact is high when estimates of amino acid conservation and variant pathogenicity diverge. We report hundreds of disease variants near glycosites with high-glycoimpact, including several with known links to aberrant glycosylation (e.g., Oculocutaneous Albinism, Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker, and Gaucher's Disease). Finally, we validate glycoimpact quantification by studying oligomannose-complex glycan ratios on HIV ENV, differential sialylation on IgG3 Fc, differential glycosylation on SARS-CoV-2 Spike, and fucose-modulated function of a tuberculosis monoclonal antibody. In all, we show glycan biosynthesis is accurately guided by specific, genetically-encoded rules, and this presents a plausible refutation to the assumption of template-free glycosylation.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

We uncover codon usage as a previously unrecognized contributor to efficient genetic code expansion using non-native codons. Relying only on conventional E. coli strains with native ribosomes, we develop a novel plasmid-based codon compression strategy that minimizes context dependence and improves ncAA incorporation at quadruplet codons. We confirm that this strategy is compatible with all known genetic code expansion resources, which allows us to identify 12 mutually orthogonal tRNA-synthetase pairs. Enabled by these findings, we evolve and optimize five tRNA-synthetase pairs to incorporate a broad repertoire of ncAAs at orthogonal quadruplet codons. Finally, we extend these resources to an in vivo biosynthesis platform that can readily create >100 new-to-nature peptide macrocycles bearing up to three unique ncAAs. Given the generality of our approach and streamlined resources, our findings will accelerate innovations in multiplexed genetic code expansion and enable the discovery of chemically diverse biomolecules for researcher-defined applications.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Heterotrophic flagellates, often branching deeply in phylogenetic trees, are arguably the most diverse eukaryotes. However, many of them remain undersampled and/or incertae sedis. Here, we conducted comprehensive phylogenomics analyses with an expanded taxon sampling of early-branching protists including 22 newly sequenced transcriptomes (apusomonads, ancyromonads, Meteora). They support the monophyly of Opimoda, one of the largest eukaryotic supergroups, with CRuMs being sister to the Amorphea (amoebozoans, breviates, apusomonads, and opisthokonts - including animals and fungi-), and the ancyromonads+malawimonads clade. By mapping traits onto this phylogenetic framework, we infer a biflagellate opimodan ancestor with an excavate-like feeding groove. Breviates and apusomonads retained the ancestral biflagellate state. Other Amorphea lost one or both flagella, enabling the evolution of amoeboid shapes, novel feeding modes, and palintomic cell division resulting in multinucleated cells, which likely facilitated the subsequent evolution of fungal and metazoan multicellularity.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

To benefit navigation, this representation must be dynamically related to surrounding locations. A candidate mechanism for linking places along an animal's path has been described in place cells, where the sequence of spikes within each cycle of the hippocampal theta oscillation encodes a trajectory from the animal's current location towards upcoming locations. In mazes that bifurcate, such trajectories alternately traverse the two upcoming arms as the animal approaches the choice point, raising the possibility that the trajectories express available forward paths encoded on previous trials. However, to bridge the animal's path with the wider environment, beyond places previously or subsequently visited, an experience-independent spatial sampling mechanism might be required. Here we show in freely moving rats, that within individual theta cycles, ensembles of grid cells and place cells encode a position signal that sweeps linearly outwards from the animal's location into the ambient environment, with sweep direction alternating stereotypically between left and right across successive theta cycles. These sweeps were accompanied by, and aligned with, a similarly alternating directional signal in a discrete population of parasubiculum cells with putative connections to grid cells via conjunctive gridxdirection cells. Sweeps extended into never-visited locations that were inaccessible to the animal and persisted during REM sleep. Sweep directions could be explained by an algorithm that maximizes cumulative coverage of surrounding space. The sustained and unconditional expression of theta-patterned left-right-alternating sweeps in the entorhinal-hippocampal positioning system provides an efficient 'look-around' mechanism for sampling locations beyond the travelled path.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

It is debated whether these differ based primarily on culturally specific, learned features, or if acoustical features can reliably distinguish them. We study the spectro-temporal modulation patterns of vocalizations produced by 369 people living in 21 urban, rural, and small-scale societies across six continents. Specific ranges of spectral and temporal modulations, overlapping within categories and across societies, significantly differentiate speech from song. Machine-learning classification shows that this effect is cross-culturally robust, vocalizations being reliably classified solely from their spectro-temporal features across all 21 societies. Listeners unfamiliar with the cultures classify these vocalizations using similar spectro-temporal cues as the machine learning algorithm. Finally, spectro-temporal features are better able to discriminate song from speech than a broad range of other acoustical variables, suggesting that spectro-temporal modulation--a key feature of auditory neuronal tuning--accounts for a fundamental difference between these categories.

However, unintended bystander editing beyond the target nucleotide poses a challenge to their translation into effective therapies. While many efforts have been made in the design of a universal enzyme with minimal bystander editing, the context dependent activity represents a major challenge for base editing-based therapies. In this work, we designed a sequence-specific guide RNA library with 3 prime-extensions and detected guides that were able to reduce bystander and increase editing efficiency in a context dependent manner. The best candidate was later used for phage assisted non-continuous evolution to find a new generation of precise base editors. Simultaneously, we use protein language models trained on massive protein sequence datasets to find the evolutionarily plausible mutational patterns that can improve deaminase activity and precision. Both strategies provide a collection of precise TadA variants that not only drastically reduced bystander edits, but also was not in detriment of on-target activity.

Although such host-induced gene silencing is well-documented, the molecular mechanisms by which RNAs can move from the cytoplasm of plant cells across the plasma membrane of both the host cell and fungal cell are poorly understood. Indirect evidence suggests that this RNA transfer may occur at a very early stage of the infection process, prior to breach of the host cell wall, suggesting that silencing RNAs might be secreted onto leaf surfaces. To assess whether Arabidopsis plants possess a mechanism for secreting RNA onto leaf surfaces, we developed a protocol for isolating leaf surface RNA separately from intercellular (apoplastic) RNA. This protocol yielded abundant leaf surface RNA that displayed an RNA banding pattern distinct from apoplastic RNA, suggesting that it may be secreted directly from the leaf surface rather than exuded through stomata or hydathodes. Notably, this RNA was not associated with either extracellular vesicles or protein complexes; however, RNA species longer than 100 nucleotides could be pelleted by ultracentrifugation. Pelleting was inhibited by the divalent cation chelator EGTA, suggesting that these RNAs may form condensates on the leaf surface. These leaf surface RNAs are derived almost exclusively from Arabidopsis, but come from diverse genomic sources, including rRNA, tRNA, mRNA, intergenic RNA, microRNAs, and small interfering RNAs, with tRNAs especially enriched. We speculate that endogenous leaf surface RNA plays an important role in the assembly of distinct microbial communities on leaf surfaces.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

While molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have the potential to fully characterise the proline cis and trans sub-ensembles, they are limited by the slow timescales of isomerisation and force field inaccuracies. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can report on ensemble-averaged observables for both the cis and trans proline states, but a full atomistic characterisation of these sub-ensembles is challenging. Given the importance of proline cis/trans isomerisation for influencing the conformational sampling of disordered proteins, we employed a combination of all-atom MD simulations with enhanced sampling (metadynamics), NMR, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to characterise the two sub-ensembles of the ORF6 C-terminal region (ORF6CTR) from SARS-CoV-2 corresponding to the proline-57 (P57) cis and trans states. We performed MD simulations in three distinct force fields: AMBER03ws, AMBER99SB-disp, and CHARMM36m, which are all optimised for disordered proteins. Each simulation was run for an accumulated time of 180-220 s until convergence was reached, as assessed by blocking analysis. A good agreement between the cis-P57 populations predicted from metadynamics simulations in AMBER03ws was observed with populations obtained from experimental NMR data. Moreover, we observed good agreement between the radius of gyration predicted from the metadynamics simulations in AMBER03ws and that measured using SAXS. Our findings suggest that both the cis-P57 and trans-P57 conformations of ORF6CTR are extremely dynamic and that interdisciplinary approaches combining both multi-scale computations and experiments offer avenues to explore highly dynamic states that cannot be reliably characterised by either approach in isolation.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Recently, the emergence and dominance of the JN.1 lineage over XBB variants have prompted a reevaluation of current vaccine strategies. Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of XBB-based vaccines against JN.1, concerns persist regarding the durability of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses against evolving JN.1 subvariants. In this study, we compared the humoral immunogenicity of XBB and JN.1 lineage infections in human subjects with diverse immune histories to understand the antigenic and immunogenic distinctions between these variants. Similar to observations in naive mice, priming with XBB and JN.1 in humans without prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure results in distinct NAb responses, exhibiting minimal cross-reactivity. Importantly, breakthrough infections (BTI) with the JN.1 lineage induce 5.9-fold higher neutralization titers against JN.1 compared to those induced by XBB BTI. We also observed notable immune evasion of recently emerged JN.1 sublineages, including JN.1+R346T+F456L, with KP.3 showing the most pronounced decrease in neutralization titers by both XBB and JN.1 BTI sera. These results underscore the challenge posed by the continuously evolving SARS-CoV-2 JN.1 and support the consideration of switching the focus of future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine updates to the JN.1 lineage.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Upon DNA-binding, cGAS generates cGAMP, which binds to STING, ultimately driving inflammatory signalling. Although normally silenced on self-DNA, cGAS can be activated during genotoxic stress. A universal by-product of these conditions are micronuclei, which accumulate cGAS, and which are therefore thought to be major cGAS activators. However, due to the inability to visualise cGAS activation in single cells, this hypothesis remains largely untested. Here we solve this question with an improved intracellular cGAMP reporter, which is compatible with microscopy, flow-cytometry and plate reader setups. Surprisingly, cGAS activation in response to multiple types of genotoxic stress is limited to a subfraction of cells and does not correlate with cGAS enrichment in micronuclei. Overall, our findings suggest a revised model of innate immune signalling in response to genotoxic stress, and introduce a novel and flexible tool with which to examine this model in future.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

In aggrephagy, the pathway mediating the degradation of aggregated, ubiquitinated proteins, this cargo material is collected in larger condensates prior to its sequestration by autophagosomes. In this process, SQSTM1/p62 and NBR1 drive cargo condensation, while TAX1BP1, which binds to NBR1 recruits the autophagy machinery to facilitate autophagosome biogenesis at the condensates. The mechanistic basis for the TAX1BP1 mediated switch from cargo collection to its sequestration is unclear. Here we show that TAX1BP1 is not a constitutive component of the condensates. Its recruitment correlates with the induction of autophagosome biogenesis. TAX1BP1 is sufficient to recruit the TBK1 kinase via the SINTBAD adapter. We define the NBR1 - TAX1BP1 binding site, which is adjacent to the GABARAP/LC3 interaction site and demonstrate that the recruitment of TAX1BP1 to cargo mimetics can be enhanced by an increased ubiquitin load. Our study suggests that autophagosome biogenesis is initiated once sufficient cargo is collected in the condensates.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Genes involved in several aspects of cytokinin transport have been characterized, but a large part of the elaborate system remains elusive. In this study, we have identified ABCC4 as a cytokinin efflux transporter gene. Using a transient expression system in tobacco leaves, we screened Arabidopsis transporter genes and isolated ATP-BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTER C4 (ABCC4). Further validation through drug-induced expression in Arabidopsis and heterologous expression in budding yeast revealed that ABCC4 effluxes the active form of cytokinins. During the seedling stage, ABCC4 was highly expressed in roots, and its expression was up-regulated in response to cytokinin application. Loss-of-function mutants of ABCC4 displayed enhanced primary root elongation, similar to mutants impaired in cytokinin biosynthesis or signaling, which was suppressed by exogenous trans-zeatin treatment. In contrast, overexpression of the gene led to suppression of root elongation. These results suggest that ABCC4 plays a role in the efflux of active cytokinin, thereby contributing to root growth regulation. Our findings contribute to unraveling the many complexities of cytokinin flow and enhance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying root system development in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

This is despite some of these tools having been available for several decades, and being widely used for genome and transcriptome annotation. We perform an assessment of nucleotide sequence and alignment-based de novo protein-coding detection tools. The controls we use exclude any previous training dataset and include coding exons as a positive set and length-matched intergenic and shuffled sequences as negative sets. Our work demonstrates that several widely used tools are neither accurate nor computationally efficient for the protein-coding sequence detection problem. In fact, just three of nine tools significantly outperformed a naive scoring scheme. Furthermore, we note a high discrepancy between self-reported accuracies and the accuracy achieved in our study. Our results show that the extra dimension from conserved and variable nucleotides in alignments have a significant advantage over single sequence approaches. These results highlight significant limitations in existing protein-coding annotation tools that are widely used for lncRNA annotation. This shows a need for more robust and efficient approaches to training and assessing the performance of tools for identifying protein-coding sequences.

Using iMGLs harboring the MAPT IVS10+16 mutation and isogenic controls, we demonstrate that a tau mutation is sufficient to alter microglial transcriptional states. We discovered that MAPT IVS10+16 microglia exhibit cytoskeletal abnormalities, stalled phagocytosis, disrupted TREM2/TYROBP networks, and altered metabolism. Additionally, we found that secretory factors from MAPT IVS10+16 iMGLs impact neuronal health, reducing synaptic density in neurons. Key features observed in vitro were recapitulated in human brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid from MAPT mutations carriers. Together, our findings that MAPT IVS10+16 drives cell-intrinsic dysfunction in microglia that impacts neuronal health has major implications for development of therapeutic strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1716069878077

In medical education, research conducted in 2016 found that authors were influenced by multiple factors such as a journal's prestige and its mission. However, since this research was conducted the publishing landscape has shifted to include a broader variety of journals, an increased threat of predatory journals, and new publishing models. This study updates and expands upon how medical education authors decide which journal to submit to with the aim of describing the motivational factors and journal characteristics that guide authors' decision making. Methods: The authors conducted five qualitative focus groups in which twenty-two medical education authors and editors participated. During the focus groups participants were engaged in a discussion about how they select a journal to submit their manuscripts. Audio from all focus groups was transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed using codebook thematic analysis. Results: Participants considered multiple factors when selecting a target journal. Factors included a journal's impact, the scope of a journal, journal quality, and technical factors (e.g., word limits). Participants also described how social factors influenced their process and that open access plays a role that could both encourage or deter submission. Discussion: The findings describe the motivational factors and influential signals that guide authors in their journal selection decision making. These findings confirm, extend, and update journal selection factors reported in medical education and other disciplines. Notably, these findings emphasize the role of social factors, relationships and personal experiences, which were absent from previous work. Additionally, we observed increased consideration of OA and a shift away from an emphasis on journal prestige.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Using simple tasks requiring rapid evaluation of a stationary sensory feature, two human neurophysiological signals have been found to evolve with similar integration dynamics, with one (centroparietal positivity; CPP) appearing to compute the running integral and continuously feed it to the other (motor beta lateralisation; MBL). However, it remains unknown whether and how these signals serve more distinct functional roles in more complex scenarios where information arrives discontinuously and requires more computational steps to form appropriate belief updates. We employed a volatile expanded judgement task that permits dissociation of the encoding of raw sensory information in each of a series of discrete stimuli ('objective evidence'), the appropriately transformed belief updates from that information ('effective evidence'), and the evolving belief itself (accumulated evidence). Whereas MBL traced the evolving belief across stimuli, the CPP was found only to locally encode the effective evidence associated with each individual stimulus. Furthermore, fluctuations in CPP amplitude after each single stimulus could account for variability in the encoding of accumulated evidence in MBL. These results suggest a flexible computational hierarchy in which effective evidence can be computed sample-by-sample at an intermediate processing level to drive downstream belief updates for protracted decisions about discrete stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

To date, stroke patients have only few therapeutic options and are often left with considerable disabilities. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based therapies are emerging as a promising therapeutic approach for stroke recovery. In this study, we demonstrate that local transplantation of good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compatible iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) improve long-term recovery-associated brain tissue responses and reduce neurological deficits after cerebral ischemia in mice. Using in vivo bioluminescence imaging and post-mortem histology, we showed long-term graft survival over the course of five weeks and preferential graft differentiation into mature neurons without signs of pluripotent residuals. Transplantation of NPCs led to a set of recovery-associated tissue responses including increased vascular sprouting and repair, improved blood-brain barrier integrity, reduced microglial activation, and increased neurogenesis compared to littermate control animals receiving sham transplantation. Employing deep learning-assisted behavior analysis, we found that NPC-treated mice displayed improved gait performance and complete fine-motor recovery in the horizontal ladder rung walk, five weeks post-injury. To dissect the molecular graft composition and identify graft-host interactions, single nucleus profiling of the cell transplants and host stroke tissue was performed. We identified graft differentiation preferentially towards GABAergic cells with remaining cells acquiring glutamatergic neuron, astrocyte, and NPC-like phenotypes. Interaction between graft and host transcriptome indicated that GABAergic cell grafts were primarily involved in graft-host communication through the regeneration-associated NRXN, NRG, NCAM and SLIT signalling pathways. In conclusion, our study reveals that transplanted iPSC-derived NPCs primarily differentiate into GABAergic neurons contributing to long-term recovery, and further delineates the regenerative interactions between the graft and the stroke-injured host tissue.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Given the time frame and its location on a busy marine trade route, study of this burial site offers us a glimpse into the lives of the Late Antique population living on this island. It comprises 33 individuals, with 17 buried within a confined grave tomb, and the remaining individuals buried in separate locations in the tomb's proximity. Our objective was to provide new perspectives on the lives of people on the island during those times by studying ancestry, population structure, possible differences within the buried population, dietary habits, and general health. Analysis of the ancestral origins of the individuals buried at Hvar - Rado[s]evi[c] revealed a diverse population reflective of the era's genetic variability. The identification of genetic outliers suggests affiliations with distinct regions of the Roman Empire, possibly linked to trade routes associated with the Late Antique port in ancient Hvar. Stable isotope ratio analysis ({delta}13C and {delta}15N) indicated a diet mainly consisting of C3 plants, with minimal consumption of marine foods. High childhood mortality rates, physiological stress markers, and dental diseases suggest a low quality of life in the population.

The trial-averaged magnitude of neural activity was similar in the two states. However, the trial-to-trial variance in neural activity was higher during disengagement. To understand this increased variance, we trained separate linear encoding models on neural data from each state. The models demonstrated that although task variables and task-aligned movements impacted neural activity similarly during the two states, movements that are independent of task events explained more variance during disengagement. Behavioral analyses uncovered that during disengagement, movements become uncoupled to task events. Taken together, these results argue that the neural signature of disengagement, though obscured in trial-averaged neural activity, is evident in trial-to-trial variability driven by changing patterns of spontaneous movements.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Although it can be effective to search the entire map to find the best placement of a component, the process can be slow when the maps are large. However, frequently there is a well-founded hypothesis about where particular components are located. In such cases, a local search using a map subvolume will be much faster because the search volume is smaller, and more sensitive because optimizing the search volume for the rotation search step enhances signal-to-noise. A Fourier-space likelihood-based local search approach, based on the previously-published em_placement software, has been implemented in the new emplace_local program. Tests confirm that the local search approach enhances speed and sensitivity of the computations. An interactive graphical interface in the ChimeraX molecular graphics program provides a convenient way to set up and evaluate docking calculations, particularly in defining the part of the map into which the components should be placed.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

In search for modulators of {beta}1 integrin surface stability, we identified the Rab7 small GTPase, believed to be required for lysosome biogenesis, as integrin stabilizer. We show that Rab7 deficiency produces late endosomes and lysosomes with acidic pH, lysosome-specific proteins and membrane architectures that are functional in protein degradation and organelle fusion. Furthermore, Rab7-deficient lysosomes form from Rab4- and transferrin receptor-positive recycling endosomes, resulting in the degradation of proteins designated for recycling. Finally, we also found that overexpression of Rab4 can direct lysosome formation from recycling endosomes in absence as well as presence of Rab7, however, the latter to a much lesser extent. Our findings reveal a lysosome biogenesis and lysosomal protein degradation pathway that becomes dominant in absence of Rab7 or when Rab4 is highly abundant.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

In contrast to what one would expect for such a non-conserved factor, TRIM52 loss compromises cell fitness. We set out to determine the cellular function of TRIM52. Genetic and proteomic analyses revealed TRIM52's involvement in resolving topoisomerase 2 (TOP2)-DNA cross-links, mitigating DNA damage and preventing cell-cycle arrest. Consistent with a fitness-promoting function, TRIM52 is upregulated in various cancers, prompting us to investigate its regulatory pathways. We found TRIM52 to be targeted for ultra-rapid proteasomal degradation by the giant E3 ubiquitin ligases BIRC6, HUWE1, and UBR4/KCMF1. BIRC6 mono-ubiquitinates TRIM52, with subsequent extension by UBR4/KCMF1. These findings underscore TRIM52's pivotal role in DNA damage repair and regulation of its own abundance through multi-ligase degradation.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

They have been shown to be present in a wide variety of enzymes across all functional and structural classes. However, the study of such pathways is experimentally challenging because they are typically transient. Computational methods such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been successfully proposed to explore tunnels. Conventional MD (cMD) provides structural details to characterize tunnels but suffers from sampling limitations to capture rare tunnel openings on longer timescales. Therefore, in this study, we explored the potential of Gaussian accelerated MD (GaMD) simulations to improve the exploration of complex tunnel networks in enzymes. We used the haloalkane dehalogenase LinB and its two variants with engineered transport pathways, which are not only well-known for their application potential but have also been extensively studied experimentally and computationally regarding their tunnel networks and their importance in multi-step catalytic reactions. Our study demonstrates that GaMD efficiently improves tunnel sampling and allows the identification of all known tunnels for LinB and its two mutants. Furthermore, the improved sampling provided insight into a previously unknown transient side tunnel (ST). The extensive conformational landscape explored by GaMD simulations allowed us to investigate in detail the mechanism of ST opening. We determined variant-specific dynamic properties of ST opening, which were previously inaccessible due to limited sampling of cMD. Our comprehensive analysis supports multiple indicators of the functional relevance of the ST, emphasizing its potential significance beyond structural considerations. In conclusion, our research proves that the GaMD method can overcome the sampling limitations of cMD for the effective study of tunnels in enzymes, providing further means for identifying rare tunnels in enzymes with potential for drug development, precision medicine, and rational protein engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

The formation of the vertebrate neural tube from stem cells in the caudal lateral epiblast (CLE) is a well characterized example. Despite an understanding of the signalling pathways involved, the gene regulatory mechanisms remain poorly defined. To address this, we developed a multiplexed in vivo CRISPR screening approach in chick embryos targeting genes expressed in the caudal epiblast and neural tube. This revealed a role for MLLT3, a component of the super elongation complex, in the specification of neural fate. Perturbation of MLLT3 disrupted neural tube morphology and reduced neural fate acquisition. Mutant forms of Retinoic Acid Receptor A lacking the MLLT3 binding domain similarly reduced neural fate acquisition. Together, these findings validate an in vivo CRISPR screen strategy in chick embryos and identify a previously unreported role for MLLT3 in caudal neural tissue specification.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

There is limited literature exploring the accessibility of CAMHS for autistic young people, particularly from parents perspectives. The present study aimed to 1) explore the experiences of parents/carers seeking help from CAMHS for their autistic childs mental health difficulties, and 2) gain parents perceptions of the accessibility of CAMHS support for their child and understand what could be improved.

MethodsA mixed-methods survey design was used to learn from parents/carers. 300 parents/carers took part from across the UK between June and October 2023. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative data using qualitative content analysis.

ResultsFindings demonstrated the ongoing struggles that parents/carers faced when seeking professional help from CAMHS for their child. Many were not referred to CAMHS or were rejected without an assessment, often due to issues relating to diagnostic overshadowing, a high threshold for assessment, or a lack of professional knowledge about autism and care pathways. Those who were referred reported a lack of reasonable adjustments and offers of ineffective or inappropriate therapies, leaving young people unable to engage, and thus not benefiting. Ultimately, parents felt their childs mental health difficulties either did not improve or declined to the point of crisis. However, there was a recognition that some professionals were kind and compassionate, and provided the validation that parents needed.

ConclusionsThere is a need for a more neuro-inclusive and personalised approach in CAMHS, from the professionals themselves, in the adjustments that are offered, and in the therapies that are provided. Further research, funding, and training are urgently needed to ensure mental health support is accessible, timely, and effective for autistic CYP.","NA","medrxiv",1716069878077

Despite the progress in mapping protein-protein interactions we lack knowledge of how they differ between tissues. Due to coordinated (post)transcriptional control, protein complex members have highly correlated abundances that are predictive of functional association. Here, we have compiled 7873 proteomic samples measuring protein levels in 11 human tissues and use these to define an atlas with tissue-specific protein associations. This method recapitulates known protein complexes and the larger structural organization of the cell. Interactions of stable protein complexes are well preserved across tissues, while signaling and metabolic interactions show larger variation. Further, we find that less than 18% of differences between tissues are estimated to be due to differences in gene expression while cell-type specific cellular structures, such as synaptic components, represent a significant driver of differences between tissues. We further supported the brain protein association network through co-fractionation experiments in synaptosomes, curation of brain derived pull-down data and AlphaFold2 models. Together these results illustrate how this brain specific protein interaction network can functionally prioritize candidate genes within loci linked to brain disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

We report the development of the first genetically encoded system capable of accurately quantifying RuBisCO-dependent CO2 fixation in cellulo using a tripartite approach that combines bacterial strains which insulate RuBisCO-derived products, an engineered pathway that eliminates RuBP toxicity, and biosensors to concurrently monitor RuBisCO abundance and catalysis. We extended this biosensing strategy to 43 Form II and II/III RuBisCO homologs, finding strong agreement with in vitro-derived enzyme kinetics in living cells for the first time. Finally, we show how this system can be used to rapidly evolve functional RuBisCO enzymes. Our approach overcomes prior limitations by streamlining intracellular RuBisCO analyses and will enable the development of enzymes with improved CO2 fixation capabilities.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Most authors agree that the dACC is involved in either cognitive control (e.g. voluntary inhibition of automatic responses) or monitoring (e.g. comparing expectations with outcomes, detecting errors, tracking surprise). A consensus on which theoretical perspective best explains dACC contribution to behaviour is still lacking. In a recent neuroimaging study, the experimental predictions of two prominent models formalizing the cognitive control hypothesis (Expected Value of Control, EVC) and the monitoring hypothesis (Predicted Response Outcome, PRO) have been tested using a behavioural task involving both monitoring and cognitive control mechanisms. The results indicated that of the two tested models, only the PRO model effectively predicted the dACC activity, indicating surprise tracking for performance monitoring as the key sole underlying mechanism, even when cognitive control was required by the task at hand. These findings challenged the long-standing and established cognitive control hypothesis of dACC function and opened a theory crisis: the proposed surprise-monitoring hypothesis indeed cannot account for a wide array of previous experimental findings evidencing dACC activation in tasks requiring cognitive control without involving monitoring or surprise. Here we propose a novel hypothesis on dACC function that integrates both the monitoring and the cognitive control perspective in a unifying coherent framework, based on meta-Reinforcement Learning. Our model, the Reinforcement Meta Learner (RML), optimizes cognitive control - as in control models like EVC-by meta-learning based on tracking surprise - as in monitoring models like PRO. We tested RML experimental predictions with the same behavioural task used to compare the PRO and EVC models, and showed that RML predictions on dACC activity matched PRO predictions and outperformed EVC predictions. However, crucially, the RML simultaneously accounts for both cognitive control and monitoring functions, resolving the theoretical impasse about dACC function within an integrative framework. In sum, our results suggest that dACC function can be framed as a meta-learning optimiser of cognitive control, providing an integrative perspective on its roles in cognitive control, surprise tracking, and performance monitoring.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Traditionally, ER moves by either sliding along stable microtubules via molecular motors or attaching to the plus ends of dynamic microtubules through tip attachment complexes (TAC). A recently discovered third process, hitchhiking, involves motile vesicles pulling ER tubules along microtubules. Previous research showed that ER hitchhikes on Rab5- and Rab7-marked endosomes, but it is uncertain if other Rab-vesicles can do the same. In U2OS cells, we screened Rabs for their ability to cotransport with ER tubules and found that ER hitchhikes on post-Golgi vesicles marked by Rab6 (isoforms a and b). Rab6-ER hitchhiking occurs independently of ER-endolysosome contacts and TAC-mediated ER movement. Disrupting either Rab6 or the motility of Rab6-vesicles reduces overall ER movement. Conversely, relocating these vesicles to the cell periphery causes peripheral ER accumulation, indicating that Rab6-vesicle motility is crucial for a subset of ER movements. Proximal post-Golgi vesicles marked by TGN46 are involved in Rab6-ER hitchhiking, while other post-Golgi vesicles (Rabs 8/10/11/13/14) are not essential for ER movement. Our further analysis finds that ER to Golgi vesicles marked by Rab1 are also capable of driving a subset of ER movements. Taken together, our findings suggest that ER hitchhiking on Rab-vesicles is a significant mode of ER movement.

Here, we propose CT-FM and CT-FM-SNP, two methods that leverage cell-type-specific cREs to fine-map causal cell types for a trait and for its candidate causal variants, respectively. We applied CT-FM to 63 GWAS summary statistics (average N = 417K) using nearly one thousand cRE annotations, primarily coming from ENCODE4. CT-FM inferred 81 causal cell types with corresponding SNP-annotations explaining a high fraction of trait SNP-heritability (~2/3 of the SNP-heritability explained by existing cREs), identified 16 traits with multiple causal cell types, highlighted cell-disease relationships consistent with known biology, and uncovered previously unexplored cellular mechanisms in psychiatric and immune-related diseases. Finally, we applied CT-FM-SNP to 39 UK Biobank traits and predicted high confidence causal cell types for 2,798 candidate causal non-coding SNPs.

For each library, we tested one and two rounds of enrichment, and assessed performance compared to deep shotgun sequencing. We find that the ""Twist Ancient DNA"" assay provides robust enrichment of ~1.2M target SNPs without introducing allelic bias that may interfere with downstream population genetics analyses. Additionally, we show that pooling up to 4 sequencing libraries and performing two rounds of enrichment is both reliable and cost-effective for libraries with less than 27% endogenous DNA content. Above 38% endogenous content, a maximum of one round of enrichment is recommended for cost-effectiveness and to preserve library complexity.

Yet, their implication for disease pathogenesis remains largely limited. Here, we introduce scPRS, a geometric deep learning model that constructs single-cell-resolved PRS leveraging reference single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling data to enhance biological discovery as well as disease prediction. Real-world applications across multiple complex diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and Alzheimers disease (AD), showcase the superior prediction power of scPRS compared to traditional PRS methods. Importantly, scPRS not only predicts disease risk but also uncovers disease-relevant cells, such as hormone-high alpha and beta cells for T2D, cardiomyocytes and pericytes for HCM, and astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells for AD. Facilitated by a layered multi-omic analysis, scPRS further identifies cell-type-specific genetic underpinnings, linking disease-associated genetic variants to gene regulation within corresponding cell types. We substantiate the disease relevance of scPRS-prioritized HCM genes and demonstrate that the suppression of these genes in HCM cardiomyocytes is rescued by Mavacamten treatment. Additionally, we establish a novel microglia-specific regulatory relationship between the AD risk variant rs7922621 and its target genes ANXA11 and TSPAN14. We further illustrate the detrimental effects of suppressing these two genes on microglia phagocytosis. Our work provides a multi-tasking, interpretable framework for precise disease prediction and systematic investigation of the genetic, cellular, and molecular basis of complex diseases, laying the methodological foundation for single-cell genetics.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

While a large body of work has investigated how urbanization may shape interspecific variation in behavioral traits, such as via urban environmental filtering, no study has yet quantitatively assessed global patterns of urban-associated intraspecific behavioral variation. Here, we conducted a phylogenetic meta-analysis to assess urban-associated behavioral differences in wild populations of birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and insects. We focused on four commonly measured behaviors (boldness, aggression, activity, and exploration) and extracted paired urban-nonurban effect size estimates for phenotypic means and variances (k = 278), behavioral repeatability (k = 13), and behavioral correlations (k = 14) from 80 studies. We found clear evidence that urban populations exhibit heightened average boldness, aggression, exploration, and activity compared to nonurban conspecifics, a result that was robust among species, geographic region, and ecological niche. Further, our results suggested that generalist species have the strongest behavioral responses. Conversely, we did not find strong evidence linking urbanization to changes in phenotypic variation, behavioral repeatability, or behavioral correlations. Our results summarize data from a rapidly evolving field in urban ecology and demonstrate geographically and taxonomically widespread differences in behavior between urban and nonurban populations, suggesting parallel natural selection across urban species and populations.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Group 3 MB subtype accounts for about 25% of MB diagnoses and is associated with the most unfavorable outcomes. Herein, we report that more than half of group 3 MB tumors express melanoma antigens (MAGEs), which are potential prognostic and therapeutic markers. MAGEs are tumor antigens, expressed in several types of adult cancers and associated with poorer prognosis and therapy resistance; however, their expression in pediatric cancers is mostly unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether MAGEs are activated in pediatric MB. Methods: To determine MAGE frequency in pediatric MB, we obtained formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) samples of 34 patients, collected between 2008-2015, from the Children's Medical Center Dallas pathology archives and applied our validated reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay to measure the relative expression of 23 MAGE cancer-testis antigen genes. To validate our data, we analyzed several published datasets from pediatric MB patients and patient-derived orthotopic xenografts, totaling 860 patients. We then examined how MAGE expression affects the growth and oncogenic potential of medulloblastoma cells by CRISPR-Cas9- and siRNA-mediated gene depletion. Results: Our RT-qPCR analysis suggested that MAGEs were expressed in group 3/4 medulloblastoma. Further mining of bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets confirmed that 50-75% of group 3 tumors activate a subset of MAGE genes. Depletion of MAGEAs, B2, and Cs alter MB cell survival, viability, and clonogenic growth due to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Conclusions: These results indicate that targeting MAGEs in medulloblastoma may be a potential therapeutic option for group 3 medulloblastomas.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Here, we directly address this question by clustering event frames using the Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland sample that includes subjects with ages spanning the human lifespan. We find evidence of two main clusters that appear across subjects and age groups. We also find that these patterns of clusters systematically change in magnitude and frequency with age. Our results also demonstrate that such event clusters have distinct, heterogeneous relationships with structural connectivity-derived communication measures, which change with age. Finally, event clusters were found to outperform non-events in predicting phenotypes regarding human intelligence and achievement. Collectively, our findings fill several gaps in current knowledge about co-fluctuation patterns in edge time series and human aging, setting the stage for future investigation into the causal origins of changes in functional connectivity throughout the human lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Here, we generated trophoblast stem cell-derived placental organoids using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels with tunable degradability and placenta-derived ECM cues to evaluate trophoblast differentiation relative to Matrigel and two-dimensional (2D) culture controls. Our data demonstrate that PEG hydrogels support trophoblast viability and metabolic function comparable to gold standard Matrigel. Additionally, phenotypic characterization via proteomic analysis revealed that PEG and Matrigel matrices drive syncytiotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblast-dominant placental organoid phenotypes, respectively. Further, three-dimensional (3D) environments promoted greater integrin expression and ECM production than 2D culture.

Here instead we describe a self-limiting strategy, designed to have geographically and/or temporally restricted effect, based on a Y chromosome-linked genome editor (YLE). The YLE comprises a CRISPR-Cas9 construct that is always inherited by males yet generates an autosomal dominant mutation that is transmitted to over 90% of the offspring and results in female-specific sterility. Males are unaffected. To our knowledge, our system represents the first engineering of the Y chromosome to generate a genetic control strain for mosquitoes. Mathematical modelling shows that this YLE technology is up to 8 times more efficient for population suppression than optimal versions of other self-limiting strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Elimination of Lkb1 from the {beta}-cell results in improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and is accompanied by profound changes in gene expression, including the upregulation of several neuronal genes. The mechanisms through which LKB1 controls gene expression are, at present, poorly understood. Here, we explore the impact of {beta} cell-selective deletion of Lkb1 on chromatin accessibility in mouse pancreatic islets. To characterize the role of LKB1 in the regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level, we combine these data with a map of islet active transcription start sites and histone marks. We demonstrate that LKB1 elimination from beta cells results in widespread changes in chromatin accessibility, correlating with changes in transcript levels. Changes occurred in hundreds of promoter and enhancer regions, many of which were close to neuronal genes. We reveal that dysregulated enhancers are enriched in binding motifs for transcription factors important for beta cell identity, such as FOXA, MAFA or RFX6 and we identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that are regulated by LKB1 at the transcriptional level. Overall, our study provides important new insights into the epigenetic mechanisms by which LKB1 regulates beta cell identity and function.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Here, we explored a large number of publicly available human microbiome datasets and retrieved a total of 829 anellovirus genomes, substantially expanding the known diversity of these viruses. The majority of new genomes fall within the three major human anellovirus genera: Alphatorquevirus, Betatorquevirus and Gammatorquevirus, while we also present one new genome of the under-sampled Hetorquevirus genus. The phylogeny reconstructed from the conserved ORF1 gene reveals three additional, previously undescribed, human anellovirus clades. We performed recombination analysis and show evidence of extensive recombination across all human anelloviruses. Interestingly, more than 95% of the detected events are between members of the same clade and only 15 inter-clade recombination events were detected. The breakpoints of recombination cluster in hotspots at the ends and outside of the ORF1 gene, while a recombination coldspot was detected within the gene. Our analysis suggests that anellovirus evolution is governed by homologous recombination, however events between distant viruses or ones producing chimaeric ORF1s likely lead to non-viable recombinants. The large number of genomes further allowed us to examine how essential genomic features vary across anelloviruses. These include functional domains in the ORF1 protein and the nucleotide motif of the replication loop region, required for the viruses rolling-circle replication. A subset of the genomes assembled in both this and previous studies are completely lacking these essential elements, opening up the possibility that anellovirus intracellular populations contain defective virus genomes (DVGs). Overall, our study highlights key features of anellovirus genomics and evolution, a largely understudied group of viruses whose potential in virus-based therapeutics is recently being explored.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

In neuroscience, techniques for estimating connectivity are paramount when attempting to understand the network structure of neural systems from their recorded activity patterns. To date, no universally accepted method exists for the inference of effective connectivity, which describes how the activity of a neural node mechanistically affects the activity of other nodes. Here, focussing on purely excitatory networks of small to intermediate size and continuous node dynamics, we provide a systematic comparison of different approaches for estimating effective connectivity. Starting with the Hopf neuron model in conjunction with known ground truth structural connectivity, we reconstruct the system's connectivity matrix using a variety of algorithms. We show that, in sparse non-linear networks with delays, combining a lagged-cross-correlation (LCC) approach with a recently published derivative-based covariance analysis method provides the most reliable estimation of the known ground truth connectivity matrix. We also show that in linear networks, LCC has comparable performance to a method based on transfer entropy, at a drastically lower computational cost. We highlight that LCC works best for small sparse networks, and show how performance decreases in larger and less sparse networks. Applying the method to linear dynamics without time delays, we find that it does not outperform derivative-based methods. Employing the Hopf model, we then use the estimated structural connectivity matrix as the basis for a forward simulation of the system dynamics, in order to recreate the observed node activity patterns. We show that, under certain conditions, the best method, LCC, results in higher trace-to-trace correlations than derivative-based methods for sparse noise-driven systems. Finally, we apply the LCC method to empirical biological data. We reconstruct the structural connectivity of a subset of the nervous system of the nematode C. Elegans. We show that the computationally simple LCC method performs better than another recently published, computationally more expensive reservoir computing-based method. Our results show that a comparatively simple method can be used to reliably estimate directed effective connectivity in sparse neural systems in the presence of spatio-temporal delays and noise. We provide concrete suggestions for the estimation of effective connectivity in a scenario common in biological research, where only neuronal activity of a small set of neurons is known.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession (DW-SSFP) is an established imaging sequence for post-mortem MRI, addressing the challenging imaging environment of fixed tissue with short T2 and low diffusivities. However, a current limitation of DW-SSFP is signal interpretation: it is not clear what diffusion 'regime' the sequence probes and therefore its potential to characterise tissue microstructure. Building on a model of Extended Phase Graphs (EPG), I establish two alternative representations of the DW-SSFP signal in terms of (1) conventional b-values (time-independent diffusion) and (2) encoding power-spectra (time-dependent diffusion). The proposed representations provide insights into how different parameter regimes and gradient waveforms impact the diffusion properties of DW-SSFP. Using these representations, I introduce an approach to incorporate existing diffusion models into DW-SSFP without the requirement of extensive derivations. Investigations incorporating free-diffusion and tissue-relevant microscopic restrictions (cylinder of varying radius) give excellent agreement to complementary analytical models and Monte Carlo simulations. Experimentally, the time-independent representation is used to derive Tensor and proof of principle NODDI estimates in a whole human post-mortem brain. A final SNR-efficiency investigation demonstrates the theoretical potential of DW-SSFP for ultra-high field microstructural imaging.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Here we have used cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to characterize products and intermediates relevant for RCS replication and find that these form an unexpectedly diverse group of RNA nanostructures. The main structural motif observed is a fully hybridized dimeric complex composed of two scRNAs and their complement strands resolved to 5.3 [A]. Cryo-EM also reveals higher order dimer filaments and dimer assembly intermediates suggesting a mechanism for assembly of the observed complexes. We show that the dimer complexes are stable and inhibit RNA-catalyzed RCS, but can be reactivated by addition of more scRNA templates.

To address this, we employed a multimodal, data-driven approach integrating intracranial electroencephalography, pain self-reports, and facial expression quantification to characterize the neural and behavioral correlates of naturalistic acute pain in twelve epilepsy patients undergoing continuous monitoring with neural and audiovisual recordings. High self-reported pain states were associated with elevated blood pressure, increased pain medication use, and distinct facial muscle activations. Using machine learning, we successfully decoded individual participants high versus low self-reported pain states from distributed neural activity patterns (mean AUC = 0.70), involving mesolimbic regions, striatum, and temporoparietal cortex. High self-reported pain states exhibited increased low-frequency activity in temporoparietal areas and decreased high-frequency activity in mesolimbic regions (hippocampus, cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex) compared to low pain states. This neural pain representation remained stable for hours and was modulated by pain onset and relief. Objective facial expression changes also classified self-reported pain states, with results concordant with electrophysiological predictions. Importantly, we identified transient periods of momentary pain as a distinct naturalistic acute pain measure, which could be reliably differentiated from affect-neutral periods using intracranial and facial features, albeit with neural and facial patterns distinct from self-reported pain. These findings reveal reliable neurobehavioral markers of naturalistic acute pain across contexts and timescales, underscoring the potential for developing personalized pain interventions in real-world settings.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Here, we tested unrefined AF2 models prospectively, comparing experimental hit-rates and affinities from large library docking against AF2 models vs the same screens targeting experimental structures of the same receptors. In retrospective docking screens against the {sigma}2 and the 5-HT2A receptors, the AF2 structures struggled to recapitulate ligands that we had previously found docking against the receptors experimental structures, consistent with published results. Prospective large library docking against the AF2 models, however, yielded similar hit rates for both receptors versus docking against experimentally-derived structures; hundreds of molecules were prioritized and tested against each model and each structure of each receptor. The success of the AF2 models was achieved despite differences in orthosteric pocket residue conformations for both targets versus the experimental structures. Intriguingly, against the 5-HT2A receptor the most potent, subtype-selective agonists were discovered via docking against the AF2 model, not the experimental structure. To understand this from a molecular perspective, a cryoEM structure was determined for one of the more potent and selective ligands to emerge from docking against the AF2 model of the 5-HT2A receptor. Our findings suggest that AF2 models may sample conformations that are relevant for ligand discovery, much extending the domain of applicability of structure-based ligand discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

To explain this early apparent equipotentiality of the two hemispheres for language, some have proposed that the language system is bilateral during early development and only becomes left-lateralized with age. We examined language lateralization using functional magnetic resonance imaging with two large pediatric cohorts (total n=273 children ages 4-16; n=107 adults). Strong, adult-level left-hemispheric lateralization (in activation volume and response magnitude) was evident by age 4. Thus, although the right hemisphere can take over language function in some cases of early brain damage, and although some features of the language system do show protracted development (magnitude of language response and strength of inter-regional correlations in the language network), the left-hemisphere bias for language is robustly present by 4 years of age.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

How somatic and germ cells interact to develop and maintain fertility is not well understood. Here, using grafting experiments and transgenic reporter animals, we find that a specific part of the gonad-the germinal zone-acts as a sexual organizer to induce and maintain de novo germ cells and somatic gonads in non-sexual tissue in the cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. We further show that germ cells express a novel member of the BMP family (Gonadless, Gls) that induces somatic gonad morphogenesis. Loss of Gls resulted in animals lacking somatic gonadal structures but having few, non-proliferative germ cells. We propose a model according to which a small number of primary germ cells drive gonad development though Gls morphogen secretion. The germinal zone in the newly formed gonad, in turn, provides positive feedback to induce secondary germ cells by activating Tfap2 (the master regulator of germ cell fate) in resident pluripotent stem cells. De novo induction of germ cells by gonads in adult life is absent in bilaterians with a sequestered germline. However, the contribution of germ cell signaling to the patterning of somatic gonadal tissue, as observed in Hydractinia, may be a general animal feature.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

For the treatment of infections with SARS-CoV-2 and possible future epi-/pandemic coronaviruses, it will be important to explore the efficacy of combinations of different drugs, in particular to avoid resistance development, such as in patients with immunodeficiencies. As a first effort, we studied the antiviral potency of combinations of antivirals. To that end, we made use of primary human airway epithelial cell (HAEC) cultures grown at the air-liquid interface that were infected with the beta coronavirus OC43. We found that the triple combination of GS-441524 (parent nucleoside of remdesivir), molnupiravir, and ribavirin resulted in a more pronounced antiviral efficacy than what could be expected from a purely additive antiviral effect. The potency of this triple combination was next tested in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters. To that end, for each of the drugs, intentionally suboptimal or even ineffective doses were selected. Yet, in the lungs of all hamsters that received triple prophylactic therapy with suboptimal/inactive doses of GS-441524, molnupiravir, and ribavirin, no infectious virus was detectable.

This neurodevelopmental trajectory is shaped by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. While common genetic variants account for a large proportion of inherited genetic risk, rare genetic variations, particularly copy number variants (CNVs), play a significant role in the genetic architecture of neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite their importance, the relevance of CNVs to child psychopathology and cognitive function in the general population remains underexplored. Objective: Investigating CNV associations with dimensions of child psychopathology and cognitive functions. Design, Setting, and Participants: ABCD study focuses on a cohort of over 11,875 youth aged 9 to 10, recruited from 21 sites in the US, aiming to investigate the role of various factors, including brain, environment, and genetic factors, in the etiology of mental and physical health from middle childhood through early adulthood. Data analysis occurred from April 2023 to April 2024. Main Outcomes and Measures: In this study, we utilized PennCNV and QuantiSNP algorithms to identify duplications and deletions larger than 50Kb across a cohort of 11,088 individuals from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. CNVs meeting quality control standards were subjected to a genome-wide association scan to identify regions associated with quantitative measures of broad psychiatric symptom domains and cognitive outcomes. Additionally, a CNV risk score, reflecting the aggregated burden of genetic intolerance to inactivation and dosage sensitivity, was calculated to assess its impact on variability in overall and dimensional child psychiatric and cognitive phenotypes. Results: In a final sample of 8,564 individuals (mean age=9.9 years, 4,532 males) passing quality control, we identified 4,111 individuals carrying 5,760 autosomal CNVs. Our results revealed significant associations between specific CNVs and our phenotypes of interest, psychopathology and cognitive function. For instance, a duplication at 10q26.3 was associated with overall psychopathology, and somatic complaints in particular. Additionally, deletions at 1q12.1, along with duplications at 14q11.2 and 10q26.3, were linked to overall cognitive function, with particular contributions from fluid intelligence (14q11.2), working memory (10q26.3), and reading ability (14q11.2). Moreover, individuals carrying CNVs previously associated with neurodevelopmental disorders exhibited greater impairment in social functioning and cognitive performance across multiple domains, in particular working memory. Notably, a higher deletion CNV risk score was significantly correlated with increased overall psychopathology (especially in dimensions of social functioning, thought disorder, and attention) as well as cognitive impairment across various domains. Conclusions and Relevance: In summary, our findings shed light on the contributions of CNVs to interindividual variability in complex traits related to neurocognitive development and child psychopathology.","NA","medrxiv",1716069878077

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, .1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

SummaryAmong 47561 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine was 23% effective against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1716069878077

Despite the highly restrictive conditions, microbial life has been found in these environments, although with limited information on their genetic properties and functional capabilities. Moreover, the accelerated melting of the Antarctic permafrost, the increasing exposure of soils, and the growing human transit pose the question of whether these environments could be a source of microbes or genes that could emerge and cause global health problems. In this line, although a high bacterial diversity and autochthonous multidrug-resistant bacteria have been found in soils of the Antarctic Peninsula, we still lack information regarding the resistome of areas closer to the South Pole. Moreover, no previous studies have evaluated the pathogenic potential of microbes inhabiting Antarctic soils. In this work, we combined metagenomic and culture-dependent approaches to investigate the microbial diversity, resistome, virulome, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in soils from Union Glacier, a high-latitude cold desert in West Antarctica. Despite the low organic matter content, diverse bacterial lineages were found, predominating Actinomycetota and Pseudomonadota, with limited archaeal and fungal taxa. We recovered more than 80 species-level representative genomes (SRGs) of predominant bacterial taxa and the archaeon Nitrosocosmicus sp. Diverse putative resistance and virulence genes were predicted among the SRGs, metagenomic reads, and contigs. Furthermore, we characterized bacterial isolates resistant to up to 24 clinical antibiotics, mainly Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Plantibacter, and Flavobacterium. Moreover, some isolates produced putative virulence factors, including siderophores, pyocyanins, and exoenzymes with hemolytic, lecithinase, protease, and DNAse activity. This evidence uncovers a largely unexplored resistome and virulome hosted by deep Antarcticas soil microbial communities and the presence of bacteria with pathogenic potential, highlighting the relevance of One Health approaches for environmental surveillance in the white continent.

HIGHLIGHTS-Union Glacier soils host a microbial community dominated by bacteria, mainly from the phylum Actinomycetota.
-Archaea from the Nitrosocosmicus genus (family Nitrosphaeraceae) were ubiquitously detected.
-Although extreme and remote, these soils host multidrug-resistant and potentially pathogenic bacteria. Some were cultured and tested in vitro.
-Metagenomes and species-level representative genomes revealed diverse putative resistance and virulence genes.
-Part of the putative antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors could be associated with mobile elements in bacterial genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

These decisions are influenced not only by the availability and quality of food but also by the internal state of the animal, which needs to compute and give weights to these different variables before making a choice. Feeding preferences of female mosquitoes exemplify this behavioural plasticity. Both male and female mosquitoes usually feed on carbohydrate-rich sources of nectar or sap, but the female also feeds on blood, which is essential for egg development. This blood-appetite is modulated across the females reproductive cycle, yet little is known about the factors that bring it about. We show that Anopheles stephensi females, a major vector for urban Malaria the Indian sub-continent and West-Africa, suppress blood-feeding between a blood-meal and until oviposition. Transcriptomics on blood-deprived and sated An. stephensi mid-brains allowed us to shortlist several candidate genes that might promote blood-feeding behaviour. Through dsRNA-mediated knockdown of nine of them, we identified two neuropeptides - short Neuropeptide F (sNPF) and RYamide - that promote blood-feeding. We find that these neuromodulators are expressed in non-overlapping subsets of neurons in the brain suggesting that blood-feeding behaviour is likely modulated by multiple mechanisms acting across different brain neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Using high-resolution chromosome conformation capture sequencing, we show that an archaeal homolog of the bacterial Smc-ScpAB complex organizes the genome of Thermococcus kodakarensis into TAD-like domains. We also find that TrmBL2, a nucleoid- associated protein that forms a stiff nucleoprotein filament, stalls the T. kodakarensis SMC complex and establishes a boundary at the site-specific recombination site dif. TrmBL2 stalls the SMC complex at tens of additional non-boundary loci with lower efficiency. Intriguingly, the stalling efficiency is correlated with structural properties of underlying DNA sequences.

However, current construction methods often introduce biases, excluding complex sequences or relying on references. The PanGenome Graph Builder (PGGB) addresses these issues. To date, though, there is no state-of-the-art pipeline allowing for easy deployment, efficient and dynamic use of available resources, and scalable usage at the same time.

ResultsTo overcome these limitations, we present nf-core/pangenome, a reference-unbiased approach implemented in Nextflow following nf-cores best practices. Leveraging biocontainers ensures portability and seamless deployment in HPC environments. Unlike PGGB, nf-core/pangenome distributes alignments across cluster nodes, enabling scalability. Demonstrating its efficiency, we constructed pangenome graphs for 1000 human chromosome 19 haplotypes and 2146 E. coli sequences, achieving a two to threefold speedup compared to PGGB without increasing greenhouse gas emissions.

To study transcript expression throughout Caenorhabditis elegans embryogenesis at single-molecule resolution, we developed a high-throughput single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) method that relies on computational methods to developmentally stage embryos and quantify individual mRNA molecules in single embryos. We applied our system to sdc-2, a zygotically transcribed gene essential for hermaphrodite development and dosage compensation. We found that sdc-2 is rapidly activated during early embryogenesis by increasing both the number of mRNAs produced per transcription site and the frequency of sites engaged in transcription. Knockdown of sdc-2 and dpy-27, a subunit of the dosage compensation complex (DCC), increased the number of active transcription sites for the X chromosomal gene dpy-23 but not the autosomal gene mdh-1, suggesting that the DCC reduces the frequency of dpy-23 transcription. The temporal resolution from in silico staging of embryos showed that the deletion of a single DCC recruitment element near the dpy-23 gene causes higher dpy-23 mRNA expression after the start of dosage compensation, which could not be resolved using mRNAseq from mixed-stage embryos. In summary, we have established a computational approach to quantify temporal regulation of transcription throughout C. elegans embryogenesis and demonstrated its potential to provide new insights into developmental gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

This paper aimed to assess a multitude of cardiac signs, symptoms, and conditions, as well as focused on patients with and without congenital heart defects (CHDs), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the post-acute cardiovascular outcomes among children and adolescents after COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 19 US children?s hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and September 2023. Every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry. Absolute risks of incident post-acute COVID-19 sequelae were reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by contrasting COVID-19-positive with COVID-19-negative groups using a Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through propensity scoring stratification. Results: A total of 1,213,322 individuals under 21 years old (mean[SD] age, 7.75[6.11] years; 623,806 male [51.4%]) were included. The absolute rate of any post-acute cardiovascular outcome in this study was 2.32% in COVID-19 positive and 1.38% in negative groups. Patients with CHD post-SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks of any cardiovascular outcome (RR, 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-1.80), including increased risks of 11 of 18 post-acute sequelae in hypertension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias), myocarditis, other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest), thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain and palpitations). Those without CHDs also experienced heightened cardiovascular risks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.69), covering 14 of 18 conditions in hypertension, arrhythmias (ventricular arrhythmias and premature atrial or ventricular contractions), inflammatory heart disease (pericarditis and myocarditis), other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock), thrombotic disorders (pulmonary embolism and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and syncope). Conclusions: Both children with and without CHDs showed increased risks for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the need for targeted monitoring and management in the post-acute phase.","NA","medrxiv",1716069878077

Osteoclastogenesis involves several steps of actin-driven rearrangements that participate not only in the cell-cell fusion process, but also in the formation of the sealing zone, the adhesive structure determining the resorption area. Despite the importance of these actin cytoskeleton-based processes, their precise mechanisms of regulation are still poorly characterized. Here, we found that moesin, a member of the Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (ERM) protein family, is activated during osteoclast maturation and plays an instrumental role for both osteoclast fusion and function. In mouse and human osteoclast precursors, moesin is negatively regulated to potentiate their ability to fuse and degrade bone. Accordingly, we demonstrated that moesin depletion decreases membrane-to-cortex attachment and enhances formation of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), F-actin-containing intercellular bridges that we revealed to trigger osteoclast fusion. In addition, via Beta3-integrin/RhoA/SLK pathway and independently of its role in fusion, moesin regulates the number and organization of sealing zones in mature osteoclast, and thus participates in the control of bone resorption. Supporting these findings, we found that moesin-deficient mice are osteopenic with a reduced density of trabecular bones and increased osteoclast abundance and activity. These findings provide a better understanding of the regulation of osteoclast biology, and open new opportunities to specifically target osteoclast activity in bone disease therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1716069878077

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1716069878077

ObjectiveTo evaluate febrile seizure risk following monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination among children aged 2-5 years.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThe primary analysis evaluated children who had a febrile seizure outcome in the 0-1 days following COVID-19 vaccination. A self-controlled case series analysis was performed in three commercial insurance databases to compare the risk of seizure in the risk interval (0-1 days) to a control interval (8-63 days).

ExposureReceipt of dose 1 and/or dose 2 of monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was febrile seizure (0-1 day risk interval).

AnalysisA conditional Poisson regression model was used to compare outcome rates in risk and control intervals and estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analyses were used to pool results across databases.

ResultsThe primary meta-analysis found a statistically significant increased incidence of febrile seizure, in the 0-1 days following mRNA-1273 vaccination compared to the control interval (IRR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.35 to 4.69, risk difference (RD)/100,000 doses = 3.22 (95%CI -0.31 to 6.75)). For the BNT162b2 vaccination, the IRR was elevated but not statistically significant (IRR: 1.41, 95%CI: 0.48 to 4.11, RD/100,000 doses = -0.25 (95%CI -2.75 to 2.24).

Conclusions and RelevanceAmong children aged 2-5 years, the analysis showed a small elevated incidence rate ratio of febrile seizures in the 0-1 days following the mRNA-1273 vaccination. Based on the current body of scientific evidence, the safety profile of the monovalent mRNA vaccines remains favorable for use in young children.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAmong children aged 2-5 years, is the risk of febrile seizure elevated immediately following monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination compared with a later period after vaccination?

FindingsIn this self-controlled case series that included participants aged 2-5 years from three commercial insurance databases, the incidence rate ratio of febrile seizures was significantly elevated in the 0-1 days following mRNA-1273 administration. Absolute risk was small.

MeaningThe incidence of febrile seizures was elevated immediately following vaccination with the monovalent mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 2-5 years. Based on the current body of evidence, the safety profile of monovalent mRNA vaccines remains favorable for use in young children.","NA","medrxiv",1716069878077

Here, we demonstrate that the macaque is capable of synchronizing taps to a subjective beat in real music, and even spontaneously chooses to do so over alternative strategies. This contradicts the influential ""vocal learning hypothesis"" that musical beat synchronization is only possible in species with complex vocalizations such as humans and some songbirds.

To localize the ancestral and geographical origins of the Yamnaya among the diverse Eneolithic people that preceded them, we studied ancient DNA data from 428 individuals of which 299 are reported for the first time, demonstrating three previously unknown Eneolithic genetic clines. First, a ""Caucasus-Lower Volga"" (CLV) Cline suffused with Caucasus hunter-gatherer (CHG) ancestry extended between a Caucasus Neolithic southern end in Neolithic Armenia, and a steppe northern end in Berezhnovka in the Lower Volga. Bidirectional gene flow across the CLV cline created admixed intermediate populations in both the north Caucasus, such as the Maikop people, and on the steppe, such as those at the site of Remontnoye north of the Manych depression. CLV people also helped form two major riverine clines by admixing with distinct groups of European hunter-gatherers. A ""Volga Cline"" was formed as Lower Volga people mixed with upriver populations that had more Eastern hunter-gatherer (EHG) ancestry, creating genetically hyper-variable populations as at Khvalynsk in the Middle Volga. A ""Dnipro Cline"" was formed as CLV people bearing both Caucasus Neolithic and Lower Volga ancestry moved west and acquired Ukraine Neolithic hunter-gatherer (UNHG) ancestry to establish the population of the Serednii Stih culture from which the direct ancestors of the Yamnaya themselves were formed around 4000BCE. This population grew rapidly after 3750-3350BCE, precipitating the expansion of people of the Yamnaya culture who totally displaced previous groups on the Volga and further east, while admixing with more sedentary groups in the west. CLV cline people with Lower Volga ancestry contributed four fifths of the ancestry of the Yamnaya, but also, entering Anatolia from the east, contributed at least a tenth of the ancestry of Bronze Age Central Anatolians, where the Hittite language, related to the Indo-European languages spread by the Yamnaya, was spoken. We thus propose that the final unity of the speakers of the ""Proto-Indo-Anatolian"" ancestral language of both Anatolian and Indo-European languages can be traced to CLV cline people sometime between 4400-4000 BCE.

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

Methods: We use a probabilistic framework to estimate the likelihood that novel influenza virus cases would be detected through testing in different community and healthcare settings (urgent care, emergency department, hospital, and intensive care unit (ICU)) while at low frequencies in the United States. Parameters were informed by data on seasonal influenza virus activity and existing testing practices. Results: In a baseline scenario reflecting the presence of 100 novel virus infections with similar severity to seasonal influenza viruses, the median probability of detecting at least one infection per month was highest in urgent care settings (72%) and when community testing was conducted at random among the general population (77%). However, urgent care testing was over 15 times more efficient (estimated as the number of cases detected per 100,000 tests) due to the larger number of tests required for community testing. In scenarios that assumed increased clinical severity of novel virus infection, median detection probabilities increased across all healthcare settings, particularly in hospitals and ICUs (up to 100%) where testing also became more efficient. Conclusions: Our results suggest that novel influenza virus circulation is likely to be detected through existing healthcare surveillance, with the most efficient testing setting impacted by the disease severity profile. These analyses can help inform future testing strategies to maximize the likelihood of novel influenza detection.","NA","medrxiv",1716069878077

While RdRp is the target of several viral inhibitors, the active site has several pitfalls when translating in vitro inhibitors to the clinic. The highly polar residues within the active site often necessitate the use of highly polar or charged compounds, especially when designing nucleoside analog inhibitors, posing significant challenges in optimizing drug-likeness and membrane permeability for clinical efficacy. Here, we investigated the broad-spectrum potential of the allosteric Thumb-1 cryptic site of the RdRp, which to date has only been adequately studied in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). To explore this potential antiviral target, we used a suite of bioinformatics techniques, including homology modeling and multiple sequence alignments, to reveal the conserved landscape of the Thumb-1 site across +ssRNA viruses. We then used ChemPrint, our Mol-GDL (Molecular-Geometric Deep Learning) machine learning model to predict drug inhibition of the Thumb-1 site in RdRp across +ssRNA viruses. Here, we identify MDL-001 as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate with favorable properties that enable oral and once-a-day dosing. We also show how the cryptic nature of the Thumb-1 site masks itself to conventional virtual screening techniques, like docking, where activity prediction is heavily based on solving or predicting an accurate structure of the open pocket. This study demonstrates the utility of this approach in drug discovery for broad-spectrum antivirals that target the Thumb-1 site.

Lay SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThis paper addresses the challenge of developing broad-spectrum antivirals against +ssRNA viruses, which include pathogens like HCV and SARS-CoV-2. The highly conserved RdRp Thumb-1 site across these viruses is identified as a potential target for broad spectrum antiviral drugs, which would be vital tools in prophylactic and therapeutic responses to future viral threats.

MethodologyUtilizing bioinformatics and deep learning (through our proprietary AI platform called GALILEO), the study maps the conserved landscape of the RdRp Thumb-1 site across a range of human pathogenic +ssRNA viruses and screens for potential inhibitory compounds.

Key DiscoveriesMDL-001 emerges as a potential broad-spectrum non-nucleoside antiviral drug candidate and the RdRp Thumb-1 site exists as a family of targets, many of which may be targetable by a single drug.

Impact and ImplicationsThe discovery that the Thumb-1 site of RdRp can be targeted by small molecules for antiviral activity against a range of +ssRNA viruses.

Future DirectionsThis work paves the way for further development of MDL-001 and research for other broad-spectrum antiviral compounds that target the RdRp Thumb-1 domain.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

This study introduces our GALILEO AI drug discovery platform and its foundational ChemPrint model, designed to improve the efficiency of drug discovery. Addressing the challenges of low hit rates and the difficulty in exploring novel chemical spaces, this platform adopts adaptive molecular embeddings and stringent model training environments to enhance predictive capabilities and navigate uncharted molecular territories. We validate this approach through a case study targeting the AXL and BRD4 oncology targets, where ChemPrint achieved a 45.5% in vitro hit rate and identified 20 novel acting compounds. These compounds exhibited substantial chemical novelty, with an average Tanimoto similarity score of 0.32 to their training set, significantly diverging from known compounds and demonstrating ChemPrints capability to extrapolate, surpassing traditional benchmarks and industry standards.

DesignThis case series study analyzed adverse event (AE) reports submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database following RSVPreF immunization from September 1, 2023, to February 23, 2024.

SettingVAERS, as a national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system, provides insights into the safety profile of the RSVPreF vaccine in a real-world setting.

ParticipantsSurveillance data included all AE reports submitted to VAERS for pregnant individuals following vaccination.

ExposureReceipt of RSVPreF vaccine among pregnant individuals in the U.S.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresDescriptive statistics assessed all AE reports with RSVPreF, including frequency, gestational age at vaccination, time to AE onset, and serious report proportions. The Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) was utilized, estimating the information component (IC) to identify disproportionate reporting of RSVPreF-event pairs.

ResultsVAERS received 77 reports pertained to RSVPreF vaccination in pregnant individuals, with 42 (54.55%) classified as serious. The most reported non-pregnancy-specific AEs were headache, injection site erythema, and injection site pain. Preterm birth was the most frequently reported pregnancy-specific AE, followed by preterm premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, cervical dilatation, and hemorrhage during pregnancy. The median time from immunization to reported preterm birth was 3 days, with two-thirds of cases within a week. Disproportionality analysis indicated a significant signal for various AEs, particularly highlighting preterm birth with an IC of 2.18 (95%CI, 1.54-2.63), suggesting that reports of preterm birth associated with RSVPreF vaccination occurred more frequently than statistically expected.

ConclusionsWhile reported AEs were generally consistent with the safety profile observed in prelicensure studies, this study highlights ongoing concern about preterm birth among pregnant individuals following RSVPreF vaccination. Comprehensive longitudinal follow-up, including prospective pregnancy registries and infant follow-up studies is urgently required.","NA","medrxiv",1716069878077

Here, we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), a genome editing system that combines the programmability and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 with the RNA-mediated gene insertion capabilities of the human LINE1 (L1) element. CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1716069878077

We investigated the association between long-term exposure to wildfire smoke PM2.5 and all-cause mortality and mortality from a wide range of specific causes in all 3,108 counties in the contiguous U.S., 2007-2020. Monthly county-level mortality data were collected from the National Center for Health Statistics. Wildfire smoke PM2.5 concentration was derived from a 10x10 km2 resolution spatiotemporal model. Controlling for non-smoke PM2.5, air temperature, and unmeasured spatial and temporal confounders, we found a non-linear association between 12-month moving average concentration of smoke PM2.5 and monthly all-cause mortality rate. Relative to a month with the long-term smoke PM2.5 exposure below 0.1 g/m3, all-cause mortality increased by 0.40-1.54 and 3.65 deaths per 100,000 people per month when the 12-month moving average of PM2.5 concentration was of 0.1-5 and 5+ g/m3, respectively. Cardiovascular, ischemic heart disease, digestive, endocrine, diabetes, mental, suicide, and chronic kidney disease mortality were all found to be associated with long-term wildfire smoke PM2.5 exposure. Smoke PM2.5 contributed to approximately 30,180 all-cause deaths/year (95% CI: 21,449, 38,910) in the contiguous U.S. Higher smoke PM2.5-related increases in mortality rates were found for people aged 65 above and racial minority populations. Positive interaction effects with extreme heat were also observed. Our study identified the detrimental effects of long-term exposure to wildfire smoke PM2.5 on a wide range of mortality outcomes, underscoring the need for public health actions and communication to prepare communities and individuals to mitigate smoke exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1716069878077

Recent research has highlighted the therapeutic potential of psychoactive substances and especially 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), in alleviating trauma symptoms in chronic patients. However, little is known regarding the consequences of trauma that is acutely experienced under the influence of psychoactive substances. Here we investigated the acute experiences and peritraumatic processing of 657 survivors from the high-casualty terror attack at the Supernova music festival in Israel on October 7th, 2023. Data were collected four to twelve weeks following the TE. Approximately two-thirds of survivors were under the influence of psychoactive substances at the time of the TE, offering a tragic and unique natural experiment on the impact of psychoactive compounds on TE processing. Our findings reveal that individuals who experienced the trauma while under the influence of MDMA demonstrated significantly improved intermediate outcomes compared to those who were under the influence of other substances or no substances at all. Specifically, the MDMA group reported increased feelings of social support, more social interactions and enhanced quality of sleep during the peritraumatic period, yielding reduced levels of mental distress and reduced PTSD symptom severity. These novel findings suggest that the influence of MDMA during the TE may carry protective effects into the peritraumatic period, possibly mediated through the known effects of MDMA in reducing negative emotions and elevating prosociality. These protective effects in turn may mitigate the development of early psychopathology-related symptoms. Current preliminary results underscore the need for further understanding of the cognitive and physiological processes by which psychedelic substances intersect with trauma recovery processes.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

These viruses have spread across the Americas causing morbidity and mortality in both wild and domestic birds as well as some mammalian species, including cattle. Many surveillance programs in wildlife as well as commercial poultry operations have detected these viruses. Here we conducted surveillance of avian species in the urban environment in New York City. We detected highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in six samples from four different bird species and performed full genome sequencing. Sequence analysis showed the presence of multiple different genotypes. Our work highlights that the interface between animals and humans that may give rise to zoonotic infections or even pandemics is not limited to rural environments and commercial poultry operations but extends into the heart of our urban centers.

ImportanceWhile surveillance for avian influenza viruses is often focused on migratory routes and their associated stop-over locations, or commercial poultry operations, many bird species - including migratory birds - frequent or live in urban green spaces and wetlands. This brings them into contact with a highly dense population of humans and pets providing an extensive urban animal-human interface in which the general public may have little awareness of circulating infectious diseases.

We report genome-wide data from 78 prehistoric North Pontic individuals to understand the genetic makeup of the people involved in these migrations and discover the reasons for their success. First, we show that native North Pontic foragers had ancestry not only from Balkan and Eastern hunter-gatherers6 but also from European farmers and, occasionally, Caucasus hunter-gatherers. More dramatic inflows ensued during the Eneolithic, when migrants from the Caucasus-Lower Volga area7 moved westward, bypassing the local foragers to mix with Trypillian farmers advancing eastward. People of the Usatove archaeological group in the Northwest Pontic were formed ca. 4500 BCE with an equal measure of ancestry from the two expanding groups. A different Caucasus-Lower Volga group, moving westward in a distinct but temporally overlapping wave, avoided the farmers altogether, and blended with the foragers instead to form the people of the Serednii Stih archaeological complex7. A third wave of expansion occurred when Yamna descendants of the Serednii Stih forming ca. 4000 BCE expanded during the Early Bronze Age (3300 BCE). The temporal gap between Serednii Stih and the Yamna expansion is bridged by a genetically Yamna individual from Mykhailivka in Ukraine (3635-3383 BCE), a site of uninterrupted archaeological continuity across the Eneolithic-Bronze Age transition, and the likely epicenter of Yamna formation. Each of these three waves propagated distinctive ancestries while also incorporating outsiders during its advance, a flexible strategy forged in the North Pontic region that may explain its peoples outsized success in spreading their genes and culture across Eurasia3-5,8-10.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878077

Stress-induced exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following translational shutoff is thought to cause condensation by allowing new multivalent RNA-dependent interactions, with RNA length and associated interaction capacity driving increased condensation. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNA species condense in response to multiple unrelated stresses in budding yeast, length plays a minor role, and instead, stress-induced transcripts are preferentially excluded from condensates, enabling their selective translation. Using both endogenous genes and reporter constructs, we show that translation initiation blockade, rather than resulting ribosome-free RNA, causes condensation. These translation initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are biochemically detectable even when stress granules, defined as microscopically visible foci, are absent or blocked. TIICs occur in unstressed yeast cells, and, during stress, grow before the appearance of visible stress granules. Stress-induced transcripts are excluded from TIICs primarily due to the timing of their expression, rather than their sequence features. Together, our results reveal a simple system by which cells redirect translational activity to newly synthesized transcripts during stress, with broad implications for cellular regulation in changing conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878078

However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.","NA","biorxiv",1716069878078
