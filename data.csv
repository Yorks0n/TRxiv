The predictive role of gut microbiome composition during acute infection in the development of LC is not well understood, partly due to the heterogeneous nature of disease. We conducted a longitudinal study of 799 outpatients tested for SARS-CoV-2 (380 positive, 419 negative) and found that individuals who later developed LC harbored distinct gut microbiome compositions during acute infection, compared with both SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals who did not develop LC and negative controls with similar symptomatology. However, the temporal changes in gut microbiome composition between the infectious (0-1 month) and post-infectious (1-2 months) phases was not different between study groups. Using machine learning, we showed that microbiome composition alone more accurately predicted LC than clinical variables. Including clinical data only marginally enhanced this prediction, suggesting that microbiome profiles during acute infection may reflect underlying health status and immune responses thus, help predicting individuals at risk for LC. Finally, we identified four LC symptom clusters, with gastrointestinal and fatigue-only groups most strongly linked to gut microbiome alterations.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1734214149176

While loss of transcription is thought to be universally lethal, the associated mechanisms promoting cell death are not yet known. Here, we show that death following loss of Pol II is not caused by dysregulated gene expression. Instead, death occurs in response to the loss of Pol II protein itself. Loss of Pol II protein exclusively activates apoptosis, and using functional genomics, we identified a previously uncharacterized mechanism, which we call the Pol II Degradation-dependent Apoptotic Response (PDAR). Using the genetic dependencies of PDAR, we identify clinically used drugs that owe their efficacy to a PDAR-dependent mechanism. Our findings unveil a novel apoptotic signaling response that contributes to the efficacy of a wide array of anti-cancer therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Benchmarking indicates OrthoHMM outperforms currently available methods; for example, using a curated set of Bilaterian orthogroups, OrthoHMM showed a 10.3 - 138.9% improvement in precision. Rank-based benchmarking using Bilaterian orthogroups and a novel dataset of orthogroups from organisms in three major eukaryotic kingdoms revealed OrthoHMM had the best overall performance (6.7 - 97.8% overall improvement).

Pacing is a self-management strategy to mitigate symptoms. Our aim was to describe experiences of pacing from the perspectives of adults living with Long COVID.

MethodsWe conducted a community-engaged qualitative descriptive study involving one-on-one online interviews with adults living with Long COVID from Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, and United States to explore experiences of disability. We asked participants about strategies they used to deal with health challenges living with Long COVID. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. We analyzed data using group-based content analytical techniques.

ResultsAmong the 40 participants living with Long COVID, the majority were women (n=25; 63%), white (n=29;73%) and heterosexual (n=30;75%). The median age of participants was 39 years (25th, 75th percentile: 32, 49). Most participants (n=37;93%) used pacing to mitigate or prevent symptoms. Participant described experiences of pacing across five main areas: 1) using pacing as a living strategy (pacing to mitigate multidimensional health challenges; applying pacing to many types of activities; process of pacing experienced as a moving target; pacing experienced as a helpful strategy, but not a cure for Long COVID); 2) learning how to pace (acquiring knowledge about pacing; developing strategies and skills to support pacing); 3) encountering challenges with pacing (learning how to pace; experiencing inequitable access to pacing; experiencing stigma and judgement; undergoing psychological and emotional adjustment from beliefs of  fighting or  pushing through to balancing rest with activity; making sacrifices; and encountering unexpected obstacles); 4) experiencing consequences of not pacing; and 5) conceptualising and describing pacing using analogies or metaphors.

DiscussionPacing is a challenging and complex strategy used to mitigate symptoms of Long COVID. Healthcare providers should work collaboratively with patients to further refine and implement this strategy, when appropriate.","NA","medrxiv",1734214149176

This has led to a focus on using only gene families with a single gene-copy per species, as these families are likely to be composed of orthologs. However, recent work has demonstrated that phylogenetic inference using paralogs is accurate and allows researchers to take advantage of more data. Here, we investigate a case in which using larger gene families actually increases accuracy compared to using single-copy genes alone. Long-branch attraction is a phenomenon in which taxa with long branches may be incorrectly inferred as sister taxa due to homoplasy. The most common solution to long-branch attraction is to increase taxon sampling to break up long branches. Sampling additional taxa is not always feasible, perhaps due to extinction or access to high-quality DNA. We propose the use of larger gene families with additional gene copies to break up long branches. Using simulations, we demonstrate that using larger gene families mitigates the impacts of long-branch attraction across large regions of parameter space. We also analyze data from Chelicerates, with a focus on assessing support for a sister relationship between scorpions and pseudoscorpions. Previous work has suggested that the failure to recover this relationship is due to long-branch attraction between pseudoscorpions and other lineages. Using data from larger gene families increases support for a clade uniting scorpions and pseudoscorpions, further highlighting the potential utility of these gene families in phylogenetic inference.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Insights derived from this phenomenon range from core principles of information processing, such as perceptual inference, to high-level concerns, such as visual awareness. The dominant computational explanations of perceptual multistability are based on the Helmholtzian view of perception as inverse inference. However, these approaches struggle to account for the crucial role played by value, e.g., with percepts paired with reward dominating for longer periods than unpaired ones. In this study, we formulate perceptual multistability in terms of dynamic, value-based, choice, employing the formalism of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We use binocular rivalry as an example, considering different explicit and implicit sources of reward (and punishment) for each percept. The resulting values are time-dependent and influenced by novelty as a form of exploration. The solution of the POMDP is the optimal perceptual policy, and we show that this can replicate and explain several characteristics of binocular rivalry, ranging from classic hallmarks such as apparently spontaneous random switches with approximately gamma-distributed dominance periods to more subtle aspects such as the rich temporal dynamics of perceptual switching rates. Overall, our decision-theoretic perspective on perceptual multistability not only accounts for a wealth of unexplained data, but also opens up modern conceptions of internal reinforcement learning in service of understanding perceptual phenomena, and sensory processing more generally.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

However, controversy has emerged regarding how many functional miRNAs are encoded in the genome, and to what extent non-regulatory products of RNA degradation have been mis-identified as miRNAs. Central to miRNA function is their capacity to associate with an Argonaute (AGO) protein and form an RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC), which mediates target mRNA suppression. We report that numerous ""miRNAs"" previously reported in EMT and cancer contexts, are not incorporated into RISC and are not capable of endogenously silencing target genes, despite the fact that hundreds of publications in the cancer field describe their roles. Apparent function can be driven through the expression of artificial miRNA mimics which is not necessarily reflective of any endogenous gene regulatory function. We present biochemical and bioinformatic criteria that can be used to distinguish functional miRNAs from mistakenly annotated RNA fragments.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we define the individual and combined contribution of KAT6A, KAT6B and KAT7, in MLL-FP leukaemia. Whilst inhibition of KAT6A/B is efficacious in some pre-clinical models, simultaneous targeting of KAT7, with the novel inhibitor PF-9363, increases the therapeutic efficacy. KAT7 interacts with Menin and the MLL complex and is co-localised at chromatin to co-regulate the MLL-FP transcriptional program. Inhibition of KAT6/KAT7 provides an orthogonal route to targeting Menin to disable the transcriptional activity of MLL-FP. Consequently, combined inhibition rapidly evicts the MLL-FP from chromatin, potently represses oncogenic transcription and overcomes primary resistance to Menin inhibitors. Moreover, PF-9363 or genetic depletion of KAT7 can also overcome acquired genetic/non-genetic resistance to Menin inhibition. These data provide the molecular rationale for rapid clinical translation of combination therapy in MLL-FP leukaemia.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Pseudomonas bacteria isolated from diseased liverworts in the wild successfully re-infected M. polymorpha in pure culture conditions, producing high in planta bacterial densities and causing prominent tissue maceration. Comparative genomic analysis of Marchantia-associated P. viridiflava identified core virulence machinery like the type-III secretion system (T3SS) and conserved effectors (AvrE and HopM1) that were essential for liverwort infection. Disease assays performed in Nicotiana benthamiana further confirmed that liverwort-associated P. viridiflava infect flowering plants in an effector-dependent manner.

However, we know very little about their structure, nor their role in the development of the economically, medicinally, and culturally important flowers. Here we assembled genomes, with phased sex chromosomes, for three XY male hops (Humulus sp.), two XY male Cannabis, and two monoecious Cannabis individuals. Most of the non-recombining regions evolved prior to the divergence between Cannabis and Humulus around 47 MYA supporting this sex chromosome origin is among the oldest known in flowering plants. The Y chromosomes are highly-degenerate, with very few genes remaining, and show substantial rearrangements, while the X also shows faster rates of molecular evolution. The Cannabaceae sex chromosomes contain critical genes for flower development and the production of key compounds like bitter acids and cannabinoids, which are important traits for the plants. The sex chromosomes thus have played a vital role in the domestication and breeding of these species, and more generally, the Cannabaceae family.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Here we report three-dimensional structures of three large ornate bacterial RNAs using cryogenic electron microscopy at resolutions of 2.9-3.1 [A]. Without precedent among previously characterized natural RNA molecules, Giant, Ornate, Lake- and Lactobacillales-Derived (GOLLD), Rumen-Originating, Ornate, Large (ROOL), and Ornate Large Extremophilic (OLE) RNAs form homo-oligomeric complexes whose stoichiometries are retained at concentrations lower than expected in the cell. OLE RNA forms a dimeric complex with long co-axial pipes spanning two monomers. Both GOLLD and ROOL form distinct RNA-only multimeric nanocages with diameters larger than the ribosome. Extensive intra- and intermolecular A-minor interactions, kissing loops, an unusual A-A helix, and other interactions stabilize the three complexes. Sequence covariation analysis of these large RNAs reveals evolutionary conservation of intermolecular interactions, supporting the biological importance of large, ornate RNA quaternary structures that can assemble without any involvement of proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Establishing the host genetic etiology of anosmia and ageusia in COVID-19 will aid in the overall understanding of the sensorineural aspect of the disease and contribute to possible treatments or cures. By using human genome sequencing data from the University of Iowa (UI) COVID-19 cohort (N=187) and the National Institute of Health All of Us (AoU) Research Program COVID-19 cohort (N=947), we investigated the genetics of anosmia and/or ageusia by employing feature selection techniques to construct a novel variant and gene prioritization pipeline, utilizing machine learning methods for the classification of patients. Models were assessed using a permutation-based variable importance (PVI) strategy for final prioritization of candidate variants and genes. The highest held-out test set area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for models and datasets from the UI cohort was 0.735 and 0.798 for the variant and gene analysis respectively and for the AoU cohort was 0.687 for the variant analysis.

TFs often have drastically different regulatory behaviors depending on promoter context and interacting cofactors. However, the detailed mechanisms by which each TF affects transcription and produce promoter-dependent regulation is unclear. Here, we discover that a simple model explains the regulatory effects of E. coli TFs in a range of contexts. Specifically, we measure the relationship between basal promoter activity and its regulation by diverse TFs and find that the contextual changes in TF function are determined entirely by the basal strength of the regulated promoter: TFs exert lower fold-change on stronger promoters under a precise inverse scaling. Remarkably, this scaling relationship holds for both activators and repressors, indicating a universal mechanism of gene regulation. Our data, which spans between 100-fold activation to 1000-fold repression, is consistent with a model of regulation driven by stabilization of RNAP at the promoter for every TF. Crucially, this indicates that TFs naturally act to maintain homeostatic expression levels across genetic or environmental perturbations, ensuring robust expression of regulated genes.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

While this is a respiratory virus, one feature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was recognized to cause pathogenesis of other organs. Because the membrane fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, binds to its major host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that regulates a critical mediator of cardiovascular diseases, angiotensin II, COVID-19 is largely associated with vascular pathologies. In fact, we have previous reported that postmortem lung tissues collected from patients who died of COVID-19 exhibited thickened pulmonary vascular walls and reduced vascular lumen. The present study extended these findings by further characterizing the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients using larger sample sizes and providing mechanistic information through histological observations. The examination of 56 autopsy lung samples showed thickened vascular walls of small pulmonary arteries after 14 days of disease compared to H1N1 influenza patients who died before COVID-19 pandemic started. Pulmonary vascular remodeling in COVID-19 patients was associated with hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer, perivascular fibrosis, edema and lymphostasis, inflammatory infiltration, perivascular hemosiderosis and neoangiogenesis. We found a correlation between the duration of hospital stay and the thickness of the muscular layer of pulmonary arterial walls. These results further confirm that COVID-19 affects the pulmonary vasculature and warrants an evaluation of patients that survived COVID-19 for possible future development of pulmonary arterial hypertension.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

The deposition of H3K36me3 occurs co-transcriptionally when the methyltransferase SETD2 associates with RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Here we present three cryo-EM structures of SETD2 bound to Pol II elongation complexes at different states of nucleosome passage. Together with functional probing, our results suggest a 3-step mechanism of transcription-coupled H3K36me3 deposition. First, binding to the elongation factor SPT6 tethers the catalytic SET domain in proximity to the upstream DNA. Second, Pol II nucleosome passage leads to the transfer of a hexasome from downstream to upstream, poised for methylation. Finally, continued transcription leads to upstream nucleosome reassembly, partial dissociation of the histone chaperone FACT and sequential methylation of both H3 tails, completing H3K36me3 deposition of an upstream nucleosome after Pol II passage.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

However, their variability complicates reference-based analysis, especially when these chromosomes are missing in the reference genome. Pangenome variation graphs offer a reference-free alternative for studying these chromosomes. Here, we constructed a pangenome variation graph for 73 diverse Fusarium oxysporum genomes, a major fungal plant pathogen with a compartmentalized genome that includes conserved core as well as variable accessory chromosomes. To obtain insights into accessory chromosome dynamics, we first constructed a chromosome similarity network using all-vs-all similarity mapping. We identified eleven core chromosomes conserved across all strains and a substantial number of highly variable accessory chromosomes. Some of these accessory chromosomes are host-specific and likely play a role in determining host range. Using a k-mer based approach we further identified the presence of these accessory chromosomes in all available (581) F. oxysporum assemblies and corroborated the occurrence of host specific accessory chromosomes. To further analyze the evolution of chromosomes in F. oxysporum, we constructed a pangenome variation graph per group of homologous chromosomes. This reveals that accessory chromosomes are composed of different stretches of accessory regions, and possibly rearrangements between accessory regions gave rise to these mosaic accessory chromosomes. Furthermore, we show that accessory chromosomes are likely horizontally transferred in natural populations. Our findings demonstrate that a pangenome variation graph is a powerful approach to elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of accessory chromosomes in F. oxysporum, which is not only a useful resource for Fusarium but provides a framework for similar analyses in other species encoding accessory chromosomes.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

In winter 2022/23 we ran a pilot study aiming to introduce multiplex testing to determine the incidence and burden of SARS-CoV-2, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in our cohort of UK healthcare workers (HCWs).

MethodsThe pilot study was conducted from 28/11/2022-31/03/2023 within the SIREN prospective cohort study. Participants completed fortnightly questionnaires, capturing symptoms and sick leave, and multiplex PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, influenza and RSV, regardless of symptoms. PCR-positivity rates by virus were calculated over time, and viruses were compared by symptoms and severity. Self-reported symptoms and associated sick leave were described. Sick leave rates were compared by vaccination status and demographics.

Results5,863 participants were included, 84.6% female, 70.3% [&ge;]45-years, and 33.4% were nurses. PCR-positivity peaked in early December for all three viruses (4.6 positives per 100 tests (95%CI 3.5, 5.7) SARS-CoV-2, 3.9 (95%CI 2.2, 5.6) influenza, 1.4 (95%CI 0.4, 2.4) RSV), declining to <0.3/100 tests after January for influenza/RSV, and around 2.5/100 tests for SARS-CoV-2. Over one-third of all infections were asymptomatic, and symptoms were similar for all viruses. 1,368 (23.3%) participants reported taking sick leave, median 4 days (range 1-59). Rates of sick leave were higher in participants with co-morbidities, working in clinical settings, and who had not been vaccinated (COVID-19 booster or seasonal influenza vaccine) versus those who had received neither vaccine (2.04 vs 1.41 sick days/100 days, adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio 1.47 (95%CI 1.38, 1.56).

ConclusionThis pilot demonstrated the use of multiplex testing allowed better understanding of the impact of seasonal respiratory viruses and respective vaccines on the HCW workforce. This highlights the important information on asymptomatic infection and persisting levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","NA","medrxiv",1734214149176

Here we describe a cost-effective methodology, Rapid Amplified Multiplexed-FISH (or RAM-FISH), based on Hybridization Chain Reaction 3.0 for localizing dozens of transcripts in the same sample. This methodology achieves multiplexing by localizing 3 genes per cycle to detect 30 or more genes within a few days. The method can be applied to fixed tissue sections, entire organs, or whole organisms such as larval Danio rerio, without extensive sample preparation steps. The automation used here can also be adapted to perform other amplification-based FISH.

These disruptions lead to the intestine acting as a reservoir for VRE that seed difficult-to-treat infections. Patients would benefit from new treatments that prevent or treat VRE intestinal colonisation. However, the factors that drive VRE growth in the gut are poorly understood. We demonstrated that multiple antibiotics that promote VRE intestinal colonisation increased the concentration of a wide range of nutrients and decreased the concentration of a wide range of microbial metabolites. We demonstrated that specific short chain fatty acids and branched chain fatty acids found in healthy gut microbiomes inhibited VRE growth, however inhibition was incomplete at physiologically relevant concentrations. We also showed that VRE could use most nutrients increased in antibiotic-treated faecal microbiomes as carbon or nitrogen sources to support their growth, where growth was higher in the presence of oxygen. Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis had some common and some distinct preferences for use of specific nutrients that were enriched in antibiotic-treated faecal microbiomes. Finally, we showed that E. faecium and E. faecalis occupied overlapping but distinct nutrient-defined intestinal niches that promoted high growth when cultured with each other and when cultured with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (another group of multidrug-resistant pathogens).

We propose PLAID (Protein Latent Induced Diffusion), a method for multimodal protein generation that learns and samples from the latent space of a predictor, mapping from a more abundant data modality (e.g., sequence) to a less abundant one (e.g., crystallography structure). Specifically, we address the all-atom structure generation setting, which requires producing both the 3D structure and 1D sequence to define side-chain atom placements. Importantly, PLAID only requires sequence inputs to obtain latent representations during training, enabling the use of sequence databases for generative model training and augmenting the data distribution by 2 to 4 orders of magnitude compared to experimental structure databases. Sequence-only training also allows access to more annotations for conditioning generation. As a demonstration, we use compositional conditioning on 2,219 functions from Gene Ontology and 3,617 organisms across the tree of life. Despite not using structure inputs during training, generated samples exhibit strong structural quality and consistency. Function-conditioned generations learn side-chain residue identities and atomic positions at active sites, as well as hydrophobicity patterns of transmembrane proteins, while maintaining overall sequence diversity.

While cortically implanted brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer high communication bandwidth to assist and rehabilitate these patients, their invasiveness and long-term stability limits broader adoption.

MethodsWe developed a minimally invasive BCI with 8 chronic epidural electrodes above primary sensorimotor cortex to restore hand functions of tetraplegia patients. With wireless powering and neural data transmission, this system enables real-time BCI control of hand movements and hand function rehabilitation in home use. A complete spinal cord injury (SCI) patient with paralyzed hand functions was recruited in this study.

ResultsOver a 9-month period of home use, the patient achieved an average grasping detection F1-score of 0.91, and a 100% success rate in object transfer tests, with this minimally invasive BCI and a wearable exoskeleton hand. This system allowed the patient to perform eating, drinking and other daily tasks involving hand functions. Additionally, the patient showed substantial neurological recovery through consecutive BCI training, regaining the ability to hold objects without BCI. The patient exhibited a 5-point improvement in upper limb motor scores and a 27-point increase in the action research arm test (ARAT).

Here, we enable Solanaceae NLR gene function in rice, soybean and Arabidopsis by co-delivering sensor NLR genes with their cognate NRC-type helper NLRs. In soybean protoplasts and in Arabidopsis plants, Solanum americanum Rpi-amr1, Rpi-amr3 and pepper Bs2 sensor NLRs confer cognate effector responsiveness if co-expressed with NRC helper NLRs. Rice carrying pepper Bs2 and NRCs recognizes the conserved effector, AvrBs2, and resists an important pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola for which no resistance gene is available in rice. Rice lines carrying sensor and helper NLR genes otherwise resemble wild-type, with unaltered basal resistance or field fitness. Thus, interfamily co-transfer of sensor and helper NLRs can broaden utility of sensor NLRs, extending the tools available to control diseases of rice, soybean, Brassicas and other crops.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Cardiac NCCs play a critical role in heart development by orchestrating outflow tract septation, valve formation, aortic arch artery patterning, parasympathetic innervation, and maturation of the cardiac conduction system. Abnormal migration, proliferation, or differentiation of cardiac NCCs can lead to severe congenital cardiovascular malformations. However, the complexity and timing of early embryonic heart development pose significant challenges to studying the molecular mechanisms underlying NCC-related cardiac pathologies. Here, we present a sophisticated functional model of human heart assembloids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, which, for the first time, recapitulates cardiac NCC integration into the human embryonic heart in vitro. NCCs successfully integrated at developmentally relevant stages into heart organoids, and followed developmental trajectories known to occur in the human heart. They demonstrated extensive migration, differentiated into cholinergic neurons capable of generating nerve impulses, and formed mature glial cells. Additionally, they contributed to the mesenchymal populations of the developing outflow tract. Through transcriptomic analysis, we revealed that NCCs acquire molecular features of their cardiac derivatives as heart assembloids develop. NCC-derived parasympathetic neurons formed functional connections with cardiomyocytes, promoting the maturation of the cardiac conduction system. Leveraging this models cellular complexity and functional maturity, we uncovered that early exposure of NCCs to antidepressants harms the development of NCC derivatives in the context of the developing heart. The commonly prescribed antidepressant Paroxetine disrupted the expression of a critical early neuronal transcription factor, resulting in impaired parasympathetic innervation and functional deficits in cardiac tissue. This advanced heart assembloid model holds great promise for high-throughput drug screening and unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying NCC-related cardiac formation and congenital heart defects.

IN BRIEFHuman neural crest heart assembloids resembling the major directions of neural crest differentiation in the human embryonic heart, including parasympathetic innervation and the mesenchymal component of the outflow tract, provide a human-relevant embryonic platform for studying congenital heart defects and drug safety.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Excessive Ca2+ entry is cytotoxic and Ca2+-mobilizing receptors have evolved diverse mechanisms for tight regulation that often include Calmodulin (CaM). TRPA1, an essential Ca2+-permeable ion channel involved in pain signaling and inflammation, exhibits complex Ca2+ regulation with initial channel potentiation followed by rapid desensitization. The molecular mechanisms of TRPA1 Ca2+ regulation and whether CaM plays a role remain elusive. We find that TRPA1 binds CaM best at basal Ca2+ concentration, that they co-localize in resting cells, and that CaM suppresses TRPA1 activity. Combining biochemical, biophysical, modeling, NMR spectroscopy, and functional approaches, we identify an evolutionarily conserved, high-affinity CaM binding element in the distal TRPA1 C-terminus (DCTCaMBE). Genetic or biochemical perturbation of Ca2+/CaM binding to the TRPA1 DCTCaMBE yields hyperactive channels that exhibit drastic slowing of desensitization with no effect on potentiation. Ca2+/CaM TRPA1 regulation does not require the N-lobe, raising the possibility that CaM is not the Ca2+ sensor, per se. Higher extracellular Ca2+ can partially rescue slowed desensitization suggesting Ca2+/CaM binding to the TRPA1 DCTCaMBE primes an intrinsic TRPA1 Ca2+ binding site that, upon binding Ca2+, triggers rapid desensitization. Collectively, our results identify a critical regulatory element in an unstructured TRPA1 region highlighting the importance of these domains, they reveal Ca2+/CaM is an essential TRPA1 auxiliary subunit required for rapid desensitization that establishes proper channel function with implications for all future TRPA1 work, and they uncover a mechanism for receptor regulation by Ca2+/CaM that expands the scope of CaM biology.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

When applied to datasets of the cell cycle, human hematopoiesis, and murine pancreatic endocrinogenesis, RegVelo demonstrates superior predictive power for interactions and perturbation simulations, for example, compared to methods that focus solely on dynamics or GRN inference. To leverage RegVelos full potential, we studied the dynamics of zebrafish neural crest development and underlying regulatory mechanisms using our Smart-seq3 dataset and shared gene expression and chromatin accessibility measurements. Using RegVelos in silico perturbation predictions, validated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout and single-cell Perturb-seq, we establish transcription factor tfec as an early driver and elf1 as a novel regulator of pigment cell fate and propose a gene-regulatory circuit involving tfec and elf1 interactions via the toggle-switch model.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

This difference in organic preservation was also confirmed by FTIR analysis. Studying similar datasets from seven prehistoric and historical sites, we found a similar age-related difference in only one cemetery.

While the Golgi apparatus plays a central role in lysosomal enzyme sorting, the mechanisms linking Golgi function to lysosomal activity remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify the Golgi-resident protein GRASP55, but not its paralog GRASP65, as a key regulator of lysosome function. More specifically, we demonstrate that loss of GRASP55 expression leads to missorting and secretion of lysosomal enzymes, lysosomal dysfunction and bloating. GRASP55 deficiency also disrupts lysosomal mTORC1 signaling, reducing the phosphorylation of its lysosomal substrates, TFEB and TFE3, while sparing its non-lysosomal targets. Mechanistically, GRASP55 interacts with GNPTAB, a critical enzyme required for mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) tagging of lysosomal enzymes, and is necessary for its correct trafficking and stability. These findings reveal an essential role for GRASP55 in Golgi-lysosome communication and lysosomal enzyme trafficking, and suggest that GRASP55/GORASP2 may act as a susceptibility gene for lysosomal storage disorder (LSD)-like conditions. Overall, this work underscores the importance of Golgi-mediated protein sorting in lysosome function and lysosomal mTORC1 signaling, and provides insights into the molecular basis of LSD-related pathologies.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

The input area V1 contains neurons that encode basic visual features, whereas downstream in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) neurons acquire tuning for novel complex feature associations. It has been assumed that each cortical area is composed of repeatable neuronal subtypes, and variations in synaptic strength and connectivity patterns underlie functional specialization. Here we test the hypothesis that diversity in the intrinsic make-up of single neurons contributes to area specialization along the visual pathways. We measured morphological and electrophysiological properties of single neurons in areas V1 and LPFC of marmosets. Excitatory neurons in LPFC were larger, less excitable, and fired broader spikes than V1 neurons. Some inhibitory fast spiking interneurons in the LPFC had longer axons and fired spikes with longer latencies and a more depolarized action potential trough than in V1. Intrinsic bursting was found in subpopulations of both excitatory and inhibitory LPFC but not V1 neurons. The latter may favour temporal summation of spikes and therefore enhanced synaptic plasticity in LPFC relative to V1. Our results show that specialization within the primate visual system permeates the most basic processing level, the single neuron.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

In recent years, a growing number of archaeal viruses have been described, revealing a stunningly diverse range of morphologies that appear unique to archaea. Detailed structural studies are paramount to fully understand how archaeal viruses infect their hosts. However, no complete atomic models of archaeal viruses are available to date.

Comparing the structures of DNA filled and empty capsids, we visualise structural changes occurring upon DNA ejection. By investigating the double-stranded DNA inside the capsid, we elucidate how the genome is spooled upon loading.

Going beyond prior research, we employed advanced information-theoretic analyses, including mutual information (MI) and co-information (co-I), alongside event-related potential (ERP) and temporal generalization analyses (TGA), to characterize auditory prediction error processing across wakefulness and sleep. We hypothesized that a shared neural code would be present across sleep stages, with deeper sleep being associated with reduced information content and increased information redundancy.

To investigate this, twenty-nine young healthy participants were exposed to an auditory  local-global oddball paradigm during wakefulness and continued during an 8-hour sleep opportunity monitored via polysomnography. We focused on  local mismatch responses to a deviating fifth tone following four standard tones.

ERP analyses showed that prediction error processing continued throughout all sleep stages (N1-N3, REM). Mutual information analyses revealed a substantial reduction in the amount of encoded prediction error information during sleep, although ERP amplitudes increased with deeper NREM sleep. In addition, co-information analyses showed that neural dynamics became increasingly redundant with increasing sleep depth. Temporal generalisation analyses revealed a largely shared neural code between N2 and N3 sleep, although it differed between wakefulness and sleep.

Here, we showed how the neural code of the  sentinel processing mode changes from wake to light to deep sleep and REM, characterised by more redundant and less rich neural information in the human cortex as consciousness wanes. This altered stimulus processing reveals how neural information changes with the changes of consciousness states as we traverse the night.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Here we conducted data synthesis to better understand the extinction factors of the iconic Jambato Harlequin frog, Atelopus ignescens, which was widespread in the Ecuadorian Andes before 1985 but vanished in 1988. The mechanism of extinction remains elusive, as it was uncertain whether Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) fungus infection, climate change, or the interaction of the two factors primarily contributed to the rapid population decline. Here we synthesize historical data from natural history museums, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and mitochondrial DNA sequences to uncover the factors that have potentially contributed to the extinction of the Jambato Harlequin frog. We found excessive rare alleles reflected in the negative Tajimas D estimated from the mitochondrial DNA samples collected in 1984, which indicates a selective sweep or bottleneck in the population shortly before the historical extinction. There was a marginal effect of the time before versus during Bd epizootics on the body sizes of the adult males, which was relatively weaker than the sex effect and geographic effect. The body size of adult males, but not the females form a geographic cline where the individuals in the northeast were larger than the males in the southwest. Species distribution modeling based on temperature and precipitation accurately predicted the occupancy of A. ignescens in 1960-69 (R2 = 0.72, accuracy = 0.9). This model further predicted the rapid decline in species distribution over decades of climate change between 1970-2020, which could have contributed to the rapid population decline in the 1980s. Collectively, our data synthesis revealed a strong climate effect and a weak epizootics effect on A. ignescens extinction, which unravels the mysterious rapid population decline and informs ongoing conservation efforts. This investigation inspires future museum genomic studies to dissect the potential climatic maladaptation behind one of the most dramatic extinction events in modern history.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

However, our ability to design new RNA structures remains limited by an incomplete understanding of their folding principles. While global metrics such as the minimum free energy are widely used, they are at odds with naturally occurring structures and incompatible with established design rules. Here, we introduce local stability compensation (LSC), a principle that RNA folding is governed by the local balance between destabilizing loops and their stabilizing adjacent stems, challenging the focus on global energetic optimization. Analysis of over 100, 000 RNA structures revealed that LSC signatures are particularly pronounced in bulges and their adjacent stems, with distinct patterns across different RNA families that align with their biological functions. To validate LSC experimentally, we systematically analyzed thousands of RNA variants using DMS chemical mapping. Our results demonstrate that stem reactivity correlates strongly with LSC (R{superscript 2} = 0.458 for hairpin loops) and that structural perturbations affect folding primarily within [~]6 nucleotides from the loop. These findings establish LSC as a fundamental principle that could enhance the rational design of functional RNAs.

Among multiple cellular roles of RAD52, its functions in homologous recombination repair and protection of stalled replication forks appear to substitute those of the tumor suppressor protein BRCA2. However, the mechanistic details of how RAD52 can substitute BRCA2 functions are only beginning to emerge. RAD52 forms an undecameric ring that is enveloped by eleven [~]200 residue-long disordered regions, making it a highly multivalent and branched protein complex that potentiates supramolecular assembly. Here, we show that RAD52 exhibits homotypic phase separation capacity, and its condensates recruit key players in homologous recombination such as single-stranded (ss)DNA, RPA, and the RAD51 recombinase. Moreover, we show that RAD52 phase separation is regulated by its interaction partners such as ssDNA and RPA. Using fluorescence microscopy, we show that RAD52 can induce the formation of RAD51-ssDNA fibrillar structures. To probe the fine structure of these fibrils, we utilized single-molecule super-resolution imaging via DNA-PAINT and atomic force microscopy and showed that RAD51 fibrils are bundles of individual RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments. We further show that RAD52 induces end-to-end tethering of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments. Overall, we demonstrate unique macromolecular organizational features of RAD52 that may underlie its various functions in the cell.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Clinical studies suggest that alterations in serotonin signalling such as genetic polymorphisms or antidepressant exposure during pregnancy are risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders. However, an understanding of how dysfunctional neuromodulation alters systems level activity over neocortical development is lacking. Here, we use a longitudinal imaging approach to investigate how genetics, pharmacology, and aversive experience disrupt state-dependent serotonin signalling with pathological consequences for sensory processing. We find that all three factors lead to increased neocortical serotonin levels during the initial postnatal period. Genetic deletion of the serotonin transporter or antidepressant dosing results in a switch from hypo- to hyper-cortical activity that arises as a consequence of altered cortical GABAergic microcircuitry. However, the trajectories of these manipulations differ with postnatal exposure to antidepressants having effects on adult sensory encoding. The latter is not seen in the genetic model despite a similar early phenotype, and a distinct influence of maternal genotype on the development of supragranular layers. These results reveal the dynamics and critical nature of serotonin signalling during perinatal life; pharmacological targeting of which can have profound life-long consequences for cognitive development of the offspring.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

The ability of populations to evolve and adapt to environmental changes depends on rates of mutational diversification and the distribution of fitness effects of random mutations. In turn, the distribution of fitness effects of stochastic mutations can be expected to depend on the adaptive state of a population. To systematically study the impact of the interplay between the adaptive state of a population on the ability of asexual populations to adapt, we used a spatial agent-based model of a neoplastic population adapting to a selection pressure of continuous exposure to targeted therapy. We found favorable mutations were overrepresented at the extinction bottleneck but depleted at the adaptive peak. The model-based predictions were tested using an experimental cancer model of an evolution of resistance to a targeted therapy. Consistent with the models prediction, we found that enhancement of the mutation rate was highly beneficial under therapy but moderately detrimental under the baseline conditions. Our results highlight the importance of considering population fitness in evaluating the fitness distribution of random mutations and support the potential therapeutic utility of restricting mutational variability.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

These prototypic heterochromatin compartments are marked by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). However, its contributions to chromocenter structure and function remain debated. We investigated the role of HP1 by recruiting the activators VP16, p65, and VPR to mouse fibroblast chromocenters and analyzed its silencing activity with a transcription reporter. Upon chromocenter decondensation and transcription activation, interactions of HP1 with chromatin and H3K9 trimethylation remained stable, suggesting stoichiometric binding rather than higher-order assembly. HP1-mediated repression required promoter-proximal binding and effectively suppressed VP16-triggered activation but not the stronger activation by VPR. These observations are explained by a 1D lattice binding model, which conceptualizes chromocenters as arrays of repeat units that can independently switch between silenced and activated states. Our findings provide a quantitative framework that explains how chromocenter organization responds to transcriptional activation while maintaining local heterochromatin features.

Speech brain- computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a solution by decoding brain activity into speech. Current neuroprosthetic devices focus on the motor cortex, which might not be usable in all patient populations. Fortunately, many other brain regions have been associated with the speech production process. Here, we investigate which regions are potential (alternative) targets for a speech BCI across a brain-wide distribution within a single study. The distribution includes sulci and subcortical areas, sampled with both a high temporal and a high spatial resolution. Thirty participants were recorded with intracranial electroencephalography during speech production, resulting in 3249 recorded contacts across the brain. We trained machine learning models to continuously predict speech from a brain-wide global to a single-channel local scale. Within each scale we examined a variation of selected electrode contacts based on anatomical features within participants. We found significant speech detection in both gray and white matter tissue, no significant difference between gyri and sulci at any of the analysis scales and limited contribution from subcortical areas. The best potential targets in terms of decoding accuracy and consistency are located within the depth of and surrounding the lateral fissure bilaterally, such as the (sub)central sulcus, transverse temporal gyrus (Heschls gyrus), the supramarginal cortex and parts of the insula. These results highlight the potential benefits of extending beyond the motor cortex and reaching the sulcal depth for speech neuroprostheses.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Since they can suppress pathogen replication and spread rapidly through insect populations, Wolbachia is at the vanguard of public health initiatives to control mosquito-borne diseases. Wolbachias abilities to block pathogens and spread quickly are closely linked to their abundance in host tissues. The most common method for counting Wolbachia is quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), yet qPCR can be insufficient to count rare Wolbachia, necessitating tissue pooling and consequently compromising individual-level resolution of Wolbachia dynamics. Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) offers superior sensitivity, enabling the detection of rare targets and eliminating the need for sample pooling. Here, we report three ddPCR assays to measure total Wolbachia abundance, Wolbachia abundance adjusted for DNA extraction efficiency, and Wolbachia density relative to host genome copies. Using Drosophila melanogaster with wMel Wolbachia as a model, we show these ddPCR assays can reliably detect as few as 7 to 12 Wolbachia gene copies in a 20 L reaction. The designed oligos are homologous to sequences from at least 106 Wolbachia strains across Supergroup A and 53 host species from the Drosophila, Scaptomyza, and Zaprionus genera, suggesting broad utility. These highly sensitive ddPCR assays are expected to significantly advance Wolbachia-host interactions research by enabling the collection of molecular data from individual insect tissues. Their ability to detect rare Wolbachia will be especially valuable in applied and natural field settings where pooling samples could obscure important variation.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Here, we introduce the universal single-copy knock-in system (Universal SKI System or U-SKI), designed for inserting any transgene by CRISPR/Cas9 in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome. The Universal SKI System takes advantage of a plasmid (pSKI), which can also be used for extrachromosomal arrays, to facilitate the insertion of a transgene at specific safe harbor loci on each autosomal chromosome. The pSKI plasmid contains multiple restriction sites for easy cloning and serves as a CRISPR/Cas9-based insertion repair template because it has two synthetic and long homology arms that recombine with the SKI cassettes. This system also uses a single crRNA guide, which acts as a Co-CRISPR enrichment marker. Overall, the Universal SKI System is highly flexible; with the same Universal SKI cassette on each autosome, researchers can select the insertion site and streamline tracking while reducing the complexity of expressing single-copy transgenes in C. elegans.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

This capacity for adjustment, known as phenotypic plasticity, is frequently regarded as a mere ""response"" rather than a distinct trait with its own genetic basis, particularly in agricultural science. As a result, plasticity is often oversimplified and viewed as an undesirable phenomenon when the goal is to achieve trait stability. In this study, we present a quantitative metric to measure phenotypic plasticity and provide evidence, through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in chickpea, that plasticity is indeed a genetically based trait, comparable to any other agronomic trait.

Our study explores whether this evolutionary principle extends to cultivated crops. In crop science, phenotypic plasticity is generally understood as a short-term response to environmental factors. Yet, the long-term evolutionary changes in both plastic and non-plastic traits under different cultivation regimes remain largely unexamined. Herein, we developed a novel mechanistic crop growth model, collectively termed the Trait-Environment Fitness Interaction (TEFI) Model, to study if and how trait plasticity varies among crops under different cultivation regimes. Our results, based on the TEFI Model, show higher trade-offs between fitness and plasticity. Specifically, we observed the evolution of higher plasticity in crops subjected to intermittent cultivation, which experienced more variable environments. However, this higher plasticity does not compensate for fitness losses due to the high rate of environmental unpredictability. Conversely, species under relatively stable conditions tend to evolve with reduced plasticity. Using real-world crop datasets, we validated the theoretical predictions of the TEFI Model, which suggest that the longer the interruption, the higher the plasticity. Our results highlight the evolutionary impact of cultivation patterns on trait plasticity and its importance in crop fitness. Ultimately, our findings illustrate how evolutionary principles of plasticity, as captured by the TEFI Model, can inform sustainable crop improvement strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

In this study, using a proteomic-based approach, we show that chlorite stress also triggers the overproduction of the periplasmic chaperone Spy. This response is mediated by the activation of the BaeSR two-component system. Furthermore, both in vivo and in vitro evidence reveal that Spys susceptibility to oxidation is critical for its chaperone activity. We demonstrate that the MsrPQ repair system ensures Spys functionality by reducing its Met-O, thereby safeguarding its role in periplasmic protein homeostasis.

We show here that ""inside-out"" proton signaling through the endosomal Na+/H+ Exchanger 6 (NHE6) activates the late endosome master regulator Rab7. The mechanism involves potent inactivation of the Rab7 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) TBC1D5 with decreasing pH. NHE6 interacts with TBC1D5 in a complex with Rab7. Neurons from NHE6-null mice or mice engineered with a selective defect in NHE6 proton efflux exhibit blocked endosome maturation and decreased active Rab7, consistent with an overactive Rab7 GAP. Finally, epistatic knock-down of TBC1D5, thereby reducing Rab7 GAP activity, in NHE6-null neurons rescues Rab7 GTPase cycling and endosome maturation. Importantly, NHE6 is mutated in Christianson Syndrome underscoring the significance of these mechanisms to neurodegeneration. We conclude that lumen acidification regulates pH-dependent Rab GTPase cycling to coordinate late endosome maturation by a process involving proton signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Longitudinal experiments enabled by this framework illuminate how different methods of selecting training signals enable improvement on the tasks. We found that for most organoids, training signals chosen by artificial reinforcement learning yield better performance on the task than randomly chosen training signals or the absence of a training signal. This systematic approach to studying learning mechanisms in vitro opens new possibilities for therapeutic interventions and biological computation.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

FastReseg introduces a novel class of algorithm that employs transcriptomic data not to redefine cell boundaries but to rectify inaccuracies within existing image-based segmentation outputs. By combining the rich information from image-based methods with the 3D precision of transcriptomic analysis, FastReseg enhances cell segmentation accuracy. A key innovation of FastReseg approach is its transcript scoring system, which scores each transcript for its goodness-of-fit within host cell using log-likelihood ratio. This scoring system facilitates the quick identification and correction of spatial doublets, i.e. cells erroneously segmented due to close proximity or spatial overlap in 2D. FastReseg approach offers several advantages: it reduces the risks of circularity in deriving cell boundaries from expression data and minimizes spatial-dependent biases arising from erroneous segmentation. It also addresses computational challenges often associated with existing transcript-based methods by introducing a heuristic, modular workflow that efficiently processes large datasets, a critical feature given the increasing size of spatial transcriptomics datasets. Its modular workflow allows for individual components to be optimized and seamlessly integrated back into the overall pipeline, accommodating ongoing advancements in segmentation technology. By enabling efficient management of large datasets and providing a scalable solution for refining cell segmentation, FastReseg is poised to enhance the quality and interpretability of spatial transcriptomics data even as underlying image-based cell segmentation techniques evolve.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Here, we used multiplex super-resolution proteometric imaging through array tomography to define features of single synapses in the adult mouse neocortex. We find that glutamatergic synapses cluster into subclasses that parallel the distinct biochemical and functional categories of receptor subunits: GluA1/4, GluA2/3 and GluN1/GluN2B. Two of these subclasses align with physiological expectations based on synaptic plasticity: large AMPAR-rich synapses may represent potentiated synapses, whereas small NMDAR-rich synapses suggest ""silent"" synapses. The NMDA receptor content of large synapses correlates with spine neck diameter, and thus the potential for coupling to the parent dendrite. Conjugate array tomography's rigorous registration of immunofluorescence with electron microscopy provides validation for future super-resolution imaging studies in other systems. No barriers prevent generalization of this approach to other species, laying a foundation for future studies of human disorders and therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Neutrophil activation is regulated, in part, by dynamic changes in gene expression. In this study we have used RNAseq to measure the transcriptomes of neutrophils from people with severe, methotrexate-refractory RA and healthy controls. We identified a dynamic gene expression profile in people with severe RA. This is dominated by a type-I interferon-induced gene expression signature as well as activation of genes regulating neutrophil degranulation, NET production, response to ROS and oxidative stress. Whilst we did not detect significantly elevated levels of interferon-alpha in RA blood sera, we identified increased expression in RA neutrophils of miR-96-5p and miR-183-5p which regulate activation of the interferon pathway as members of the miR-183C cluster. We also detected significantly elevated NET debris in RA blood sera (p<0.05). Using gene set variation analysis we explored the heterogeneity of neutrophil gene expression in RA and identified subsets of patients with gene expression profiles reflecting enhanced neutrophil degranulation and cytotoxicity, tissue inflammation or activation by interferons. Comparison with published single-cell RNAseq datasets identified RA transcriptomes where neutrophils were polarised by genes relating to early or late cell maturity, with significant genes in each polarised state being regulated by miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-183-5p or miR-96-5p. Overall our study demonstrates the heterogeneity of the RA neutrophil transcriptome and proposes miRNA-driven mechanisms for regulating the activated neutrophil phenotype in RA.","NA","medrxiv",1734214149176

Despite multiple studies reporting this connection, the mechanism by which T2D exacerbates AD is poorly understood. It is challenging to design studies that address co-occurring and comorbid diseases, limiting the number of existing evidence bases. To address this challenge, we expanded the applications of a computational framework called Translatable Components Regression (TransComp-R), initially designed for cross-species translation modeling, to perform cross-disease modeling to identify biological programs of T2D that may exacerbate AD pathology. Using TransComp-R, we combined peripheral blood-derived T2D and AD human transcriptomic data to identify T2D principal components predictive of AD status. Our model revealed genes enriched for biological pathways associated with inflammation, metabolism, and signaling pathways from T2D principal components predictive of AD. The same T2D PC predictive of AD outcomes unveiled sex-based differences across the AD datasets. We performed a gene expression correlational analysis to identify therapeutic hypotheses tailored to the T2D-AD axis. We identified six T2D and two dementia medications that induced gene expression profiles associated with a non-T2D or non-AD state. Finally, we assessed our blood-based T2DxAD biomarker signature in post-mortem human AD and control brain gene expression data from the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus. Using partial least squares discriminant analysis, we identified a subset of genes from our cross-disease blood-based biomarker panel that significantly separated AD and control brain samples. Our methodological advance in cross-disease modeling identified biological programs in T2D that may predict the future onset of AD in this population. This, paired with our therapeutic gene expression correlational analysis, also revealed alogliptin, a T2D medication that may help prevent the onset of AD in T2D patients.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Two emerging intuitive mental paradigms, Visual Imagery (VI) and Imagined Speech (IS) show promise to optimise the development of non-invasive BCIs, which involves the extraction of corresponding neural patterns during the imagined tasks. This study took a comprehensive user-centric approach to build on the current foundation of knowledge on VI and IS EEG-BCIs utilising an adapted 1D-CNN to optimise the classification decoding performance. Twenty healthy participants were assessed for their ability to visualise imagery in their minds and performed the VI and IS mental paradigms in two class conditions ''push'' and ''relax''. It was shown that alpha and beta suppression was observed during the ''push'' condition of VI compared to the ''relax'' condition, and those that scored higher in the VVIQ had better VI classification accuracy than those who did not. The adapted 1D-CNN model performed well for classification between the two classes ''push'' and ''relax'' at 89.3% and 77.87% performance accuracy for VI and IS, respectively. These findings contribute to the current body of work on VI BCI, that it is a dynamic and plausible option compared to standard BCI paradigms, and VI BCI illiteracy could potentially be controlled by VVIQ.

Spatial transcriptomics, which provides spatially resolved gene expression profiles overlaid on histology images, offers a unique opportunity to integrate morphological and expression features, thereby deepening our understanding of tumor biology. However, spatial transcriptomics experiments with patient samples in either clinical trials or clinical care are costly and challenging, whereas histology images are generated routinely and available for many legacy prospective cohorts of disease progression and outcomes in well-annotated cohorts. Inferring spatial transcriptomics profiles computationally from these histology images would significantly expand our understanding of tumor biology, but paired data for training multi-modal spatial-histology models remains limited. Here, we tackle this challenge by incorporating performant foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets of pathology images and single-cell RNA-Seq, respectively, which provide useful embeddings to underpin multi-modal models. To this end, we developed PathOmCLIP, a model trained with contrastive loss to create a joint-embedding space between a histopathology foundation model and a single-cell RNA-seq foundation model. We incorporate a set transformer to gather localized neighborhood tumor architecture following contrastive training, which further enhances performance and is necessary to obtain robust results. We validate PathOmCLIP across five tumor types and achieve significant performance improvements in gene expression prediction tasks over other methods. PathOmCLIP can be applied to many archived histology images, unlocking valuable clinical information and facilitating new biomarker discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

MethodsUsing a population-based panel study of 9,820 adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large, integrated healthcare system, we compared survey-defined ME/CFS-like illness with presence of an ME/CFS diagnosis in the electronic health record (EHR) to evaluate ME/CFS underdiagnosis.

ResultsOf those with survey-defined ME/CFS-like illness, an estimated 97.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 97.1%-98.4%) did not have an ME/CFS diagnosis in the EHR. The group without EHR diagnosis was younger, less likely to identify as white non-Hispanic, and more likely to have developed fatigue in the past three years than the EHR diagnosed group. Both diagnosed and undiagnosed ME/CFS-like illness groups had significantly impaired physical, cognitive, and social functioning, and significantly worse mental health and anxiety than those without ME/CFS-like illness.

ConclusionME/CFS is underdiagnosed in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California healthcare system. Enhanced syndromic surveillance that characterizes patients with ME/CFS who have not been diagnosed has the potential to increase timely recognition of ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1734214149176

It is mediated by conserved ATG proteins, which coordinate autophagosome biogenesis and selective cargo degradation. Among these, the ubiquitin-like ATG8 protein plays a central role by linking cargo to the growing autophagosomes through interacting with selective autophagy receptors. Unlike most ATG proteins, the ATG8 gene family is significantly expanded in vascular plants, but its functional specialization remains poorly understood. Using transcriptional and translational reporters in Arabidopsis thaliana, we revealed that ATG8 isoforms are differentially expressed across tissues and form distinct autophagosomes within the same cell. To explore ATG8 specialization, we generated the nonuple{Delta} atg8 mutant lacking all nine ATG8 isoforms. The mutant displayed hypersensitivity to carbon and nitrogen starvation, coupled with defects in bulk and selective autophagy as shown by biochemical and ultrastructural analyses. Complementation experiments demonstrated that ATG8A could rescue both carbon and nitrogen starvation phenotypes, whereas ATG8H could only complement carbon starvation. Proximity labeling proteomics further identified isoform-specific interactors under nitrogen starvation, underscoring their functional divergence. These findings provide genetic evidence for functional specialization of ATG8 isoforms in plants and lay the foundation for investigating their roles in diverse cell types and stress conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Expansion proceeds via two distinct waves of arterial cell proliferation along blood flow that are spatially stochastic, yet temporally coordinated. Each wave exhibits unique cell cycle kinetics and properties, with the first wave exhibiting cell cycle durations as fast as 6 hours. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed changes in fatty acid metabolism concomitant with an increase in cell size.

However, creating high-quality genomic FMs from scratch is resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power and high-quality pre-training data. The success of large language models (LLMs) in NLP has largely been driven by industrial-scale efforts leveraging vast, diverse corpora and massive computing infrastructure. In this work, we aim to bypass the data and computational bottlenecks of creating genomic FMs from scratch and instead propose repurposing existing LLMs for genomics tasks. Inspired by the recently observed  cross-modal transfer phenomenon - where transformers pre-trained on natural language can generalize to other modalities - we introduce L2G, which adapts a pre-trained LLM architecture for genomics using neural architecture search (NAS) and a novel three-stage training procedure. Remarkably, without requiring extensive pre-training on DNA sequence data, L2G achieves superior performance to fine-tuned genomic FMs and task-specific models on more than half of tasks across multiple genomics benchmarks. In an enhancer activity prediction task, L2G further demonstrates its capacity to identify significant transcription factor motifs.

PathoFact, a bioinformatics pipeline introduced in 2021, provides insights into ARGs, VFs, and bacterial toxins from metagenomic data. However, recent advancements in bioinformatics highlight the need for an updated version of PathoFact. We introduce PathoFact 2.0, an enhanced pipeline for improved ARG, VF, and toxin prediction. Key updates include an updated machine learning (ML) model for VF identification, a new ML model for toxin identification, expanded hidden Markov model profiles, and the antiSMASH 7.0 integration for predicting biosynthetic gene clusters. These upgrades make PathoFact 2.0 a more powerful, user-friendly platform for predicting microbiome-based pathogenicity and resistance, offering a crucial tool for better understanding and addressing the challenges posed by antimicrobial resistance and infectious diseases.

However, current approaches require sharing the covariance matrix between variants for each study and trait of interest. For large-scale studies with many phenotypes, these matrices can be cumbersome to calculate, store, and share. To address this challenge, we present REMETA, an efficient tool for meta-analysis of gene-based tests. REMETA uses a single sparse covariance reference file per study that is rescaled for each phenotype using single variant summary statistics. We develop methods to apply REMETA to binary traits with case-control imbalance, and estimate allele frequencies, genotype counts and effect sizes of burden tests. We demonstrate the performance and advantages of our approach via meta-analysis of 5 traits in 469,376 samples in UK Biobank. The open-source REMETA software tools and framework will facilitate meta-analysis across large scale exome sequencing studies from diverse studies that cannot easily be brought together.","NA","medrxiv",1734214149176

Research gathered from model species, particularly Arabidopsis thaliana, has revealed that the nuclear auxin pathway controls many of these processes through transcriptional regulation. Recently, a non-transcriptional pathway based on rapid phosphorylation mediated by kinases has been described, complementing the understanding of the complexity of auxin-regulated processes. Phylogenetic inferences of both pathways indicate that only some of the components are conserved beyond land plants. This raises fundamental questions about the evolutionary origin of auxin responses and whether algal sisters share mechanistic features with land plants. Here we explore auxin responses in the unicellular streptophyte alga Penium margaritaceum. By assessing physiological, transcriptomic and cellular responses we found that auxin triggers cell proliferation, gene regulation and acceleration of cytoplasmic streaming. Notably, all these responses are also triggered by the structurally related tryptophan. These results identify shared auxin response features among land plants and algae, and suggest that less chemically specific responses preceded the emergence of auxin-specific regulatory networks in land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Yet insights into dikaryotic fungi that separate their haploid genomes into distinct nuclei is limited. Here we explore the impact of dikaryotism on the genome biology of a long-term asexual clone of the wheat pathogenic fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. We use Oxford Nanopore (ONT) duplex sequencing combined with Hi-C to generate a T2T nuclear-phased assembly with >99.999% consensus accuracy. We show that this fungus has large regional centromeres enriched in LTR retrotransposons with a single centromeric dip in methylation that suggests one kinetochore attachment site per chromosomes. The centromeres of chromosomes pairs are most often highly diverse in sequence and kinetochore attachment sites are not always positionally conserved. Each nucleus carries a unique array of rDNAs with >200 copies that harbour nucleus-specific sequence variations. The inter-haplotype diversity between the two nuclear genomes is caused by large-scale structural variations linked to transposable elements. Nanopore long-read cDNA analysis across distinct infection conditions revealed pervasive allele specific expression for nearly 20% of all heterozygous gene pairs. Genes involved in plant infection were significantly enriched in ASE genes which appears to be mediated by elevated CpG gene body methylation of the lower expressed pair. This suggests that epigenetically regulated ASE is likely a previously overlooked mechanism facilitating plant infection. Overall, our study reveals how dikaryotism uniquely shapes key eukaryotic genome features.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Identifying organisms that can serve as biomonitors of lead contamination and models to understand mechanisms of lead tolerance is therefore an important goal. We used the Cuban brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) in New Orleans, USA, to investigate the consequences of variation in environmental lead exposure at the physiological and gene regulatory levels. We found that brown anole blood lead levels are associated with soil lead contamination, and that their blood lead levels are extreme. At our most contaminated site, the mean and highest individual blood lead levels were over two times higher than the next highest values reported in free-living vertebrates. However, this lead exposure did not decrease performance in whole-organism traits commonly affected by lead (balance, sprint speed, endurance). A 60-day lead dosing experiment demonstrated that the brown anole blood lead threshold for decreased whole-organism performance is actually an order of magnitude higher than the highest mean field concentration. Transcriptomic analysis of brain and liver from lizards in high and low lead sites revealed relatively minor effects of lead exposure. However, several of the differentially expressed genes function in metal ion homeostasis and oxygen carrying capacity, pointing to cellular mechanisms that may contribute to high lead tolerance. The brown anole may be the most lead-tolerant vertebrate known to date and has the potential to be a powerful model system to help us better understand how organisms cope with heavy metal exposure.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

A link between this pattern and climatic variations has not yet been tested in the region using lithic attribute analysis.

To investigate that, we integrated technological data of blades and bladelets from eastern African contexts (Marine Isotope Stages 5-1) with large-scale paleoclimatic reconstructions. A principal component analysis (PCA) finds the first component (reflecting artifacts dimensions) significantly correlating with time. This highlights a progressive reduction in size over time, a trend that has already been suggested for the MSA-LSA transition. The second principal component reflects artifact shape and shows a significant correlation with seasonality.

Based on this, we propose that more variable blades reflect greater versatility in foraging strategies as adaptation to unpredictable environments. On the other hand, during periods of mild seasonal change, a more standardized toolkit with thinner, longer elements would emerge from refining and adapting to familiar situations and challenges.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Clustering and topic modeling of scATAC data identified discrete cell-types and continuous cell states, which helped reveal disease-relevant cellular contexts, and allowed mapping of genetic effects on chromatin accessibility across these contexts. We identified 37,390 chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTL) at 10% FDR across eight cell groups and observed extensive sharing of caQTLs across immune cell contexts, finding that fewer than 20% of caQTLs are specific to a single cell type.

However, most GWAS-caQTL colocalizations had no detectable downstream regulatory effects on gene expression levels in the same cell type.

However, no regulatoryapproved blood tests are available for the early detection of lung cancer. We aimed to improve the classification of pulmonary nodules to identify malignant ones in a high prevalence patient group. Methods: A study involving 806 participants with undiagnosed nodules larger than 5 mm, identified via CT imaging, focused on assessing nucleosome levels and histone modifications in circulating blood. Nodules were classified as malignant or benign. A logistic regression analysis was performed. For model development, the data were randomly divided into training (n = 483) and validation (n = 121) datasets. The model's performance was then evaluated using a separate testing dataset (n = 202). Results: Among patients, 755 (93.7%) had a tissue diagnosis. The overall malignancy rate in the cohort was 80.4%. For all datasets, the AUCs were as follows: training, 0.74; validation, 0.86; and test, 0.79 (accuracy range: 0.80 to 0.88). Sensitivity showed consistent results across all datasets (0.91, 0.95, and 0.93, respectively), whereas specificity ranged from 0.37 to 0.64. For smaller nodules (5 to 10 mm), the model recorded accuracy values of 0.76, 0.88, and 0.85. Sensitivity values of 0.91, 1.00, and 0.94 further highlight the robust diagnostic capability of the model. The performance of the model across the RADS categories was evaluated, and it demonstrated consistent accuracy. Conclusion: Our EB panel detected non small cell lung cancer early in a high risk patient group with high sensitivity and accuracy. The EB model was particularly effective in identifying high risk lung nodules, including small, part solid, and non solid nodules, and provided further evidence for external validation.","NA","medrxiv",1734214149176

In Australia, they are considered exotic biosecurity threats, and an incursion of these viruses would require rapid and strict control efforts. However, current surveillance methods for these viruses are limited. We examined whether RMV and related tobamoviruses could be detected by deep sequencing of gut metatranscriptomes of vertebrate animals and ticks. Using this method, we discovered that RMV, as well as a novel relative of RMV, and two highly diverse novel tobamoviruses are present in Australia. RMV was detected in multiple sites in both the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and Tasmania, two regions separated by approximately 700km of land and 200km of water. The novel relative of RMV was detected in the ACT and New South Wales (NSW), while the highly divergent novel tobamoviruses were each detected in a single state, NSW and Queensland (QLD). In addition, Tobacco mild green mosaic virus, which is already known to be present in Australia, was detected in QLD using this method. This work highlights the potential utility of metatranscriptomic sequencing of wild animal gut for the surveillance of biosecurity threats to native and agricultural plant species.

ImportancePlant viruses can have devastating impacts on global horticulture. Tobamoviruses (family Virgaviridae, genus Tobamovirus) are among the most damaging seed-borne viruses in horticultural crops, and Australia is free of many of the tobamoviruses that cause major crop losses in other countries. These viruses are extremely difficult to eradicate. Consequently, early detection of incursions is key to the control of these viruses in Australia, alongside rapid deployment of eradication and management plans. Current biosecurity surveillance methods in Australia rely on visual inspection, immunological assays, and molecular methods such as screening of imported seed lots. This study introduces a complementary approach that utilises unbiased metatranscriptomic sequencing of animal gut material to detect cryptic plant viruses circulating in nature. Using this approach, we detected five different tobamovirus circulating in Australia, including a virus thought to be exotic and three novel viruses. This unique approach highlights alternative options for surveillance/detection of exotic crop viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

We conducted a longitudinal study in 47 households reporting people with COVID-19 in Texas in January-July 2022, during the first Omicron wave. We evaluated 105 people and 100 of their companion animals by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 at three sequential sampling events 1-2 weeks apart, starting 0-5 days after the first reported diagnosis of COVID-19 in the house. Of 47 households that reported people with COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 43, with 68% of people testing positive by RT-qPCR; 95.5% of people had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Dogs were the only animal species positive by RT-qPCR (5.4%; 3/55). Viral copies were consistently lower in dogs than household members, and no infectious virus was recovered in cell culture. Whole genome sequencing revealed household clusters of Omicron subvariants BA.1.1, BA.2.3.4 and BA.5.1.1 in people, dogs and a food bowl, confirming human-to-dog transmission within households, with no evidence of onward transmission from the infected dogs. Eleven dogs (n = 55) and two cats (n = 26) had neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Infection was not associated with clinical signs in pets; only two animals that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 were reported to be sick. Nearly one-third (30.2%) of households with active COVID-19 had pets exposed to SARS-CoV-2, similar to our pre-Omicron studies, yet incidence of infection in cats was lower compared to pre-Omicron. These differences suggest that the zoonotic transmission dynamics in households may differ based on variant.

Significance statementMonitoring companion animals offer insights into the zoonotic potential of SARS-CoV-2 ahead of its introduction into other animal populations where viral spread may go unchecked. At the peak of the first Omicron wave, we assessed SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in households longitudinally testing people and their pets in Texas. Omicron infections in cats were significantly lower when compared to pre-Omicron variants. Whole genome sequencing revealed three household clusters of human-to-dog transmission, each with a different Omicron subvariant, yet we did not find evidence of onward transmission to other animals or humans from infected dogs. Sustained animal surveillance in at-risk animals and people using the One Health approach are critical given the ongoing potential for viral evolution that can impact public health.","NA","medrxiv",1734214149176

One approach to distinguishing between alternative mechanisms is to study species that reproduce at very young ages, as competing hypotheses make different predictions about patterns of mutation in these organisms. Here, we study the germline mutation rate in the gray short-tailed opossum, Monodelphis domestica, a laboratory model species that becomes reproductively mature at less than six months of age. Whole-genome sequencing of 22 trios reveals the lowest mutation rate per generation found in mammals thus far (0.26 x 10-8 per base pair per generation at an average parental age of 313 days), which is expected given their early reproduction. We also examine the mutation spectrum and find fewer mutations at CpG sites in opossums than in humans, consistent with the lower CpG content in the opossum genome. We observe that two-thirds of mutations are inherited from the male parent in opossums, slightly lower than the degree of male bias observed in organisms that reproduce at much older ages. Nevertheless, the very young age at reproduction in opossums suggests that ongoing spermatogonial divisions in males after puberty are not the primary driver of the observed male mutation bias. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that the differences between male and female germline mutation may arise from mechanisms other than cell division post-puberty.

Article SummaryThis study investigates the germline mutation rate in the gray short-tailed opossum, a marsupial with early reproductive maturity. By sequencing 22 families, we report the lowest mutation rate recorded in mammals but a typical male mutation bias. These findings add to growing evidence that challenges the traditional view that continuing cell division is the primary driver of male-biased mutations. Instead, the study suggests that alternative mechanisms, such as differences in DNA repair, may influence sex-specific mutation rates.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

We studied three signal processing methods (i.e., artifact subspace reconstruction, surface Laplacian filtering, and data normalization), four feature extractors (i.e., common spatial patterns, independent component analysis, short-time Fourier transform, and no feature extraction), and four machine learning classifiers (i.e., support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, convolutional neural networks, and long short-term memory networks). Using a large-scale EEG dataset, we optimized each combination for individual subjects (i.e., resulting in 672 total experiments) and evaluated performance based on classification accuracy. We also compared the computational and memory storage requirements, which are important for real-time embedded computing. Our comparative analysis provides novel insights that help inform the design of next-generation neural decoding algorithms for brain-machine interfaces used to interact with and control robots and computers.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149176

Its low cost and accessibility have extended its use across biological topics, from symbiosis to biogeography, and ecology. A successful metabarcoding application depends on accurate and comprehensive reference databases for proper taxonomic assignment. The 18S rRNA gene is the primary genetic marker used for general/broad eukaryotic metabarcoding due to its combination of conserved and hypervariable regions, and the availability of extensive taxonomically-informed reference databases like PR2 and SILVA. Despite its advantages, 18S rRNA has certain limitations at lower taxonomic levels, depending on the lineage. Alternative fast-evolving molecular markers, such as the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, have been adopted as widely used ""barcoding genes"" for eukaryotes due to their resolution to the species level. However, the COI gene lacks a curated taxonomically-informed database covering all eukaryotes, including protists, comparable to those available for 18S rRNA. To address this gap, we introduce eKOI, a curated COI gene database aimed at enhancing the taxonomic annotation and primer design for COI-based metabarcoding at the community level. This database integrates COI gene data from GenBank and mitochondrial genomes that are publicly available, followed by rigorous manual curation to eliminate redundancies and contaminants and to correct taxonomic annotations. We validate using the eKOI database for taxonomic annotation of protists by re-annotating several COI-based metabarcoding studies, revealing previously unidentified biodiversity. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the accuracy of the taxonomic annotations, highlighting the potential of eKOI to uncover new biodiversity in various eukaryotic lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

We exploit the sensitivity of 19F chemical shifts to ring currents by designing labels with direct contact to a native or engineered aromatic ring. Fifty protein variants predicted by AlphaFold and molecular dynamics simulations show 80-90% success rates and direct correlations of their experimental chemical shifts with the magnitude of the engineered ring current. Our method consequently improves the chemical shift dispersion and through simple 1D experiments enables structural analyses of alternative conformational states, including ribosome-bound folding intermediates, and in-cell measurements of thermodynamics and protein-protein interactions. Our strategy thus provides a simple and sensitive tool to extract residue contact restraints from chemical shifts for previously intractable systems.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

Yet laboratory tests of decision making often investigate how animals optimize their behavior to achieve a single, well-defined goal, which is often a nutritive reward. Thus, how animals solve multi-objective optimization problems is not well understood. Here, we devised an ethologically-inspired decision making task to examine how rats balance the pursuit of food and non-food reinforcement. Rats performed a free-choice patch-foraging task, in which they could earn food in one location (food patch) or interact with a rodent play structure in a different location (toy patch). The cost of switching between patches was manipulated by requiring rats to endure a long or short ""travel time"" penalty during which they were not able to access either patch. Rats devoted a considerable amount of their limited foraging time to patches of both types, showing a small but significant preference for food patches. In accordance with theoretical models of foraging, when the cost of switching patches was high rats chose longer stay durations in both types of patches, suggesting that similar rational principles guided their pursuit of food and non-food rewards. Examining the within-session dynamics of time allocation revealed that rats showed an early preference for spending time in toy patches that reversed over the course of the session. These results validate a naturalistic approach to testing decision making in rats over a range of food and non-food goods.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

With no known effective FDA-approved treatments for either condition, patient-reported outcomes of treatments are invaluable for guiding management strategies in patient care and generating new avenues for research. Here, we present the results of an ME/CFS and Long COVID treatment survey with responses from 3,925 patients. We assessed the experiences of these patients with more than 150 treatments, as well as their demographics, symptoms, and comorbidities. Patients with each condition who participated in the study shared similar symptom profiles, including all the core symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g., 89.7% of ME/CFS and 79.4% of Long COVID reported post-exertional malaise (PEM). Treatments with the greatest perceived benefits were identified, which had varied effects on different core symptoms. In addition, treatment responses were significantly correlated (R{superscript 2} = 0.68) between the two patient groups. Patient subgroups with distinct profiles of symptoms and comorbidities showed varied responses to treatments, e.g., a POTS-dominant cluster benefiting from autonomic modulators and a cognitive-dysfunction cluster from CNS stimulants. This study underscores the symptomatic and therapeutic similarities between ME/CFS and Long COVID and highlights the commonalities and nuanced complexities of infection-associated chronic diseases and related conditions. Insights from patient-reported experiences, in the absence of approved treatments, provide urgently needed real-world evidence for targeted therapies in patient care and for developing future clinical trials.

In contrast, larger mammals, including humans, show reduced or absent MYH4 expression and type IIb myofibers, favoring slower-contracting myofibers. The evolutionary mechanisms underlying this shift remain unclear. Here, we identify large MAF transcription factors (MAFA, MAFB, MAF) as key regulators of MYH4 expression in large mammals, including human and bovine. Overexpression of large MAFs induces MYH4 expression and enhances glycolytic capacity in human myotubes, supported by RNA-seq and metabolic flux analyses. RNA-seq of human muscle biopsies reveals a positive correlation between MAFA, MAF, and MYH4 expression, with these genes elevated in power-trained individuals. These findings reveal a conserved mechanism across mammals, showing that large MAFs can induce type IIb myofibers even in humans, with potential applications for enhancing athletic performance and addressing age-related muscle weakness associated with the loss of fast-twitch myofibers.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

In this work, we explore the potential of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) detection methods based on phylogenies (i.e., reconciliation methods) to reveal and quantify ghost diversity along the branches of a species phylogeny. We succinctly present the theoretical framework for this approach, and we demonstrate, using simple simulations, that HGT signals, as interpreted by a reconciliation method, can reveal the presence and phylogenetic position of ghost clades, despite the absence of genomic data for these taxa. We anticipate possible limitations and difficulties in using HGT detection to explore ghost diversity and suggest promising approaches to address or circumvent them. Altogether, this proof of concept opens new lines of research for the future: a scarce fossil record and a large proportion of unknown lineages, especially in Archaea and Bacteria, does not equate to an absence of information for evolutionary studies.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

We identified and spatially validated novel and human-specific markers of myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells and unexpectedly heterogeneous perineurial fibroblasts. Nerve-associated leukocytes were diverse with an endoneurial to epineurial macrophage gradient. All PNPs shared a loss of myelinating and an increase in repair Schwann cells and lipid-associated macrophages. Transcriptional changes affected multiple cells outside of the endoneurium across PNPs, suggesting PNPs as  pan-nerve diseases. Spatially, PNPs showed a perineurial hyperplasia and fibrotic dispersion and this was most pronounced in immune-mediated PNPs.

Our study reveals that, among these resources, SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the oxysterol-binding protein 1 (OSBP1) transporter to exploit the Golgi-bound phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) pool. This leads to a depletion of Golgi-resident PI4P, triggering the activation of the ATM DNA Damage Response (DDR) kinase in the cytoplasm. As such, ATM, typically anchored to PI4P at the Golgi in an inactive state, undergoes auto-phosphorylation and cytoplasmic release upon SARS-CoV-2-induced PI4P depletion. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of ATM auto-phosphorylation, which stabilizes its interaction with PI4P, significantly impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication. The requirement for PI4P and impact of ATM inhibition might be conserved across coronaviruses, as similar effects were observed with HCoV-229E. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-induced, cytoplasmic ATM pre-activation primes cells for an accelerated response to DNA damage, which might contribute to the severe outcomes of COVID-19 observed in cancer patients undergoing chemo- or radiotherapy. Therefore, this study uncovers a DNA damage-independent mode of ATM activation and highlights the potential of ATM inhibitors as therapeutic agents against COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

This creates a significant gene-copy imbalance of the X and Z chromosomes between the sexes as well as between the single sex chromosome and the autosomes in the heterogametic sex, making its resolution essential. Dosage compensation and its molecular mechanisms have primarily been studied in select organisms, such as primates, rodents, birds, fruit flies, and C. elegans, while the extent and mechanisms of dosage compensation remain largely unexplored in the vast majority of animal taxa.

Recently, coleoid cephalopods, including octopuses, squids, and cuttlefish, were reported to possess a ZZ/Z0 sex chromosome system1, where males carry two copies of the Z chromosome while females carry only one. However, whether dosage compensation occurs in these species remains unexplored. Here, we present evidence that Z-chromosome dosage compensation is achieved in octopus. In two species (Octopus vulgaris and Octopus sinensis), we observed male-to-female ratios of Z-chromosome expression exceeding 1 but significantly below 2, indicating partial dosage compensation, comparable to that achieved for the Z chromosome in birds. Additionally, Z-to-autosomal expression ratios were close to 1. Furthermore, we identified a Z-linked, male-specific long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in O. vulgaris (""Zmast""), with conserved sequence in annotated Z-linked loci of O. sinensis--notably expressed in a male-specific manner also in this species.

Our results provide the first evidence of sex chromosome dosage compensation in octopus and introduce the intriguing possibility of a long non-coding RNA playing a sex-specific role in gene regulating.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

To obtain the iron required for growth, many bacterial pathogens encode transporters capable of extracting the iron-containing cofactor heme directly from host proteins. Pathogenic E. coli and Shigella spp. produce the outer membrane transporter ChuA, which binds host hemoglobin and extracts its heme cofactor, before importing heme into the cell. Heme extraction by ChuA is a dynamic process, with the transporter capable of rapidly extracting heme from hemoglobin in the absence of an external energy source, without forming a stable ChuA-hemoglobin complex. In this work, we utilise a combination of structural modelling, Cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, mutagenesis, and phenotypic analysis to understand the mechanistic detail of this process. Based on this understanding we utilise artificial intelligence-based protein design to create binders capable of inhibiting E. coli growth by blocking hemoglobin binding to ChuA. By screening a limited number of these designs, we identify several binders that inhibit E. coli growth at low nanomolar concentrations, without experimental optimisation. We determine the structure of a subset of these binders, alone and in complex with ChuA, demonstrating that they closely match the computational design. This work demonstrates the utility of de novo-designed proteins for inhibiting bacterial nutrient uptake and uses a workflow that could be applied to integral membrane proteins in other organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

Cryptosporidium is an intracellular parasite of intestinal epithelial cells, and a leading cause of diarrheal death and disease in infants worldwide. Despite this, very little is known about the cell biology of infection of this eukaryotic pathogen. Here, we designed and implemented a unique microscopy-based arrayed CRISPR-Cas9 screen to interrogate the effects of the loss of every protein-coding human gene on a Cryptosporidium infection. As the experimental readout is image-based, we extracted multiple phenotypic features of infection, including parasite growth, progression of the parasite to its sexual life stage, and recruitment of host actin to  pedestals beneath the parasite vacuole. Using this dataset, we discovered a tipping point in the host cholesterol biosynthesis pathway that controls Cryptosporidium infection. Parasite growth can either be inhibited or promoted by the intermediary metabolite squalene. A build-up of squalene in epithelial cells creates a reducing environment, with more reduced host glutathione available for uptake by the parasite. Because Cryptosporidium has lost the ability to synthesise glutathione, this uptake from the host cell is required for growth and progression through its life cycle. We demonstrate that this dependency can be leveraged for treatment with the abandoned drug lapaquistat, an inhibitor of host squalene synthase that has efficacy against Cryptosporidium in vitro and in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

The result is a genomic network that describes the conditionally independent genetic associations between traits that remain when controlling for shared signal with the broader network of traits. Graph theory metrics provide added insight by formally quantifying the most important traits in the genomic network. GNA can discover additional trait-specific pathways by incorporating gene expression or genetic variants into the network to estimate their conditional associations with each trait.

Retinal waves are crucial for refining visual maps in the brains retinofugal targets and for the development of retinal circuits underlying feature detection, such as direction selectivity. Yet, how waves alter gene expression in immature RGCs is poorly understood, particularly at the level of the many distinct types of RGCs that underlie the retinas ability to encode diverse visual features. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on RGCs isolated at the end of the first postnatal week from wild-type (WT) mice and {beta}2KO mice, which lack the {beta}2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, leading to the disruption of cholinergic retinal waves. Statistical comparisons of RGC transcriptomes between the two conditions reveal a weak impact of retinal waves on RGC diversity, indicating that retinal waves do not influence the molecular programs that instruct RGC differentiation and maturation. Although wave-dependent gene expression changes are modest in the global sense, we identified [~]238 genes that are significantly altered in select subsets of RGC types. We focused on one gene, Kcnk9, which encodes the two-pore domain leak channel potassium channel TASK3. Kcnk9, which is highly enriched in RGCs, was strongly downregulated in {beta}2KO. We validated this result using in situ hybridization and performed whole-cell recording to demonstrate a significant decrease in the leak conductance in {beta}2KO RGCs.

Gene ontology analyses have repeatedly identified enrichment of proteins with annotated functions in gene expression regulation and neuronal communication. However, proteins are often pleiotropic and these annotations are inherently incomplete. Our recent autism functional genetics work has suggested that these genes may share a common mechanism at the cilium, a membrane-bound organelle critical for neurogenesis, brain patterning, and neuronal activity-all processes strongly implicated in autism. Moreover, autism commonly co-occurs with conditions that are known to involve ciliary-related pathologies, including congenital heart disease, hydrocephalus, and blindness. However, the role of autism genes at the cilium has not been systematically investigated. Here we demonstrate that autism proteins spanning disparate functional annotations converge in expression, localization, and function at cilia, and that patients with pathogenic variants in these genes have cilia-related co-occurring conditions and biomarkers of disrupted ciliary function. This degree of convergence among genes spanning diverse functional annotations strongly suggests that cilia are relevant to autism, as well as to commonly co-occurring conditions, and that this organelle should be explored further for therapeutic potential.

The challenge remains to efficiently apply precision breeding methods to plant gene regulation. Endogenous gene regulatory sequences are subject to complex transcriptional control, a bottleneck in altering gene expression patterns in a predictable way. Here we present the CRE.AI.TIVE platform, enabling upregulation of plant gene activity without a priori knowledge of individual cis-regulatory elements or their specific location. A predictive machine learning model underpinning the platform has been trained on a wide range of tissue specific transcriptomic and epigenomic coverage datasets from DNA sequence of 12 plant species, showing competitive performance on RNA-seq coverage prediction across all species. Our platform further combines in silico DNA sequence mutagenesis and a protoplast-based massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA). We demonstrate the platforms functionality by mutagenesis of a proximal promoter of the tomato gene SlbHLH96 which yields predictions of variant gene activity in silico. 2,000 sequence candidates with varying predicted gene expression strength were validated with MPRA in plant protoplasts, identifying variants with significantly upregulated gene activity. A portion of functional sequence variants were further individually evaluated with a fluorescence reporter assay and were observed to contain a new order of known cis-regulatory elements. The CRE.AI.TIVE platform offers a first-of-its-kind scalable method of gene upregulation in plants with native DNA sequences without the need for CRE cataloguing and rational promoter design.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

However, the resulting data is highly sparse with most data entries being zeros. As such, currently available computational methods for scATAC-seq feature a range of transformation procedures to extract meaningful information from the sparse data. Most notably, these transformations can be categorized into: 1) feature aggregation with known biological associations, 2) pseudo-bulking cells of similar biology, and 3) binarisation of count data. These strategies beg the question of whether or not scATAC-seq data actually has usable single-cell and single-region information as intended from the assay. If we can go beyond aggregated features and pooled cells, it opens up the possibility of more complex statistical tasks that require that degree of granularity. To reach the finest possible resolution of single-cell, single-region information there are inevitably many computational challenges to overcome. Here, we review the major data analysis challenges lying between raw data readout and biological discovery, and discuss the limitations of current data analysis approaches. Lastly, we conclude that chromatin accessibility profiling at true single-cell resolution is not yet achieved with current technology, but that it may be achieved with promising developments in optimising the efficiency of scATAC-seq assays.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

Multiple RV association tests are available to study the relationship between genotype and phenotype, but most are restricted to per-gene models and do not fully leverage the availability of variant-level functional annotations. We propose Genome-wide Rare Variant EnRichment Evaluation (gruyere), a Bayesian probabilistic model that complements existing methods by learning global, trait-specific weights for functional annotations to improve variant prioritization. We apply gruyere to WGS data from the Alzheimers Disease (AD) Sequencing Project, consisting of 7,966 cases and 13,412 controls, to identify AD-associated genes and annotations. Growing evidence suggests that disruption of microglial regulation is a key contributor to AD risk, yet existing methods have not had sufficient power to examine rare non-coding effects that incorporate such cell-type specific information. To address this gap, we 1) use predicted enhancer and promoter regions in microglia and other potentially relevant cell types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons) to define per-gene non-coding RV test sets and 2) include cell-type specific variant effect predictions (VEPs) as functional annotations. gruyere identifies 15 significant genetic associations not detected by other RV methods and finds deep learning-based VEPs for splicing, transcription factor binding, and chromatin state are highly predictive of functional non-coding RVs. Our study establishes a novel and robust framework incorporating functional annotations, coding RVs, and cell-type associated non-coding RVs, to perform genome-wide association tests, uncovering AD-relevant genes and annotations.","NA","medrxiv",1734214149177

However, despite improvements in genome assembly, genome annotation (i.e. the identification of protein-coding genes) remains challenging, particularly for eukaryotic genomes: it requires combining several approaches (typically ab initio, transcriptomics, and homology search), each with its own pros and cons. Deciding which gene models to retain in a consensus is far from trivial, and automated approaches tend to lag behind laborious manual curation efforts in accuracy. Results: Here, we present OMAnnotator, a novel approach to building a consensus annotation. OMAnnotator repurposes the OMA algorithm, originally designed to elucidate evolutionary relationships among genes across species, to integrate predictions from different annotation sources, using evolutionary information as a tie-breaker. We validated OMAnnotator by reannotating the Drosophila melanogaster reference genome and comparing it with the expert-curated reference and results from the automated pipelines BRAKER2 and EvidenceModeller. OMAnnotator produced a consensus annotation that outperformed each individual input and surpassed the existing pipelines. Finally, when applied to three recently published genomes, OMAnnotator gave substantial improvements in two cases, and mixed results in the third, which had already benefited from extensive expert curation. Conclusion: We introduce an original, flexible, and effective approach to annotating genomes by integrating multiple lines of evidence. The method's robustness is underlined by its successful implementation in re-annotating recently published genomes, opening up new avenues in eukaryotic genome annotation.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

This is more likely to arise when the two SNPs are in relatively close proximity, so while true epistasis between nearby variants could be commonplace, in practice there is no reliable way of telling apart true epistatic signals from false positives. By considering the causes of phantom epistasis from a genealogy-based perspective, we leverage the rich information contained within reconstructed genealogies (in the form of ancestral recombination graphs) to address this problem. We propose a novel method for explicitly quantifying how likely it is that a given pairwise interaction is the result of phantom epistasis, which can be applied to pairs of SNPs regardless of the genetic distance between them. Our method uses only publicly-available data and so does not require access to the phenotypes and genotypes used for detecting interactions. Using simulations, we show that the method has good sensitivity at even low genetic distances (around 0.5cM), and demonstrate its power to detect phantom epistasis using real data from previous studies. This opens up the exciting possibility of distinguishing spurious interactions in cis from those reflecting real biological effects.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

It is widely accepted that the spread of this language family across Europe from the 5th millennium BP correlates with the expansion and diversification of steppe-related genetic ancestry from the onset of the Bronze Age6,7. However, multiple steppe-derived populations co-existed in Europe during this period, and it remains unclear how these populations diverged and which provided the demographic channels for the ancestral forms of the Italic, Celtic, Greek, and Armenian languages8,9. To investigate the ancestral histories of Indo-European-speaking groups in Southern Europe, we sequenced genomes from 314 ancient individuals from the Mediterranean and surrounding regions, spanning from 5,200 BP to 2,100 BP, and co-analysed these with published genome data. We additionally conducted strontium isotope analyses on 224 of these individuals. We find a deep east-west divide of steppe ancestry in Southern Europe during the Bronze Age. Specifically, we show that the arrival of steppe ancestry in Spain, France, and Italy was mediated by Bell Beaker (BB) populations of Western Europe, likely contributing to the emergence of the Italic and Celtic languages. In contrast, Armenian and Greek populations acquired steppe ancestry directly from Yamnaya groups of Eastern Europe. These results are consistent with the linguistic Italo-Celtic10,11 and Graeco-Armenian1,12,13 hypotheses accounting for the origins of most Mediterranean Indo-European languages of Classical Antiquity. Our findings thus align with specific linguistic divergence models for the Indo-European language family while contradicting others.

Some people in their eighties have cognitive abilities similar to many 30-year-olds, while others experience significant cognitive decline at a much younger age. The variation in age-related cognitive decline is not arbitrary. Several non-modifiable (e.g. genetic) and potentially modifiable (e.g. high blood pressure, smoking, and hearing loss) risk factors are associated with faster cognitive aging. Beyond these individual-level risk factors, a growing body of evidence has identified associations between cognitive impairment and social, economic, and environmental factors. These associations are even more pronounced in developing countries, notably because of greater disparities in education and socioeconomic status. However, people from these countries are rarely studied in scientific research: a citizen of a high-income country is 37 times more likely to appear in a study in top medical journals than a citizen of a low-income country. Here, we examine the association between sociodemographic factors and cognitive aging trajectories among 715,295 participants in 46 countries. Cognition is assessed using Sea Hero Quest, a spatial navigation video game that predicts spatial ability in the real world. We find that the social, economic, and environmental well-being of older adults, as measured by the Global AgeWatch Index (GAWI), is negatively associated with age-related decline in spatial ability. In particular, the GAWI Health and Environment subscores are strongly correlated with the effect of age on wayfinding performance. We also found that gender differences in spatial navigation skills increase with age, and even more so in countries with greater gender inequality, as estimated by the Gender Inequality Index. Our results show that cognitive aging must be understood as a dynamic, heterogeneous process that is strongly linked to potentially modifiable environmental and social factors.","NA","medrxiv",1734214149177
"Between-movie variability severely limits generalizability of ""naturalistic"" neuroimaging","10.1101/2024.12.03.626542","biorxiv",19.499999999999996,0,6.25,18.249999999999996,19.499999999999996,"Leipold, S.; Ravi Rao, R.; Schoffelen, J.-M.; Bogels, S.; Toni, I.","Simon Leipold","Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour","2024-12-06","1","new results","cc_by","neuroscience","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/12/06/2024.12.03.626542.source.xml","""Naturalistic imaging"" paradigms, where participants watch movies during fMRI, have gained popularity over the past two decades. Many movie-watching studies measure inter-subject correlation (ISC), which refers to the correlation between participants neural activation time series. Previous research has focused on explaining ISC differences during movie-watching based on individual states and traits, such as social distance, personality, and political orientation. For example, friends show higher ISC than strangers while watching movies.

However, movies are not natural categories but cultural artifacts that evoke varying levels of ISC depending on content, directing style, or editing methods. This raises questions about how much trait- or state-like differences in ISC depend on the specific movies chosen, potentially limiting the generalizability of findings across different movies.

Here, we used an fMRI dataset of 112 participants watching eight animated movies to (a) quantify between-movie variability in ISC across the brain and (b) assess the implications for the generalizability of trait- or state-like effects on ISC. We found substantial between-movie variability in ISC, with this variability differing across brain regions. Crucially, brain regions with the highest ISC exhibited the greatest variability, indicating that trait- or state-like differences in ISC from one movie may not generalize to others.

We conclude that variability between movies limits the generalizability of trait- or state-like ISC differences. Using a specific movie in neuroscience should be treated similarly to using a particular task, requiring a comparable characterization of the constituent cognitive elements. Broad generalizations about ""naturalistic imaging"" or ""movie watching"" are not warranted.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

By developing modified pre-crRNA expression vectors and a degron-based Cas12a system, we overcome the self-processing constraint, allowing for accurate detection of pre-crRNAs at the single-cell level, thus greatly expanding possibilities for future Perturb-seq efforts.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) seeks to prioritize chromosomally normal embryos for transfer based on genetic analysis of a biopsy of approximately five trophectoderm cells from blastocyst-stage in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos. While modern PGT-A platforms classify these biopsies as aneuploid, euploid, or mosaic (possessing a mixture of normal and aneuploid cells), the underlying incidences of aneuploid, euploid, and mosaic embryos and the rates of meiotic and mitotic error that produced them remain largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we paired a recent method for embryo simulation with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to infer rates of meiotic and mitotic error that best explain published PGT-A data. By simulating from these posterior distributions, we also evaluated the chromosomal status of entire embryos. For a published clinical sample, we estimated a 39-43% probability of meiotic error per meiosis, as well as a 1.0-3.0% probability of mitotic error per mitosis, depending on assumptions about spatial clustering of aneuploid cells within mosaic embryos. In addition, our analyses suggest that less than 1% of blastocysts are fully euploid, and that many embryos possess low-level mosaic clones that are not captured during biopsy. These broad conclusions were relatively insensitive to potential misclassification of mosaic biopsies. Together, our work helps overcome the limitations of embryo biopsies to estimate the fundamental rates of cell division errors that are the main causes of human pregnancy loss.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

Whether distinct lymphatic phenotypes exist that govern the switch between immunity and metastasis remains unclear. Here we reveal that cytotoxic immunity normalizes lymphatic function and uncouples immune and metastatic potential. We find that in mice and humans, intratumoral lymphatic vessel density negatively correlates with productive cytotoxic immune responses and identify IFN{gamma} as an intrinsic inhibitor of lymphangiogenesis. Specific deletion of the Ifngr1 in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) greatly expanded the intratumoral lymphatic network and drove the emergence of a tip-like endothelial state, promoting lymph node metastasis but not dendritic cell migration. IFN{gamma} inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, which is required for proliferation and acquisition of the pathologic transcriptional state. Our data indicate that IFN{gamma} induces a phenotypic switch in tumor-associated lymphatic vessels to reinforce canonical immune surveillance and block metastasis.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

Several inherent limitations restrict applying the approaches to genes not suitable for RNA velocity inference due to complex transcriptional dynamics, low expression, or lacking splicing dynamics, and data of non-transcriptomic modality. Here, we present GraphVelo, a graph-based machine learning procedure that uses RNA velocities inferred from existing methods as input and infer velocity vectors lie in the tangent space of the low-dimensional manifold formed by the single cell data. GraphVelo preserves vector magnitude and direction information during transformations across different data representations. Tests on multiple synthetic and experimental scRNA-seq data, as well as multi-omics datasets demonstrate that GraphVelo, together with downstream Dynamo analyses, extends RNA velocities to multi-modal data and reveals quantitative nonlinear regulation relations between genes, different layers of gene regulation, and between virus and host cells.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

Zoonotic crossovers, with hemagglutinins mutated to enhance viral ability to use human 2-6-linked sialic acid receptors versus avian 2-3-linked ones, highlight the pandemic risk. To gain insight into these crossovers, we determined the cryo-EM structure of hemagglutinin from the zoonotic H5N1 A/Texas/37/2024 strain (clade 2.3.4.4b) in complex with a previously reported neutralizing antibody. Surprisingly, we found that the receptor-binding site of this H5N1 hemagglutinin was already occupied by an 2-3-linked sialic acid and that this glycan emanated from asparagine N169 of a neighboring protomer on hemagglutinin itself. This structure thus highlights recognition by influenza hemagglutinin of an ""auto""-2-3-linked sialic acid from N169, an N-linked glycan conserved in 95% of H5 strains, and adds ""auto-glycan recognition"" to the complexities surrounding H5N1 zoonosis.

They disagreed on the coding status of one of every eight annotated coding genes. The analysis inspired bilateral collaborations between annotation groups.

Here we have repeated our analysis with updated versions of the three reference coding gene sets. Superficially, little appears to have changed. Although there are slightly fewer genes predicted as coding overall, the three groups still disagree on the status of 2,606 annotated genes. However, a comparison without read-through genes and immunoglobulin fragments shows that the three reference sets have merged or reclassified more than 700 genes since the last analysis and that just 0.6% of Ensembl/GENCODE coding genes are not also annotated by the other two reference sets.

We used eight features indicative of non-coding genes to examine the 21,873 coding genes annotated across the three reference sets. We found that more than 2,000 had one or more potential non-coding features. While some of these genes will be protein coding, we believe that most are likely to be non-coding genes or pseudogenes. Our results suggest that annotators still vastly overestimate the number of true coding genes.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

Such fibrinaloid microclots are also relatively resistant to fibrinolysis. The proteins that the amyloid microclots contained differed markedly both from the soluble proteome of typical plasma and that of normal clots, and also between the disease studies (an acute syndrome in the form of sepsis in an ITU and a chronic disease represented by Long COVID). Many proteins in the amyloid microclots were low in concentration in plasma and were effectively accumulated into the fibres, whereas many other abundant plasma proteins were excluded. The proteins found in the microclots associated with the diseases also tended to be themselves amyloidogenic. We here ask effectively the inverse question. This is: can the clot proteome tell us whether the clots associated with a particular disease contained proteins that are observed uniquely (or are highly over-represented) in known amyloid clots relative to normal clots, and thus were in fact amyloid in nature? The answer is in the affirmative in a variety of major coagulopathies, viz. venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, various cardiac issues, and ischaemic stroke. Galectin-3-binding protein and thrombospondin-1 seem to be especially widely associated with amyloid-type clots, and the latter has indeed been shown to be incorporated into growing fibrin fibres. These may consequently provide useful biomarkers with a mechanistic basis.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177

Such transgenerational inheritance is reversable as it does not lead to mutations and thus alterations in the genetic information. Epigenetic mechanisms such as small RNAs (sRNAs) in the germline silence transposable elements (TEs), which comprise a significant portion of the genome. TE mobility can be mutagenic and is thought to contribute to genome evolution by altering genome structure and diversification. In C. elegans elevated temperature leads to desilencing of TEs in the germline, suggesting that environmental conditions could impact the integrity of inheritable genomes. Here, we show that dysfunction of the AFD thermosensory neurons leads to desilencing of TEs in the germline. The TE activity results in de novo insertions and mutagenesis. Our data indicate that neuronal sensing of environmental conditions can alter genetic inheritance through stress-induced TE mutagenesis thus shaping genome evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1734214149177
