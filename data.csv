Most TMPs follow a conventional secretory pathway confined to the cell soma, where they are translated at the rough ER, exit through ER exit sites (ERES) to reach the Golgi apparatus (GA), prior to their delivery to the plasma membrane (PM). Intriguingly, we recently found that many mRNAs encoding TMPs are associated with the axonally-enriched ER-protein P180, which facilitates axonal ER-ribosome interaction and regulates local translation. Given the absence of the GA in the axon, it remains unknown how locally synthesized TMPs leave the ER and reach the axonal PM. Here, we visualized the translation of different axonal TMPs within the axon and followed their trafficking from the ER. We found that a fraction of neosynthesized cargos follow an unconventional route, exiting the axonal ER and reaching the PM independent of the GA. Notably, we identified axonal ERES components tightly associated with the axonal ER. Removal of these components prevents TMP exit from the axonal ER, while addition of external cues increases the number of axonal ERES and Golgi-bypassing cargos. Moreover, we identified the ER-translation regulator HDLBP and the NRZ-SEC22B vesicular tether complex associated with axonal ERES and involved in unconventional secretion. Local removal of axonal ERES components or depletion of these identified players causes defects in axon growth and bouton assembly. We propose a novel mechanism coupling local TMP translation and secretion to the PM at the axonal ER, which is essential for neuronal development.

However, their analysis is complicated by measurement noise and bias, differences between batches, technology platforms, and restricted antibody panels. This results in a limited capacity to accumulate knowledge across technologies, studies, experimental batches, or across different antibody panels. Here, we present CytoVI - a probabilistic generative model designed to address these challenges and enable statistically rigorous and integrative analysis for antibody-based single cell technologies. We show that CytoVI outperforms existing computational methods and effectively handles a variety of integration scenarios. CytoVI enables key functionalities such as generating informative cell embeddings, imputing missing measurements, differential protein expression testing, and automated annotation of cells. We applied CytoVI to generate an integrated B cell maturation atlas across 350 proteins from a set of smaller antibody panels measured by conventional mass cytometry, and identified proteins associated with immunoglobulin class-switching in healthy humans. Using a cohort of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients measured by flow cytometry, CytoVI uncovered T cell states that are associated with disease. Finally, we show that CytoVI is a robust probabilistic framework for the analysis of standard diagnostic flow cytometry antibody panels, enabling the automated detection of tumor populations and diagnoses of incoming patient samples.

It is critically dependent on ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), a mitochondrial reductase that facilitates cuproptosis by reducing ionophore-bound Cu(II) to Cu(I), which triggers its release, and by promoting mitochondrial protein lipoylation, which is directly targeted by the released Cu to drive cell death. Despite the pivotal role of FDX1 in cuproptosis, the structural determinants underlying its distinct functions remain unclear. To address this, we performed deep mutational scanning (DMS) of FDX1 and identified two conserved residues, D136 and D139, on -helix 3 that are critical for both FDX1-mediated lipoylation and cuproptosis. Charge-reversal mutations at these positions abolished FDX1 ability to support lipoylation and induce cuproptosis in cells, despite retaining full enzymatic activity in vitro. Guided by structural and genomic analyses, we further identified dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD), the E3 subunit of lipoylated complexes as an alternative FDX1 reductase both in cells and in vitro. Together, these findings establish -helix 3 of FDX1 as a critical interface for its upstream regulation and suggest that FDX1 roles in lipoylation and cuproptosis are both structurally and functionally linked.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01CA279550;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

The Proximity Prediction Hypothesis (PPH) is the first comprehensive predictive coding model explaining ASMRs underlying neural mechanism. PPH posits that near-field acoustic cues from common ASMR triggers (e.g., brushing sounds, whispered speech) engage the audio-tactile Peripersonal Space Network, generating a top-down prediction of gentle C-tactile (CT) touch on CT fibre-rich skin of the scalp and neck. This prediction suppresses locus coeruleus (LC) arousal and increases vagal output, offering a mechanistic explanation for the phenomenons therapeutic benefits. In a subjective-experience survey (N = 64), ASMR-labelled trials were rated significantly more pleasant but only slightly more arousing than controls. Pleasantness predicted both the presence and intensity of tingles, supporting PPHs core claim that hedonic value, rather than sympathetic activation, drives the graded somatosensory response. PPH situates ASMR within the Neurovisceral Integration framework, predicting measurable Central Nervous System-Autonomic Nervous System (CNS-ANS) markers (beta-band desynchronisation in the posterior insula and proportional increases in high-frequency heart rate variability with tingle intensity). It further predicts reduced LC activity during ASMR, stronger effects in individuals with high interoceptive prediction error (e.g., anxiety, autism), and attenuation of tingles when spatial proximity cues are removed. By integrating auditory proximity, CT-touch anticipation, and autonomic regulation into a single predictive-coding account, PPH provides a unified, testable framework for explaining ASMR, offering a blueprint for translating this sensory phenomenon into targeted, evidence-based interventions for anxiety and sleep disorders.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

Whether computational prediction tools can identify amyloid-forming potential in thrombus proteomes remains unclear.

MethodsAmyloGram is a computational tool that estimates amyloid-forming potential based on n-gram sequence encoding and random forest classification. Using AmyloGram, we analyzed 204 proteins tagged by humans as amyloidogenic in UniProt. We then applied the same approach to proteins identified in thrombi retrieved using mechanical thrombectomy from patients with cardioembolic and atherothrombotic stroke. In addition we used AmyloGram to analyse the amyloidogenicity of 83,567 canonical human protein sequences.

ResultsAmong the UniProt-annotated  amyloid set, nearly all proteins received AmyloGram scores above 0.7, including 23 of the 24 human proteins. Even the lowest-scoring human protein, lysozyme (scoring 0.675), is known to form amyloid under certain conditions. In thrombi from both stroke subtypes, all detected proteins had AmyloGram scores above 0.7, suggesting a high likelihood of amyloid content. A majority of unannotated proteins also achieve AmyloGram scores exceeding 0.7.

ConclusionsAmyloGram reliably identifies known amyloid-forming proteins and reveals that stroke thrombi are enriched for proteins with high amyloidogenic potential. These findings support the hypothesis that thrombus formation in stroke involves amyloid-related mechanisms and warrant further investigation using histological and functional validation.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

Mapping receptor distributions in the brain is therefore necessary for understanding how neurotransmitter systems mediate the link between brain structure and function. Normative receptor density can be estimated using group averages from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. However, the generalizability and reliability of group-average receptor maps depends on the inter-individual variability of receptor density, which is currently unknown. Here we collect group standard deviation brain maps of PET-estimated protein abundance for 12 different neurotransmitter receptors and transporters across 7 neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, cannabinoid, and opioid. We illustrate how cortical and subcortical inter-individual variability of receptor and transporter density varies across brain regions and across neurotransmitter systems. We complement inter-individual variability with inter-regional variability, and show that receptors that vary more across brain regions than across individuals also demonstrate greater out-of-sample spatial consistency. Altogether, this work quantifies how receptor systems vary in healthy individuals, and provides a means of assessing the generalizability of PET-derived receptor density quantification.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

To reveal how these processes are mechanistically linked, we combined acute molecule perturbations in live cells with correlative 3D electron tomography or MINFLUX super-resolution microscopy. We show that degrading Nup62 during mitosis arrests NPC assembly at an intermediate step with smaller membrane pores and removes the whole central transport channel. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted that 32 copies of the central channel subcomplex, recruited into the previously unoccupied pore center, can self-associate via hydrophobic interactions to occupy the volume required for full pore size and exert an outward pushing force; indeed, disrupting these interactions during NPC assembly blocked pore dilation. Later in mitotic exit, perturbed cells exhibited impaired nuclear import, smaller nuclei, and looser NE spacing. Acute inhibition of nuclear import recapitulated these NE defects without affecting NPC assembly. Together, our findings reveal a new, two-step molecular mechanism linking NPC assembly and NE reformation. First, hydrophobic FG-nucleoporins dilate the assembling nuclear pore to its full width by forming the central transport channel, which then allows nuclear import-driven nuclear expansion leading to tight, regular NE membrane spacing.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Project-ID 511488495 - SFB 1638, P06;""},{""name"":""Baden-W√ºrttemberg Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""NIH/NIGMS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM083960;P41GM109824;R01GM112108;F32GM150243;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03tx8dq56"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

These dormant forms (hypnozoites) cannot be detected using standard diagnostics, but recent P. vivax exposure and by proxy, hypnozoite carriage, can be inferred using antibody-based tests (serological markers). In this study, we examined how genetic variation in P. vivax affects the utility of these antibody markers, and whether redesigned antigens could improve performance.

MethodsWe analysed global P. vivax genetic data to assess variation in leading serological markers. Based on this, we produced new antigen versions (haplotypes) that better reflect global sequence diversity, compared to the commonly used reference strain (Sal-1). Antibody responses against these new constructs were then tested using samples from well-characterised cohorts in Brazil and Thailand. Antibody levels were assessed in relation to how recently participants had a qPCR-detectable blood-stage P. vivax infection. We compared the ability of the haplotypes and reference constructs to correctly identify individuals infected within the prior 9-months.

FindingsExtensive genetic diversity was identified in two P. vivax antigens, DBPII and MSP5. Several antigens had large numbers of circulating haplotypes globally, with the percentage with similar sequence identity to the reference Sal-1 ranging from 0.4% (MSP5) to 99% (S16). Two antigens exhibited strong differences in immunogenicity by region and construct (RBP2a and DBPII). However, for most proteins (5 out of 8), these differences had little impact on the accuracy of identifying recent exposure. In cases where performance was affected (e.g. RBP2a), this could be overcome by adding multiple antigens into the classification model.

InterpretationEven highly diverse antigens can be effective serological exposure markers. Our findings highlight the importance of testing the impact of genetic diversity when designing serological tests and suggest practical strategies, such as using a mix of antigens, to ensure consistent performance across regions.","[{""name"":""National Health and Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/011kf5r70"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GNT1173210;GNT2016908;1161066;2018654;GNT2024622;""},{""name"":""Government of Victoria"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02xvc5r05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""veski Fellowship;""},{""name"":""Sylvia and Charles Viertel Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05539km59"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/043z4tv69"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5R01AI104822;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

We show how this can be caused by variable amounts of statistical information between variants, e.g. due to variable sample sizes, which arise widely in meta-analyses, or due to variable imputation accuracy or call rate. This effect becomes more pronounced as sample sizes become larger, such that small differences in information available at different variants can lead to large errors in credible set predictions. Here, we show this inaccuracy propagates to the colocalisation method coloc, yielding confident but incorrect inference. We propose an adaptation of the proportional colocalisation test, which avoids any fine-mapping inference as an alternative to fine- mapping based colocalisation. This method was originally superseded by coloc because the null hypothesis is colocalisation, and because it can have low power in genetic regions with many variants. Our adaptation resolves this second issue, and simulations demonstrate that our approach accurately resolves false coloc inferences. However, the first issue remains, such that we suggest proportional colocalisation is used as an accompaniment to fine- mapping-based coloc. Our findings also emphasize the need for new methodologies in fine- mapping, particularly as GWAS sample sizes grow, to ensure accurate fine-mapping inference.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.","[{""name"":""Landesinstitut f√ºr Bioinformatikinfrastruktur in Baden-W√ºrttemberg"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 programme"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""965193;""},{""name"":""German Research Foundation (DFG)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DFG-508152189;""},{""name"":""UKRI BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X011054/1;BBS/E/F/000PR13631;""},{""name"":""TUBITAK ARDEB"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""120E531;""},{""name"":""German Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""031L0257B;""},{""name"":""Imperial College London"",""id"":""https://ror.org/041kmwe10"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""SmartCare"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""03LW0233K;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

We integrated phylogenetic, trait and genome size data for palms (Arecaceae) - a large pantropical family (>2600 species) with 167-fold variation in trait and 60-fold variation in genome size. We used structural equation modelling to test three key hypotheses: trait evolution promotes speciation (H1: trait flexibility hypothesis), and, speciation and trait evolution rates are constrained by allometry (H2: allometric constraint hypothesis) and genome size (H3: large genome constraint hypothesis). We detected seven major speciation rate shifts during the ca. 110-million-year history of palms. Tip-derived speciation rates increased with faster evolution in leaves and plant height, supporting H1, whereas correlated evolution between trait evolution rates indirectly influenced speciation, supporting H2. Large genomes decreased plant height and stem diameter evolutionary rates, but increased leaf size evolution and speciation rates, thus partly supporting H3. Our findings illustrate how the complex interplay between genome size, allometry and trait evolvability affect speciation, emphasizing the importance of holistic approaches in macroevolution. Furthermore, our results point to potential general mechanisms driving speciation rates throughout the plant Tree of Life.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DFG FZT 118, 202548816;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

In species with pollination-induced wilting, pollination rates should also influence phenotypic expression of genetic variation in longevity, raising questions of how and when variation in floral lifespan is shaped by adaptation. Methods: We experimentally manipulated pollination rates in a wild population of Sabatia angularis (Gentianaceae). We asked how treatments influenced pollen gain curves, the phenotypic distribution of floral longevity, trait correlations, and potential costs. We further asked how abiotic factors influence longevity and how they may interact with pollination conditions. Key results: Mean, variance, and maximum of longevity expressed increased with declining pollination. A flower longevity-number trade-off and positive longevity-flower size relationship persisted regardless of pollination context. Plants with more, not longer-lived, flowers suffered greater seed predation, potentially mitigating the flower number-longevity trade-off. The vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and seasonal changes constrained longevity. VPD had the strongest effect under the poorest pollination conditions, where longer-lived flowers would otherwise be favored. Conclusions: Our findings highlight how ecological conditions and internal constraints shape phenotypic variation. Conditional expression of longevity may preserve genetic variation, enabling rapid evolutionary responses when environmental change causes selection and exposure of variation to align.","[{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1655772;""},{""name"":""Temple University"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kx1jb78"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

Despite its cultural and nutritional significance, teff has limited genomic tools, constraining progress in yield improvement and trait optimization. Here, we assembled and resequenced the Teff Association Panel (TAP), a diverse set of 265 landraces and cultivars, to investigate the domestication history, genetic diversity, and agronomic traits of teff. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses confirm Eragrostis pilosa as the direct progenitor of teff, with domestication likely occurring in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. We generated a high-quality reference genome for E. pilosa and found extensive chromosomal collinearity and minimal gene loss compared to teff, with teff-specific genes enriched in functions related to domestication traits. We identified signatures of selection across the teff genome and used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to map loci associated with seed color and panicle architecture. Integrated GWAS, expression, metabolic, and comparative genomic analyses pinpoint a major seed color locus containing orthologs of the TT7 cytochrome P450 gene involved in flavonoid hydroxylation and the TT2 MYB transcription factor regulating proanthocyanidin biosynthesis. For panicle architecture, we identified a strong association near a teff ortholog of Dense and Erect Panicle 1 (DEP1), a key regulator of inflorescence structure in rice and sorghum. This suggests convergent selection on shared genetic pathways controlling panicle morphology across cereals. Our findings confirm the evolutionary origin of teff, identify key domestication loci, and highlight untapped genetic diversity among Ethiopian breeding lines. These genomic resources provide a foundation for accelerating teff improvement through molecular breeding and genome editing to enhance yield, resilience, and nutrition.","[{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NSF-DBI-2213983;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""USDA-NIFA 2022-67013-36118;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

Reaggregated early gastrula cells (here called gastruloids) of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis are able to regenerate with only little delay whole organisms that are virtually indistinguishable from normal developing polyps. However, the molecular control underlying the restoration of body axis and germ layers remains largely unknown. To address this, we established a standardized protocol, which reproducibly generates gastruloids developing into polys with a single body axis. Here, we show that committed mesodermal and endodermal cells are sorted out to the surface of the aggregate, where mesodermal cells form clusters of about 30 cells. At a critical time point, one mesodermal cluster immigrates, along with peripherally attached endodermal cells. Thereby, the inner germ layer and the oral-aboral axis is established in one and the same process. Functional studies demonstrated that this polarization of the endodermal cells requires a feedback loop of Notch and Wnt signaling. The dissociation of the early embryo disrupts Notch signaling in the endodermal cells, which leads to transient adoption of an endomesodermal profile, marked by the expression of the mesodermal cadherin1 until the boundaries between the germ layer identities are re-established. Our results highlight distinct morphogenetic behaviors of mesodermal and endodermal cells and the hitherto unknown role of Notch signaling in germ layer boundary formation in self-organizing gastruloids. Conservation of Notch-mediated boundary formation between endoderm and mesoderm mirrors bilaterian mechanisms, demonstrating how adoption of ancestral regulatory networks governing morphogenesis likely enabled the diversification of metazoan body plans.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P34404;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

As expected, deeper sleep was associated with reduced cortical activation, reflected in a lower high-to-low frequency power ratio. Yet, this relationship weakened in the presence of dreaming, indicating that immersive conscious experiences can counteract the impact of cortical activation on perceived depth. Indeed, perceived sleep depth was lowest during states with a mere sense of presence and highest during immersive dreaming or deep unconsciousness. Across the night, physiological sleep pressure and subjective sleepiness declined, but perceived sleep depth rose alongside increasing dream immersiveness.

Somitogenesis, the rhythmic segmentation of vertebrate embryos, is governed by signalling gradients and oscillations in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM)1,2, but the corresponding protein dynamics are largely unknown. Perturbations in this process cause congenital spine disorders and can result in embryonic lethality3. Here, we introduce an integrated proteomics and microfluidics approach to resolve spatiotemporal protein expression in the developing mouse tail. To this end, we established a microfluidic system to synchronize oscillations in embryo tails grown in 3D, which we combined with mass-spectrometry and RNA sequencing. We uncover novel oscillatory proteins and differentially expressed genes along the anteroposterior axis. Building on this dataset, we identify a previously unrecognized antagonistic, dynamic ligand-receptor expression pattern in R-Spondin/LGR signalling explaining how Wnt-oscillation amplitude increases despite decreasing ligand levels in anterior PSM. Dynamic ligand expression was validated in mouse gastruloids. Perturbation of ligand dynamics reduced oscillation amplitude and impaired somite formation. Our study reveals a novel regulatory strategy in which dynamic antagonistic gradients fine-tune signalling strength, providing new mechanistic insight into how protein dynamics control tissue patterning. We anticipate our dataset to serve as foundation for mechanistic investigations of mammalian somitogenesis including the role of mechanics and metabolism. More broadly, our approach combining microfluidics-based synchronization of signalling in multicellular systems with omics analyses can be applied to study dynamics in other contexts such as in tissue homeostasis4 and regeneration5.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

EXPAND focuses on a core set of 12 nuclear pathologist-interpretable features (NPIFs), composing the Nottingham grading criteria used by the pathologists. It is a fully automated, end-to-end diagnostic workflow, which automatically extracts NPIFs given a patient tumor slide and uses them to predict tumor subtype and survival. EXPANDs performance is comparable to that of existing deep learning non-interpretable black box AI models. It achieves areas under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.73, 0.79 and 0.75 for predicting HER2+, HR+ and TNBC tumor subtypes, respectively, matching the performance of proprietary models that rely on substantially larger and more complex interpretable feature sets. The 12 NPIFs demonstrate strong and independent prognostic value for patient survival, underscoring their potential as biologically grounded, interpretable biomarkers for survival stratification in BC.

Traditionally, ecological factors have been the primary focus of species distribution studies, but recent work emphasizes the importance of rapid evolution through local adaptation. Here, we focus on adaptation to changing temperatures, which is one of the central challenges populations face today. Importantly, thermal adaptation may be affected by the underlying thermodynamics. Despite many existing models in the fields of thermal biology and spatial evolutionary ecology, there is little integrative theory. However, understanding and modelling the thermodynamic constraints on thermal adaptation is likely essential for more nuanced predictions of the impacts of climate change. By integrating molecular mechanisms and population dynamics in a unified modelling framework, we here study how temperature-dependent processes at the protein level influence the macroecological patterns of range expansions. Our results highlight the importance of the microscopic processes underlying thermal adaptation for capturing the evolutionary ecology of range expansions. Specifically, the molecular bases of thermal adaptation define how and how fast thermal performance can evolve, which determines range expansion speeds. In general, our framework predicts that adaptation to warmer temperatures will be easier than adaptation to cold. Our study underscores the necessity for more interdisciplinary work, combining molecular mechanisms with population dynamics in space in order to improve climate change modeling, enhance prediction accuracy and provide better information for management and conservation of natural populations.

Significance StatementAs global temperatures shift, species must adapt to new climates, but how molecular changes scale up to influence population- and ecosystem-level patterns is poorly understood. Here, we link mutations affecting protein stability and enzyme activity to species abilities to expand along temperature gradients. Our models show that adaptation is faster at warmer temperatures and more constrained in the cold, reflecting how mutations shape protein function. Thermodynamic effects amplify the impact of beneficial mutations at higher temperatures, potentially accelerating evolutionary responses. By connecting molecular biophysics to population dynamics and range expansion, this work provides a cross-scale framework for predicting how organisms respond to warming environments.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-19-CE02-0015;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

Yet this raises a paradox: if there is such strong selection for optimal display choreography within species, how do courtship displays diversify so extensively between species? To address this, we measure how the choreography of courtship changes among allopatric populations of the dancing dune fly - Apotropina ornatipennis Malloch (Diptera: Chloropidae) - a species in which males and females spend their days cavorting on Australias hot sandy beaches. Merging population genetics with detailed quantification of the courtship display we explore which elements of the display are the first to diverge between isolated populations, whether new behaviours arise rapidly, and whether sequence rearrangements occur in the modular structure of the display. We find that these tiny flies express courtship repertoires approaching the levels of visual complexity seen in birds of paradise. Yet despite clear genetic and geographic isolation, the complex choreography of courtship displays is stable among populations. In contrast to the notion that courtship behaviour should be highly evolvable and rapidly diverge among allopatric populations, our findings suggests that the complex choreography of courtship can instead act as a stabilising feature that limits divergence over short evolutionary timescales.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

However, current sample preparation methods are largely inherited from visible light or electron microscopy workflows and hence are not optimised to exploit the full potential of X-ray contrast mechanisms. Here we propose to replace interstitial material by air to enhance X-ray phase contrast of the ultrastructural features. We used critical point drying (CPD) of heavy metal-stained mouse brain tissue to produce mechanically stable samples with preserved ultrastructure and enhanced refractive index boundaries, a nanofoam-like material that remains compatible with follow-up conventional resin embedding. Using two complementary synchrotron-based setups, a high-throughput microtomography beamline (P14, DESY) and a nanoscale holographic tomography beamline (ID16A, ESRF), we found that CPD samples consistently showed 2-4x stronger phase-shift signal than conventional resin-embedded tissue. The contrast gain remained consistent across samples, imaging conditions, and beamlines. Our results suggest that CPD offers a versatile route for preparing tissue for subcellular and ultrastructural-resolution X-ray imaging. It retains structural detail while improving signal, and is compatible with other processing procedures like femtosecond laser milling or electron microscopy, paving the path for biological tissue imaging beyond the mm3 scale.","[{""name"":""Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01js2sh04"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""XIMG-13;""},{""name"":""European Synchrotron Radiation Facility"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02550n020"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS3231;IHMA106;""},{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC2036;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC2036;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC2036;110174/Z/15/Z;EP/W024292/1;""},{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/W024292/1;EP/V007661/1;""},{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101094250;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""852455;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

However, it remains unclear whether this is intrinsically mediated or driven by age-related changes in neighboring cells. Here, we describe a scalable, genetically modifiable system for in vivo heterochronic myeloid cell replacement. We find reconstituted myeloid cells adopt region-specific transcriptional, morphological and tiling profiles characteristic of resident microglia. Young donor cells in aged brains rapidly acquired aging phenotypes, particularly in the cerebellum, while old cells in young brains adopted youthful profiles. We identified STAT1-mediated signaling as one axis controlling microglia aging, as STAT1-loss prevented aging trajectories in reconstituted cells. Spatial transcriptomics combined with cell ablation models identified rare natural killer cells as necessary drivers of interferon signaling in aged microglia. These findings establish the local environment, rather than cell-autonomous programming, as a primary driver of microglia aging phenotypes.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Cure Alzheimer‚Äôs Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

Yet the molecular basis underlying niche-specific colonization remains poorly defined. To address this, we conducted a time-resolved dual RNA-seq experiment to simultaneously monitor the transcriptional co-adaptations of human commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and human gut epithelial cells in an anaerobe-epithelium co-culture system. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of mucus-associated versus supernatant Bacteroides populations unveiled small RNAs (sRNAs) that are differentially regulated between spatially segregated subpopulations. Among these, we identified IroR as a key sRNA that facilitates B. thetaiotaomicron adaptation to the mucus-rich, iron-limiting niche, partly by modulating expression of bacterial capsule genes. This work provides new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of gut colonization and underscores a previously underappreciated role for bacterial sRNAs in shaping mutualistic interactions between the human microbiota and the gut epithelium.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757887661084

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.
