This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1749247763501

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

High viral titres were detected in milk from infected cows, raising concerns about onwards human infections. Although pasteurisation was shown to effectively inactivate influenza viruses in milk, unpasteurised milk still poses a risk of infection, both from occupational exposure in dairies and from the consumption of raw milk. We therefore assessed how long influenza viruses could remain infectious for in milk without heat inactivation. We examined the stability of a panel of influenza viruses in milk, including a contemporary H5N1 HPAIV and a variety of other influenza A and D viruses. We incubated viruses in cows milk under laboratory conditions: at room temperature to simulate exposure in dairies and at 4{degrees}C to simulate exposure to refrigerated raw milk. Following an isolated report of H5N1 viral RNA being detected in milk from a sheep in the UK, we also carried out similar experiments with a laboratory strain of IAV in sheeps milk. Although the survival of influenza viruses in milk was variable, we consistently found that under laboratory conditions substantial viral infectivity remained over periods when people might reasonably be exposed to infected milk - for over a day at room temperature and for more than 7 days when refrigerated. Our results highlight the zoonotic risk of H5N1 HPAIV in raw milk from infected animals and reinforce the importance of taking measures to mitigate this risk.","NA","medrxiv",1749247763501

It remains unclear how the limited set of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) and other proteins activated by these cytokine receptors can encode the observed diversity of immune cell phenotypes. To understand how signaling downstream of cytokines control immune cell phenotype, we sought to map the structure of Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling domains to cell signaling and resulting CAR T cell function. We recombined 14 signaling motifs to construct a library of ~30,000 constitutively active synthetic cytokine receptors (SCRs) with intracellular domains composed of novel signaling motif combinations that activate different signaling cascades. We experimentally tested ~450 SCRs which generated a range of CAR T cell memory, cytotoxicity, and proliferation. SCRs with pSTAT1 and 3 signaling generated effector memory CAR T cells, while SCRs with strong pSTAT5 generated effector CAR T cells with potent anti-tumor activity. To map the structure-signaling-phenotype landscape we trained models to predict signaling and CAR T cell phenotype that result from varied motif combinations. From neural network predictions we identified features, including strong STAT5 and Shc signaling, that promote unsafe autonomous CAR T cell proliferation. Models also revealed a trade-off between memory and cytotoxicity, with a Pareto front encoded by a continuous change in signaling. These results demonstrate that recombination of a limited set of signaling motifs creates a continuous spectrum of signaling that encodes a corresponding spectrum of cell phenotype. This work synthetically expands the combinatorial space of JAK/STAT signaling and provides a foundation for rational design of CAR T cells with improved cytotoxicity, memory, and safety profiles.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

However, with the growth of complex lab experiments, large datasets, many analytical tools, and expansive literature, biomedical research is increasingly constrained by repetitive and fragmented workflows that slow discovery and limit innovation, underscoring the need for a fundamentally new way to scale scientific expertise. Here, we introduce Biomni, a general-purpose biomedical AI agent designed to autonomously execute a wide spectrum of research tasks across diverse biomedical subfields. To systematically map the biomedical action space, Biomni first employs an action discovery agent to create the first unified agentic environment - mining essential tools, databases, and protocols from tens of thousands of publications across 25 biomedical domains. Built on this foundation, Biomni features a generalist agentic architecture that integrates large language model (LLM) reasoning with retrieval-augmented planning and code-based execution, enabling it to dynamically compose and carry out complex biomedical workflows - entirely without relying on predefined templates or rigid task flows. Systematic benchmarking demonstrates that Biomni achieves strong generalization across heterogeneous biomedical tasks - including causal gene prioritization, drug repurposing, rare disease diagnosis, micro-biome analysis, and molecular cloning - without any task-specific prompt tuning. Real-world case studies further showcase Biomnis ability to interpret complex, multi-modal biomedical datasets and autonomously generate experimentally testable protocols. Biomni envisions a future where virtual AI biologists operate alongside and augment human scientists to dramatically enhance research productivity, clinical insight, and healthcare. Biomni is ready to use at https://biomni.stanford.edu, and we invite scientists to explore its capabilities, stress-test its limits, and co-create the next era of biomedical discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

Despite widespread vaccination, infections persist, and the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 reprograms host metabolism remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether virus-induced lipid remodeling is conserved across variants and whether changes in lipid abundance correlate with alterations in lipid biosynthetic enzymes. Using global untargeted lipidomics and quantitative proteomics, we analyzed A549-ACE2 cells infected with the Delta (B.1.617.2) or Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants and compared them to cells infected with the ancestral WA1 strain. In parallel, we conducted quantitative proteomics to assess virus-induced changes in the host proteome. Our results reveal that SARS-CoV-2 drives a remarkably consistent pattern of metabolic rewiring at both the lipidomic and proteomic levels across all three variants. We mapped changes in the expression of host metabolic enzymes and compared these to corresponding shifts in lipid abundance. This integrative analysis identified key host proteins involved in virus-mediated lipid remodeling, including fatty acid synthase (FASN), lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA), and ORM1-like protein 2 (ORMDL2). Together, these findings highlight conserved metabolic dependencies of SARS-CoV-2 variants and underscore host lipid metabolism as a potential target for broad-spectrum antiviral strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

Previously, the Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, with or without c-MYC: ""OSK(M)"") have been shown to rejuvenate cells based on accurate predictors of age known as epigenetic clocks. Unfortunately, OSK(M) induces dangerous pluripotency pathways, making it unsuitable for therapeutic use. Recent work has focused on minimising the danger of the cocktail, but safety concerns remain. Here we present ""SB000"", the first single gene intervention to rejuvenate cells from multiple germ layers with efficacy rivalling the Yamanaka factors. Cells rejuvenated by SB000 retain their somatic identity, without evidence of pluripotency or loss of function. These results reveal that decoupling pluripotency from cell rejuvenation does not remove the ability to rejuvenate multiple cell types. This discovery paves the way for cell rejuvenation therapeutics that can be broadly applied across age-driven diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

This is partly due to a historical view of females occupying a passive role compared with males, which led to ignoring female song even in some well-studied species. We report one such case in yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia), as no other study investigated female song in 35 years after the first documentation of solo female songs. We interrogate the seasonal patterns and functions of female song in Galapagos yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia aureola), in which females perform solo song and produce duets with their male social partners. We carried out simulated territory intrusions by broadcasting male, female, or duet songs during breeding and non-breeding seasons, and conducted a territory retention survey for over a year. We measured the association between aggressive response and singing behaviour, sex-specific patterns of response, and territory retention across years. Females sang mostly during the non-breeding season and predominantly in male-led duets. Although females were strongly aggressive towards female song playback, they gave the weakest singing response towards them. There was no association between female aggressive behaviour and song output in response to a simulated intruder. Moreover, the probability of territory retention across years was not explained by song output or aggression in response to intruders, though evidence for this was weak due to the small sample size. We suggest that female song in this year-round resident island system does not function for territory defense or intrasexual competition, but may have other functions.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

Many centromeres comprise highly variable, megabase-scale satellite DNA arrays, yet the mutation spectrum driving this variability remains poorly understood. Using replicated genome assemblies of six Arabidopsis mutation accumulation lines, we identified centromeric mutations consisting almost exclusively of point mutations and structure-preserving, in-frame indels spanning a few kilobases. Centromeric point mutations occurred at a ninefold higher rate (6.1x10-8/bp/gen) than in chromosome arms, frequently introduced by non-allelic gene conversions from closely linked repeat units. Forward-in-time simulations based on the observed mutation spectrum recapitulated the emergence of megabase-scale higher-order repeat (HOR) structures, including long-range sequence similarities, without requiring large-scale rearrangements, closely mirroring centromeric divergence among natural genomes. Our results show that centromere evolution is driven by a unique mutational spectrum, providing a quantitative framework to understand how small-scale mutations shape and maintain the large-scale architecture of centromeric DNA.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

These variations can render retention time prediction models inaccurate and dramatically reduce the value of predictions for identification, validation, and DIA spectral library generation. To date, mitigation of these issues has been attempted through calibration or by training bespoke models for specific experimental setups, with only partial success. We here demonstrate that transfer learning can successfully overcome these limitations by leveraging pre-trained model parameters. Remarkably, this approach can even fit highly performant models to substantially different peptide modifications and LC conditions than those on which the model was originally trained.

However, the richness of such data means that conventional analyses may only scratch its surface. Extracting meaningful insights from these datasets often requires advanced computational methods and domain expertise. Current AI agents for biology are primarily focused on executing user-specified commands and are therefore limited by the user's creativity and familiarity with which kinds of analyses are useful. Furthermore, these agents do not account for prior analyses already attempted by researchers, reducing their ability to build upon existing work. To address these limitations, we introduce CellVoyager, an AI agent that autonomously explores scRNA-seq datasets in novel directions conditioned on prior user-ran analyses. Built on large language models, CellVoyager ingests both the dataset and a record of prior analyses to generate and test new hypotheses within a Jupyter notebook environment. We evaluate CellVoyager on CellBench, a new benchmark based on 50 published scRNA-seq studies encompassing 483 analyses. Given only the background sections of these papers, CellVoyager outperformed GPT-4o and o3-mini by up to 20% in predicting which analyses the authors eventually conducted. We then carried out three in-depth case studies where CellVoyager is given previously published papers with their scRNA-seq datasets and conducts analyses to generate new findings. The original authors of each study evaluated these findings and consistently rated them as creative and sound; 80% of the agent's hypotheses were deemed scientifically interesting. For example, in one case study, the agent found that CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 infection are more primed for pyroptosis, which was not explored by the original researchers. CellVoyager also reanalyzed a brain aging dataset to discover a previously unreported association between increased transcriptional noise and aging in the subventricular zone of the brain. These results demonstrate that CellVoyager can act both autonomously and collaboratively to accelerate hypothesis generation and computational biology. It also highlights the potential of agents like CellVoyager to unlock new biological insights by reanalyzing the vast existing biological data at scale.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

Here, we report the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein persistence in the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 replication in otherwise healthy individuals, a set of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and a case of a 60-year-old man who developed a new onset of lupus nephritis seven months following mild COVID-19 disease. We have identified that N protein persistence in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) did not correlate with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood but is associated with significantly increased secretion of type I interferons (IFN) and presence of tubuloreticular structures in peripheral leukocytes. We further demonstrate that the N protein colocalizes in the mitochondrial fraction of PBMCs from individuals positive for N protein alongside mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). In vitro expression of the N protein in a monocytic cell line showed that the N protein itself was directly capable of interacting with MAVS in the absence of viral RNA, and this interaction was enhanced if the cell was exposed to oxidative stress. We show that the type I IFN signature in the presence of N protein expression was MAVS, but not STING signaling pathway-dependent. Our findings suggest a mechanism for the onset and promotion of type I IFN signature after COVID-19; in our model, the SARS-CoV-2 N protein can independently trigger sustained type I IFN production via direct activation of MAVS and its spontaneous oligomerization. This long-lasting type I IFN generation may create a chronic inflammatory milieu, favoring autoimmunity with SLE-like symptoms in susceptible individuals.

However, a subset of circulating T cells with a tissue-resident memory-like phenotype retained transcriptional hallmarks of mucosal inflammation, mirroring their ileal counterparts with enrichment in cytokine pathways, including interferon gamma and TNF receptor signaling.

To evaluate if the evolving H5N1 viruses have changed tissue tropism over time, we compared the binding patterns of recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins derived from clade 1 (A/Vietnam/1203/04, H5VN) and circulating clade 2.3.4.4b viruses detected from a wild bird (A/Eurasian Teal/Hong Kong/AFCD-HKU-23- 14009-01020/2023, H5HK) and dairy cattle (A/bovine/Ohio/B24OSU-439/2024, H5OH). The HA protein of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was included for comparison. Using bio-layer interferometry, H1 protein preferentially bound to the 2,6-linked sialoside 6SLNLN while H5 proteins preferentially bound to the 2,3-linked sialoside 3SLN. H5OH showed higher binding affinity to 3SLN than H5HK and H5VN. The attachment pattern of H1 and H5 proteins to the respiratory tissues of different species and dairy cattle mammary glands were evaluated. Compared to the H1 protein, H5 proteins showed stronger binding to the lung epithelial cells of cat, cattle, chicken, ferret, human, and pig, and the clade 2.3.4.4b H5 proteins exhibited increased binding to pig and cattle bronchial epithelial cells. All H5 proteins attached to the alveolar and cistern epithelial cells in mammary glands where 2,3-linked and 2,6-linked sialyl glycans were detected by Maackia amurensis lectin II and Sambucus Nigra Lectin, respectively. Taken together, the HA proteins of clade 1 and 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses generally share comparable attachment patterns to avian and mammalian tissues, despite of evolving into antigenically distinct clades over the past 3 decades.

IMPORTANCEThe outbreaks of H5N1 HPAI among US dairy cattle since 2024 have raised concerns of the potential changes in HA receptor binding specificity and tissue tropism. Using insect-cell expressed recombinant HA proteins derived from clade 1 and circulating clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses, we showed that the dairy cattle H5 protein retained binding specificity for the avian-like 2,3-linked sialoside 3SLN over the human-like 2,6-linked sialoside 6SLNLN, with higher binding affinity to 3SLN than the other H5 proteins. Clade 1 and 2.3.4.4b H5 proteins showed comparable attachment patterns to the mammary tissues of lactating dairy cattle, which showed high expression of 2,3-linked and 2,6-linked sialyl glycans. All H5 proteins also showed comparable attachment patterns to the lungs of cat, cattle, chicken, ferret, human, and pig. Our results suggest that the recent H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cattle may be related to ecological factors rather than changes in HA receptor binding specificity.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

Here we present a series of technical improvements significantly enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of the Serial Lift-Out and SOLIST (Serialized On-grid Lift-In Sectioning for Tomography) procedures that are revolutionizing the field. We were able to extend the cryo-FIBSEM session from 24 hours to 5 days without interruptions. In addition, we describe a modified silver-plated EasyLiftTM needle that eliminates the need of the copper or gold block between the original tungsten needle and the sample. Moreover, we describe a strategy that significantly reduces curtaining effects. Finally, we report a precise routine to target a lamella with a precision of approximately 1 {micro}m in X,Y and Z. Together, these modifications considerably reduce contamination risk and preparation time, making cryo-lift-out techniques more accessible for routine structural biology applications on any type of tissue. Here, we demonstrate the power of our technique by targeting several specific wall structures that are of crucial importance for root function in plants and that were previously inaccessible to cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). High-pressure freezing (HPF) of plant tissues presents unique challenges for cryo-electron microscopy sample preparation due to the overall sample size, the individual cells size, their rigid cell wall and finally, their large vacuoles, which contain large amounts of rather diluted water solutions compared to cytosol.

Our technological improvements for the cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM) workflow enabled successful, targeted cryo-ET in plant roots. We noticed that, despite ice formation in vacuoles and to some degree in the cytosol, the plasma membranes and cell walls are remarkably well preserved, providing stunning insights into the native, hydrated nano-structure of plant cell walls, previously only observable with contrasting agents and in a dehydrated state.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

Maximum Likelihood (ML) based phylogenetic inference tools search for the tree and evolutionary model that best explain the observed genomic data. Given the independence of likelihood score calculations between different genomic sites, parallel computation is commonly deployed. This is followed by a parallel summation over the per-site scores to obtain the overall likelihood score of the tree. However, basic arithmetic operations on IEEE 754 floating-point numbers, such as addition and multiplication, inherently introduce rounding errors. Consequently, the order by which floating-point operations are executed affects the exact resulting likelihood value since these operations are not associative. Moreover, parallel reduction algorithms in numerical codes re-associate operations as a function of the core count and cluster network topology, inducing different round-off errors. These low-level deviations can cause heuristic searches to diverge and induce high-level result discrepancies (e.g., yield topologically distinct phylogenies). This effect has also been observed in multiple scientific fields, beyond phylogenetics. Results: We observe that varying the degree of parallelism results in diverging phylogenetic tree searches (high level results) for over 31 % out of 10 130 empirical datasets. More importantly, 8 % of these diverging datasets yield trees that are statistically significantly worse than the best known ML tree for the dataset (AU-test, p < 0.05). To alleviate this, we develop a variant of the widely used phylogenetic inference tool RAxML-NG, which does yield bit-reproducible results under varying core-counts, with a slowdown of only 0 to 12.7 % (median 0.8 %) on up to 768 cores. We further introduce the ReproRed reduction algorithm, which yields bit-identical results under varying core-counts, by maintaining a fixed operation order that is independent of the communication pattern. ReproRed is thus applicable to all associative reduction operations - in contrast to competitors, which are confined to summation. Our ReproRed reduction algorithm only exchanges the theoretical minimum number of messages, overlaps communication with computation, and utilizes fast base-cases for local reductions. ReproRed is able to all-reduce (via a subsequent broadcast) 4.1 {middle dot} 106 operands across 48 to 768 cores in 19.7 to 48.61 {micro}s, thereby exhibiting a slowdown of 13 to 93 % over a non-reproducible all-reduce algorithm. ReproRed outperforms the state-of-the-art reproducible all-reduction algorithm ReproBLAS (offers summation only) beyond 10 000 elements per core. In summary, we re-assess non-reproducibility in parallel phylogenetic inference, present the first bit-reproducible parallel phylogenetic inference tool, as well as introduce a general algorithm and open-source code for conducting reproducible associative parallel reduction operations.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

In Azotobacter vinelandii and many other members of Proteobacteria, the two-component system NifL-NifA controls the expression of nif genes that encode the nitrogen fixation machinery. The NifL-NifA system evolved the ability to integrate several environmental cues, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon availability. The nitrogen fixation machinery is thereby only activated under strictly favorable conditions, enabling diazotrophs to thrive in competitive environments. Whilst genetic and biochemical studies have enlightened our understanding of how NifL represses NifA, the molecular basis of NifA sequestration by NifL depends on structural information on their interaction. Here, we present mechanistic insights into how nitrogen fixation is regulated by combining biochemical and genetic approaches with a low-resolution cryo-EM map of the oxidized NifL-NifA complex. Our findings define the interaction surface between NifL and NifA and reveal how this interaction can be manipulated to generate bacterial strains with increased nitrogen fixation rates able to secrete surplus nitrogen outside the cell, a crucial step in engineering improved nitrogen delivery to crop plants.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

Here, we show that dendritic inhibition terminates plateaus in an all-or-none manner. Plateaus were initially resistant to inhibition but became increasingly susceptible to termination as they progressed. Between two distinct subtypes of dendrite-targeting interneurons, OLMNdnf generated slower postsynaptic currents that terminated plateaus more effectively than OLM2. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) were necessary for plateaus, which were prolonged by blocking small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK). A single-compartment model with these two conductances recapitulated core experimental findings and provided a mechanistic explanation for terminations. Plateaus arose from VGCCs maintained in the active state by sustained Ca2+ influx, a positive feedback loop that was quasi-balanced by ISK. Inhibition terminated plateaus by driving the membrane potential below a dynamic threshold to deactivate VGCCs and end the positive feedback loop. Lastly, two-photon Ca2+ imaging showed that plateaus evoke large dendritic Ca2+ transients that were graded by terminations. Overall, our results demonstrate how the feedback inhibitory circuit interacts with intrinsic cellular mechanisms to regulate plateau potentials and shape dendritic Ca2+ signals in CA1-PYRs.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

While the advent of single-cell transcriptomics has allowed for the discovery and identification of transcriptionally distinct cell populations present during lung development, the spatiotemporal dynamics of these transcriptional shifts remain undefined. With imaging-based spatial transcriptomics, we analyzed the gene expression patterns in 17 human infant lungs at varying stages of development and lung injury, creating a spatial transcriptomic atlas of ~1.2 million cells. We applied computational clustering approaches to identify shared molecular similarities among this cohort, generating hypotheses about how tissue architecture and molecular spatial relationships are coordinated during normal development and disrupted in disease. Recognizing that all preterm birth represents an injury to the developing lung, we have moved away from the conventional paradigm of classifying an infant lung as belonging to 'disease' or 'control' groups in favor of a linear regression approach that accounts for the routinely collected objective measures of gestational age and life span. Within this new framework, we have identified cell type patterns across these variables that would likely be overlooked when using a binary, conventional 'diseased' vs. 'control' comparison. Together, these data represent an open resource for the lung research community, supporting discovery-based inquiry and identification of targetable molecular mechanisms in both normal and arrested human lung development.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

Substantial variability in gene selection across programs exists, highlighting the need for a systematic approach to prioritize genes.

MethodsWe assembled a dataset comprising 25 characteristics about each of the 4,390 genes included in 27 NBSeq programs. We used regression analysis to identify several predictors of inclusion, and developed a machine learning model to rank genes for public health consideration.

ResultsAmong 27 NBSeq programs, the number of genes analyzed ranged from 134 to 4,299, with only 74 (1.7%) genes included by over 80% of programs. The most significant associations with gene inclusion across programs were presence on the US Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (inclusion increase of 74.7%, CI: 71.0%-78.4%), robust evidence on the natural history (29.5%, CI: 24.6%-34.4%) and treatment efficacy (17.0%, CI: 12.3%- 21.7%) of the associated genetic disease. A boosted trees machine learning model using 13 predictors achieved high accuracy in predicting gene inclusion across programs (AUC = 0.915, R{superscript 2} = 84%).

In this study, we generated multiple new alleles of bik1 and pbl1 by CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing and systematically analyzed these mutants alongside existing T-DNA insertional lines. These analyses reinforced the central role of BIK1 and PBL1 in pattern-triggered immunity mediated by both receptor kinases and receptor-like proteins.

As cells differentiate collectively, it raises the question of how tissue-level properties affect instructive cues of decision-making. Here, we show that a tissue rigidity phase transition guides patterning by tuning the length-scales and time-scales of morphogen signalling. By combining rigidity percolation theory, reaction-diffusion modelling, quantitative imaging, optogenetics and single-cell transcriptomics in zebrafish, we uncover dynamical global tissue rigidity patterns that actively shape the Nodal morphogen gradient by restricting ligand dispersal and accelerating its signalling activity. In this self-generated mechanism, Nodal, besides driving meso-endoderm fate specification, increases cell-cell adhesion strength via regulating planar cell polarity genes. Once adhesion strength reaches a critical point, it triggers a rigidity transition which collapses tissue porosity. The abrupt tissue reorganisation negatively feeds back on Nodal signalling impacting both its length-scales, by limiting Nodal diffusivity, and its time-scales, by speeding up the expression of its antagonist Lefty, thereby ensuring timely signal termination and robust patterning. Overall, we reveal how emergent properties set the spatiotemporal dynamics of morphogen gradients, uncovering macroscopic mechanisms of pattern formation.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

We developed an integrated experimental-computational workflow using MALDI imaging mass spectrometry, isotope tracing, and deep-learning artificial intelligence. Most measured metabolites (> 95%) showed significant spatial concentration gradients in liver lobules and intestinal villi. In the liver, tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle metabolites and their labeling from both glutamine and lactate localized periportally. Energy-stress metabolites including adenosine monophosphate (AMP) also localized periportally, consistent with high periportal energy demand. In intestine, the TCA intermediates malate (tip) and citrate (crypt) showed opposite spatial patterns, which aligned with higher glutamine catabolism in tips and lactate oxidation in crypts based on isotope tracing. Finally, we mapped the fate of the obesogenic dietary sugar fructose. In the intestine, oral fructose was catabolized faster in the villus bottom than the tips. In the liver, fructose-derived carbon accumulated pericentrally as fructose-1-phosphate and triggered pericentral adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion.

The classical view holds that cells translate a constant concentration of a GF with specific chemical identity to a steady state activation of the underlying signaling pathway, resulting in a defined phenotypic response. However, recent findings suggest that even a single GF, when presented in a pulsatile manner, drives differential phenotypic responses depending on the frequency of stimulation. To reconcile these views, we introduce a novel conceptual framework of ""signaling homeorhesis"". Unlike homeostasis, homeorhesis describes the stable evolution of signaling trajectories over time. Defining this concept quantitatively using a dynamical systems framework, we use mathematical models of the Epidermal Factor Growth Receptor (EGFR) and the Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) networks, as well as available experimental temporal protein activity recordings in PC-12 cells to demonstrate that cells classify GF signals to unique signaling trajectories that encode for distinct cell phenotypes, irrespective of the GF identity. We thereby propose that the cellular phenotype is determined in real-time, as the cell actively interprets the growth factor signals from its environment.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

We then estimated intrinsic motoneuron properties and garnered insight about the proportion of excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory inputs contributing to motor commands across contraction intensities in each group. Participants also performed a task where a triangular contraction was superimposed onto a sustained one designed to challenge inhibitory control of dendritic persistent inward currents (PICs).

No differences in discharge rate hysteresis or the discharge rate characteristics during the sombrero tasks between groups, suggesting no differences in neuromodulatory input. Conversely, resistance- compared to endurance-trained individuals exhibited greater acceleration slopes during lower contractions forces ([&le;]50% MVF), indicating the possibility of enhanced initial activation of PICs. Collectively, the greater and more linear MU discharge patterns in the trained groups either suggests a more reciprocal (i.e., push-pull) excitation-inhibition coupling during higher contraction forces or enhanced excitatory synaptic input to the motor pool, which might underpin greater force production of trained individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

Here we assessed genetic diversity within and among populations from two Caribbean islands, Puerto Rico (n = 43, five sites) and Guadeloupe (n = 25, one site), which contain putative wild and/or introgressed forms. Using whole-genome resequencing data and a phylogenomic framework derived from a broader genomic survey, we parsed individuals into feral derivatives and truly wild forms. Feral cottons display uneven levels of genetic and morphological resemblance to domesticated cottons, with diverse patterns of genetic variation and heterozygosity. These patterns are inferred to reflect a complex history of interspecific and intraspecific gene flow that is spatially highly variable in its effects. Wild cottons in both Caribbean islands appear to be relatively inbred, especially the Guadeloupe samples.

Pig body weight values estimated by a conventional approach or a computer vision system can be considered as two different measurements of the same trait, but with different sources of phenotyping error. Previous studies have shown that trait measurement error, defined as the difference between manually collected phenotypes and image-derived phenotypes, can be influenced by genetics, suggesting that the error is systematic rather than random and is more likely to lead to misleading quantitative genetic analysis results. Therefore, we investigated the effect of trait measurement error on genetic analysis of pig body weight (BW).

ResultsCalibrated scale-based and image-based BW showed high coefficients of determination and goodness of fit. Genomic heritability estimates for scale-based and image-based BW were mostly identical across growth periods. Genomic heritability estimates for trait measurement error were consistently negligible, regardless of the choice of computer vision algorithm. In addition, genome-wide association analysis revealed no overlap between the top markers identified for scale-based BW and those associated with trait measurement error. Overall, the deep learning-based regressions outperformed the adaptive thresholding segmentation methods.

ConclusionsThis study showed that manually measured scale-based and image-based BW phenotypes yielded the same quantitative genetic results. We found no evidence that BW trait measurement error could be influenced, at least in part, by genetic factors. This suggests that trait measurement error in pig BW does not contain systematic errors that could bias downstream genetic analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

Changes in the biochemical or mechanical properties of the ECM can lead to diseases such as fibrosis or cancer. In a 3D microenvironment, cell-matrix interaction is vital to how cells sense and respond to biochemical and biophysical cues. This study examines the reciprocal interactions between fibroblasts and collagen in 3D hydrogels. We quantitatively measured changes in collagen branch number and junctions in 3D hydrogels using confocal reflectance microscopy and existing analysis protocols. This reveals the impact small changes in collagen concertation (1.0 vs 1.5 mg/ml) over time (15 minutes to 4 hours) have on 3D gels. Embedded in 3D hydrogels, wild-type mouse fibroblasts differentially affect collagen organisation in their immediate proximity with changing concentration and time. This regulation is interestingly lost in Caveolin-1 null fibroblasts with altered stiffness, mechanosensing and cytoskeletal regulation. Inhibition of the Rho-ROCK pathway (known to be changed in Caveolin-1 null fibroblasts) drives cellular protrusions and concentration-dependent 3D collagen organisation in wildtype fibroblasts, but surprisingly not in Caveolin-1 null fibroblasts. This depends on dynamin-dependent endocytosis, which, when inhibited, disrupts ROCK-dependent protrusions and alters collagen organisation in 3D collagen. Together, these observations quantitatively demonstrate how cells respond at the cell-matrix interphase to subtle changes in collagen concentration and organisation in 3D hydrogels, regulated by the presence of Caveolin-1.

Statement of SignificanceThis study highlights the critical role of Caveolin-1 in cell-mediated regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in a 3D microenvironment. Using confocal reflectance microscopy, we demonstrate that subtle changes in collagen concentration significantly influence collagen organisation over time. While wild-type fibroblasts exhibit dynamic, concentration-dependent regulation of the cell-matrix interphase, Caveolin-1 null fibroblasts lose this regulation. Furthermore, Rho-ROCK pathway inhibition promotes protrusions and collagen reorganisation in wild-type cells but not Caveolin-1 null fibroblasts. Dynamin-dependent endocytosis also emerges as a key modulator of this process. These findings provide quantitative insights into how mechanosensing and cytoskeletal regulation, dependent on endocytosis can control the cell-matrix interphase, with possible implications for understanding disease-associated matrix changes.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

The recent outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza (AI) in dairy cattle highlighted the importance of early detection in managing and mitigating HPAIV outbreaks. A successful high-speed diagnostic response requires rapid site and specimen access, minimal time for test protocols, and prompt communication of the diagnostic results to government officials. A new diagnostic paradigm that consists of miniaturized extractor and qPCR instruments (EZextractor and EZcycler MiniQ), designed for mobile, on-site testing has been compared with a platform of benchtop instruments (QIAGEN RNeasy and QuantStudio 5) for detecting inactivated H5 avian influenza virus (AIV) spiked in raw milk samples. Two sets of experiments were performed: 1) 15 raw milk samples, obtained from 15 different farms, diluted with phosphate-buffered saline and spiked with the virus to reach approximately 10 copies/mcL virus concentration, and 2) raw milk samples from two farms, each spiked with the inactivated AIV H5 followed by 5 series of dilution to reach AIV concentrations of 1000, 100, 10, 1 and 0.1 copies/mcL. Results show that despite the inhibitors in raw milk, AIV in all samples can be detected by both platforms. The MT platform showed higher sensitivity than the benchtop platform: the Ct values from the MT were ~2 units lower than the benchtop Ct values. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of the MT platform for diagnosing AIV H5 in raw milk samples and support its use as an on-site diagnostic for rapid surveillance and response.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

We tested relationships between eggshell maculation, surface temperature, hormone concentrations before and during incubation, and embryonic growth in Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) eggs developing while artificially incubated in duplicate incubators. We detected 10 steroid hormones in the yolks during development and concentrations of all hormones declined to Day 15 (~2 days before hatch). Steroid declines at Day 9 of incubation were related to eggshell surface temperature, with warmer eggs having higher concentrations of androgens and progestogens, and incubator assignment, as eggs were warmer on average in one incubator than the other. However, eggshell surface temperature was not related to eggshell maculation, embryonic size, or embryonic heart rate during development. These results provide evidence of yolk steroid concentration declines through incubation and suggest that environmental conditions (such as temperature or light) could alter embryonic hormone uptake and/or metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

We developed the tangle maturity scoring system to semi-quantitatively evaluate each tangle maturity level. Based on proportions of tangle maturity levels, we classified antibodies as ""early"" (mostly pretangles and mature tangles), ""middling"" (mature tangles with pretangles and ghost tangles), and ""advanced"" (mostly ghost tangles and mature tangles) tangle maturity markers. To summarize tangle maturity predilection, we developed the tangle maturity scale to integrate individual tangle maturity scores. Correlations showed stronger relationships between tangle maturity scale and subsector thickness for more advanced tangle maturity markers in CA1 and subiculum, whereas Braak tangle stage remained consistently correlated throughout markers of the tangle lifespan. To aid in scoring hippocampi, we used machine learning to recognize tangle maturity levels, which performed comparably to a domain expert and showed similar relationships by Spearman correlation. Pattern recognition software was used to assess tangle and neuritic tau burden separately, which generally correlated with Braak stage and neuronal counts. However, tangle-derived tau burden more consistently correlated with hippocampal subsector thickness. In conclusion, we developed manual and automated scoring systems to evaluate tangle maturity levels, demonstrating early 4R, phosphorylated, and oligomeric tau accumulation preceding more advanced 3R and truncated tau. Our study provides supportive evidence of disease-relevant ordering of tau posttranslational modifications in the brain, which may have implications for theragnostic development. These findings underscore the promise of computerized quantitative analyses (i.e., pathomics) for high-throughput feature extraction from whole-slide images to enhance our understanding of microscopically observed morphologic changes.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

Central to their energy metabolism is a membrane-bound, sodium-translocating methyltransferase complex: the N-tetrahydromethanopterin:CoM-S-methyltransferase (Mtr complex), which catalyzes the methyl transfer between two methanogen specific cofactors. This exergonic methyl transfer step is coupled with a vectorial sodium ion transport from the cytoplasm to the cell exterior and is the only energy conserving step in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Here, we present a 2.1 [A] single-particle cryo-EM structure of the full Mtr complex from Methanosarcina mazei. Our structural model encompasses the entire complex, reveals the arrangement of archaeal phospholipids, the architecture of the sodium ion binding site, and the structure and interactions of all catalytic subunits. Most strikingly, we discover and characterize MtrI, a previously unannotated small open reading frame (small ORF), encoded protein (<100 aa) conserved across the order of Methanosarcinales. MtrI binds to the cytoplasmic domain of MtrA in response to oxygen exposure, suggesting a role in oxygen stress response and protection. By binding on top of the sodium channel and anchoring to the cobamide cofactor in MtrAs cytoplasmic domain, MtrI might prevent sodium leakage and inhibit MtrA-CoM turnover. These findings offer new insights into methanogen energy conservation and uncover a potential adaptive response to oxygen exposure, expanding our understanding of methanogen survival strategies under oxidative stress.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1749247763501

We identified a unique mechanism employed by insect odorant receptors to discriminate amongst pheromones, chemical communication signals that orchestrate courtship and mating behavior. By coupling cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and functional mutagenesis, we find that males of the silkmoth Bombyx mori distinguish between two quasi-identical compounds -bombykol, an alcohol, and bombykal, an aldehyde- by establishing a reversible covalent bond between the pheromone receptor and bombykal. Bombykol, instead, binds to the same receptor through hydrogen bonds, with significantly lower potency. The unique ability of aldehydes to establish a reversible covalent bond allows moths to unequivocally distinguish between compounds that differ only in the presence of a single hydrogen atom. Further, as many important odorants are aldehydes, this work illuminates a new binding mode available to the olfactory system to achieve high selectivity for these compounds.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) already supplies nitrogen to legume crops and several avenues of research are underway to extend it to non-legume crops. In maize (Zea mays), aerial roots have been shown to contribute to BNF in some varieties, and both having many aerial roots and large aerial roots contributes to the fixation trait. However, much of the genetics controlling aerial root number and size is still unknown. Here we validate and quantify BNF in maize varieties from Southern Mexico under controlled conditions and evaluate a population of double haploids derived from the elite inbred PHZ51 crossed with these varieties. We find that most aerial root traits (root number, nodes with roots, root size) are reasonably heritable (h2 0.5-0.75) and generally uncorrelated with each other. QTL mapping identifies 5 QTL each affecting nodes with aerial roots and aerial root number per node; in both cases all but 1 QTL show an increase from the landrace allele. We also identify 11 QTL for aerial root diameter, with most positive QTL coming from PHZ51. Between the two populations, only a few QTL overlap, indicating a presumably high diversity of genes affecting aerial root morphology in landrace populations. Combining the best QTL into elite material may provide a path toward meaningful levels of BNF for maize, and additional work is needed to determine how viable this approach will be in field settings.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1749247763501

Surprisingly, the developmental processes underlying gill formation in zebrafish remain poorly understood. Here, we present for the first time a comprehensive analysis of the morphogenesis of gill arteries, filaments and lamellae during lifelong development.

Our results provide important insights into the temporal and spatial pattern of gill angiogenesis, revealing fundamental differences in the formation of lateral versus medial filaments along the dorso-ventral axis. These early asymmetries correlate with, and likely underlie, the structural asymmetries observed in adult gills, which we quantitatively characterize. This indicates that a region-specific developmental programme establishes a blueprint for gill architecture maintained throughout life.

We further show that lamellae develop through a complex interplay between endothelial and cranial neural crest-derived pillar cells. Notably, lamellar size, which strongly influences respiratory efficiency, depends on the position of the filament in the arch. Together, our work identifies key cellular and temporal mechanisms driving gill development and provides a framework to investigate broader principles of branching morphogenesis and angiogenesis in vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

Pasta accurately predicts relative age from bulk, single-cell, and microarray data, capturing senescent and stem-like cellular states through signatures enriched in p53 and DNA damage response pathways. Its predictions correlate with tumor grade and patient survival, underscoring clinical relevance. Applied to the CMAP L1000 dataset, Pasta identified known and novel age-modulatory compounds and genetic perturbations, and highlighted mitochondrial translation and mRNA splicing as key determinants of the cellular propensity for aging and rejuvenation, respectively. Supporting Pastas predictive power, we validated pralatrexate as a potent senescence inducer and piperlongumine as a rejuvenating agent. Strikingly, chemotherapy drugs were highly enriched among pro-aging hits.

In this study, we propose that regions of the language network are coupled to one another through subspaces of shared linguistic features. To test this idea, we developed a model-based connectivity framework to quantify stimulus-driven, feature-specific functional connectivity between language areas during natural language comprehension. Using fMRI data acquired while subjects listened to spoken narratives, we tested three types of features extracted from a unified neural network model for speech and language: low-level acoustic embeddings, mid-level speech embeddings, and high-level language embeddings. Our modeling framework enabled us to quantify the stimulus features that drive connectivity between regions: early auditory areas were coupled to intermediate language areas via lower-level acoustic and speech features; in contrast, higher-order language and default-mode regions were predominantly coupled through more abstract language features. We observed a clear progression of feature-specific connectivity from early auditory to lateral temporal areas, advancing from acoustic connectivity to speech- and finally to language-driven connectivity. These findings suggest that regions of the language network are coupled through feature-specific communication channels to facilitate efficient and context-sensitive language processing.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

A promising set of newer approaches are based on genetic data, which can be cheaper to obtain and less invasive than information from more direct observation. One of these approaches is close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR), a type of method that uses genetic data to identify kin pairs and estimates population size from these pairs. Although CKMR methods are promising, a major limitation to using them more broadly is a lack of CKMR models that can deal with spatial heterogeneity both in population density and sample effort. We introduce a simulation-based approach to CKMR that uses spatially explicit individual-based simulation in concert with a deep convolutional neural network to estimate population sizes. Using extensive simulation, we show that our method, CKMRnn, is highly accurate, even in the face of spatial heterogeneity, and demonstrate that it can account for potential confounders such as unknown population histories. Finally, to demonstrate the accuracy of our method in an empirical system, we apply CKMRnn to data from a Ugandan elephant population, and show that point estimates from our method recapitulate those from traditional estimators but that the confidence interval on our estimator is reduced by approximately 30%.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

The host-bacteria induced proinflammatory cytokines in epithelial cells, while Saccharibacteria were immune silent. Remarkably, Saccharibacteria dampened cytokine responses to host-bacteria during coinfection. This effect was driven by Saccharibacteria-induced clustering of TLR2 receptors, a process likely facilitated by type IV, ultimately leading to reduced TLR2-mediated cytokine signalling. High resolution imaging showed that Saccharibacteria were endocytosed by oral epithelial cells, and colocalized with endosome markers, eventually trafficking to lysosomes. Moreover, a subset of the Saccharibacteria survive endocytosis long-term, and retains their capability to reinfect host-bacteria, highlighting a mechanism for persistence in the oral microbiome and a vital role in mammalian immune system modulation.","NA","biorxiv",1749247763501

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1749247763501

We demonstrate the real world implications of the use of testing and evaluate adverse events and outcomes in individuals who did not receive pharmacogenomic testing for clopidogrel.

MethodsWe analyzed ~100K individuals with paired EHR and exome sequencing data from population health studies administered at multiple medical centers using the Helix Exome+(R) assay. We inferred clopidogrel dosage by processing the prescription with an LLM. We identified all instances of individuals with at least one prescription that is not in concordance with their CYP2C19 genotype. Lastly, we identify instances of thrombosis using a comprehensive codeset based on ICD9, ICD10, and SNOMED terms.

ResultsWe identified 16,140 prescriptions of clopidogrel given to 3,853 participants. We found that 29% of these individuals have a mismatch between the recommended clopidogrel dosage guideline based on their CYP2C19 genotype and their actual prescribed daily dosage. 25% of poor metabolizers experienced thrombosis, with 40% occurring within 2 months of treatment. Poor and intermediate metabolizers receiving clopidogrel are much more likely to experience thrombosis and myocardial infarction (binomial p-value = 0.001).

ConclusionsWe estimate a 38% excess of adverse events occur in poor and intermediate metabolizers relative to normal and rapid metabolizers. The lack of testing may be responsible for 1 thrombosis event per every ~30 people prescribed clopidogrel.","NA","medrxiv",1749247763501

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.
