Several experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can, in principle, determine conformational states, binding configurations and their probabilities, but suffer from low throughput. Here we develop a Biomolecular Emulator (BioEmu), a generative deep learning system that can generate thousands of statistically independent samples from the protein structure ensemble per hour on a single graphical processing unit. By leveraging novel training methods and vast data of protein structures, over 200 milliseconds of MD simulation, and experimental protein stabilities, BioEmu's protein ensembles represent equilibrium in a range of challenging and practically relevant metrics. Qualitatively, BioEmu samples many functionally relevant conformational changes, ranging from formation of cryptic pockets, over unfolding of specific protein regions, to large-scale domain rearrangements. Quantitatively, BioEmu samples protein conformations with relative free energy errors around 1 kcal/mol, as validated against millisecond-timescale MD simulation and experimentally-measured protein stabilities. By simultaneously emulating structural ensembles and thermodynamic properties, BioEmu reveals mechanistic insights, such as the causes for fold destabilization of mutants, and can efficiently provide experimentally-testable hypotheses.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

Moreover, we identified secreted factors that enable a pair of thermosensory neurons (AFD) to communicate with the germline and trace the path of the epigenetic signal.

Epigenetic mechanisms such as small RNAs (sRNAs) in the germline silence transposable elements (TEs), which comprise a significant portion of the genome. TE mobility can be mutagenic and is thought to contribute to genome evolution by altering genome structure and diversification. In C. elegans elevated temperature leads to desilencing of TEs in the germline, suggesting that environmental conditions could impact the integrity of inheritable genomes.

Such fibrinaloid microclots are also relatively resistant to fibrinolysis. The proteins that the amyloid microclots contained differed markedly both from the soluble proteome of typical plasma and that of normal clots, and also between the disease studies (an acute syndrome in the form of sepsis in an ITU and a chronic disease represented by Long COVID). Many proteins in the amyloid microclots were low in concentration in plasma and were effectively accumulated into the fibres, whereas many other abundant plasma proteins were excluded. The proteins found in the microclots associated with the diseases also tended to be themselves amyloidogenic. We here ask effectively the inverse question. This is: can the clot proteome tell us whether the clots associated with a particular disease contained proteins that are observed uniquely (or are highly over-represented) in known amyloid clots relative to normal clots, and thus were in fact amyloid in nature? The answer is in the affirmative in a variety of major coagulopathies, viz. venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, various cardiac issues, and ischaemic stroke. Galectin-3-binding protein and thrombospondin-1 seem to be especially widely associated with amyloid-type clots, and the latter has indeed been shown to be incorporated into growing fibrin fibres. These may consequently provide useful biomarkers with a mechanistic basis.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

Traditionally linked to genomic imprinting, these effects are believed to have evolved from parental conflict over resource allocation to offspring, which results in opposing parental genetic influences. Despite their potential importance, POEs remain heavily understudied in complex traits, largely due to the lack of parental genomes.

Here, we present a multi-step approach to infer the parent-of-origin of alleles without parental genomes, leveraging inter-chromosomal phasing, mitochondrial and chromosome X data, and sibling-based crossover inference. Applied to the UK Biobank (discovery cohort) and Estonian Biobank (replication cohort), this scalable approach enabled parent-of-origin inference for up to 221,062 individuals, representing the largest dataset of its kind.

GWAS scans for more than 60 complex traits and over 2,400 protein levels contrasting maternal and paternal effects identified over 30 novel POEs and confirmed more than 50% of testable known associations. Notably, approximately half of our POEs exhibited a bipolar pattern, where maternal and paternal alleles exert conflicting effects. These effects were particularly prevalent for traits related to growth (e.g., IGF-1, height, fat-free mass) and metabolism (e.g., type 2 diabetes, triglycerides, glucose). Replication in the Estonian Biobank validated over 70% of testable associations.

Overall, our findings shed new light on the influence of POEs on diverse complex traits and align with the parental conflict hypothesis, providing compelling evidence for this understudied evolutionary phenomenon.","NA","medrxiv",1733522965941

Cryptosporidium is an intracellular parasite of intestinal epithelial cells, and a leading cause of diarrheal death and disease in infants worldwide. Despite this, very little is known about the cell biology of infection of this eukaryotic pathogen. Here, we designed and implemented a unique microscopy-based arrayed CRISPR-Cas9 screen to interrogate the effects of the loss of every protein-coding human gene on a Cryptosporidium infection. As the experimental readout is image-based, we extracted multiple phenotypic features of infection, including parasite growth, progression of the parasite to its sexual life stage, and recruitment of host actin to pedestals beneath the parasite vacuole. Using this dataset, we discovered a tipping point in the host cholesterol biosynthesis pathway that controls Cryptosporidium infection. Parasite growth can either be inhibited or promoted by the intermediary metabolite squalene. A build-up of squalene in epithelial cells creates a reducing environment, with more reduced host glutathione available for uptake by the parasite. Because Cryptosporidium has lost the ability to synthesize glutathione, this uptake from the host cell is required for growth and progression through its life cycle. We demonstrate that this dependency can be leveraged for treatment with the abandoned drug lapaquistat, an inhibitor of host squalene synthase that has efficacy against Cryptosporidium in vitro and in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

We present LRGE, a novel tool that uses read-to-read overlap information to estimate genome size in a reference-free manner. LRGE calculates per-read genome size estimates by analysing the expected number of overlaps for each read, considering read lengths and a minimum overlap threshold. The final size is taken as the median of these estimates, ensuring robustness to outliers such as reads with no overlaps. Additionally, LRGE provides an expected confidence range for the estimate. LRGE outperforms k-mer-based methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency and produces genome size estimates comparable to those from assembly-based approaches, like Raven, while using significantly less computational resources. We validate LRGE on a large, diverse bacterial dataset and confirm it generalises to eukaryotic datasets.

Availability and implementationOur method, LRGE (Long Read-based Genome size Estimation from overlaps), is implemented in Rust and is available as a precompiled binary for most architectures, a Bioconda package, a prebuilt container image, and a crates.io package as a binary (lrge) or library (liblrge).

This escape has been attributed to mutations in critical neutralizing antibody epitopes mainly in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. Here we show that this notion is incomplete. We found that several broadly neutralizing human antibodies isolated over the past years retain an almost undiminished capacity for inhibitory targeting of RBDs of recent highly immunoevasive SARS-CoV-2 strains. Likewise, human sera collected during the pre-Omicron era from persons immunized with original Wuhan-based vaccines were found to contain abundant neutralizing activity targeted against the RBDs of modern Omicron variants. However, this unexpected neutralization sensitivity was observed only when these RBDs were incorporated into a mismatched spike protein backbone, whereas the corresponding native Omicron spike proteins were highly resistant against the same panel of antibodies and human sera. We conclude that changes occurring outside of the RBD and leading to altered conformational dynamics of the spike protein have played a key part in the viral evolution enabling SARS-CoV-2 to escape from neutralizing antibodies that target highly conserved cryptic RBD epitopes.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

Moreover, genetically divergent versions of N2 have arisen over decades of research and hindered reproducibility of C. elegans genetics and genomics. Here we provide a 106.4 Mb gap-free, telomere-to-telomere genome assembly of C. elegans, generated from CGC1, an isogenic derivative of the N2 strain. We used improved long-read sequencing and manual assembly of 43 recalcitrant genomic regions to overcome deficiencies of prior N2 and VC2010 assemblies, and to assemble tandem repeat loci including a 772-kb sequence for the 45S rRNA genes. While many differences from earlier assemblies came from repeat regions, unique additions to the genome were also found. Of 19,972 protein-coding genes in the N2 assembly, 19,790 (99.1%) encode products that are unchanged in the CGC1 assembly.

C. elegans possesses an expanded repertoire of at least 19 AGOs functioning in an intricate gene regulatory network. Despite their crucial roles, little is known about the regulation of AGOs, and whether their expression levels, tissue specificity, and functions change in response to genetic perturbations or environmental triggers. Here, we report that PALS-22, a member of an unusually expanded protein family in C. elegans, acts as a negative regulator of antiviral RNAi involving the RIG-I homolog. The loss of pals-22 leads to enhanced silencing of transgenes and endogenous dsRNAs. We found that PALS-22 normally suppresses the expression of two AGOs, VSRA-1 and SAGO-2, which are activated by bZIP transcription factor ZIP-1. When pals-22 is eliminated, vsra-1 and sago-2 are upregulated. These AGOs in turn play key roles in defense against foreign genetic elements and intracellular pathogens, respectively. Surprisingly, while in pals-22 mutants immune genes functioning in the intracellular pathogen response (IPR) are upregulated, removing SAGO-2 or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RRF-3 in these mutants leads to the downregulation of these genes. This observation contrasts with the typical gene-silencing role of siRNAs. Finally, by analyzing C. elegans wild isolates and lab reference strains, we demonstrate that PALS-22 regulates the expression of several germline AGOs, affecting germline mortality and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In summary, PALS-22 is a key genetic node that balances the trade-off between immunity and germline health by modulating the functions of different AGOs, thereby shaping the outputs of the RNAi machinery and the dynamics of epigenetic inheritance.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

SUN1 and ALLAN form a unique complex, detected by live-cell imaging, ultrastructural expansion microscopy, and interactomics. Deletion of either SUN1 or ALLAN gene disrupts nuclear MTOC organization, leading to basal body mis-segregation, defective spindle assembly, and impaired kinetochore attachment, but axoneme formation remains intact. Ultrastructural analysis revealed nuclear and cytoplasmic MTOC miscoordination, producing aberrant flagellated gametes lacking nuclear material. Sun1 deletion also alters parasite lipid composition, underscoring its role in NE homeostasis. These defects block parasite development in the mosquito and transmission, highlighting the essential functions of this complex. This study reveals a bipartite MTOC and a highly divergent mechanism of NE remodelling during Plasmodium male gametogenesis. The SUN1-ALLAN complex is an unusual adaptation of the LINC complex, in absence of canonical KASH-domain proteins in Plasmodium, providing new insights into the evolution of closed mitosis and highlighting potential targets for blocking malaria transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

However, the underlying cis-regulatory genetic factors that contribute to heterogeneity in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and their impact on clinical phenotypes remain enigmatic. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to quantify genetic contributions to cis-regulatory variation in 361,119 peripheral blood mononuclear cells across 63 COVID-19 patients during acute infection, 39 samples collected in the convalescent phase, and 106 healthy controls. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping across cell types within each disease state group revealed thousands of cis-associated variants, of which hundreds were detected exclusively in immune cells derived from acute COVID-19 patients. Patient-specific genetic effects dissipated as infection resolved, suggesting that distinct gene regulatory networks are at play in the active infection state. Further, 17.2% of tested loci demonstrated significant cell state interactions with genotype, with pathways related to interferon responses and oxidative phosphorylation showing pronounced cell state-dependent variation, predominantly in CD14+ monocytes. Overall, we estimate that 25.6% of tested genes exhibit gene-environment interaction effects, highlighting the importance of environmental modifiers in the transcriptional regulation of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings underscore the importance of expanding the study of regulatory variation to relevant cell types and disease contexts and argue for the existence of extensive gene-environment effects among patients responding to an infection.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

Our high-resolution cryoEM structure reveals that PITHD1 simultaneously blocks three crucial functional sites on the 19S regulatory particle which are required for ubiquitin recognition, processing, and substrate translocation. This triple-lock mechanism effectively prevents protein degradation in dormant cells. Given PITHD1s evolutionary conservation across species, this mechanism likely represents a general strategy for reversible proteasome regulation during cellular dormancy.

However, these co-expression networks must be interpreted with caution, as they can arise from multiple processes. Here, we show that hybridization and gene flow between populations can greatly modify co-expression networks. Admixture between populations produces correlated expression between genes experiencing linkage disequilibrium. This correlated expression does not reflect functional relationships between genes, but rather depends on migration rates and physical linkage on chromosomes. Given the prevalence of gene flow between divergent populations in nature, these introgression effects likely represent a significant force in network evolution, even in populations where hybridization is historical rather than contemporary. These findings emphasize the critical importance of considering both evolutionary history and genomic architecture when analyzing gene co-expression networks in natural populations.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

Besides the commonly used Agrobacterium strains, Rhizobium rhizogenes can also introduce foreign DNA into host plants for gene expression. While many R. rhizogenes strains have been known for inducing hairy root symptoms, their use for transient expression has not been fully explored. Here, we showed that R. rhizogenes A4 outperformed all other tested agrobacterial strains in agroinfiltration experiments on leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana and other solanaceous plants. By conducting an agroinfiltration screening in N. benthamiana leaves using various agrobacterial strains carrying the RUBY reporter gene cassette, we discovered that A4 mediates the strongest and fastest transient expression. Utilizing the genomic information, we developed a collection of disarmed and modified strains derived from A4. By performing vacuum infiltration assays, we demonstrated that these A4-derived strains efficiently transiently transform 6-week-old N. benthamiana leaves, showing less sensitivity to the age of plants compared to the laboratory strain GV3101. Furthermore, we performed agroinfiltration using AS109, an A4-derived disarmed strain, on the leaves of tomato, pepper, and eggplant. Remarkably, AS109 mediated transient gene expression on tested solanaceous plants more effectively than all the tested commonly used agrobacterial strains. This discovery paves the way for establishing R. rhizogenes A4-derived strains as a new option for enhancing transient expression in N. benthamiana and facilitating the functional study of plant genes in other solanaceous species.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

They are an important tool for understanding both the spread of epidemics as well as long-term macroevolutionary trends in speciation and extinction. In particular, phylodynamic methods based on multi-type birth-death models have been used to infer the evolution of discrete traits, the movement of individuals or pathogens between geographic locations or host types, and the transition of infected individuals between disease stages. In these models, population heterogeneity is treated by assigning individuals to different discrete types. Typically, methods which allow inference of parameters under multi-type birth-death models integrate over the possible birth-death trajectories (i.e. the type-specific population size functions) to reduce the computational demands of the inference. As a result, it has not been possible to use these methods to directly infer the dynamics of trait-specific population sizes, infected host counts or other such demographic quantities. In this paper we present a method which infers these multi-type trajectories with almost no additional computational cost beyond that of existing methods. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach by applying it to a previously-published set of MERS-CoV genomes, inferring the numbers of human and camel cases through time, together with the number and timing of spillovers from the camel reservoir. This application highlights the multi-type population trajectorys ability to elucidate properties of the population which are not directly ancestral to its sampled members.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

In this study, we present a high-resolution structure of the CP in the ciliary tip of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila and identify several tip proteins that bind and form unique patterns on both microtubules of the tip CP. Two of those proteins that contain tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP)-like domains, TLP1 and TLP2, bind to high curvature regions of the microtubule. TLP2, which contains two TPPP-like domains, is an unusually long protein that wraps laterally around half a microtubule and forms the bridge between the two microtubules. Moreover, we found that the conserved protein SPEF1 binds to both microtubule seams. In vitro, human SPEF1 not only binds to the microtubule seam but also crosslinks two parallel microtubules. Single-molecule microtubule dynamics assays indicate that SPEF1 stabilizes microtubules in vitro. Together, these data show that the proteins in the tip CP maintain stable microtubule structure and probably play important roles in maintaining the integrity of the axoneme.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

These models aggregate individuals into compartments, often stratified by characteristics to represent groups that might be intervention targets or otherwise of particular concern. Ideally, model calculation could occur at the most demanding resolution for the overall analysis, but this may be infeasible due to availability of computational resources or empirical data. Instead, detailed population age-structure might be consolidated into broad categories such as children, working-age adults, and seniors. Researchers must then discretise key epidemic parameters, like the infection-fatality ratio, for these lower resolution groups. After estimating outcomes for those crude groups, follow on analyses, such as calculating years of life lost (YLLs), may need to distribute or weight those low-resolution outcomes back to the high resolution. The specific calculation for these aggregation and disaggregation steps can substantially influence outcomes. To assist researchers with these tasks, we developed paramix, an R package which simplifies the transformations between high and low resolution. We demonstrate applying paramix to a common discretisation analysis: using age structured models for health economic calculations comparing YLLs. We compare how estimates vary between paramix and several alternatives for an archetypal model, including comparison to a high resolution benchmark. We consistently found that paramix yielded the most similar estimates to the high-resolution model, for the same computational burden of low-resolution models. In our illustrative analysis, the non-paramix methods estimated up to twice as many YLLs averted as the paramix approach, which would likely lead to a similarly large impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios used in economic evaluations.","NA","medrxiv",1733522965941

In contrast with this view, here we show that cells exposed to micropatterned fibronectin gradients exhibit a complex repertoire of trajectories, including directed haptotactic migration up the gradient but also linear oscillations and circles with extended periods of migration down the gradient. To explain this behavior, we developed a biophysical model of haptotactic cell migration based on a coarse-grained molecular clutch model coupled to persistent stochastic polarity dynamics. While initial haptotactic migration is explained by the differential friction at the front and back of the cell, the observed complex trajectories over longer time scales arise from the interplay between differential friction, persistence, and physical confinement. Overall, our study reveals that confinement and persistence modulate the ability of cells to sense and respond to haptotactic cues and provides a framework to understand how cells navigate complex environments.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

Regrettably, this was accomplished only for individual, tissue-dissociated cells. High-plex spatial biology has begun to recover the x, y, and z-coordinates of single-cells, but typically at the expense of far less than whole transcriptome coverage. To solve this problem, Bruker Spatial Biology has accomplished a commercial-grade panel (CosMx(R) Spatial Molecular Imager Whole Transcriptome Panel (WTx)), using 37,872 imaging barcodes, capable of sub-cellular imaging of the entire human protein-coding transcriptome. The imaging barcodes are encoded with 156 bits of information (4 on-cycles and 35 dark-cycles per code), at a Hamming Distance of 4 from each other to achieve a very low false-code detection. Key to achieving this high-plex capability was the ability to manufacture imaging barcodes that require no in-tissue amplification (every barcode is manufactured under GMP to contain exactly 30 fluorescent dyes) and uniform, size-exclusion purified, extremely small imaging barcodes ([~] 20 nm). A detailed study of six different human FFPE tissue types was performed (Colon, Pancreas, Hippocampus, Skin, Breast, Kidney), yielding over 5.4 billion transcripts from 2.7 million cells. We counted over 1,550 transcripts-per-cell on average and observed 900 unique genes per cell (measured as the median). Single fixed-cells containing well over 10,000 subcellularly imaged transcripts were accomplished. Advancing single-cell imaging to the whole transcriptome level opens a single unified approach to accomplish essentially all single-cell experiments, both imaging and non-imaging. Depending upon the sample type (e.g. fixed-cells, organoids, tissue sections, etc.), the transcripts per cell and genes per cell measured using the whole transcriptome panel often exceeds that obtained by the highest-resolution single-cell RNA-seq, can be performed on a single 5 {micro}m FFPE tissue section, with no dissociation bias (every cell is counted). Pathway analysis within the tumor bed of a colon adenocarcinoma sample found evidence of enrichment in pathways suggestive of an aggressive tumor type, and localized ligand-receptor analysis showed spatially restricted patterns related to adhesion, migration, and proliferation. The high-dimensional whole transcriptome data is streamed directly to a cloud-based Spatial Informatics Platform, allowing for the scalable processing of millions-of-single-cells and billions-of-transcripts per operation. The WTx data are combined with high-resolution antibody-based cell-morphology imaging and data-driven machine-learning cell segmentation algorithms, to generate the most complete view of single cell and sub-cellular spatial biology that has ever been obtained.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

This report describes endogenous zebrafish hand2 Cre and CreERT2 drivers generated with GeneWeld CRISPR-Cas9 precision targeted integration. Results: hand2-2A-cre and hand2-2A-creERT2 knock-ins crossed with ubiquitous loxP-based Switch reporters led to broad labeling in expected mesodermal and neural crest-derived lineages in branchial arches, cardiac, fin, liver, intestine, and mesothelial tissues, as well as enteric neurons. Novel patterns of hand2 lineage tracing appeared in venous blood vessels. CreERT2 induction at 24 hours reveals late emerging hand2 progenitors in the 24-48 hour embryo contribute to the venous and intestinal vasculature. Induction in 3 dpf larva restricts hand2 lineage labeling to mesoderm-derived components of the branchial arches, heart, liver and enteric neurons. Conclusions: hand2 progenitors from the lateral plate mesoderm and ectoderm contribute to numerous lineages in the developing embryo. Later emerging hand2 progenitors become restricted to a subset of lineages in the larva. The hand2 Cre and CreERT2 drivers establish critical new tools to investigate hand2 lineages in zebrafish embryogenesis and larval organogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

Here, we introduce Genomic Network Analysis (GNA), an analytic framework that applies the principles of network modelling to estimates of genetic overlap derived from genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. The result is a genomic network that describes the conditionally independent genetic associations between traits that remain when controlling for shared signal with the broader network of traits. Graph theory metrics provide added insight by formally quantifying the most important traits in the genomic network. GNA can discover additional trait-specific pathways by incorporating gene expression or genetic variants into the network to estimate their conditional associations with each trait. Extensive simulations establish GNA is well-powered for most GWAS. Application to a diverse set of traits demonstrate that GNA yields critical insight into the genetic architecture that demarcate genetically overlapping traits at varying levels of biological granularity.","NA","medrxiv",1733522965941

In PDAC, both cell types stimulate macropinocytosis as an adaptive response to glutamine depletion. CAFs play a critical role in sculpting the tumor microenvironment, yet how adaptations to metabolic stress impact the stromal architecture remains elusive. In this study, we find that macropinocytosis functions to control CAF subtype identity when glutamine is limiting. Our data demonstrate that metabolic stress leads to an intrinsic inflammatory CAF (iCAF) program driven by MEK/ERK signaling. Utilizing in vivo models, we find that blocking macropinocytosis alters CAF subtypes and reorganizes the tumor stroma. Importantly, these changes in stromal architecture can be exploited to sensitize PDAC to immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

Current rapid rewarming methods are unreliable at maintaining water temperature between the gold standard range of 37{degrees}C and 39{degrees}C. However, immersion circulators can precisely maintain this temperature range throughout rewarming, potentially leading to better patient outcomes following frostbite injury. In-vitro rewarming trials were conducted using frozen wild boar (Sus scrofa) legs to evaluate 3 rewarming methods: sink and faucet, bucket, and immersion circulator. Porcine leg temperature and water temperature were measured every minute over the 30 minute duration of each trial. The immersion circulator method proved to be the most efficient at reaching the target tissue temperature (9 minutes) while maintaining the least variability in water temperature (0% of time spent below 37{degrees}C).

Posttranscriptional Q/R editing of GluA2 renders AMPARs nearly impermeable to calcium ions, which is crucial for their normal function. Although previous studies have characterized conductivity and selectivity differences between edited and unedited GluA2 variants and heteromeric receptors incorporating GluA2, the atomistic mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigate ion permeation in the context of multiple Ca2+ binding sites along the pore predicted from MD simulations, considering both mutations and co-permeating monovalent ions. Patch clamp electrophysiology recordings confirmed a binding site at the intracellular mouth of the selectivity filter that confers selectivity for calcium over monovalent ions. A patient mutation at the same site has been previously shown to cause neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Furthermore, MD simulations of GluA2 with different arginine copy number at the Q/R site show that Ca2+ conduction is blocked in the presence of two arginines, whereas K+ is only blocked by four arginines, in explaining the results from decades of electrophysiological work. Finally, MD simulations revealed that Ca2+ reduces K+ conduction by preferentially occupying the intracellular SF binding site, whereas Na+ does not. This result is consistent with electrophysiological results from the D590 mutants, and suggests that divalent binding in the selectivity filter is a major determinant of AMPAR conductance.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

Typhi) invasion from the gut lumen. Transmission between people occurs through ingestion of contaminated food and water, particularly in settings with poor water and sanitation infrastructure, resulting in over 10 million illnesses annually. As the pathogen invades via the gastrointestinal tract, it is plausible that the gut microbiome may influence the outcome of S. Typhi exposure. There is some evidence that bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) may create an environment unfavourable to invasive Salmonella, but data from humans is limited.

To investigate the association between gut microbiome and typhoid fever, we analysed samples collected from three all-age cohorts enrolled in a prospective surveillance study conducted across three settings where typhoid fever is endemic (Dhaka, Bangladesh; Blantyre, Malawi; and Kathmandu, Nepal). Cohorts consisted of acute typhoid fever patients (n=92), asymptomatic household contacts of typhoid fever patients (representing individuals who were likely exposed to S. Typhi but did not develop disease, n=97), and asymptomatic serosurvey participants with high Vi antibody titres (representing individuals who were exposed to S. Typhi and may be carriers, n=69). The stool microbiomes of each cohort were characterised using shotgun metagenomics, and bacterial diversity, composition, and function were compared.

We identified 4 bacterial species that were significantly lower in abundance in typhoid fever patients compared with household contacts (i.e. probably exposed), in two of the three participant populations (Bangladesh and Malawi). These bacteria may represent taxa that provide protection against development of clinical infection upon exposure to S. Typhi, and include the inflammation-associated species Prevotella copri clade A and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Our functional analysis identified 28 specific metabolic gene clusters (MGCs) negatively associated with typhoid fever in Bangladesh and Malawi, including seven MGCs involved in SCFA metabolism. The putative protection provided by microbiome SCFA metabolism was supported by data from a controlled human infection model conducted in a UK population, in which participants who did not develop typhoid fever following ingestion of S. Typhi had higher abundance of a putative SCFA-metabolising MGC (q-value = 0.22).

This study identified the same protective associations between taxonomic and functional microbiota characteristics and non-susceptibility to typhoid fever across multiple human populations. Future research should explore the potential functional role of SCFAs and inflammation-associated bacteria in resistance to S. Typhi and other enteric infections.","NA","medrxiv",1733522965941

However, little is known about what causes macrophages to choose trogocytosis versus phagocytosis. Here, we report that cortical tension of target cells is a key regulator of macrophage trogocytosis. At low tension, macrophages will preferentially trogocytose antibody-opsonized cells, while at high tension they tend towards phagocytosis. Using model vesicles, we demonstrate that macrophages will rapidly switch from trogocytosis to phagocytosis when membrane tension is increased. Stiffening the cortex of target cells also biases macrophages to phagocytose them, a trend that can be countered by increasing antibody surface density and is captured in a mechanical model of trogocytosis. This work suggests that a distinct molecular pathway for trogocytosis is not required to explain differences in trogocytosis among target cell types and points to a mechanism for target cells to modulate trogocytosis.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

We found that traditional blotting methods of sample preparation were inadequate, and high-pressure freezing plus focused ion beam milling was essential to maintain condensate integrity. To identify densely packed molecules within the condensate, we integrated deep learning-based segmentation with novel context-aware template matching. Our approaches were developed on chromatin condensates, and were also effective on condensed regions of in situ native chromatin. Using these methods, we determined the average structure of nucleosomes to 6.1 and 12 [A] resolution in reconstituted and native systems, respectively, and found that nucleosomes have a nearly random orientation distribution in both cases.

Two current issues with RTC is that it scales as O(N^2) making it inefficient at high frame counts, and the clustering results are dependent on the order of the input frames. To address the first issue, we have increased the speed of the seed selection by using k-means++ to select the seeds of the available frames. To address the second issue and make the results invariant with respect to frame ordering, whenever there is a tie in the most populated cluster, the densest and most compact cluster is chosen using the extended similarity indices.

Current vaccines have limitations, including an increased risk of severe dengue in seronegative individuals and moderate efficacy, highlighting the need for more effective solutions. Our study aimed to design a multi-serotype Dengue virus vaccine using a computational approach to achieve broad-spectrum immunity. We employed advanced computational tools and algorithms to predict B-cell and T-cell epitopes, ensuring the selection of antigenic targets that provide comprehensive protection against all four serotypes. The methodology included tools for B-cell epitope prediction, tools for MHC class II and I peptide predictions, and tools for toxicity and allergenicity screening to ensure the safety of the vaccine candidates. Our results identified 21 B-cell epitopes, 15 CTL peptides, and 12 HTL peptides, validated for safety regarding toxicity and allergenic potential. The vaccine construct incorporated the adjuvant {beta}-defensin-3 and specific linkers to enhance immunogenicity and stability. Tertiary structure prediction, Ramachandran plot analysis, and stereochemical examination confirmed the stability and quality of the vaccine model. These findings demonstrate the potential of computational methods in addressing the complex challenges of Dengue virus vaccine development.

Microglia are brain-resident professional phagocytes that play important roles in neural circuit development including as primary effectors of efferocytosis. While the mechanisms through which microglia recognize potential phagocytic cargo are widely studied, the lysosomal mechanisms that are necessary for efficient digestion are less well defined. Here we show that the lysosomal protease cathepsin B promotes microglial efferocytosis of neurons and restricts the accumulation of apoptotic cells during brain development. We show that cathepsin B is microglia-specific and enriched in brain regions where neuronal turnover is high in both zebrafish and mouse. Myeloid-specific cathepsin B knockdown in zebrafish led to dysmorphic microglia containing undigested dead cells, as well as an accumulation of dead cells in surrounding tissue. These effects where phenocopied in mice globally deficient for Ctsb using markers for apoptosis. We also observed behavioral impairments in both models. Live imaging studies in zebrafish revealed deficits in phagolysosomal fusion and acidification, and live imaging of cultured mouse microglia reveal delayed phagocytosis consistent with impairments in digestion and resolution of phagocytosis rather than initial uptake.

Recently, a wealth of public single-cell RNA sequencing data as well as rapid scaling of self-supervised learning methods have provided new avenues to address this longstanding challenge. However, rapid parameter scaling has been essential to the success of large language models in text and images, while similar scaling has not been attempted with Transformer architectures for cellular modeling. To produce accurate, transferable, and biologically meaningful representations of cellular systems, we develop AIDO.Cell, a pretrained module for representing gene expression and cellular systems in an AI-driven Digital Organism [1]. AIDO.Cell contains a series of 3M, 10M, 100M, and 650M parameter encoder-only dense Transformer models pre-trained on 50 million human cells from diverse tissues using a read-depth-aware masked gene expression pretraining objective. Unlike previous models, AIDO.Cell is capable of handling the entire human transcriptome as input without truncation or sampling tricks, thus learning accurate and general representations of the human cells entire transcriptional context. This pretraining with a longer context was enabled through FlashAttention-2, mixed precision, and large-scale distributed systems training. AIDO.Cell (100M) achieves state-of-the-art results in tasks such as zero-shot clustering, cell-type classification, and perturbation modeling. Our findings reveal interesting loss scaling behaviors as we increase AIDO.Cells parameters from 3M to 650M, providing insights for future directions in single-cell modeling.

Mast cells regulate gastrointestinal (GI) function by controlling vascular and epithelial permeability, and interacting with the immune system and the enteric nervous system. Mucosal (MCT) and connective tissue (MCTC) mast cells coexist in the gastrointestinal tract, but are located in distinct microanatomical niches. However, little is known about the transcriptional heterogeneity of human intestinal mast cells. Additionally, whether distinct microanatomical niches instruct mast cell phenotypes in the human gut is currently unknown. We therefore performed 10x single cell RNA sequencing on healthy rectal biopsies and on dissected layers of human sigmoid colon. We identified five transcriptionally distinct mast cell subsets (MC1-5) which exhibited a layer-specific distribution in the healthy human colon and distinct cytokine, chemokine, protease, and transcription factor profiles, and were associated with putative immune and neuro-immune functions. This study provides a framework for the integration of mast cell heterogeneity in the study of gastrointestinal disease mechanisms in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

In early 2024, a surge in acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC), also referred as red eye disease, was observed in coastal Kenya, prompting the Ministry of Health to issue an outbreak alert. Herein, we investigated the etiology of this outbreak. Methods. Ocular swabs were obtained from 13 individuals presenting with AHC at a Mombasa clinic in early February 2024. Ten of these were analyzed using bacterial cultures, and all 13 using a pan-adenovirus quantitative PCR (qPCR) and metagenomic sequencing. Potential viral etiology was confirmed by a specific qPCR, amplicon sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Results. Bacterial cultures yielded no growth except in three samples where non-pathogenic bacteria were detected. All 13 samples were adenovirus qPCR negative. Metagenomic sequencing detected coxsackievirus A24 variant (CA24v) in three of the 13 samples. CA24v detections were confirmed by both CA24v specific qPCR and amplicon sequencing of an approximately 450 nucleotide long VP4/2 junction genomic region. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP4/2 sequences showed that they were closely related to CA24v genotype IV. Conclusion. The AHC epidemic in coastal Kenya in early 2024 was likely caused by CA24v. Metagenomic sequencing is a powerful tool for identifying potential causative agents of new disease outbreaks.","NA","medrxiv",1733522965941

Under challenging environmental conditions, such as low temperatures and high light intensities, plants need to immediately adjust their metabolism to prevent irreversible tissue damage, e.g., caused by reactive oxygen species. Regulation of photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism plays a crucial role in this stress response. Here, we analysed mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, which were affected in either central enzymatic activities of carbohydrate metabolism, in chloroplast positioning or in a combination of both. Plants were exposed to a treatment of combined cold and elevated light. While mutants with deficiencies in sucrose (spsa1) or starch (pgm1) metabolism showed affected metabolic pathway regulation under abiotic stress, Hexokinase 1 mutants (hxk1) showed a severe growth phenotype with lesions and pale areas on leaf tissue. In a double mutant, which combined deficiencies in Chloroplast Unusual Positioning 1 (CHUP1)-mediated chloroplast positioning and HXK1 (chup1 x hxk1), this growth phenotype vanished resulting in wild type-like plants. Transcriptome analysis revealed a significantly affected immune response of hxk1 plants, which was suppressed in the double mutants. Our findings provide evidence for a role of HXK1 as a positive regulator of the plant immune response. Finally, we suggest that, due to its potential role as a negative regulator of plant immunity, CHUP1 deficiency counteracted the reduced immunity of hxk1 in the double mutant which rescued the plants. Future studies might now reveal whether deficiencies in CHUP1 function and/or transcription represent a conserved strategy to increase plant immunity under abiotic stress.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

While some types of floral traits, such as flower color, are well-characterized, other types of complex morphologies remain understudied. One example is occluded personate flowers, dorso-ventrally compressed flowers with obstructed floral passageways, which have evolved in multiple genera, but have only been characterized from snapdragon. Our study examined the morphological basis and evolutionary history of personate flowers in a clade of Penstemon species that includes three personate-flowered species. We characterized floral morphology and inferred phylogenomic relationships for 13 species in this group in order to examine the evolutionary history of personate flowers. We used phylogenomic tests for introgression to examine whether personate-flowered lineages have a history of introgression. Unlike the personate flowers of snapdragon, personate flowers in Penstemon are produced by deep pleats in the ventral petal tissue that curve the ventral petal surface upwards, obstructing the floral tube opening. Our phylogenetic tree suggests that personate flowers evolved in two separate lineages. Phylogenomic analyses indicate incomplete lineage sorting and introgression between certain taxa have contributed to phylogenomic discordance, however we found little evidence of recent introgression between the two personate-flowered lineages. The evolution of personate flowers in Penstemon involves a distinct morphological basis than snapdragon. Personate flowers have evolved multiple times in Penstemon on a rapid evolutionary timescale. The source of genetic variation for repeated shifts may be de novo mutations or pre-existing variants.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

Using a novel analytic method to annotate natural speech recordings, we identify a low-frequency rate of IUs across the sample, with a peak at 0.6 Hz, and little variation between sexes or across the life span. We find that IU rate is only weakly related to speech rate quantified at the syllable level (SR), and crucially, that cross-linguistic variation in IU rate is smaller than cross-linguistic variation in SR. Since SR was shown to be inversely related to information density quantified at the syllable level, we suggest that across languages, IUs are more balanced than syllables in their information content.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

At the same time, these new capabilities are creating potential biosecurity challenges by providing new pathways to intentional or accidental synthesis of genes that encode hazardous proteins. The synthesis of nucleic acids is a key choke point in the AI-assisted protein engineering pipeline as it is where digital designs are transformed into physical instructions that can produce potentially harmful proteins. Thus, one focus for efforts to enhance biosecurity in the face of new AI-enabled capabilities is on bolstering the screening of orders by nucleic acid synthesis providers. We describe a multistakeholder, cross-sector effort to address biosecurity challenges with uses of AI-powered biological design tools to reformulate naturally occurring proteins of concern to create synthetic homologs that have low sequence identity to the wild-type proteins. We evaluated the abilities of traditional nucleic acid biosecurity screening tools to detect these synthetic homologs and found that, of tools tested, not all could previously detect such AI-redesigned sequences reliably. However, as we report, patches were built and deployed to improve detection rates over the course of the project, resulting in a final mean detection rate over tools of 97% of the synthetic homologs that were determined, using in-silico metrics, to be more likely to retain wild-type-like function. Finally, we make recommendations on approaches for studying and addressing the rising risk of adversarial AI-assisted protein engineering attacks like the one we identified and worked to mitigate.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

However, current methods often rely on PCR amplification for enrichment of marker genes. PCR can introduce significant biases that affect quantification and is typically restricted to one target loci at a time, limiting the diversity that can be captured in a single reaction. Here, we address these issues by using Cas9 to enrich marker genes for long-read nanopore sequencing directly from a DNA sample, removing the need for PCR. We show that this approach can effectively isolate a 4.5 kb region covering partial 18S and 28S rRNA genes and the ITS region in a mixed nematode community, and further adapt our approach for characterising a diverse microbial community. We demonstrate the ability for Cas9-based enrichment to support multiplexed targeting of several different DNA regions simultaneously, enabling optimal marker gene selection for different clades of interest within a sample. We also find a strong correlation between input DNA concentrations and output read proportions for mixed-species samples, demonstrating the ability for quantification of relative species abundance. This study lays a foundation for targeted long-read sequencing to more fully capture the diversity of organisms present in complex environments.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

They develop either from embryonic precursors or from circulating monocytes, and their functions are in part dictated by their origin. We previously observed robust monocyte recruitment and contribution to the macrophage pool in brown adipose tissue. In particular, monocytes were predicted to give rise to two phenotypically distinct macrophage subsets identifiable by CD206 or CD226 expression. In the present study, we investigated monocyte differentiation pathways in brown adipose tissue and the function of monocyte-derived macrophages. We found that monocytes highly contributed to the CD226+ macrophage population while the CD206+ population arise from embryonic origin. Fate mapping analysis revealed a low contribution of GMP- and a high contribution of MDP-derived monocytes to the CD226+ macrophage subset. Importantly, adoptive transfer experiments demonstrate that MDP- but not GMP-derived monocytes are pre-conditioned to give rise to CD226+ macrophages. Using meta-analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing data, we found that MDP-derived CD226+ macrophages were present in several tissues including peritoneal cavity, adrenal glands and all adipose depots, with a particular enrichment in beige and brown fat. A similar macrophage subset was identified in humans. Functionally, while depletion of CD206+ macrophages using anti-CD115 blocking antibodies led to decreased adipose triglyceride content, genetic depletion of CD226+ macrophages caused the opposite phenotype. We thus identify CD226+ MDP-derived macrophages as a new myeloid cell type conserved across tissues and tied to lipid metabolism homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965941

This chaperone function is critically important to proteostasis, conserved across all kingdoms of life, and associated with various protein misfolding diseases in humans4,5. Mechanistic insights into how sHSPs sequester destabilized clients have been limited due to the extreme molecular plasticity and client-induced polydispersity of sHSP/client complexes6-8. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the sHSP from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (mjHSP16.5) in both the apo-state and in an ensemble of client-bound states. The ensemble not only reveals key molecular mechanisms by which sHSPs respond to and sequester client proteins, but also provides insights into the cooperative nature of chaperone-client interactions. Engagement with destabilized client induces a polarization of stability across the mjHSP16.5 scaffold, proposed to facilitate higher-order assembly and enhance client sequestration capacity. Some higher-order sHSP oligomers appear to form through simple insertion of dimeric subunits into new geometrical features, while other higher-order states suggest multiple sHSP/client assembly pathways.

Here, we present the results of an ME/CFS and Long COVID treatment survey with responses from 3,925 patients. We assessed the experiences of these patients with more than 150 treatments, as well as their demographics, symptoms, and comorbidities. Patients with each condition who participated in the study shared similar symptom profiles, including all the core symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g., 89.7% of ME/CFS and 79.4% of Long COVID reported post-exertional malaise (PEM). Treatments with the greatest perceived benefits were identified, which had varied effects on different core symptoms. In addition, treatment responses were significantly correlated (R{superscript 2} = 0.68) between the two patient groups. Patient subgroups with distinct profiles of symptoms and comorbidities showed varied responses to treatments, e.g., a POTS-dominant cluster benefiting from autonomic modulators and a cognitive-dysfunction cluster from CNS stimulants.

Here, we report on the identification of a previously unrecognized property of MYOD as repressor of gene expression, via E-box-independent chromatin binding within accessible genomic elements, which invariably leads to reduced chromatin accessibility. MYOD-mediated repression requires the integrity of functional domains previously implicated in MYOD-mediated activation of gene expression. Repression of mitogen- and growth factor-responsive genes occurs through promoter binding and requires a highly conserved domain within the first helix. Repression of cell-of-origin/alternative lineage genes occurs via binding and decommissioning of distal regulatory elements, such as super-enhancers (SE), which requires the N-terminal activation domain as well as two chromatin-remodeling domains and leads to reduced strength of CTCF-mediated chromatin interactions. Surprisingly, MYOD-mediated chromatin compaction and repression of transcription do not associate with reduction of H3K27ac, the conventional histone mark of enhancer or promoter activation, but with reduced levels of the recently discovered histone H4 acetyl-methyl lysine modification (Kacme). These results extend MYOD biological properties beyond the current dogma that restricts MYOD function to a monotone transcriptional activator and reveal a previously unrecognized functional versatility arising from an alternative chromatin recruitment through E-box or non-E-box sequences. The E-box independent repression of gene expression by MYOD might provide a promiscuous mechanism to reduce chromatin accessibility and repress cell-of-origin/alternative lineage and growth factor/mitogen-responsive genes to safeguard the integrity of cell identity during muscle progenitor commitment toward the myogenic lineage.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

We report herein the isolation of a human monoclonal antibody with a broad but incomplete SARS-CoV-2 neutralization profile, but structural analyses and mutational scanning led to the engineering of variants that resulted in greater antibody flexibility while binding to the viral spike.

However, protein function is mediated by many modalities, and simultaneously generating multiple modalities remains a challenge. We propose PLAID (Protein Latent Induced Diffusion), a method for multimodal protein generation that learns and samples from the latent space of a predictor, mapping from a more abundant data modality (e.g., sequence) to a less abundant one (e.g., crystallography structure). Specifically, we address the all-atom structure generation setting, which requires producing both the 3D structure and 1D sequence to define side-chain atom placements. Importantly, PLAID only requires sequence inputs to obtain latent representations during training, enabling the use of sequence databases for generative model training and augmenting the data distribution by 2 to 4 orders of magnitude compared to experimental structure databases. Sequence-only training also allows access to more annotations for conditioning generation. As a demonstration, we use compositional conditioning on 2,219 functions from Gene Ontology and 3,617 organisms across the tree of life. Despite not using structure inputs during training, generated samples exhibit strong structural quality and consistency. Function-conditioned generations learn side-chain residue identities and atomic positions at active sites, as well as hydrophobicity patterns of transmembrane proteins, while maintaining overall sequence diversity.

Understanding how cellular events such as these are coordinated across organ scales remains a challenge in developmental biology. In Arabidopsis, polarised proteins guide the asymmetric divisions in the early stomatal lineage. These proteins show organ scale alignment and may be sensitive to mechanical stress [2]. In contrast, what determines the orientation and alignment of the critical final division is unknown [3]. Here we use an artificial system where every cell adopts the fate of a stomata pore [4] making it easy to visualise their alignment. Combining this system with simultaneous time-lapse imaging on both sides of the cotyledon we are able to compare the stomatal orientation relative to the organ axis, the cell major axis, and the principal directions of growth. Using finite element modelling on a realistic template enabled us to identify differential growth-derived stress patterns as a factor coordinating stomata division at the organ scale.

It is widely accepted that the spread of this language family across Europe from the 5th millennium BP correlates with the expansion and diversification of steppe-related genetic ancestry from the onset of the Bronze Age6,7. However, multiple steppe-derived populations co-existed in Europe during this period, and it remains unclear how these populations diverged and which provided the demographic channels for the ancestral forms of the Italic, Celtic, Greek, and Armenian languages8,9. To investigate the ancestral histories of Indo-European-speaking groups in Southern Europe, we sequenced genomes from 314 ancient individuals from the Mediterranean and surrounding regions, spanning from 5,200 BP to 2,100 BP, and co-analysed these with published genome data. We additionally conducted strontium isotope analyses on 224 of these individuals. We find a deep east-west divide of steppe ancestry in Southern Europe during the Bronze Age. Specifically, we show that the arrival of steppe ancestry in Spain, France, and Italy was mediated by Bell Beaker (BB) populations of Western Europe, likely contributing to the emergence of the Italic and Celtic languages. In contrast, Armenian and Greek populations acquired steppe ancestry directly from Yamnaya groups of Eastern Europe. These results are consistent with the linguistic Italo-Celtic10,11 and Graeco-Armenian1,12,13 hypotheses accounting for the origins of most Mediterranean Indo-European languages of Classical Antiquity. Our findings thus align with specific linguistic divergence models for the Indo-European language family while contradicting others. This underlines the power of ancient DNA in uncovering prehistoric diversifications of human populations and language communities.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

We show that, at the cellular level, dietary adaptations are primarily driven by anterior enterocytes, and that both the relative abundance and gene expression profiles of these cells have evolved in response to rapid dietary specializations.

The relative importance of standing genetic variation vs. de novo mutations in adaptation remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Selection during domestication has been long used as a model to understand evolutionary processes, providing information not only on the phenotypes selected but also, in many cases, an understanding of the causal loci. Of the multiple causal loci that have been identified in maize, the selected allele can be found segregating in natural populations, consistent with their origin as standing genetic variation. The sole exception to this pattern is the well-characterized domestication locus tga1, which has long been thought to be an example of selection on a de novo mutation. Here, we use a large dataset of maize and teosinte genomes to reconstruct the origin and evolutionary history of tga1. We first estimated the age of tga1-maize using a genealogy-based method, finding that the allele arose approximately 41,000-49,000 years ago, predating the beginning of maize domestication. We also identify, for the first time, tga1-maize in teosinte populations, indicating the allele can survive in the wild. Finally, we compare observed patterns of haplotype structure and mutational age distributions near tga1 with simulations, finding that patterns near tga1 in maize better resemble those generated under simulated selective sweeps on standing variation. These multiple lines of evidence suggest that maize domestication likely drew upon standing genetic variation at tga1 and cement the importance of standing variation in driving adaptation during domestication.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

The recent approval of TCR-gene-edited T cells for cancer therapy demonstrates the therapeutic advantage of using pMHC recognition to eliminate cancer. However, identification and selection of TCRs from patient material is complex and influenced by the TCR repertoire of the donors used. To overcome these limitations, we here present a rapid and robust de novo binder design platform leveraging state-of-the-art generative models, including RFdiffusion, ProteinMPNN, and AlphaFold2, to engineer minibinders (miBds) targeting the cancer-associated pMHC complex, NY-ESO-1(157-165)/HLA-A*02:01. By incorporating in silico cross-panning and molecular dynamics simulations, we enhanced specificity screening to minimise off-target interactions. We identified a miBd that exhibited high specificity for the NY-ESO-1-derived peptide SLLMWITQC in complex with HLA-A*02:01 and minimal cross-reactivity in mammalian display assays. We further demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this miBd by integrating it into a chimeric antigen receptor, as de novo Binders for Immune-mediated Killing Engagers (BIKEs). BIKE-transduced T cells selectively and effectively killed NY-ESO-1+ melanoma cells compared to non-transduced controls, demonstrating the promise of this approach in precision cancer immunotherapy. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of generative protein design for accelerating the discovery of high-specificity pMHC-targeting therapeutics.

Not only do TF concentrations fluctuate in time and from cell to cell, in each cell the actual binding and unbinding of TFs to promoters is also stochastic. However, how this  noise propagation from TFs to their targets determines the expression fluctuations in target genes of the same TF has so far not been quantitatively characterized. Here we use fluorescence time-lapse microscopy in combination with microfluidics and automated image analysis to quantitatively track the single-cell growth and gene expression dynamics of different target promoters of the LexA SOS response regulator in E. coli under mild DNA damage induced by the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP).

We find that, at the single-cell level, LexA target promoters exhibit stochastic bursts in protein production with specific quantitative characteristics. First, the durations of protein production bursts are short, identical for all promoters, and independent of CIP levels. Second, the heights of the production peaks are exponentially distributed for each promoter, and independent of CIP level, but with different average heights for different promoters. Third, the frequency of the production bursts increases with CIP level for all promoters, but differs across promoters.

Importantly, we show that these observations are inconsistent with popular  equilibrium models of bacterial gene regulation that assume that the dynamics of binding and unbinding of TFs is fast relative to the time-scale of TF concentration fluctuations. Instead, all observations can be quantitatively fit by a relatively simple model in which DNA damage events lead to short transient dips in LexA concentration, and an expression burst occurs in a cell whenever LexA unbinds from the target promoter during such a short dip in LexA concentration. Moreover, because these transient dips in LexA concentration occur on the same time-scale as the stochastic unbinding of LexA from promoters, the response of a target promoter to an individual DNA damage event is stochastic and depends in a complex manner on the strengths of its LexA binding sites and the duration of the event. Consequently, the expression levels of different LexA target genes in a given cell reflect distinct statistics of the frequency and durations of DNA damage events in the recent history of that cell.

Our results show that, even in the simple scenario where a single TF is induced, different target promoters can exhibit distinct stochastic responses that depend on the precise kinetics of the induction events.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

In the case of ligand-gated ion channels, agonist binding triggers rapid transition through a series of intermediate states leading to a transient open-pore conformation. These transitions are usually framed in terms of a mechanism where agonist binding and channel activation are separate events. Here, we collect cryo-EM images over a range of agonist concentrations to define structures of the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in unliganded, mono-liganded, and di-liganded states. We show that agonist binding to a single agonist site stabilizes an intermediate state where an entire principal agonist-binding subunit has transitioned to an active-like conformation, while the other unoccupied principal subunit remains inactive, albeit poised for activation. Binding of agonist to the second agonist site fully activates the remaining subunits leading to hydration of the ion pore. Uniting this cryo-EM derived intermediate structure with single-channel recordings leads to a model where individual acetylcholine receptor subunits asynchronously undergo conformational transitions, and thus a sequential activation mechanism that has implications for the entire superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

These three loci, Teosinte crossing barrier 1 (Tcb1), Gametophytic factor 1 (Ga1), and Ga2, each play a key role in preventing hybridization between populations and are proposed to maintain the barrier between domesticated and wild subspecies. Each locus encodes a matching pair of silk- and pollen-active pectin methylesterases (PMEs). To investigate the diversity and molecular evolution of these gametophytic factor loci, we identified existing and improved models of the responsible genes in a new genome assembly which contains active versions of all three loci. We then examined fifty-two assembled genomes from seventeen species to classify haplotype diversity and identify sites under diversifying selection during the evolution of the causal genes. We show that Ga2, the oldest of these three loci, was duplicated to form Ga1 at least 12 million years ago. Tcb1, the youngest locus, arose as a duplicate of Ga1 before or around the time of diversification of the Zea genus. We find evidence of positive selection during evolution of the functional genes at an active site in the pollen-expressed PME and predicted surface sites in both the silk- and pollen-expressed PMEs. The most common allele at the Ga1 locus is a conserved ga1 allele (ga1-O), which is non-coding due to conserved stop codons in full-length gene copies that are between 610 thousand and 1.5 million years old. We show that the ga1-O allele is associated with and likely generates 24-nt siRNAs in developing pollen-producing tissue, and these siRNAs map to functional Ga1 alleles.

Taken together, this seems to be an example of a type of epigenetic trans-homolog silencing known as paramutation functioning at a locus controlling a reproductive barrier.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

Here, using experimental evolution, we show that the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae can adapt to freeze-thaw stress in a stereotyped manner, with survival increasing nearly two orders of magnitude from {approx}2% to {approx}70% in about 25 cycles of stress exposure. Adapted cells exhibit reduced membrane damage, smaller sizes, higher mass densities, and a lower prevalence of budding. Rheological measurements show that the adapted cells are stiffer and exhibit lower particle mobilities within the cytoplasm. Whole genome sequencing indicates that increased survival is not accompanied by specific (unique) genetic changes, but rather is associated with multiple, distinct genotypes. Concomitant with mechanical changes in the adapted cells, the basal intracellular level of trehalose, a sugar speculated to play a physical role in maintaining membrane and cytoplasmic integrity, exhibits a three-fold increase. Together, these cellular attributes strongly correlate with the entry of cells into a quiescence-like state. A quantitative model that incorporates selection based on cellular quiescence recapitulates the adaptation dynamics, i.e. increase in survival and trehalose levels, seen in experiments. Finally, we find that the evolved mechano-chemical phenotypes are similar even when we use qualitatively different freeze-thaw selection protocols for the evolution, hinting at a convergent adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

With the advance of population genomics, studies in diverse organisms revealed supergenes associated with a myriad of complex traits, ranging from morphology to sexual behavior, from butterfly wing patterns to floral morphs. Two supergenes have been described on non-homologous ""social chromosomes"" in two ant lineages, Solenopsis and Formica, that diverged more than 90 million years ago. In both lineages, the supergene is associated with social polymorphism, where some colonies are headed by a single queen (monogyne) while others harbor multiple queens (polygyne). We discovered a new supergene associated with similar social polymorphism in the desert ant Cataglyphis niger. Although Cataglyphis is more closely related to Formica than to Solenopsis, the social chromosome in C. niger is homologous to the Solenopsis social chromosome, with conservation of synteny in gene content as well as gene order. Therefore, this is an ancient chromosome dating back to the common ancestor of Solenopsis and Cataglyphis, at least 90 million years ago. Previous work dated the Solenopsis supergene to be only one million years old, therefore, we propose that the two supergenes have evolved independently in the two diverged lineages on this ancient social chromosome. We surveyed hymenopteran genomes to discover a bee chromosome homologous to the ants social chromosome. The conservation of the gene set on these homologous chromosomes in ants and bees suggests that this chromosome plays an important role in social behavior across social Hymenoptera. We hypothesize that the conserved gene set in the social chromosome was repeatedly used as a pre-adapted toolkit for the evolution of social traits in general and specifically in the evolution of polygyne social structure in ants.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

To counteract this, cells deploy dedicated silencing factors, such as the E3 ligase SIFI that terminates the mitochondrial stress response. How a single enzyme can sense stress across cells and elicit timely stress response inactivation is poorly understood. Here, we report the structure of human SIFI, which revealed how this 1.3MDa complex can target hundreds of proteins for accurate stress response silencing. SIFI attaches the first ubiquitin to substrates using flexible domains within an easily accessible scaffold, yet builds linkage-specific ubiquitin chains at distinct, sterically restricted elongation modules in its periphery. Ubiquitin handover via a ubiquitin-like domain couples versatile substrate modification to precise chain elongation. Stress response silencing therefore exploits a catalytic mechanism that is geared to process many diverse proteins and hence allows a single enzyme to monitor and, if appropriate, modulate a complex cellular state.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

We find that {beta} cell ablation impedes PDAC development in mice, arguing that the endocrine pancreas is critical for exocrine tumorigenesis. Conversely, obesity induces {beta} cell hormone dysregulation, alters CCK-dependent peri-islet exocrine cell transcriptional states, and enhances islet proximal tumor formation.

Uptake of peptides by S. aureus involves at least two transport systems: the POT family di/tri-peptide permease DtpT and the oligopeptide ABC transporter Opp3. Here we study the individual and combined functions of DtpT and Opp3 in enabling utilisation of 282 di-/tri-peptides via a high-throughput phenotypic screen. We reveal that many peptides can be utilised via either transporter, though DtpT appears to be the primary route of uptake for dipeptides. Intriguingly, we demonstrate a preference for Asp/Glu-containing peptides among putative DtpT substrates. To measure DtpT-mediated peptide transport directly, the protein was purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes and active transport of diverse di- and tri-peptides was demonstrated, supporting the conclusions of the phenotypic screen. During this in vitro analysis, we also found that DtpT could transport the biologically prevalent tripeptide reduced glutathione (GSH). In the absence of the known glutathione transporter Gis, dtpT is essential for growth under conditions where GSH is supplied as the sole sulphur source, identifying DtpT as the predicted second GSH uptake system of S. aureus. Site-directed mutagenesis of the predicted ligand binding site of DtpT suggests GSH binds the protein vertically in a manner dependent on interactions with Gln310. Finally, we demonstrate that GSH transport is required by S. aureus for complete fitness during in vitro macrophage infection experiments, and our data suggest that GSH uptake plays a role in modulating host-pathogen interactions in these infections. Together, these data reveal important new functions for DtpT, both in the utilisation of diverse peptides for growth but also providing the first clues toward a distinct role of DtpT during intracellular infection.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

Here, we focused on the contribution of the viral ""internal"" genomic segments of H5N1 B3.13 to bovine cells adaptation. We generated 45 reassortant viruses harbouring the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 and internal gene constellations from several influenza A viruses (IAV) or carrying segment swaps between distinct H5N1 strains. The recombinant B3.13 viruses displayed faster replication kinetics in bovine cells compared to other IAV. Importantly, multiple genomic segments of B3.13 viruses contribute to their faster replicative fitness. Further, recombinants with the B3.13 internal genes were less susceptible than ancestral 2.3.4.4b strain to the bovine IFN response. However, bovine (and human) MX1, a key restriction factor for avian IAV, restricted both ancestral 2.3.4.4b and B3.13 recombinant viruses. Interestingly, the latter escape restriction from human BTN3A3. Finally, recombinant B3.13 was virulent in mice unlike the ancestor 2.3.4.4b recombinant virus.

Given the high incidence and deleterious consequences of epileptiform activity in AD, we hypothesized neuronal hyperactivity and seizures are key factors in tau spread. To examine these interactions, we created a novel mouse model involving the cross of targeted recombination in active populations (TRAP) mice and the 5 times familial AD (5XFAD; 5X-TRAP) model allowing for the permanent fluorescent labelling of neuronal activity. To establish a causal role of seizures in tau spread, we seeded mice with human AD brain-derived tau lysate and induced seizures with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling. Comprehensive brain mapping of tau pathology and neuronal activity revealed that basal hyperactivity in 5X-TRAP mice was associated with increased tau spread, which was exacerbated by seizure induction through activated networks and correlated with memory deficits. Computational modeling revealed that anterograde tau spread was elevated in 5X-TRAP mice and that regional neuronal activity was predictive of tau spread to that brain region. On a cellular level, we found that in both saline and PTZ-treated 5X-TRAP mice, hyperactive neurons disproportionately contributed to the spread of tau. Further, we found that Synaptogyrin-3, a synaptic vesicle protein that interacts with tau, was increased following PTZ kindling in 5X-TRAP mice, possibly indicative of a synaptic mechanism underlying seizure-exacerbated tau spread. Importantly, postmortem AD brain tissue from patients with a history of seizures showed increased tau pathology in patterns indicative of increased spread and increased Synaptogyrin-3 levels compared to those without seizures. Overall, our study identifies neuronal hyperactivity and seizures as key factors underlying the pathobiological and cognitive progression of AD. Therapies targeting these factors should be tested clinically to slow tau spread and AD progression.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

While movement plans can be computed relative to the world (extrinsic), intrinsic muscle commands tuned for current limb posture are ultimately needed to execute spatially accurate movements. The whole-brain topology and dynamics of this process are largely unknown. Here, we use high spatiotemporal resolution magnetoencephalography (MEG) in humans combined with a Pro-/Anti-wrist pointing task with 2 opposing forearm postures to investigate this question. First, we computed cortical source activity in 16 previously identified bilateral cortical areas (Alikhanian, et al., Frontiers in Neuroscience 2013). We then contrasted oscillatory activity related to opposing wrist postures to find posture coding and test when and where extrinsic and intrinsic motor codes occurred. We found a distinct pair of overlapping networks coding for posture (predominantly in {gamma} band) vs. posture-specific movement plans ( and {beta}). Some areas (e.g., pIPS) only showed extrinsic motor coding, and others (e.g., AG) only showed intrinsic coding, but the majority showed both types of codes. In the latter case, intrinsic codes appeared slightly before extrinsic codes and persisted in parallel across different cortical areas. These findings are consistent with two cortical networks for 1) direct feed-forward sensorimotor transformations to intrinsic muscle coordinates (for rapid control) and 2) computations of extrinsic spatial coordinates, possibly for use in higher-level aspects of visually-guided action, such as spatial updating and internal performance monitoring.

Significance statement / author summaryIt is thought that the brain incorporates posture into extrinsic spatial codes to compute intrinsic (muscle-centered) motor commands, but the whole-brain temporal dynamics of this process is unknown. Here we employed human magneto-encephalography (MEG) to track this process across 16 bilateral cortical sites. We identified two, largely overlapping subnetworks for posture-dependent intrinsic codes, and extrinsic spatial coding. Surprisingly, the direct transformation from sensorimotor coordinates to intrinsic commands preceded the appearance of extrinsic codes, suggesting that extrinsic motor codes are derived from intrinsic codes for higher-level cognitive purposes.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

In the evolutionary transition from C3 to the more efficient C4 photosynthesis, restricting the glycine decarboxylase reaction to bundle sheath cells initiates a carbon concentrating mechanism via the photorespiratory glycine shuttle. This evolutionary step is generally thought to play an essential role in the progression from ancestral C3 to C4 photosynthesis. Plants operating this shuttle are often referred to as C3-C4 intermediates or C2 species. Within the Brassicaceae family, which includes model plants and crops, such species have evolved independently at least five times. However, research on the biochemistry of C3-C4 intermediates in the Brassicaceae has been limited to a few case studies of differentially localized proteins between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. Here, we leveraged recent advances in single-cell transcriptome sequencing to better understand how new cellular specialization affects interconnected pathways. We generated a single-nuclei RNA sequencing dataset for Moricandia arvensis, a Brassicaceae with C3-C4 intermediate characteristics, and compared it to a publicly available single-cell transcriptome of leaf tissue of the C3 Arabidopsis thaliana. We independently confirmed the localization of selected photorespiratory proteins by electron microscopy of immunogold-labelled leaf sections. Our analysis revealed the shift in expression of genes directly associated with the photorespiratory glycine decarboxylase reaction, but also of related pathways, such as ammonium assimilation, synthesis of specific amino acids, redox regulation, and transport to the M. arvensis bundle sheath. In contrast, the expression of these genes was not restricted to this cell type in the C3 plant.

Mechanical cues exerted by shear stress from the blood flow remodel an initial vascular plexus into a ramifying array of large and small vessels. As plasma starts to fill vascular lumens, these forces trigger changes in EC gene expression and dynamic alterations in cell shape and cell adhesion, as cuboidal angioblasts elongate and flatten into ECs. Little is known about how embryonic ECs sense and transduce hemodynamic signals as vessels form in vivo. Here, we report a critical requirement for the Lats1 and Lats2 Hippo pathway kinases during this process. We show that when Lats1/2 are genetically deleted in ECs, embryos develop severe defects in blood vessel formation, which lead to embryonic lethality by E11.5. We find that initial vessel patterning and circulation initiate properly, however remodeling of the initial vascular plexus fails due to lumen collapse and altered blood flow. When Lats1/2 are knocked down using siRNA approaches in cultured ECs, cells fail to elongate and polarize, similar to ECs in the mutant embryos. In addition, VE-cadherin (VEcad) based junctions fail to mature under shear stress. These data show that Lats1/2 deficient cells no longer respond to laminar shear stress, both in vivo and in vitro.

The mechanisms for gene regulation are primarily encoded in noncoding DNA sequences, but deciphering how these sequence features control gene expression remains a significant challenge in genomics.

Pre-trained on a diverse set of multi-species genomes, we demonstrate Nucleotide GPTs genomic understanding through evaluation on diverse prediction tasks, including histone modifications, promoter detection, and transcription factor binding sites. When finetuned to predict genome interactions with two separate nuclear subcompartments - the lamina of the inner nuclear membrane and nuclear speckles that lie more interior - Nucleotide GPT achieves an average accuracy of 73.6% for lamina-associated domains (LADs) and 79.4% accuracy for speckle-associated domains (SPADs), averaged across three cortical development cell types. Analysis of the models learned representations through Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) reveals that Nucleotide GPT develops internal embeddings that effectively distinguish LADs from inter-LADs, with predicted probabilities closely corresponding to experimentally determined LAD classifications. When examining these representations in the context of cell type-invariant constitutive LADs (cLADs) compared to cell type-specific LADs, the model assigns lower confidence scores to cell type-specific LADs compared to cLADs that are conserved across neuronal differentiation, suggesting sequence features may play a stronger role in maintaining cLAD associations. Examination of the models attention patterns at correctly classified regions suggests that specific sequence elements govern model decision making about nuclear subcompartment associations. Our results demonstrate the utility of transformer architectures for studying three-dimensional (3D) genome organization and substantiate a role for DNA sequence in determining nuclear subcompartment associations.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

Early-life adversity (ELA) is a risk for human affective disorders involving dysregulated reward behaviors. In mice, ELA causes anhedonia-like behaviors in males and augmented reward motivation in females, indicating sex-dependent disruption of reward circuit operations. We recently identified a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expressing GABAergic projection from basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) that governs reward-seeking deficits in adult ELA males--but not females.

MethodsTo probe the sex-specific role of this projection in reward behaviors, adult male and female CRH-Cre mice raised in control or ELA conditions received excitatory or inhibitory Cre-dependent DREADDs in BLA, and then clozapine N-oxide or vehicle to NAc medial shell during reward behaviors. We determined the cell identity of the projection using immunostaining and electrophysiology. Using tissue clearing, light sheet fluorescence microscopy and deep learning pipelines, we mapped brain-wide BLA CRH+ axonal projections to uncover sex differences in innervation.

ResultsChemogenetic manipulations in male mice demonstrated inhibitory effects of the CRH+ BLA-NAc projection on reward behaviors, whereas neither excitation nor inhibition influenced female behaviors. Molecular and electrophysiological cell-identities of the projection did not vary by sex. By contrast, comprehensive whole-brain mapping uncovered significant differences in NAc innervation patterns that were both sex and ELA-dependent, as well as selective changes of innervation of other brain regions.

ConclusionsThe CRH/GABA BLA-NAc projection that influences reward behaviors in males differs structurally and functionally in females, uncovering potential mechanisms for the profound sex-specific impacts of ELA on reward behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

However, snRNA-seq poses high costs and technical limitations, often requiring the pooling of independent biological samples and loss of individual sample-level data. Deconvolution of sample identity using inherent features would enable the incorporation of pooled barcoding and sequencing protocols, thereby increasing data throughput and analytical sample size without requiring increases in experimental sample size and sequencing costs. In this study, we demonstrate a proof of concept that sex-dependent gene expression patterns can be leveraged for the deconvolution of pooled snRNA-seq data. Using previously published snRNA-seq data from the rat ventral tegmental area, we trained a range of machine learning models to classify cell sex using genes differentially expressed in cells from male and female rats. Models that used sex-dependent gene expression predicted cell sex with high accuracy (90-92%) and outperformed simple classification models using only sex chromosome gene expression (69-89%). The generalizability of these models to other brain regions was assessed using an additional published data set from the rat nucleus accumbens. Within this data set, model performance remained highly accurate in cell sex classification (89-90% accuracy) with no additional re-training. This work provides a model for future snRNA-seq studies to perform sample deconvolution using a two-sex pooled sample sequencing design and benchmarks the performance of various machine learning approaches to deconvolve sample identification from inherent sample features.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

Deep learning protein design approaches like ProteinMPNN have shown strong performance both in creating novel proteins or stabilizing existing ones. However, it is unlikely that the stability of the designs will significantly exceed that of the natural proteins in the training set, which are biophysically only marginally stable. Therefore, we collected predicted protein structures from hyperthermophiles, which differ substantially in their amino acid composition from mesophiles. Notably, ProteinMPNN fails to recover their unique amino acid composition. Here we show that a retrained network on predicted proteins from hyperthermophiles, termed HyperMPNN, not only recovers this unique amino acid composition but can also be applied to proteins from non-hyperthermophiles. Using this novel approach on a protein nanoparticle with a melting temperature of 65{degrees}C resulted in designs remaining stable at 95{degrees}C. In conclusion, we created a new way to design highly thermostable proteins through self-supervised learning on data from hyperthermophiles.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

These two groups of taxa show contrasting trends in the molecular mechanisms of 3D chromatin organization and long-term evolutionary dynamics of cis-regulatory element (CREs) conservation. To help us identify shared versus derived features that could be responsible for the evolution of these different regulatory architectures in animals, we studied the evolution and organization of the regulatory genome of echinoderms, a lineage whose phylogenetic position and relatively slow molecular evolution has proven particularly useful for evolutionary studies. First, using PacBio and HiC data, we generated new reference genome assemblies for two species belonging to two different echinoderm classes: the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the bat sea star Patiria miniata. Second, we characterized their 3D chromatin architecture, identifying TAD-like domains in echinoderms that, like in flies, do not seem to be associated with CTCF motif orientation. Third, we systematically profiled CREs during sea star and sea urchin development using ATAC-seq, comparing their regulatory logic and dynamics over multiple developmental stages. Finally, we investigated sea urchin and sea star CRE evolution across multiple evolutionary distances and timescales, from closely related species to other echinoderm classes and deuterostome lineages. This showed the presence of several thousand elements conserved for hundreds of millions of years, revealing a vertebrate-like pattern of CRE evolution that probably constitutes an ancestral property of the regulatory evolution of animals.","NA","biorxiv",1733522965942

Here we show that for oblique plane microscopes (OPM), a subset of LSFM where a single primary objective is used for illumination and detection, light-sheet stabilization can be achieved without expending sample fluorescence. Our method achieves ~43nm axial precision and maintains the light-sheet well within the depth of focus of the detection system for hour-long acquisition runs in a lab environment that would otherwise detune the system.

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty. We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1733522965942

MethodsProtocol expansions to PREVENT-19 included enrollment of adolescents (aged 12 to <18 years) and administration of 3rd and 4th doses of NVX-CoV2373 to adults and adolescents. Participants randomized 2:1 received NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart; 3rd and 4th doses were administered [&ge;]6 months after the preceding dose. Secondary and additional assessments included post-3rd- and 4th-dose immune responses (neutralizing antibody [nAb], anti-rS IgG, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-receptor binding inhibition [hACE2-RBI]) and response durability (post-3rd dose) to ancestral virus; cross-reactivity to Omicron subvariants; safety; and reactogenicity.

ResultsImmune responses were observed against ancestral virus after two doses of NVX-CoV2373 but not after placebo. In both adults and adolescents, additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 increased nAb titers, anti-rS IgG levels, and hACE2-RBI; durable responses were recorded 8 months post 3rd dose. nAb responses post 3rd dose were noninferior to those post primary series. Cross-reactivity to BA.5 and BQ.1.1 variants was also observed, with anti-rS IgG levels post 3rd or 4th dose exceeding previously reported correlates of protection. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated, with no new safety signals.

ConclusionsNVX-CoV2373 elicited robust and durable humoral immune responses to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 as a 3rd and 4th dose after the primary series in adults and adolescents. Cross-reactivity to relevant variants provides insight into potential protection against antigenically related, but shifted, viral strains. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated with no new safety signals. These results support the utility of this vaccine platform and continued updates, based on currently circulating strains, to help effectively combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

From 2022, the national vaccination programme has been run twice per year, prioritising older age groups or those classified as clinically vulnerable. Here we assess the trends in COVID-19 outcomes between September 2023 and April 2024, using national-level data held by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

MethodsData linkage of national-level COVID-19 episode data, NHS emergency and hospital attendance data, and death registrations were used to analyse COVID-19 outcomes. Outcomes were defined as COVID-19 associated A&E attendances, hospital admissions, severe hospitalisations, and deaths.

The number and rate of each COVID-19 outcome category between September 2023 and April 2024 was calculated, stratified by clinical risk status and age and sex.

ResultsThe most common COVID-19 outcomes during this time-period were A&E attendance and hospital admission, with the rates highest among those aged 75 and over. Among this age group, all outcomes disproportionately affect those who have been identified as at clinical risk and those who were immunosuppressed.

High rates of A&E attendance and hospital admission were also observed among infants (under 6 months old) but were lower for more severe outcomes.

DiscussionGroups that were most affected by COVID-19 outcomes were currently prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination in England, which will help protect against more severe outcomes including admission to intensive care and death.

Immunity has been acquired through natural infection, primary and booster vaccination, while protection has been lost through waning immunity and viral mutation. During the height of the pandemic in England, the main aim was to rapidly protect the population and large supplies of vaccine were pre-purchased, eliminating the need for cost-effective calculations. As we move to an era where for the majority of the population SARS-CoV-2 infections cause relatively mild disease, and vaccine stocks need to be re-purchased, it is important we consider the cost-effectiveness and economic value of COVID-19 vaccination programmes.

MethodsHere using data from 2023 and 2024 in England on COVID-19 hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths, coupled with bespoke health economic costs, we consider the willingness to pay threshold for COVID-19 vaccines in different age and risk groups. We partition the population into sixteen 5-year age-groups and three risk groups (no-risk, at-risk and immunosuppressed) and calculate the health savings, in terms of costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), per vaccine dose. We adopt three different methodological approaches to estimate the level of vaccine protection leading to five different estimates of efficacy.

FindingsWillingness to pay thresholds vary from less than {pound}1 for younger age-groups without any risk factors, to over {pound}100 for older age-groups with comorbidities that place them at risk. This extreme non-linear dependence on age, means that despite the different method of estimating vaccine efficacy, there is considerable qualitative agreement on the willingness to pay threshold, and therefore which ages it is cost-effective to vaccinate. For pre-purchased vaccine, where the only cost is administration ({approx}{pound}10), a twice-yearly universal booster offer to all those aged 70 and over is cost-effective (the benefits outweigh the administration costs), while for the at-risk group this could be extended to those over 65. When the vaccine cost is included, the cost-effective ages reduce, such that at a total cost of {pound}30 (for vaccine and administration) universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 75; while at {pound}60 universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 80.

InterpretationThe historic offer of COVID-19 vaccination to those 65 and over for the autumn 2023 programme and those over 75 for the spring 2023 programme, aligns with our cost-effective threshold for pre-purchased vaccine when the only cost was administration. However, for future programmes, when vaccine costs are included, the age-thresholds slowly increase thereby demonstrating the continued importance of protecting the eldest and most vulnerable in the population.","NA","medrxiv",1733522965942
