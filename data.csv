Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1740866870261

However, there remains concern regarding public health and an unmet need for therapeutic options. Herein, we report the discovery of S-892216, a second-generation SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease (3CLpro) inhibitor, to treat COVID-19. S-892216 is a reversible covalent 3CLpro inhibitor with highly potent antiviral activity and an EC50 value of 2.48 nM against SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Structure-based design of a covalent modifier for compound 1 revealed that introducing a nitrile warhead increased 3CLpro inhibition activity by 180-fold. Subsequent optimization efforts yielded S-892216, which combined a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and high off-target selectivity. S-892216 exhibited antiviral activity against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants, with no cross-resistance to major mutations reducing antiviral activities of nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir. In SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, S-892216 inhibited viral replication in the lungs similar to ensitrelvir, although at a 30-fold lower dose.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870261

However, between 3 and 2 thousand years before present (BP) Celtic was widely spoken across most of Europe. While often associated with Bell Beaker-related populations, the spread of this prominent Indo-European linguistic cluster remains debated1--7. Previous genomic investigations have focused on its arrival to specific regions: Britain8, Iberia9 and Southwestern Germany10. Here, we utilize new genomic data from Bronze and Iron Age Europe to investigate the population history of historically Celtic-speaking regions, and test different linguistic theories on the origins and early spread of the Celtic languages. We identify a widespread demographic impact of the Central European Urnfield Culture. We find ancestry associated with its Knoviz subgroup in the Carpathian Basin to have formed between 4--3.2 kyr BP, and subsequently expanded across much of Western Europe between 3.2 and 2.8 kyr BP. This ancestry further persisted into the Hallstatt Culture of France, Germany and Austria, impacting Britain by 2.8 kyr BP and Iberia by 2.5 kyr BP. These findings support models of an Eastern Central rather than a Western European center of spread for a major component of all the attested Celtic languages. Our study demonstrates, yet again, the power of ancient population genomics in addressing long-standing debates in historical linguistics.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870261

An emerging consensus is to reduce the potential immunogenicity of such therapies by instead using human protein domains. However, as we engineer these human-derived proteins, we create nonhuman peptides at the linkers or junctions between domains and at mutated residues within them, which still pose a risk of immunogenicity that has largely been left unaddressed. Here, we present a modular workflow to simultaneously optimize the functions of proteins and minimize their immunogenic risk using existing machine learning models that predict protein function and nonhuman peptide immunogenicity from their sequences. We first applied this workflow to existing transcriptional activation and bio-orthogonal RNA binding domains. Then we generated a set of small molecule-controllable transcription factors with human-derived zinc finger DNA-binding domains for targeting orthogonal non-genomic DNA sequences. Finally, we established a workflow for creating deimmunized zinc finger arrays to target arbitrary genomic DNA sequences and used it to upregulate expression of two therapeutically relevant genes, UTRN and SCN1A. Our future-proof, modular workflow offers a proof of principle for making cell and gene therapies safer and more efficacious through dual-objective protein optimization using state-of-the-art algorithms.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870261

Our previous work demonstrated the ability to achieve optical transparency in live mice using intensely absorbing dye molecules, which created transparency in the red spectrum while blocking shorter-wavelength photons. In this paper, we extend this capability to achieve optical transparency across the entire visible spectrum by employing molecules with strong absorption in the ultraviolet spectrum and sharp absorption edges that rapidly decline upon entering the visible spectrum. This new color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency method enables optical transparency for imaging commonly used fluorophores in the green and yellow spectra. Notably, this approach facilitates tissue transparency for structural and functional imaging of the live mouse brain labeled with yellow fluorescent protein and GCaMP through the scalp and skull. We show that this method enables longitudinal imaging of the same brain regions in awake mice over multiple days during development. Histological analyses of the skin and systemic toxicology studies indicate minimal acute or chronic damage to the skin or body using this approach. This color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency technique opens new opportunities for noninvasive deep-tissue optical imaging, enabling long-term visualization of cellular structures and dynamic activity with high spatiotemporal resolution and chronic tracking capabilities.

Significance StatementTissue scattering represents a major barrier to deep tissue imaging in vivo. We recently showed that tissue can be rendered transparent in the red spectrum using intensely absorbing dye molecules. Here, we introduce a new, color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency approach. We demonstrate longitudinal structural and functional imaging in the deep tissue of awake mice.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870261

Asymptomatic colonization by S. aureus presents a significant risk for subsequent infection of the colonized infant and for patient-to-patient transmission. Transmission of more virulent S. aureus strains in the NICU could increase infection risk in this vulnerable population.

MethodsWe performed a three-year, unit-wide screening for S. aureus in the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) NICU, with whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 1,670 isolates from patient colonization surveillance, blood cultures from both NICU and non-NICU patients, and environmental surfaces. We used comparative genomic epidemiological approaches to investigate the transmission dynamics of S. aureus in the NICU setting.

FindingsOur analyses revealed 490 unique strains with multiple, highly related, clones among NICU S. aureus genomes. We identified sixty-nine transmission clusters, of which 87% (60/69) were methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), and 28% (19/69) included isolates from both colonizing sites and bacteremia. The largest invasive cluster persisted over 2 years, involved 30 infants, and caused 4 cases of bacteremia. Spatial and temporal epidemiological links were found in 88% of clusters, and suggest that shared spaces served as the predominant means of transmission in the NICU setting. NICU environmental surveillance revealed S. aureus on surfaces; 3 of these isolates were also identified in colonizing and invasive clusters, suggesting potential environmental reservoirs. Remarkably, transmission clusters with both colonizing and invasive isolates were associated with higher rates of transmission, suggesting that specific transmission clusters pose a significantly higher risk for invasive infections in the NICU.

InterpretationsGenomic temporal-spatial epidemiologic analyses revealed high levels of S. aureus transmission in the NICU with multiple transmission clusters that persisted over long periods of time. Our findings demonstrate a strong association amongst colonization, transmission, and the development of invasive infections, underscoring the importance of targeted measures to prevent S. aureus infections in the NICU setting.

Examining the zoonotic emergence of Ebola virus, Marburg virus, influenza A virus, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, we find no evidence of a change in the intensity of natural selection immediately prior to a host switch, compared with typical selection within reservoir hosts. We conclude that extensive pre-zoonotic adaptation is not necessary for human-to-human transmission of zoonotic viruses. In contrast, the reemergence of H1N1 influenza A virus in 1977 showed a change in selection, consistent with the hypothesis of passage in a laboratory setting prior to its reintroduction into the human population, purportedly during a vaccine trial. Holistic phylogenetic analysis of selection regimes can be used to detect evolutionary signals of host switching or laboratory passage, providing insight into the circumstances of past and future viral emergence.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870261

Whether transient pockets formed within intrinsically disordered and unstructured regions of proteins can be selectively targeted with small molecules remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we developed a bespoke stereochemically-paired spirocyclic oxindole aziridine covalent library and screened this library for degradation of MYC. Through this screen, we identified a hit covalent ligand KL2-236, bearing a unique sulfinyl aziridine warhead, that engaged MYC in vitro as pure MYC/MAX protein complex and in situ in cancer cells to destabilize MYC, inhibit MYC transcriptional activity and degrade MYC in a proteasome-dependent manner through targeting intrinsically disordered C203 and D205 residues. Notably, this reactivity was most pronounced for specific stereoisomers of KL2-236 with a diastereomer KL4-019 that was largely inactive. Mutagenesis of both C203 and D205 completely attenuated KL2-236-mediated MYC degradation. We have also optimized our initial KL2-236 hit compound to generate a more durable MYC degrader KL4-219A in cancer cells. Our results reveal a novel ligandable site within MYC and indicate that certain intrinsically disordered regions within high-value protein targets, such as MYC, can be interrogated by isomerically unique chiral small molecules, leading to destabilization and degradation.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870261

Here, we report isolation of two strains belonging to the order proposed as FECAs closest relative,  Hodarchaeales,5 as members of a pure co- and tri-culture with methanogenic partners. Both are obligately anaerobic, syntrophic, peptide-degrading, and mesophilic archaea that have simple internal cell structure and produce protrusions and vesicles, like Promethearchaeales3,4. All strains demonstrate behavior focused on cell construction rather than division, unlike typical prokaryotes6. Strain HC1 possesses genes associated with aerobic lifestyles but lacks complete pathways for aerobic respiration and co-cultures cannot grow under (micro)aerobic conditions, suggesting the genes support oxygen detoxification rather than respiration. Reflecting this, HC1 can survive and grow under microaerobic conditions only when aerobic organisms are present. Phylogenetic analyses indicate FECA may have possessed these genes and thus some aerotolerance.

Here, we designed a near-native viral fusion system that recapitulates SARS-CoV-2 entry and used cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to capture fusion intermediates leading to complete fusion. The spike protein undergoes extensive structural rearrangements, progressing through extended, partially folded, and fully folded intermediates prior to fusion-pore formation, a process that is dependent on protease cleavage and inhibited by the WS6 S2 antibody. Upon interaction with ACE2 receptor dimer, spikes cluster at membrane interfaces and following S2' cleavage concurrently transition to postfusion conformations encircling the hemifusion and pre-fusion pores in a distinct conical arrangement. Subtomogram averaging revealed that the WS6 S2 antibody binds to the spike's stem-helix, crosslinks and clusters prefusion spikes and inhibits refolding of fusion intermediates.

While molecular data such as gene expression and methylation profiles offer comprehensive insights, obtaining this data is costly and is slow. Addressing this challenge, here we developed Path2Omics, a deep learning model that predicts gene expression and methylation from histopathology. Path2Omics was trained on 20,497 slides (a combination of 9,456 formalin fixed (FFPE) and 11,041 fresh frozen (FF)) from 8,007 patients across 23 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts. When tested on FFPE slides, which are the most readily available in the clinical pathology practice from 15 TCGA cohorts, the integrated Path2Omics model outperformed its individual FF and FFPE trained components, achieving an average of nearly 5,000 genes whose expression is robustly inferred, approximately five times higher than our recently published DeepPT approach, the top extant prediction transcriptomics inference model. Externally evaluated on seven unseen independent patient cohorts, Path2Omics successfully robustly predicted the expression of about 4,400 genes, yielding a 30% increase over the performance of the FFPE model alone. Finally, we demonstrate that inferred gene expression and methylation using Path2Omics is as effective as the actual expression values for further predicting patient survival and treatment response. These results lay the basis for using Path2Omics to advance precision oncology from histopathology slides in a speedy and cost-effective manner, going forward.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870261

We explore this premise in All of Us Research Program participants with pathogenic variation causal for three Mendelian conditions: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), Marfan syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).

MethodsWe identified All of Us Research Program participants with putatively pathogenic variation in NF1, FBN1, PKD1, and PKD2. Concept terms were extracted from electronic health records to assess participant diagnosis and phenotype. Variant annotation and participant surveys were evaluated to identify biological and social factors differentiating diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals.

ResultsLarge proportions of individuals with pathogenic variation in NF1, FBN1, or PKD1/PKD2 lack the associated diagnosis of NF1 (47%), Marfan syndrome (58%), or ADPKD (51%), respectively. Pathogenic variants in diagnosed individuals have greater inferred deleteriousness for NF1 and ADPKD, and undiagnosed individuals had less severe phenotypes compared to diagnosed individuals for all three conditions.

ConclusionA genotype-first ascertainment of individuals in genomic research allows for a more comprehensive assessment of Mendelian disease and removes biases that confound our understanding of the penetrance and presentation of these conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1740866870261

INs expressing the neuropeptide vasoactive-intestinal peptide (VIP) have attracted attention recently following the discovery that they predominantly function by inhibiting dendritic-targeting somatostatin (SST) expressing INs, thereby disinhibiting PCs. This VIP-SST disinhibitory circuit motif is observed throughout the neocortex from mice to humans, and serves as a key mechanism for top-down (feedback) and context-dependent information processing. Thus, VIP IN-mediated disinhibition has been found to play an important role in sensory processing, control of executive functions, attention, sensorimotor integration and other cortico-cortical and thalamocortical feedback interactions. Furthermore, VIP INs have been implicated in mediating the effects of reinforcement signals, both reward and aversive, via their responsiveness to neuromodulators such as acetylcholine (ACh), and in facilitating synaptic plasticity and learning. While it is evident from transcriptomic analyses that VIP INs are a molecularly heterogeneous group, the physiological significance of this diversity is unclear at present. Here, we have characterized the functional diversity of VIP INs in the primary somatosensory cortex by leveraging intersectional genetic approaches to study distinct VIP IN subtypes. We found that VIP INs can be divided into four different populations: a group that expresses the Ca2+-binding protein calretinin (CR), two distinct groups that express the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK), and a group that does not express either CR or CCK (non-CCK non-CR; or nCCK nCR). VIP neurons in each group exhibit different laminar distributions, axonal and dendritic arbors, intrinsic electrophysiological properties, and efferent connectivity, VIP/CR INs target almost exclusively SST INs, VIP/nCCK nCR INs also mainly target SST INs but also have connections to parvalbumin (PV) expressing INs. These two groups have essentially no connectivity to pyramidal cells (PCs). On the other hand, the two types of VIP/CCK INs target PCs, but differ in the degree to which synaptic release from each type is modulated by endocannabinoids. We also found that long-range inputs differentially recruit distinct VIP IN groups. Intriguingly, we find that distinct VIP IN populations target distinct SST INs subtypes in turn, indicating the presence of specialized VIP-SST disinhibitory subcircuits. Activation of distinct VIP IN subpopulations in vivo results in differential effects on the cortical network, thus providing evidence for modularity in VIP IN-mediated actions during cortical information processing.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870261

These responses can drive collective behaviours like photoaccumulation and photodispersion, which play a key role in broader biological functions like photosynthesis. Our understanding of these emergent phenomena is severely limited by difficulties in obtaining data needed to establish accurate models that can serve as a basis for multi-scale analyses. Here, we address this issue by developing an integrated experimental and computational platform to collect large temporal imaging datasets that allow for the inference of 'digital twins' - mathematically precise computational models that accurately mirror the behavior of individual microorganisms - and show that they can replicate the light response of diverse microorganisms in silico. We show that a generalised phenomenological model of movement can be effectively parameterised from experimental data to capture key behavioural traits of two commonly studied photo-responsive microorganisms (Euglena gracilis and Volvox aureus) and demonstrate our model's ability to accurate reproduce patterns of movement for individuals and populations in response to dynamic and spatially varying light patterns. This work takes steps towards the automated phenotyping of multi-scale behaviours in biology and complements high-throughput genome sequencing efforts by allowing for more comprehensive and quantitative genotype-to-phenotype mappings. It also unlocks new opportunities for the design of spatial control algorithms to guide collective microorganism behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870261

Premature loss of chromosome cohesion proteins and untimely separation of chromosomes is thought to underly high rates egg aneuploidy during maternal aging. However, because chromosome cohesion loss occurs gradually over female reproductive lifespan and cytoskeletal defects alone can predispose eggs to chromosomal abnormalities, the root causes of exponential rise in egg aneuploidy at advanced reproductive ages remain a mystery. Here, we applied high-resolution live imaging to visualize for the first time cohesion protein dynamics underpinning meiotic chromosome segregation. To discover proteins whose dysfunction accelerates aneuploidies associated with female reproductive aging, we innovated the first experimental system in which chemically induced cohesion reduction rapidly triggers aging-like chromosomal abnormalities in young eggs. By integrating this direct cohesion manipulation system with quantitative high-resolution microscopy and targeted protein degradation tools, we identified the centromeric protein CENP-A as a new factor whose aging-like depletion causes a dramatic rise in premature separation of sister chromatids. Our work illuminates cohesion loss-independent origins of age-related egg aneuploidy and provides new avenues to discover therapeutic targets for extending the female reproductive lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870261

These networks are often incomplete due to absent or unobserved information. Predicting these missing links is critical for many applications, including genome-wide association studies and phenotype prediction. Efforts have previously applied graph neural networks (GNNs) to this missing-link prediction problem, but these techniques too have limitations when the sparsity of the networks is very high. Here, we apply a novel feature engineering technique that uses local graph motif incidence to enhance the feature set for variational graph autoencoders (VGAE). We compare the performance of our technique against state-of-the-art approaches, and then progressively hide more and more of the original graph edges. Our results show that VGAEs with our local-area motif prevalence (LAMP) features outperform state-of-the-art node embeddings for a wide range of missing edges on both a benchmark and a biological dataset. We also observe that this combined VGAE and LAMP technique has the potential to facilitate the search for novel genetic interactions in an experimental adaptive sampling context with far fewer samples. Improvements to gene interaction imputation can lower the barrier to new pharmaceutical and epidemiological discoveries by revealing hidden gene interactions that steer the development of potential drug targets.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870261

We show that 2-deoxyribose inhibits nucleic acid phase separation and suppresses the intra-condensate networking transition, known as percolation, that underlies the condensate dynamical arrest. All-atom simulations reveal increased solvation and compaction of single-stranded DNA compared to RNA, suggesting an unintuitive role of chain flexibility in modulating heat-induced nucleic acid phase separation and percolation transitions. Further, 2-O-methylation (2-O-Me) of RNA, a common sugar modification, lowers the driving force of RNA phase transitions. These results highlight the diverse physicochemical parameters governing nucleic acid phase behavior and suggest how sugar modifications may have evolved to robustly tune the formation and dynamical arrest of RNA condensates.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

Recent progress in inference has made ARG-based approaches feasible across of range of applications, and many new methods using inferred ARGs as input have appeared. This progress on the long-standing problem of ARG inference has proceeded in two distinct directions. First, the Bayesian inference of ARGs under the Sequentially Markov Coalescent (SMC), is now practical for tens-to-hundreds of samples. Second, approximate models and heuristics can now scale to sample sizes two to three orders of magnitude larger. Although these heuristic methods are reasonably accurate under many metrics, one significant drawback is that the ARGs they estimate do not have the topological properties required to compute a likelihood under models such as the SMC under present-day formulations. In particular, heuristic inference methods typically do not estimate precise details about recombination events, which are currently required to compute a likelihood. In this paper we present a backwards-time formulation of the SMC and derive a straightforward definition of the likelihood of a general class of ARG under this model. We show that this formulation does not require precise details of recombination events to be estimated, and is robust to the presence of polytomies. We discuss the possibilities for inference that this opens.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

In particular, how QDR against a generalist necrotrophic pathogen evolved and whether it is driven by conserved or species-specific regulatory networks remains unclear. Here, we examined the transcriptomic responses of five diverse wild tomato species that span a gradient of QDR. We initially hypothesised that conserved regulatory modules might control QDR. Instead, we use differential gene expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to find that species-specific regulatory features, encompassing both infection-induced and constitutively expressed genes, predominantly shape QDR levels. Although we identified an ethylene response factor among candidate genes for QDR-regulation, it did not fully account for the phenotypic variation. To further dissect the evolutionary basis of these regulatory patterns, we performed phylotranscriptomic analyses on gene regulatory networks. Notably, our findings reveal that the conserved NAC transcription factor 29 is pivotal in developing disease resistance only in S. pennellii. The differential regulation and altered downstream signalling pathways of NAC29 provide evidence for its co-option in the resistance mechanisms of S. pennellii. This finding highlights the species-specific rewiring of gene regulatory networks by repurposing a conserved regulatory element to enhance resistance against pathogens effectively. These results offer new insights into the evolutionary and regulatory complexity underlying QDR and emphasise the significance of species-specific gene regulation in shaping resistance against a cosmopolitan necrotrophic pathogen.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

Early botanical and comparative morphological research and recent genetic research supported a polyphyletic origin. A monophyletic origin was proposed after the discovery that a single genetic locus controls the presence of hull-less grains in all domesticated barley. Interpreting the origin of domesticated barley is further complicated by the archaeological record showing that the first domesticates had two rows of grain on the inflorescence, as does its wild progenitor. However, these two-rowed types effectively disappeared from the record for thousands of years, and they were replaced by derived six-rowed types that dominated barleys cultivation history and only reappeared in the record around one thousand years ago. Here, we used two independent datasets with large sample sizes and genome-wide genetic markers to re-evaluate barley cultivation history. We unequivocally demonstrate that modern domesticated barley has a monophyletic origin. Phylogenetic reconstruction and examination of current archaeological records suggests that the west Fertile Crescent was most likely where barley was first domesticated. Modern two-rowed types were likely derived from six-rowed domesticated types not earlier than 3,500 years ago in modern Turkiye and Iran. We conclude that the two distinct non-brittle rachis haplotypes, coinciding with distinct row types in cultivated barley, are likely the results of two chronological events along the same evolutionary line. Our results provide a reconcilable framework for explaining genetic and phytogeographic patterns and pave the way for a consensus on the origin of barley domestication.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

Unbiased analyses of IDRome-spanning grammars reveals that specialized IDR grammar features direct biological processes, cellular localization preferences, and molecular functions. IDRs with exceptional grammars, defined as sequences with high-scoring non-random features, are harbored in proteins and complexes that enable spatial and temporal sorting of biochemical activities. Protein complexes within the nucleus recruit specific factors through top-scoring IDRs. These IDRs are frequently disrupted via cancer-associated mutations and fusion oncoproteins. Overall, GIN enables the decoding of sequence-function relationships of IDRs and can be deployed in IDR-specific and IDRome-wide analyses.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

We identified brain systems supporting self-generated states using precision fMRI.

We found that thinking involving scenes evoked activity within or near the default network, while imagining speech evoked activity within or near the language network.

The production of functional eggs in sufficient numbers for a female lifespan requires dynamic and precisely coordinated cellular and developmental programs in early oogenesis. However, our understanding of their underlying regulatory mechanisms is critically lacking. Here, we aimed to identify overlooked essential regulators of early oogenesis in zebrafish. First, we present the establishment of a long-term ovary culture system which enables physiological oocyte development from oogonia to primordial follicles in cultured ovaries, providing an invaluable ex-vivo platform for rapid investigation. Next, we utilized this system for robust functional screening of candidates from stage-specific oocyte transcriptomic data. We identified mTOR, Stat3, and Stathmin as novel regulators of oocyte polarity. By using a combination of genetics, pharmacological manipulations ex-vivo, and rescue experiments, we established an essential mTOR-Stat3-Stathmin pathway that orchestrates centrosome regulation and microtubule organization to facilitate oocyte polarity. Microtubules control the localization and condensation of the essential polarity regulator Bucky ball (Buc). Loss of mTOR or Stat3 functions, as well as overactivation of Stathmin (a microtubule destabilizing protein) resulted in aberrant centrosome regulation and destabilization of microtubules, leading to dispersed mis-localized Buc condensates and loss of polarity. We show that mTOR acts upstream of Stat3 in oocytes, and that inhibition of Stathmin in stat3-/- or mTOR deficient ovaries rescued both cytoskeletal and polarity defects. We propose a novel mTOR-Stat3-Stathmin pathway which through cytoskeletal regulation, provides oocytes with polarization competence, a step likely widely conserved in biology. mTOR, Stat3, and Stathmin are known for their roles in cellular growth and cancer. Our work reveals their novel unpredicted functions in cell polarity during animal post-embryonic development.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

To estimate gene expression heritability, standard models require a single gene expression value per individual, forcing data from single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments to be pseudobulked. Here, we show that applying standard heritability models to pseudobulk data overestimates gene expression heritability and produces inflated false positive rates for detecting cis-heritable genes. Therefore, we introduce a new method called scGeneHE (single cell Gene expression Heritability Estimation), a Poisson mixed-effects model that quantifies the cis-genetic component of gene expression using individual cellular profiles. In simulations, scGeneHE has a consistently well-calibrated false positive rate for eGene detection and unbiasedly estimates cis-heritability at many parameter settings. We applied scGeneHE to scRNA-seq data from 969 individuals, 11 immune cell types, and 822,552 cells from the OneK1K cohort to infer cell-type-specificity of genetic regulation at risk genes for immune-mediated diseases and trace the fluctuation of cis-heritability across cellular populations of varying resolution.

This system includes a defense protein, TerI, and two self-immunity proteins, anti-TerI1 and anti-TerI2. TerI targets the terminase complex of invading phages to prevent DNA translocation into procapsids without halting the lytic cycle, leading to the release of unpacked non-infectious procapsids upon bacterial lysis. In contrast, the self-immunity proteins, anti-TerI1 and anti-TerI2, counteract TerI during prophage induction to allow virion production.

Using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we analyzed transcript distribution and morphology simultaneously in young and aged mouse brains. Our approach revealed how mRNA spatial organization varies across microglial states. We identified distinct transcript localization patterns within microglial processes and uncovered morphological heterogeneity within transcriptomically defined populations. Notably, we found a subpopulation of disease-associated microglia with a ramified morphology (displaying numerous processes), challenging the conventional assumption between morphology and microglial states. Finally, we found that aging not only alters the distribution of compartmentalized mRNAs but also reshapes their colocalization networks, shifting microglial functions from synaptic maintenance and phagocytic processes in younger brains to migration and catabolic pathways in older brains. Our findings highlight the role of subcellular transcript organization in shaping microglial morphology and function, offering new avenues for studying and modulating microglial states in health, disease, and aging.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

Many orthoceratoids contain cameral deposits, which are enigmatic calcareous structures within their chambered shell that presumably balanced their straight conchs in a horizontal position. Since the mid-19th century, palaeontologists have attempted to understand the cameral deposit formation process. The various hypotheses include growth from cameral fluids, precipitation by a cameral mantle or even their dismissal as post-mortem structures. All of these previous interpretations have in common that they are complicated with contradictory evidence. Here, we present evidence from well-preserved Trematoceras elegans specimens from the Late Triassic St. Cassian Formation (Dolomites, northern Italy). We studied the specimens by using optical and electron beam microanalysis techniques and argue that the cameral deposits consist of primary aragonite and calcite fabrics. A fibrous microstructure, which is bilaterally symmetrically arranged with irregularities, is documented. Thin organic sheets originally delimited radial growth sectors. Based on these observations, we propose a new growth model that explicitly involves the cameral sheets. These sheets acted as an extension of the pellicle and held a thin film of supersaturated liquid in the otherwise emptied chambers by the cameral sheets via the capillary effect. Ions were supplied through the siphuncle, such as in living Nautilus, and enabled the precipitation of aragonite and calcite fabrics. This model goes beyond previous interpretations, resolves contradictory observations and has functional implications, suggesting that cameral sheets and deposits were an adaptation to increased growth rates.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

However, little is known on the role of CD8 T cells in MS, partially due to the nearly ubiquitous use of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models that are mediated by CD4 T cells, with no CD8 T cell contribution. Importantly, MS and EAE differ in both their distribution of CNS lesions and their symptoms, indicating differences in CNS inflammation. MS lesions are more prevalent in the brain, while EAE lesions are more frequent in the spinal cord. Additionally, neurologic deficits in MS rarely parallel the paralysis typical for CD4 T cell-mediated EAE (CD4-EAE). In contrast, CD8-EAE models suggest that CD8 T cells preferentially cause brain inflammation, but little is known regarding how brain and spinal cord inflammation may differ, and how CD8 T cells may contribute to those differences. We have established an adoptive CD8-EAE mouse model characterized by brain-centered inflammation, severe ataxia, and weight loss. CNS inflammation in the brain and spinal cord differed in immune cell numbers, cellular composition, and inflammatory signatures. CD8-EAE could be suppressed by blocking IFN-g, and exacerbated by blocking PD-1, with concomitant changes in numbers of CNS-infiltrating monocytes. Most CD8 T cells in the CNS were CD11c+, suggesting that they are the pathogenic subset.

Dietary vitamin B1 plays a role in reducing oxidative stress, which may influence endometriosis risk. However, limited research explores this association.

ObjectiveTo investigate the association between dietary vitamin B1 intake and the risk of endometriosis, using NHANES 2003-2006 data. Vitamins B2 and B6 are included as reference comparisons.

MethodsData from 2,462 participants in NHANES 2003-2006 were analyzed. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between vitamin B1 intake and endometriosis risk, with adjustments for covariates. Subgroup analyses and restricted cubic spline (RCS) regressions were applied to assess non-linear relationships. Vitamins B2 and B6 served as reference nutrients for comparison.

ResultsVitamin B1: Higher intake of dietary vitamin B1 was significantly associated with reduced risk of endometriosis (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.58- 0.99, P = 0.044 in Model 4).

Vitamin B2 and B6: No significant associations were observed (P > 0.05).

RCS regression demonstrated a non-linear relationship for vitamin B1, with a protective effect observed at intake levels > 1.84 mg/day.

ConclusionHigher dietary vitamin B1 intake is associated with a reduced risk of endometriosis. While B2 and B6 showed no significant associations, their trends provide additional insight for future research.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

Importantly, the increase in the Mex67 level in {Delta}hpr1 cells is not a consequence and thus the cause of the nuclear mRNA export defect. Therefore, precise regulation of the Mex67-Mtr2 level in nuclear mRNPs is essential for efficient nuclear mRNA export.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

Here, we determine the organization around and between specific proteins at nanometer resolution within condensates, deploying thermodynamic principles to interpret partitioning measurements of designed protein probes. When applied to the nucleolus as a proof of principle, the data reveals considerable inhomogeneity, deviating from that expected within a liquid-like phase. The inhomogeneity can be attributed to ribosome biogenesis, with the local meshwork weakening as biogenesis progresses, facilitating transport. Beyond introducing an innovative modality for biophysical interrogation, our results suggest condensates are far from uniform, simple liquids, a property we conjecture enables regulation and proofreading.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

This metabolism/PTM crosstalk is especially true for lactate, the product of anaerobic metabolism following glycolysis. Lactate forms an amide bond with the {varepsilon}-amino group of lysine, a modification known as lysine lactylation, or Kla. Multiple independent mechanisms have been proposed in the formation of Kla, including p300/CBP-dependent transfer from lactyl-CoA, via a high-energy intermediate lactoylglutathione species that non-enzymatically lactylates proteins, and several enzymes are reported to have lactyl transferase capability. We recently discovered that class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1, 2, and 3 can all reverse their canonical chemical reaction to catalyze lysine {beta}-hydroxybutyrylation. Here we tested the hypothesis that HDACs can also catalyze Kla formation. Using biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic approaches, we found that HDAC-catalyzed lysine lactylation accounts for the majority of Kla formation in cells. Dialysis experiments confirm this is a reversible reaction that depends on lactate concentration. We also directly quantified intracellular lactyl-CoA and found that Kla abundance can be uncoupled from lactyl-CoA levels. Therefore, we propose a model in which the majority of Kla is formed through enzymatic addition of lactate by HDACs 1, 2, and 3.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

Accordingly, helicases are instrumental in maintaining genomic integrity and ensuring genetic diversity. Srs2 is a multi-functional DNA helicase that dismantles Rad51 nucleofilaments and regulates DNA strand invasion to prevent excessive or inappropriate homologous recombination in yeast. Consistently, the deletion of Srs2 has significant consequences for the maintenance of genome integrity in mitotic cells. In contrast, its role in meiotic recombination remains less clear. We present here substantial evidence that SRS2 plays an important role in meiotic recombination in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis srs2 mutants exhibit moderate defects in DNA damage-induced RAD51 focus formation, but SRS2 is dispensable for DNA repair and RAD51-dependent recombination in somatic cells. Meiotic progression and fertility appear unaffected in srs2 plants but strikingly, the absence of SRS2 leads to increased genetic interference accompanied by increased numbers of Class I COs and a reduction in MUS81-dependent Class II COs. SRS2 thus has both anti- and pro-CO roles during meiosis in Arabidopsis thaliana - acting as an anti-CO factor by influencing the stability and/or the dissociation of early recombination intermediates, while playing a pro-CO role by promoting MUS81-mediated resolution of meiotic recombination intermediates.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

The inclina-tion of individuals born with low birth weight towards palatable foods indicates a possible modification in the hedonic aspect of their eating behavior. However, our understanding of the ontogenesis of structural organization and function within the brain's reward circuits remains limited. Therefore, the objective of this research is to investigate the preferences for palatable food, molec-ular signatures of reward circuits, and functional properties of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a rat model of perinatal protein restriction (LP). Starting from weaning, continuing into adolescence and adulthood, a longitudinal analysis was conducted on rats born to mothers with protein-restricted diets during gestation and lactation (LP pups), comparing them to pups born from control dams (CD pups). The LP group exhibited an increased preference for palatable food at day 25 after birth (P25), followed by a decreased preference during adolescence (P50), and no significant difference in palatable food preference at P95 (young adult) compared to CD rats. Molecular and electrophysiological assessments of medium spiny neurons (MSN) in the NAc revealed a reorganization of reward circuits during crucial developmental periods, potentially influencing the attractiveness of palatable food for the LP group. This study represents the first exploration of how preferences for palatable food evolve throughout an indi-vidual's lifespan and how these observations correlate with the remodeling of reward circuits. By shedding light on the molecular and functional aspects of reward circuits, we contribute to a better understanding of the link between perinatal nutrition, behav-ioral preferences, and the underlying neural mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

Although determining their relative weight is made difficult by discrepancies between palaeontological and neontological data, mammalian tooth morphology may bridge the gap between fossil record and laboratory observations. Fossils indicate that placentals and marsupials diversified after evolving molars bearing more cusps, which emerge through the iterative signalling of enamel knots. However, this theoretical evo-devo model of mammalian tooth evolution has not been explicitly assessed on empirical data. Here, by combining the fossil record with laboratory experiments, we identify a shared developmental basis for the convergent, ratcheted evolution of increasingly complex molars in arvicoline rodents (voles, lemmings, muskrats). Longer, narrower molars lead to more cusps throughout development and deep time, suggesting a developmental driver for tooth evolution. Both the arvicoline fossil record and vole tooth development show slower transitions toward the highest cusp counts. This newly identified pattern suggests that the developmental processes fuelling the evolution of increasingly complex molars may also limit the potential for further complexity increases. Integrating palaeontological and developmental data shows that long-term evolutionary trends can be accurately explained by the simple tinkering of developmental pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

However, due to their limited genome size, viruses must adopt unique strategies to confront cellular sensors. Since emerging in humans, SARS-CoV-2 has accrued multiple mutations throughout its genome, some of which enhanced virus replication and led to the rise of viral variants. However, the biological consequences of many of these changes remain to be discovered. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 produces a truncated form of the nucleocapsid protein, called N*M210. Due to the acquisition of a viral transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) in the N gene, certain variants, such as Omicron, produce a new viral mRNA that markedly increases N*M210 expression. We show that N*M210 is a dsRNA binding protein, which inhibits multiple arms of the cellular antiviral response, including blocking interferon induction and inhibiting stress granule formation. We created a panel of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 viruses (rSARS-2) with mutations in the N gene that increased or decreased N*M210 production. We show that N*M210 production increases virus fitness, as viruses that produce more N*M210 outcompeted wild-type rSARS-2. We demonstrate that the fitness advantage provided by N*M210 is partly due to its ability to potently block stress granules. We propose a model where, to evade the cellular antiviral response, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a mechanism to increase the production of a truncated form of the N protein, which broadly limits the activation of dsRNA-induced antiviral responses, tipping the balance in favour of the virus in the battle for control of the cell.

Within the NRC (NLR Required for Cell Death) network, NLRs operate in complex sensor-helper configurations to confer immunity against a diverse array of pathogens, particularly in Asterids. While helper NLRs are typically conserved and evolve slowly, sensor NLRs tend to evolve more rapidly. However, the functional connections between slow and fast-evolving NLRs remain poorly understood, notably in important crop species. We conducted a comparative analysis of NLRs across 40 Solanales and 29 Asterales genomes to explore NRC network expansion and diversification within the less-studied Asterales order. Our findings reveal that the NRC network has expanded less in Asterales compared to Solanales. We functionally validated a minimal Asterales NRC network with 2 helpers and 9 sensors in common lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Through selection and diversification analysis and structural modeling of NRC helper and sensor subclades in the Lactuca genus, we found varying evolutionary diversification rates between NRC helpers and sensors. We found a correlation between sensor diversification rates and helper dependency, with sensors reliant on a phylogenetically conserved helpers experiencing limited diversification pressure. Our results highlight the lineage- and function-specific evolution of the NRC network, offering insights into the evolutionary pressures shaping plant immune receptor networks.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

Since the influenza virus causes respiratory infections in humans, developing mucosal vaccines to protect the entry site of the virus is of high importance. Recombinant NA requires adjuvants to induce a protective immune response after mucosal administration. In the current study, we analyze the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a recombinant NA-based influenza virus vaccine administered intranasally in combination with adjuvants consisting of outer membrane proteins from Neisseria meningitidis complexed with exogenous lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Shigella flexneri or endogenous LPS from N. meningitidis.

Finally, we performed a heterologous challenge study to test the ability of the investigated vaccine formulations to induce cross-protection. The study demonstrates that bacterial cell membrane-derived adjuvants significantly improve the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the recombinant N1 NA-based influenza vaccine leading to protection against clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 challenge.

By contrast, many biological and environmental settings---ranging from mucus in the body to ocean sediments and the soil beneath our feet---feature multicellular bacterial populations that are confined to tight spots where essential metabolic substrates (e.g., oxygen) are scarce. What influence does such confinement have on a bacterial population? Here, we address this question by studying suspensions of motile Escherichia coli confined to quasi two-dimensional (2D) droplets. We find that when the droplet size and cell concentration are both large enough, the initially-uniform suspension spatially self-organizes into a concentrated, immotile inner ""core"" that coexists with a more dilute, highly-motile surrounding ""shell"". By simultaneously measuring cell concentration, oxygen concentration, and motility-generated fluid flow, we show that this behavior arises from the interplay between oxygen transport through the droplet from its boundary, uptake by the cells, and corresponding changes in their motility in response to oxygen variations. Furthermore, we use theory and simulations to develop quantitative principles describing this interplay---establishing a biophysical framework that unifies all our experimental observations. Our work thereby sheds new light on the rich collective behaviors that emerge for bacterial populations, and other forms of chemically-reactive living and active matter, in confined environments, and provides a way to predict and control these behaviors more broadly.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

Compositional theories propose that cognitive processes in neural network rely on shared components that can be reused to support different behaviors. However, previous studies have suggested that working memory components are task specific, challenging this framework. Here, we revisit this question using a population-based approach. We recorded neural activity in macaque monkeys performing two spatial working memory tasks with opposing goals: one requiring movement toward previously presented spatial locations (look task) and the other requiring avoidance of those locations (no-look task). Despite differences in task demands, we found that spatial memory representations were largely conserved at the population level, with a common low-dimensional neural subspace encoding memory across both tasks. In parallel, task identity was encoded in an orthogonal subspace, providing a stable and independent representation of contextual information. These results provide neural evidence for a compositional model of working memory, where representational geometry enables the efficient and flexible reuse of mnemonic codes across behavioral contexts while maintaining an independent representation of context.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

Lung organoids can be cultured in various formats that offer potential for studying highly pathogenic viruses. However, the effects of these different formats on virus infection remain unexplored, leaving their relative value unclear. In this study, we generated primary lung organoids from human donor cells and used them to derive monolayers and air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures with the goal of comparing the replication kinetics of two circulating highly pathogenic coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection studies revealed that organoid-derived monolayers displayed limited infection and the innate immune response was impaired against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but not against virus-like double-stranded dsRNA or poly(I:C). Meanwhile, organoids and organoid-derived ALI cultures retained viral permissivity, with ALI cultures displaying diverse antiviral immune responses against both coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV demonstrated differential replication kinetics in organoid and organoid-derived ALI cultures. Therefore, primary organoid-derived cells in two-dimensional monolayer or three-dimensional ALI formats influence virus infection and host antiviral responses.

Here we show that bacteria can mount a genome-wide, coordinated, and highly effective immune response against bacterial and viral threats using a single regulatory pathway. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that Pseudomonas species broadly possess a specialized form of the Gac/Rsm regulatory pathway (GRP), which our prior work in Pseudomonas aeruginosa implicated in activating interbacterial antagonism defense mechanisms in response to neighbor cell death. Proteomic studies comparing GRP-activated and -inactivated strains derived from diverse Pseudomonas species showed that the pathway regulates a large and variable suite of factors implicated in defense against both bacterial and phage threats. Focusing on P. protegens, we identify profound phenotypic consequences of these factors against multiple forms of bacterial antagonism and several phage. Together, our results reveal that bacteria, like more complex organisms, couple danger sensing to the activation of an immune system with antibacterial and antiviral arms.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

As implementation of faster gradients has facilitated higher sample throughput, mass spectrometers must adapt to shorter analysis times by enhancing scanning speed and sensitivity. For Orbitrap mass spectrometers, faster scan rates are constrained by the need for sufficient ion accumulation time, particularly given limitations on duty cycle at high repetition rate, and transient length, which determines analyzer sensitivity and resolving power. In this context, implementing alternative ion scheduling and better ion signal-processing strategies are needed to unleash the speed of these instruments. Here, we introduce a new scanning strategy termed pre-accumulation, which enables the storage of ions in the bent flatapole in parallel to the operation of the C-trap/IRM, leading to a significant improvement in ion beam utilization and enabling for the first time scanning speeds of >70 Hz on hybrid Orbitrap instruments. The combination of pre-accumulation and increased scan speeds notably enhances peptide and protein group identifications for short LC gradients and improves sensitivity for high-throughput applications. These benefits were further amplified when coupled with the full mass range phase-constrained spectrum deconvolution method ({Phi}SDM), especially for fast, lower-resolving Orbitrap measurements used with short LC gradients. Overall, we demonstrate that pre-accumulation of ions in the bent flatapole offers distinct advantages, particularly for conditions with reduced signal input. Since no hardware changes are required, this approach is highly attractive for Orbitrap mass spectrometers operated with fast MS/MS acquisition methods.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262

However, these studies have so far been biased towards the direct effects of heat and extreme weather in high-income countries, and so capture a small fraction of the total global burden of climate change. Expanding the use of attribution science in public health could help put pressure on policymakers to take action for human health.","NA","medrxiv",1740866870262

Here, we present the Mosquito Cell Atlas (MCA), a comprehensive single-nucleus RNA sequencing dataset of more than 367,000 nuclei from 19 dissected tissues of adult female and male Aedes aegypti, providing cellular-level resolution of mosquito biology. We identify novel cell types and expand our understanding of sensory neuron organization of chemoreceptors to all sensory tissues. Our analysis uncovers male-specific cells and sexually dimorphic gene expression in the antenna and brain. In female mosquitoes, we find that glial cells in the brain, rather than neurons, undergo the most extensive transcriptional changes following blood feeding. Our findings provide insights into the cellular basis of mosquito behavior and sexual dimorphism. The MCA aims to serve as a resource for the vector biology community, enabling systematic investigation of cell-type specific expression across all mosquito tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1740866870262
