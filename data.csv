This raises the possibility that they produce a convergent effect on the dynamics or temporal evolution of neural population activity. To explore this, we analyzed intracortical electrophysiological recordings during infusions of propofol, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine, using a rigorous method to estimate dynamical stability. We found that all three anesthetics, despite their molecular differences, similarly affect cortical states by destabilizing their dynamics. This destabilization matched the slower recovery from sensory perturbations and longer stimulus-induced autocorrelation times observed during the anesthetic infusions. The destabilization was also reflected predominantly in lower-frequency ranges, linking it to the well-known increase in low-frequency power during anesthesia. Finally, destabilization closely tracked real-time fluctuations in consciousness. Together, these findings suggest that cortical destabilization may be a shared neural correlate of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, offering a mechanistic explanation for low-frequency oscillations observed during anesthesia.","[{""name"":""Office of Naval Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rk2pe57"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MURI N00014-23-1-2768;MURI W911NF2410228;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R01MH131715-01;R01MH11559;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R21AG077275-01A1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756332488050

Leveraging sequence-to-function deep learning models, we discovered 301 sequence motifs and predicted the functional impact of genetic variants through in silico mutagenesis, thereby facilitating the decoding of the regulatory syntax of the cattle genome and fine-mapping of GWAS loci for 22 complex traits. Cross-species analysis further revealed evolutionarily conserved features of regulatory architecture and provided evolutionary insights into complex traits and diseases in humans.

This has resulted in the accumulation of studies estimating the age-specific demographic transition rates across the tree of life over the last few decades. Although this accumulation of studies has enabled comparative demographic analyses to be developed, such analyses remain difficult to perform because age-specific data are scattered across literature. Here, we present a new open-access database, malddaba, which compiles age-specific demographic rates for mammals in the wild from published information. Currently, the database encompasses 170 species from 250 publications, representing 428 age- and sex-specific survival series and 199 age- and sex-specific reproduction series. Each series is reported using a standardized approach aimed at facilitating the extraction and use of that dataset by anyone interested in comparative biology. We show how malddaba can be used to address a variety of questions, ranging from comparative ageing with the assessment of actuarial and reproductive senescence patterns in a wide diversity of mammals. We can also address questions related to comparative population dynamics. For this purpose, in addition to the raw demographic rate records, we were able to build 43 population-specific life tables using malddaba records, which allow demographic outputs to be estimated accurately, such as population growth rate and generation time for those species. The malddaba database will be regularly updated to keep adding new demographic estimates and bring a comprehensive and dynamic view of the diversity of demographic trajectories across mammals.","[{""name"":""Agence National de la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR JCJC “AGEX” (ANR-15-CE32-0002-01);ANR PRC “DivInT” (ANR-22-CE02-0020);ANR PRC “EVORA” (ANR-22-CE02-0021);""},{""name"":""Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012kf4317"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756332488050

In this study, we introduce an approach to systematically optimize the number of usable reads that RNA-seq protocols generate. We applied this ""funnel strategy"" to prime-seq, an early-barcoding bulk RNA-seq protocol, by systematically testing critical protocol steps totaling 1080 samples in 49 libraries. This resulted in the optimized prime-seq2 protocol that increases the number of usable reads by 60 % and improves one of the most cost-efficient bulk RNA-seq protocols available.

It is well known that tag fusion can cause unwanted changes in protein stability, but whether this is an inherent property of the tagged protein, or can be influenced by the cell and tissue environment, is unclear. Using a series of genome edited mouse models, we show that tag-dependent changes in protein expression can vary across different primary cell and tissue contexts. In one case (Ncaph2), a C-terminal auxin-inducible degron fusion strongly increased protein stability in some tissues but decreased it in others. Destabilisation resulted from tissue-specific  leakage of the auxin-inducible degron, which depended on TIR1 expression, and occurred selectively in the small intestine where basal concentrations of auxin / indole-3-acetic acid can reach levels that are sufficient to trigger protein degradation in cultured cells. Stabilisation occurred in post-mitotic cells via an endogenous degradation signal situated at the Ncaph2 C-terminus, which normally undergoes activation upon cell cycle exit, but is inactivated by C-terminal tag fusion. Our results highlight the underappreciated importance of cell and tissue environment in determining the consequences of tag fusions on protein expression, which may be particularly important in animal models that contain diverse cell types.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MC_PC_21040;""},{""name"":""National Science Centre, Poland"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SONATA BIS 2021/42/E/NZ1/00190;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756332488050

The present study compares the phenotypic response for different phenotypes of two epilines of Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica), with similar genetic structure across three generations following an initial genistein ingestion in the ancestors diet. Linear and linear mixed models were fitted to extract the fraction of variance allocated to multiple factors such as dam, family, sex, reproductive status and epiline. The latter was found to be significantly associated with body weight and with heart, abdominal fat and testicle weight adjusted by body weight. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the epiline progressively increased from the first generation (G0) to the last (G2), leading - for example in body weight at slaughter - to an average difference for adult males and females in G2 of 9 grams and 14 grams respectively, between genistein treated offspring (epi+) and controls (epi-). These findings suggest a possible transgenerational effect of the initial diet disruption. In tissue weights, production and behavioural traits, the effect of the epiline accounted for smaller fractions of phenotypic variability and overall large residual variances were observed, underlining the complex nature of the analysed traits. This innovative experimental design allowed for a characterization of the impact of transgenerational effects on a variety of phenotypic traits, which will be useful for prioritizing traits for future genetic and epigenetic association studies.

ImplicationsNowadays, changes in the environment occur more frequently and livestock species can struggle to adapt to these rapid shifts. It is therefore important to understand the impact of the environment on animals. In this study, we evaluate how an initial modification in prior generations can also affect subsequent ones. By collecting different traits of interest (growth, tissues, production, and behaviour), we compare the response to a change in the ancestors diet across three successive generations. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the potential multi-generational effects of changes to the environment. This could provide guidelines for better poultry management in order to ensure animal welfare while maintaining sustainable production yields.","[{""name"":""European Union Horizon2020"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101000236;""},{""name"":""INRAE animal genetics division"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""La Région Occitanie"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756332488050

Here, we show that LSD treatment significantly extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans and reduces age-associated lipofuscin accumulation, indicative of delayed cellular aging. LSD reproduces several CR-like phenotypes, including decreased reproductive output and increased nuclear localization of the transcription factor PHA-4/FOXA, without affecting food intake. Moreover, LSD treatment reduces lipid stores and downregulates global protein synthesis, both hallmark signatures of TOR inhibition.

Within the sand flys alimentary tract, these parasite forms encounter shifts in temperature, pH and nutrient availability, which trigger significant morphological and physiological adaptations. Membrane transporter proteins, channels and pumps play a crucial role in facilitating the movement of solutes across eukaryotic membranes. Previously, a systematic loss-of-function screen of the L. mexicana ""transportome"" identified forty transporter deletion mutants that caused significant loss of fitness in macrophage and mouse infections. Here, using an independently generated library of over 300 barcoded gene deletion mutants, we monitored their growth fitness for seven days in vitro and tested which transporters are required for Leishmania promastigotes to successfully colonise Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies for nine days. Overall, fitness scores correlated between promastigotes from long-term in vitro culture and in vivo sand fly infections. More importantly, for 34 mutants, a significant loss of fitness was observed exclusively in vivo. Moreover, deletion of the vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) proved detrimental for parasite persistence and promastigote differentiation in the sand fly, uncovering a key role for the V-ATPase at different stages throughout the Leishmania life cycle.

Author SummaryLeishmania parasites cause leishmaniases - a group of neglected tropical diseases that affect millions of people worldwide. These parasites must survive in two radically different environments: inside a mammalian host and within the gut of a blood-feeding sand fly. To thrive in the sand fly, Leishmania undergo extensive physiological changes and depend on transporter proteins to move nutrients and other molecules across their cell membranes. In this study, we focused on identifying which of these transporters are critical for the parasites survival inside the sand fly. We used a genetically engineered library of Leishmania promastigotes - the parasite form adapted to the insect vector - to assess the importance of more than 300 different transporter genes. We discovered that 34 of these transporters are essential for successful colonization of the sand fly. Among them, one key protein complex - the vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) pump - was found to be crucial for parasite survival in the insect vector. Our findings deepen our understanding of how Leishmania adapts to life within the sand fly and highlight potential molecular targets for disrupting its transmission.","[{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""trans-LEISHion-EU FP7, No. 798736;LeishBlock-Horizon, No. 101148623;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""104111/Z/14/Z;104627/Z/14/Z;200807/Z/16/Z;211075/Z/18/Z;221944/A/20/Z;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/V000446/1;""},{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_220011;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756332488050

Based on the number of formants, two different coda quality categories have been described: a-codas and i-codas. In the present paper, we demonstrate that sperm whale codas not only resemble human vowels acoustically, but also pattern like them across several dimensions. First, traditional count- and timing-based coda types interact with coda ""vowel"" quality (a vs. i). Second, a-codas are generally longer than i-codas. Third, the duration of i-codas has a bimodal distribution, showing a contrast between short i-codas and long[i] -codas. Fourth, the baseline coda length differs across whales. And fifth, edge clicks mismatching their coda often match an adjacent coda, a phenomenon that resembles human coarticulation. All five properties have close parallels in the phonetics and phonology of human languages. Sperm whale coda vocalizations thus represent one of the closest parallels to human phonology of any known animal communication system.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSperm whales communicate using series of clicks known as codas. The codas acoustically resemble human vowels. In addition, they pattern in ways similar to human sound systems. For example, different coda types are correlated with particular click qualities, and their durations are intentionally controlled. This shows that sperm whale vocalizations are highly complex and likely constitute one of the most sophisticated communication systems in the animal kingdom. By studying it, we may be able to gain a broader understanding of animal intelligence and social behaviors, determine the impact of human activities on whale habitat, develop strategies to protect whales from threats such as noise pollution and ship traffic, and advance legislation which facilitates that protection.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756332488050

The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) integrates multiple metabolic inputs to produce uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a central substrate for protein and lipid glycoconjugates. While UDP-GlcNAc levels influence pluripotency, the broader metabolic roles of the HBP in stem cell maintenance and differentiation remain largely unexplored. Using proteomic and metabolomic analyses, we uncovered extensive enzymatic remodelling of the HBP during early mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation, including a significant decrease in N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc6P) levels, despite stable UDP-GlcNAc levels. Isotope labelling experiments revealed that pluripotent stem cells maintain UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis through a combination of glucose-driven de novo synthesis and the N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) salvage pathway, both of which are downregulated during differentiation. Functionally, we identified GlcNAc6P--a point of convergence of the de novo synthesis and the salvage pathways--as a pivotal metabolite of stem cell fate. Preventing GlcNAc6P's deacetylation by deleting or depleting AMDHD2 impaired mESC differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that GlcNAc6P catabolism is essential for sustaining cytosolic acetate and in turn acetyl-CoA levels, which are critical for lipid synthesis and histone modifications required for pluripotency exit. These findings establish AMDHD2 as a key supplier of cellular acetate and reveal an essential metabolic link between HBP activity and acetyl-CoA homeostasis. By expanding the role of the HBP beyond UDP-GlcNAc production, this study reveals an unrecognised metabolic vulnerability that can be exploited to manipulate stem cell identity.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE 2326/3-1;""},{""name"":""Jürgen Manchot Stiftung"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PhD project Lea Hund;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756332488050

Players often rely on caffeinated or sugary drinks to combat fatigue, but regular use poses health risks. Sparkling water, a sugar- and caffeine-free beverage, stimulates brainstem and prefrontal activity via sensory pathways mediated by transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in the throat. We here tested the hypothesis that sparkling water mitigates cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play. Fifteen young adult players participated in a randomized crossover trial, each completing two 3-hour sessions of a virtual football game while consuming either sparkling water or plain water. Subjective fatigue, enjoyment, and executive function (via a flanker task) were measured at baseline and hourly, while pupil diameter and heart rate were monitored continuously. Blood glucose and salivary cortisol were also assessed periodically.

Compared to plain water, sparkling water significantly attenuated increases in subjective fatigue, enhanced enjoyment, and preserved executive function, along with preventing pupil constriction. Heart rate, blood glucose, and salivary cortisol levels did not differ between conditions. Notably, players committed fewer in-game fouls with sparkling water, while offensive and defensive performance remained unchanged. These findings demonstrate that sparkling water alleviates both subjective and objective signs of cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play, supporting our hypothesis. This non-caffeinated intervention may help sustain inhibitory control and promote fair behavior, offering a safe and sustainable strategy for managing mental fatigue in modern life.

The IUCN Red List provides guidelines for assessing climate-related extinction risk using species distribution models (SDMs) and spatially explicit population models (SEPMs). However, a systematic evaluation of these guidelines is currently missing. Using simulations of virtual species with diverse life-history traits and range dynamics, we found that SDMs consistently underestimated extinction risk for range-shifting species. This was due to a concave relationship between population size and habitat loss, which contradicts the linear assumption in the Red List guidelines. For range-contracting species, SDMs provided adequate warning times. Probabilistic extinction estimates from SEPMs provided delayed warning for all species, particularly for highly threatened ones. Our results reveal key limitations of current Red List guidelines under climate change. Based on our findings, we provide tentative recommendations for updating the IUCN Red List guidelines.","[{""name"":""German Research Foundation (DFG)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ZU 361/6-1;DFG– _FZT 118, 202548816;""},{""name"":""Leibniz Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01n6r0e97"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P52/2017;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756332488050

Despite their critical role, the structural organization of kinetochores assembled on centromeres with vastly distinct architectures across diverse species remains poorly understood2,3. To address this question, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the inner kinetochore (CCAN) from the silkmoth Bombyx mori, an insect that lacks the canonical centromere-specifying histone variant CENP-A and exhibits chromosome-wide centromeric activity (holocentric). Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour l’Education et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756332488050

Here, we connect cell state dynamics of type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2) in cholangitis with site-specific{gamma}{delta} T17 responses in liver and draining lymph nodes (LN).

MethodsThe 0.1% Diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-Dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet was used to generate an immunobiliary DC- and{gamma}{delta} T-enriched mouse liver and LN single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas covering temporal disease dynamics, resolution and cDC2B depletion. cDC2 trajectories were inferred using VarID2 and{gamma}{delta} T cell transcription factor (TF) regulon activity was predicted by SCENIC. The human biliary niche was resolved by integrating human liver scRNA-seq data with available spatial transcriptomics data. Functional studies were conducted using Tcrd knockout, Il17a/f knockout and Tcrd reporter mice.

ResultsA disease trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B was identified connecting DC maturation, homing and the expression of Il17-inducing genes. Disease progression was associated with numeric exhaustion of mature cDC2B and recruitment of DC precursors.{gamma}{delta} T cells were the main Il17 producers and were subtyped into Il17ahigh Scart1+ V{gamma}6+ and Il17low Scart2+ V{gamma}4+ populations exhibiting cDC2-directed communication and divergent TF regulon activity. Spatial proximity and conserved molecular interactions of cDC2 and{gamma}{delta} T cells were confirmed in human cholangitis. Il17-deficiency resulted in reduced liver fibrosis in mice, while cDC2B depletion attenuated{gamma}{delta} T17 cell states.

ConclusionsIn cholangitis, a profibrogenic function of{gamma}{delta} T cells is contingent on the induction by peribiliary cDC2B, thereby highlighting relevant disease determinants within the immunobiliary and liver-draining LN niche.

Impact and ImplicationsThe immunobiliary niche contains rare immune cells such as conventional dendritic cells and unconventional T cells, however, the function of these cell types in liver inflammation remains poorly understood. Mirroring human biliary diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, we induced experimental cholangitis in a mouse model to generate a site-specific single-cell sequencing atlas resource resolving underexplored cell populations. Our data capture a profibrotic hepatic disease state trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B inducing a{gamma}{delta} T cell-specific Il17-response, which is attenuated upon cDC2B depletion and in DC precursors, which are characterized by reduced genomic accessibility of{gamma}{delta} T cell-interacting genes.

These results highlight the importance of portal niche residing underexplored immune cell populations and the necessity to further resolve immunobiliary niche responses and crosstalk in inflammatory settings such as in cholangitis.

A key component of social behavior is approach, where animals actively move to-ward social partners to maintain group cohesion, establish affiliations, and coordinate actions. While a continuous stream of social information is encoded across sensory modalities, it remains unclear whether a distinct neural process underlies social approach. Here, we developed a novel assay in which a head-fixed, tail-free zebrafish interacts with a freely swimming conspecific, enabling precise quantification of social behavior alongside whole-brain functional imaging at cellular resolution. We demonstrate that zebrafish approach behavior is jointly shaped by spatial and temporal information from conspecifics rather than by these features acting independently. Social approach behavior is preceded by distinct brain-wide neural activity patterns emerging seconds before movement onset, characterized by increased activity in a small subset of forebrain neurons and decreased activity in midbrain and hindbrain neuronal populations. These activity patterns reliably predict upcoming approach movements from each of these regions separately. Moreover, the extent to which neural activity distinguishes approach from non-approach movements predicts individual differences in social behavior, directly linking neural dynamics to behavioral variability. Together, our findings reveal a neural mechanism underlying social approach behavior, highlighting how a distributed yet functionally coordinated network facilitates social interaction.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756332488050
