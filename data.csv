DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]). Negative control outcomes did not show any indication of meaningful unobserved residual confounding.

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. They underscore the need to evaluate vaccines using clinical endpoints that extend beyond their targeted diseases.

Panic disorder, diagnosed in 2- 4%3, involves recurrent attacks followed by persistent worry about further attacks, leading to functional impairment and avoidance behaviours1,2. We conducted genome-wide association meta-analyses of panic attacks and panic disorder (61,746 and 29,775 cases, respectively, and 105,814 controls), identifying the first genome-wide significant variants for both traits (16 for panic attacks; 7 for panic disorder). Geneset analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing data implicated afferent neurons from the eye, heart, and lung in panic attacks, suggesting a critical role for sensory processing and interoceptive awareness. Further analyses suggested that these associations generalize to other psychiatric disorders. These findings offer novel insights into the biological mechanisms underlying panic, the role of afferent neurons, and may inform the development of more targeted and effective interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1750284580003

Previous structural studies have advanced our understanding of hantavirus glycoprotein architecture and function, however, the lack of high-resolution in situ structures of the glycoprotein tetramer and its lattice organization has limited mechanistic insights into viral assembly, entry, and antigenicity. Here, we leveraged a virus-like particle (VLP) system to establish a cryo-electron microscopy workflow for lattice-forming viral glycoproteins. This enabled the determination of a 2.35 A resolution structure of the membrane-embedded Andes virus (ANDV) glycoprotein tetramer, as well as structures of dimers of tetramers and a complex with antibody ADI-65534. These structures reveal previously uncharacterized features of glycoprotein organization, stability, and pH-sensing. Immunization of mice with self-amplifying replicon RNA (repRNA) encoding ANDV-VLPs elicited high levels of glycoprotein-binding antibodies but equivalent titers of neutralizing antibodies compared to repRNA-encoded native ANDV glycoprotein complex.

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.

Simultaneously, pathogens secrete effectors to promote host colonization through various mechanisms, including targeted host microbiota manipulation. Here, we characterize the Av2 effector of the vascular wilt fungus Verticillium dahliae as a suppressor of the cry for help. Inspired by in silico antimicrobial activity prediction, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of Av2 in vitro. Furthermore, its role in V. dahliae virulence was assessed through microbiota sequencing of inoculated plants, microbial co-cultivation assays, and inoculations in a gnotobiotic plant cultivation system. We show that Av2 inhibits bacterial growth, and acts as a virulence factor during host colonization. Microbiota sequencing revealed involvement of Av2 in suppression of Pseudomonas spp. recruitment upon plant inoculation with V. dahliae, suggesting that Av2 suppresses the cry for help. We show that several Pseudomonas spp. are antagonistic to V. dahliae and sensitive to Av2 treatment. We conclude that V. dahliae secretes Av2 to supress the cry for help by inhibiting the recruitment of antagonistic Pseudomonas spp. to pave the way for successful plant invasion.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

In ovules of Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana), one of the two synergid cells degenerates at fertilization, while the fertilized egg cell (zygote) undergoes directional elongation followed by asymmetric division to initiate embryonic patterning. However, morphological analysis of these events has been hampered by the limitations of conventional cell wall staining, which fails to label cells lacking complete walls, and by the requirement for transgenic fluorescent reporters to visualize cell outlines. Here, we report that the membrane-specific fluorescent dye FM4-64 readily permeates ovules, allowing clear visualization of reproductive cell morphology both before and after fertilization. This staining method supports high-resolution time-lapse imaging and quantitative analysis of early embryogenesis in living tissues. Importantly, it is applicable not only to the angiosperm A. thaliana but also to the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (M. polymorpha) and the fern Ceratopteris richardii (C. richardii), enabling the visualization of live reproductive cell structures within maternal tissues and revealing fertilization-associated morphological changes. This simple and robust method thus provides a valuable tool for spatiotemporal and quantitative analyses of reproductive processes across a broad range of plant species, without the need to generate transgenic lines.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

In such cases, we understand the information by selectively attending to one of the modalities. Previous research has shown that selective attention to a specific stimulus modality modulates cortical activity patterns. However, it remains unclear which aspects of linguistic information are selectively modulated by attention and how such modulation influences the decodability of semantic content. To address this question, we constructed decoding models of latent semantic features from the functional magnetic resonance imaging data of six participants in both unimodal (either visual or auditory) and bimodal conditions (simultaneously visual and auditory, with participants attending to a single modality at a time). In unimodal conditions, we successfully decoded the semantic contents from the brain activity. Decodable features were consistent across modalities in both intra-modal and cross-modal decoding. For bimodal conditions, decoding accuracies for the attended stimuli were higher than for the ignored when training and test stimuli belonged to the same modality. Furthermore, decodable features were more consistent across modalities with attended than ignored stimuli in both intra-modal and cross-modal decoding. These results indicate common decodable semantic features regardless of the presentation modality and that selective attention enhances the semantic representations contributing to such decodability.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

Single-nucleus transcriptomics reveal a conserved FUS-dependent gene network downregulated in these mice and ALS-ci patients.

His Y-chromosome has been hypothesized to belong to haplogroup C3* (C2a1a3-F1918) but this has yet to be substantiated. To explore the genetic ancestry of Genghis Khan, we analyzed four archaeological individuals from the Golden Horde, including three males and one female, who were buried in separate medieval elite mausoleums in the Ulitau region of Kazakstan. One of the males is believed to be Joshi (Juchi), the eldest son of Genghis Khan. We generated genomic data from these archaeological individuals and found that the three males were paternally related, sharing the Y-chromosome haplogroup C3*, consistent with the hypothesized signature haplotype of Genghis Khan.

Here we investigate the critical functions of chromatin regulator MORC2 in epigenome reprogramming of the repetitive genome in early human neurodevelopment. We find that reversible ATP-dependent dimerization is required for MORC2 accumulation over L1s but not gene promoters. Mutation of the MORC2 ATPase module, causative for neurodevelopmental disorders, severely disrupts the distribution of MORC2 chromatin binding, leading to simultaneous loss of L1 transcriptional control and hyper-repression of clustered ZNF genes in human pluripotent stem cells. Upon neural differentiation these phenotypes persist due to striking, targeted defects in CpG methylation patterning. Together our results define the vital role of MORC2 in safeguarding the somatic human genome upon exit of pluripotency by directing CpG methylation patterning over transcriptionally-active retrotransposons in a manner analogous to the piRNA pathway in the germline.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

C_LIO_LIHere, we present a unified framework for performing Bayesian analysis of social transmission using NBDA-type models, implemented in the widely used Stan programming language. We provide a user-friendly R package ""STbayes"" (ST: social transmission) for other researchers to easily use this framework. STbayes accepts user-formatted data, but can also import data directly from the existing NBDA R package. Based on the data users provide, STbayes automatically generates multi-network, multi-diffusion models that allow for individual covariates that may influence transmission, as well as individual-level varying (random) effects.
C_LIO_LIUsing simulated data, we demonstrate that this model can accurately differentiate the relative contribution of individual and social learning in the spread of information through networked populations. We illustrate how incorporating upstream uncertainty about the relationships between individuals in the social group can improve model fit. We show that our framework can be used to infer complex transmission rules and describe a new parameterization of frequency-dependent transmission that is more numerically stable than prior parameterizations. Finally, we introduce support for dynamic transmission weights and a ""high-resolution"" data mode, which allows users to make use of fine-scale data collected by contemporary automated tracking methods. These extensions increase the set of contexts that this type of model may be used for.

Here, we present a comprehensive proximity labeling study of five conserved Caenorhabditis elegans proteins--NEKL-2, NEKL-3, MLT-2, MLT-3, and MLT-4--that form two NEKL-MLT kinase-scaffold subcomplexes involved in membrane trafficking and actin regulation. Using endogenously expressed TurboID fusions and a data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (MS) pipeline, we profiled NEKL-MLT interactomes across 23 experiments, including several methodological variations, applying stringent controls and filtering strategies. By analyzing and comparing experimental outcomes, we develop a set of intuitive quantitative metrics to assess experimental outcomes and quality. We demonstrate that DIA-based workflows produce sensitive physiologically relevant findings, even in the presence of experimental noise and variability across biological replicates. Our approach is validated through the identification of known NEKL-MLT binding partners and conserved genetic suppressors of nekl-mlt mutant phenotypes. Gene ontology enrichment further supports the involvement of newly identified NEKL-MLT interactors in processes including membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal regulation, and cell adhesion. Additionally, several novel proximate interactors were functionally validated using genetic assays. Our findings underscore the utility of DIA-MS in proximity labeling applications and highlight the value of incorporating internal controls, quantitative metrics, and biological validation to enhance confidence in candidate interactors. Overall, this study provides a scalable, organismal-level strategy for probing endogenous protein networks and offers practical guidelines for proximity labeling in multicellular systems.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

CRISPR-Cas systems are known to be important regulators of these host-MGE interactions, but a global understanding of CRISPR-Cas diversity, activity, and roles across Earths biomes is still lacking. Here, we use an optimized computational approach to search short-read data and collect [~]800 million CRISPR spacers across [~]450,000 public metagenomes. Comparing spacers across samples and taxa revealed a high population diversity for CRISPR loci overall, with typically only a small subset of spacers detected as prevalent and conserved within a microbial population. From this extensive CRISPR spacer dataset, we identified 1.18 billion hits between 41 million spacers and 2.5 million viruses and plasmids. Prevalent and conserved spacers were over-represented in these MGE-matching spacers, and CRISPR spacers frequently matched multiple MGEs, consistent with a positive selection pressure associated with MGE targeting. Focusing on the role of CRISPR as anti-phage defense, we observed surprising cases of viruses targeted by microbes not expected to be viable hosts. These were more frequent for viruses encoding a diversification mechanism (DGR) for their host attachment proteins, and associated with a reduced rate of escape mutations. This suggests that broad spacer targeting may derive from the recurring entry of a virus genome into a non-host microbial cell, leading to some viruses being targeted by taxonomically diverse microbes well outside of their actual host range. Taken together, this petabase-scale exploration of CRISPR arrays in nature outlines the extensive diversity of CRISPR array loci across microbiomes. It highlights several key genomic and ecological parameters driving the activity of CRISPR arrays that are likely influencing strain-level diversification and selection processes within microbial populations.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

Unlike traditional learning rules, BTSP learns correlations on the timescales of seconds and rapidly changes single-unit activity in only a few trials. To explore how BTSP-like learning can be integrated into network models, we propose a generalized BTSP rule (gBTSP), which we apply to unsupervised and supervised learning tasks, in both feedforward and recurrent networks. Unsupervised gBTSP mirrors classical frameworks of competitive learning, learning place field maps (in the feed-forward case), and attractive memory networks (in the recurrent case). For supervised learning, we show that plateau events can reduce task error, enabling gBTSP to solve tasks such as trajectory matching and delayed non-match-to-sample. However, we find that credit assignment via gBTSP becomes harder to achieve with increased network depth or CA3-like recurrence. This suggests that additional features may be needed to support BTSP-mediated few-shot learning of complex tasks in the hippocampus.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

Using Perturb-map, we determine how dozens of different gene perturbations shape the growth and cellular environments of PDAC clones through space and time. Our study reveals dynamic, gene-specific adaptations of immune neighborhoods during clonal selection. We identified Serpinb2 (PAI2) and Serpine1 (PAI1) as key cancer-derived mediators of TME remodeling and immune evasion. These factors promote the deposition of a fibrin-rich ECM that shapes immune cell composition, locally retains and polarizes immunosuppressive macrophages and excludes cytotoxic T cells. Deletion of either Serpinb2 or Serpine1 greatly enhanced tumor response to anti-PD1 immunotherapy in an aggressive PDAC model. Transcriptomic analysis further linked their expression to distinct PDAC subtypes and poor patient survival. Our findings demonstrate that Serpinb2 and Serpine1 establish a permissive niche for tumor progression and show how PDAC cells exploit components of the fibrinolysis pathway to remodel the ECM, alter macrophage composition, and protect themselves from immune editing, ultimately reinforcing the role of extracellular factors in shaping an immune-privileged tumor niche.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

Despite the numerous candidate proteins proposed, none have withstood genetic ablation, leaving them relegated to auxiliary regulatory roles. To date, no essential mPTP component has been identified. Here, we establish ATAD3 as the first essential component of the mPTP. Genetic deletion of Atad3 in cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes renders heart and liver mitochondria incapable of undergoing Ca2+-induced mPTP-dependent swelling. Moreover, these mitochondria exhibit the highest Ca2+ retention capacity ever reported following genetic perturbation of the mPTP. Furthermore, patch-clamp recordings of recombinant ATAD3a in liposomes reveal intrinsic channel activity. Given the established role of mPTP-dependent necrosis in driving ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, we show that cardiac-specific Atad3 deletion markedly reduces infarct size following I/R, with no additive protection from cyclosporine A. Together, these findings establish ATAD3 as an core, putative pore-forming component essential for mPTP opening and mPTP-dependent necrosis, resolving a long-standing mystery in mitochondrial biology.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

In contrast to the highly differentiated sex chromosomes of mammals, birds, and Drosophila, most anurans (frogs and toads) maintain homomorphic sex chromosomes that exhibit a rapid turnover, even among closely related species. To uncover the mechanisms underlying the emergence of new master sex-determining genes and sex chromosome turnover, we analysed 53 published anurans and one caecilian genome (>200 Ma divergence) and available transcriptomes. We asked how often new master sex-determining genes arise by gene duplication, whether and how often gene translocation associates with sex chromosome turnover, and if new master sex-determining genes evolve under positive selection. We find that chromosome-level synteny is remarkably conserved, with only a few fusions or fissions and no evidence for translocation of four candidate master sex-determining genes (Dmrt1, Foxl2, Bod1l, Sox3). Only Dmrt1 duplicated in 3 out of 50 species (excluding tetraploid Xenopus), and it showed strong testis-biased expression in all 8 species with available gonadal expression data. While Dmrt1 has evolved under purifying selection, Dmrt1 duplicates exhibit elevated nonsynonymous substitution rates and a tendency towards positive selection. Lineage-specific amino acid changes were observed in the conserved DM domain of Dmrt1. These results demonstrate that, in anurans, master sex-determining genes arise rarely via gene duplication, and more likely evolve via allelic diversification. Sex chromosome turnover is not associated with gene translocation, and is more likely driven by mutations on genes involved in sexual developmental pathway. All candidate sex-determining genes were under strong purifying selection, with the exception of duplications which are linked to positive selection. Our results suggest future research on anuran sex determination and sex chromosome evolution should focus on identifying allelic diversification and novel mutations on genes involved in sexual developmental pathway.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

Viral antigen triggered innate immune response leads to induction of interferons (IFNs) and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) including ADAR1 p150 isoform, which edits adenosine (A) residues within double stranded RNAs in both the virus and the host. Such RNA editing mediated by ADARs plays a crucial role in innate immune responses during viral infections through modulation of host-virus interactions. Additionally, ADAR editing acts post-transcriptionally, and serves as a mechanism of dynamic regulation of transcriptome and proteome diversity. While evidence points to changes in ADAR editing during infection, we do not know whether editing targets change over the course of the infection. Here, we explored temporal changes in ADAR expression and editing patterns, across three distinct stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we examined whether infection-triggered dysregulation in ADAR editing persists or returns to pre-infection states post-viral clearance. We addressed this question by analyzing publicly available whole blood RNA sequencing samples from forty-five, age-matched individuals. The individuals selected had no documented comorbidities, developed mild COVID-19, and were sampled across three distinct stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection: pre-, mid-, and post-infection. Our results demonstrate dynamic changes in ADAR expression and editing across the three stages. We further identified unique editing sites resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection, across all three stages of infection, within genes involved in immune response pathways. Noteworthy, genes within neutrophil degranulation pathway appear to be edited, suggesting they may play a role in inflammation and sequelae observed post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results demonstrate a consistent trend of elevated ADAR expression and reduced overall ADAR editing within each individual mid-infection. Subsequently, in some post-infection samples ADAR expression returns to approximately pre-infection levels, while in others it remains dysregulated. These differences may be contributing to heterogeneity in disease outcomes seen in individuals post-SARS-CoV-2 infection.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

We tested these prompts on open-source Llama and medically fine-tuned Llama models to steer their alignment toward accurate concept assignment across multiple prompt formats. Domain-tuned models consistently outperform general models of the same size in retrieval and generative tasks.

Studies of neural circuit evolution often focus on a few elements within a network. However, addressing fundamental questions in evolutionary neuroscience, such as whether some elements are more evolvable than others, requires a more global and unbiased approach. Here, we used synapse-level comparative connectomics to examine how an entire olfactory circuit evolves. We compared the full antennal lobe connectome of the larvae of two closely related Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. erecta, which differ in their ecological niches and odour-driven behaviours. We found that evolutionary change is unevenly distributed across the network. Some features, including neuron types, neuron numbers and interneuron-to-interneuron connectivity, are highly conserved. These conserved elements delineate a core circuit blueprint presumably required for fundamental olfactory processing. Superimposed on this scaffold, we find rewiring changes that mirror each species ecologies, including a systematic shift in the excitation-to-inhibition balance in the feedforward pathways. We further show that some neurons have changed more than others, and that even within individual neurons some synaptic elements remain conserved while others display major species-specific changes, suggesting evolutionary hot-spots within the circuit. Our findings reveal constrained and adaptable elements within olfactory networks, and establish a framework for identifying general principles in the evolution of neural circuits underlying behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

Meta-analyses revealed that otto-SR generated newly statistically significant conclusions in 2 reviews and negated significance in 1 review. These findings demonstrate that LLMs can autonomously conduct and update systematic reviews with superhuman performance, laying the foundation for automated, scalable, and reliable evidence synthesis.","NA","medrxiv",1750284580003

The composition of epithelial cells in human pulmonary fibrosis - irrespective of disease etiology - is marked by the presence of Aberrant Basaloid cells: an abnormal cell phenotype with pro-fibrotic and senescent features, localized to the surface of fibrotic lesions. Despite their relevance to human pulmonary fibrosis, the exotic molecular profile of Aberrant Basaloid cells has obscured their etiology, preventing insights into how or why these cells emerge with fibrosis. Here we identify cellular intermediaries between Aberrant Basaloid and normal alveolar epithelial cells in human IPF tissue. We track the emergence of Aberrant Basaloid cells from alveolar epithelial cells ex vivo and uncover a role for similar cells in epithelial regeneration under normal conditions. Lastly, we characterize the epigenetic changes that distinguish Aberrant Basaloid cells from their progenitors and identify hallmarks of AP-1 injury memory retention. This study elucidates the phenomenon of maladaptive epithelial plasticity and regeneration in pulmonary fibrosis and re-contextualizes therapeutic strategies for epithelial dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

MethodsIn 543 cognitively unimpaired DELCODE participants, we modelled four-year interrelations between medial temporal lobe to ventricle ratio (MTLV-ratio), WMH, and PACC5 performance using latent growth curve modelling. We quantified unique contributions of brain changes to cognitive change and derived a domain-general brain maintenance index. Associations with lifestyle and personality were examined post-hoc.

ResultsSteeper MTLV-ratio decline related to baseline WMH and its progression. Brain-domain changes independently contributed to cognitive changes. Neuroticism, depressive symptoms, and low cognitive engagement related to unfavourable domain-specific trajectories and brain maintenance index.

DiscussionDynamics of WMH and ageing-related atrophy on cognitive ageing highlight their relevance for brain maintenance. Our results suggest that maintaining cerebrovascular and mental health alongside cognitive engagement could promote brain maintenance, delay cognitive decline and dementia.","NA","medrxiv",1750284580003

In this study, we investigated time-resolved changes in cortical E/I balance and their network-level and structural correlates in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. High-density EEG recordings encompassing at least one recorded seizure were obtained from pre-surgical evaluations. Using source-reconstructed EEG, we tracked dynamic changes in the aperiodic exponent of the power spectrum, a non-invasive proxy for E/I balance, during preictal and interictal periods. Directed functional connectivity was assessed using spectral Granger causality, and correlations with cortical thickness and neurotransmitter receptor density were evaluated. We found that the aperiodic exponent increased progressively in the minutes preceding seizures, reflecting a widespread shift toward cortical inhibition. This pattern was specific to the preictal state and evident across both epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic regions. Periodic activity in delta and theta bands also increased prior to seizures, supporting a global reorganization of cortical excitability. At the functional profile level, epileptogenic regions demonstrated significantly greater outward connectivity than both their inward connectivity and that of non-epileptogenic areas during the preictal phase. Moreover, E/I balance was differentially related to connectivity patterns: non-epileptogenic regions showed a positive correlation between inhibition (higher aperiodic exponent) and outward connectivity, whereas epileptogenic regions displayed a trend toward the opposite pattern. Structure-function coupling also diverged: cortical thickness positively correlated with inhibitory tone in non-epileptogenic regions but not in epileptogenic ones. Finally, we observed that lower values of muscarinic receptor density corresponded to an E/I balance shifted towards inhibition (ie., higher aperiodic exponent), linking cholinergic tone with preictal E/I dynamics. These findings indicate that seizure onset is preceded by a shift toward inhibition at the whole-brain level, accompanied by distinct patterns of directed connectivity and disrupted structural coupling in epileptogenic networks. This multiscale perspective highlights the interplay between electrophysiology, network topology and cortical architecture systems in the moments leading up to seizure onset. Our results support and enlarge the interictal suppression hypothesis, suggesting a network protective mechanism through inhibition, related to a perturbatory event as the seizure onset. Overall, the dynamic aperiodic exponent emerges as a promising non-invasive marker with potential applications in seizure prediction and network-targeted neuromodulation.","NA","medrxiv",1750284580003

Here we propose a new method, pleiotropic heritability with bias correction (PHBC), to estimate pleiotropic heritability (h2pleio), defined as the liability-scale genetic variance of a target disease that is shared with a specific set of auxiliary diseases. We estimate h2pleio from GWAS summary statistics by estimating the proportion of variance explained from an estimated genetic correlation matrix and employing a Monte-Carlo bias correction procedure to account for sampling noise in genetic correlation estimates. Simulations showed that PHBC produces approximately unbiased estimates of pleiotropic heritability. The average ratio of pleiotropic heritability vs. total SNP-heritability (h2pleio/h 2) across 15 diseases from the UK Biobank (spanning 7 disease categories) was 34% (s.e. 7%). Several diseases were dominated by pleiotropic heritability, including depression (71%) and type 2 diabetes (65%). Pleiotropic heritability was broadly distributed across disease categories, with h2pleio /h2decreasing only slightly when removing all auxiliary diseases in the target disease category (avg = 31% (s.e. 7%)) and only moderately when further removing one other (most informative) category whose removal had the greatest impact (avg = 20% (s.e. 3%)). Average 2pleio 2 increased to 44% (s.e. 9%) when adding 16 auxiliary quantitative traits in UK Biobank, and 50% (s.e. 5%) when further adding 30 auxiliary diseases from large GWAS meta-analyses. On average, h2pleio/h2 was 2.4x larger than the proportion of liability-scale total phenotypic variance explained by the same set of auxiliary diseases, implying higher pleiotropy for genetic effects than the effects of non-genetic exposures. In conclusion, we have uncovered pervasive sharing of genetic aetiologies, with roughly half of common disease heritability being pleiotropic with diseases from a broad range of disease categories, which strongly motivates the importance of multi-disease approaches to risk prediction and therapeutic development.","NA","medrxiv",1750284580003

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

Since the amygdala is a hub for emotional regulation and fear memory, we hypothesized that accumulation of ApoER2-Dab1 components in amygdala may correlate with cognitive or neuropsychiatric manifestations of AD.

METHODSWe used single-marker and multiplex immunohistochemistry to label ApoER2-Dab1 components in amygdala from 32 cases spanning the clinicopathological spectrum of AD.

RESULTSSeven ApoER2-Dab1 pathway components accumulated in amygdala and correlated with histological progression and cognitive or neurobehavioral deficits in AD. ApoER2-Dab1 components accumulated within ApoER2-expressing neurons and dystrophic neurites surrounding ApoE-enriched extracellular plaques.

The etiology of PMDD, or more generally premenstrual syndrome (PMS) including subclinical forms, is not well understood and both biological and psychological models have been postulated. In the current manuscript we explore the role of emotion regulation ability for the emergence of premenstrual symptoms. Specifically, we were interested whether difficulties in emotion regulation in women with PMS/PMDD persisted as a trait across all cycle phases or were specific to the symptomatic premenstrual phase. We also explored for the first time, whether difficulties in emotion regulation already emerged during the high progesterone mid-luteal phase. 105 women aged 18 to 35 years completed a trait questionnaire on difficulties in emotion regulation, as well as two state measures of emotion regulation during three cycle phases (mid-follicular, mid-luteal, premenstrual). PMS/PMDD was prospectively confirmed across two menstrual cycles in 54 women, while the remaining 51 were assigned to the control group. Our results confirm previous findings that women with PMS/PMDD subjectively report more difficulties in emotion regulation on a trait scale. However, these difficulties were not confirmed in any of the state measures employed in the current study. Furthermore, difficulties in emotion regulation did not account for premenstrual symptom severity in a mediation analysis. This raises the question, whether difficulties in emotion regulation underly premenstrual symptoms or the perception of impaired emotion regulation arises as a consequence of untreated PMS/PMDD. Noteworthy, we were also able to demonstrate via Bayesian analyses, that mood worsening in the premenstrual phase is not a universal occurrence and absent in healthy controls. Taken together these findings highlight the importance of adequate diagnosis and treatment of PMDD.","NA","medrxiv",1750284580003

Their carriage often corresponds with changes to the host transcriptome, but it is unknown during which stage of the conjugation process these transcriptional changes are initiated, and how gene transfer is modulated as they occur. This is because they are normally studied after their full acquisition by conjugation has already occurred, not during the process. Here, active RP4 conjugation revealed that the transcriptional response to plasmid acquisition is almost immediate and is host and surface factor dependent. Responses included activation of non-SOS stress pathways, motility, exopolysaccharide production, anaerobic respiration, and metabolic adaptation. These responses were not a barrier to conjugation, indicating that their significance relates to host homeostasis rather than gene transfer. The recipient could prevent these responses by blocking conjugation through capsule expression. RP4 expression was also inhibited by recipient capsule, since capsule physically blocked donor-recipient contact. Unexpectedly, within a population, RP4 was found to exploit single cell variation in recipient capsule thickness and to successfully conjugate with recipient bacteria with reduced capsule. These results show a novel interplay between plasmid and surface architecture across diverse species that controls the conjugation transcriptional landscape, with important ramifications for plasmid dissemination and evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

However, current tools employing variational inference on single-cell datasets, including methods for paired and mosaic integration, transfer learning, and modality imputation, typically act as black boxes. This lack of interpretability makes it challenging to evaluate whether biological variation is preserved, which can compromise downstream analyses. Here, we introduce NetworkVI, a sparse deep generative model designed for the integration and interpretation of multimodal single-cell data. NetworkVI utilizes biological prior knowledge as an inductive bias, specifically it relies on gene-gene interactions inferred from topologically associated domains and structured ontologies like the Gene Ontology to aggregate gene embeddings to cell embeddings, enhancing the interpretability at the gene and subcellular level. While achieving state-of-the-art data integration, modality imputation, and cell label transfer via query-to-reference mapping benchmarks across bimodal and trimodal datasets, NetworkVI additionally excels in providing biologically meaningful modality- and cell type-specific interpretations. NetworkVI aids researchers in identifying associations between genes and biological processes and uncovers immune evasion mechanisms in a Perturb CITE-seq dataset of melanoma cells. NetworkVI will support researchers in interpreting cellular disease mechanisms, guiding biomarker discovery, and ultimately aiding the development of targeted therapies in large-scale single-cell multimodal atlases.

In modern landscape models, attractors represent cell types, and stochastic jumps and bifurcations drive cellular decisions, allowing for quantitative and predictive descriptions. However, given a biological problem of interest, we still lack tools to infer and build possible Waddington landscapes systematically. In this study, we propose a generative model for deriving epigenetic landscapes compatible with data. To build the landscapes, we combine gradient and rotational vector fields composed of locally weighted elements that encode  valleys of the Waddington landscape, resulting in interpretable models. We optimize landscapes through computational evolution and illustrate our approach with two developmental examples: metazoan segmentation and neuromesoderm differentiation. In both cases, we obtain ensembles of solutions that reveal both known and novel landscapes in terms of topology and bifurcations. Conversely, topographic features appear strongly constrained by dynamical data, which suggests that our approach can generically derive interpretable and predictive epigenetic landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

Given the abundance of Siglec ligands on T cells, we investigated whether Siglec-liposomes modulate T cell function and find that Siglec-7-liposomes increase T cell proliferation in a ST3Gal1-dependent and CD43-independent manner. Taken together, Siglec-liposomes are a versatile and sensitive tool for detecting Siglec ligands and immunomodulation.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

While mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in SLE, its cell-type-specific impact on immune subsets remains underexplored.

MethodsWe repurposed existing RNA-seq data from SLE patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with a focus on nuclear-encoded mitochondrial (NEmt) genes, as well as mitochondrial genes themselves, to identify differentially expressed genes compared to healthy controls. Mitochondrial stress tests were performed on freshly isolated CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and monocytes from SLE patients and healthy donors to assess bioenergetic function.

ResultsRNA-seq revealed that both NEmt genes and mitochondrial genes were downregulated in the PBMC population of SLE patients. In situ mitochondrial stress tests revealed significant reductions in oxygen consumption rate (OCR), indicating impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) across all immune subsets, while extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), a marker of glycolysis, remained unchanged. These findings highlight immune-cell-specific mitochondrial bioenergetic failure in SLE, without compensatory glycolytic adaptation.

ConclusionOur results position mitochondrial fitness as a novel therapeutic target in SLE. We propose leveraging high-throughput screening of mitochondria-targeted compounds, including FDA-approved agents, to enhance OXPHOS, regulate mitophagy, or mitigate oxidative stress.

This precision-based approach offers a paradigm shift from conventional immunosuppression to metabolic recalibration, with the potential to restore immune homeostasis in SLE.

Key messagesO_LIWhat is already known on this topic:
Mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming have been linked to SLE pathogenesis, but the cell-type-specific extent of mitochondrial impairment and its therapeutic potential remained unclear.
C_LIO_LIWhat this study adds:
We demonstrate reduced OXPHOS in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and monocytes from SLE patients for the first time, highlighting cell-type-specific mitochondrial dysfunction as a possible driver of immune dysregulation and target for therapy.
C_LIO_LIHow this study might affect research, practice, or policy:
This study advocates for drug repurposing to restore mitochondrial fitness, offering a novel therapeutic strategy to complement existing SLE treatments and improve patient outcomes.

Improving pDNA production in the most common production host (E. coli) has faced obstacles arising from the complex network of genes responsible for pDNA synthesis, with the specific enzyme(s) limiting pDNA yield remaining unidentified. To address this challenge, we employed an inducible genome-wide mutagenesis strategy, combined with fluorescent screening, to isolate E. coli NEB 5 strains with enhanced pDNA production. Following selection, we successfully isolated an E. coli strain (M3) with elevated plasmid copy numbers (PCNs) across multiple origin types. Specifically, we observed a 5.93-fold increase in PCN for the GFP reporter plasmid, a 1.93-fold increase for the gWiz DNA vaccine plasmid, and an 8.7-fold increase for the pAAV-CAGG-eGFP plasmid, all of which contain pUC origins. In addition, plasmids with p15A and pSC101 origins showed 1.44-fold and 1.68-fold increases in PCN, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing of the adapted strain M3 identified 85 mutations, including one in recG, which encodes an ATP-dependent DNA helicase. Replacement of the mutant recG with its wild-type counterpart in the mutant strain resulted in a 63% reduction in PCN, but the recG mutation alone was insufficient to increase PCN in the wild-type strain. These findings suggest that the recG mutation plays a synergistic role with other genomic mutations to drive PCN increases. Taken together, this study presents the development of a pDNA hyperaccumulating E. coli strain with promising applications in industrial and therapeutic pDNA production, while also offering important insights into key genes involved in pDNA production.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580003

Here, we demonstrate this technique using the MS2 VLP as a model self-assembling, proteinaceous nanoparticle. We constructed, for the first time, a comprehensive circular permutation library of the fused MS2 coat protein dimer construct. The strategy revealed new terminal locations, validated via cryo-electron microscopy, that enabled C-terminal peptide tagging and led to a stable protein encapsulation strategy via covalent bonding - a feature the native coat protein does not permit.

Spacer acquisition relies on the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and accessory proteins like Cas4, which select DNA sequences flanked by the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and insert them into the CRISPR array. It has been shown that in type II-A systems selection of PAM-proximal prespacers is mediated by the effector nuclease Cas9, which forms a  supercomplex with the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and the Csn2 protein. However, the supercomplex structure and the role of the ring-like Csn2 protein remain unknown. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the type II-A prespacer selection supercomplex in the DNA-scanning and two different PAM-bound configurations. Our study uncovers the mechanism of Cas9-mediated prespacer selection in type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems, and reveals the role of the accessory protein Csn2, which serves as a platform for the assembly of Cas9 and Cas1-Cas2 integrase on prespacer DNA, reminiscent of the sliding clamp in DNA replication.

However, EHR data may be prone to misclassification and unmeasured confounding, requiring systematic mitigation to ensure robust findings.

MethodsIn VEBIS-EHR, a retrospective multi-country COVID-19 VE cohort study, we examined unmeasured confounding using a negative control outcome (death not related to COVID-19) and misclassification from varying data extraction intervals. The evaluation spanned two periods (November-December 2023, January-February 2024), encompassing up to 18.7 million individuals across six EU/EEA countries. Vaccine confounding-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.

ResultsaHRs against non-COVID-19 mortality ranged from 0.35 (95% CI: 0.28-0.44) to 0.70 (0.66-0.73) when comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated. Delaying EHR data extraction modestly increased the capture of outcome and exposure events, with some variation by vaccination status. Site-level fluctuations in aHRs did not meaningfully alter the overall pooled VE, suggesting stable estimates despite misclassification related to extraction timing.

ConclusionsWe observed some evidence of unmeasured confounding when using non-COVID-19 deaths as a negative outcome, though the specificity of our negative control must be considered. This result may suggest overestimation of VE, but also the need for further analysis with more specific negative control outcomes and confounding-adjustment techniques. Addressing such confounding using richer data sources and more refined approaches remains critical to ensure accurate, timely VE estimates when using real-world EHR-based data. Extending the delay between the end of observation and data extraction modestly improves the completeness of exposure and outcome data, with limited effect on pooled VE estimates.

Key MessagesA Key Messages section should be added after the keywords and before the articles introduction, with the key messages of the paper made in 3 bullet points that succinctly describe:

O_LIWhat your research question was: Whether vaccine effectiveness estimates based on EHR data are internally valid according to analyses focused on two topics of concern related to EHR-based observational research - unmeasured confounding and misclassification.
C_LIO_LIWhat you found: We observed unmeasured confounding in our estimates when using non-COVID19 deaths as negative outcome, and timing of data abstraction from source EHRs was found to have a small influence on the capture and classification of exposure and outcome.
C_LIO_LIWhy it is important: Our results reinforce earlier evidence of the healthy vaccinee phenomenon indicating possible biases in the estimates of vaccine effectiveness estimates obtained from EHR data and that there appears to be little influence of EHR extraction timing on data completeness.

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1750284580004

Chronic active white matter lesions (CAL), identifiable radiologically as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), indicate progression-relevant chronic neuroinflammation. Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1) and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells.

Although dietary tryptophan is associated with various health benefits, excessive intake can result in adverse physiological effects. The specific tryptophan-derived metabolites responsible for such toxicity, however, remain incompletely characterized. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying tryptophan-induced toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We observe that tryptophan concentrations of 1 mM or higher are highly toxic to C. elegans, blocking egg hatching. Notably, supplementation with various sugars alleviates this toxicity. Genetic analyses reveal that host tryptophan metabolism is dispensable for the observed effects. Instead, bacterial metabolism, particularly the conversion of tryptophan to indole, is essential for mediating toxicity. Bacterial strains deficient in indole production abolished tryptophan-induced toxicity, and all sugars that conferred protection also suppressed bacterial indole synthesis. These findings demonstrate that tryptophan toxicity in C. elegans is primarily mediated by microbial metabolism and underscore the pivotal role of host-microbiota interactions in shaping the physiological consequences of dietary amino acid intake.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580004

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1750284580004

Common wisdom holds that G should respond to drift only as a scaled reduction. In contrast, I find that drift causes drastic and predictable shifts in the orientation of G by driving genetic correlations to their extremes. Biologically, this is a consequence of linkage build-up introduced by drift. I compare these theoretical results to empirical observations based on experiments conducted by Phillips et. al. (2001). Additionally, to derive the model of G-matrix evolution, I developed a novel synthetic framework for modelling ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations carrying multivariate traits. By striking a balance between genetic detail and analytical tractability, and by minimizing requisite technical background, this framework is optimized for deriving new models across a wide range of topics in population biology. Foundations of the framework are formalized by the theory of measure-valued processes, but application of the framework only requires multivariate calculus, and heuristics are presented in the main text for making additional calculations involving stochastic processes. Collectively, this work establishes a powerful framework enabling efficient formal analysis of integrated population processes across evolution and ecology, and its potential for making new discoveries is illustrated by novel findings on fundamental aspects of G-matrix evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580004

Search queries may vary in size from short gene sequences to multiple whole genomes that are too large to fit in computer memory. In microbial genomics, a routine search application involving both large queries and large collections is the removal of contaminating host genome sequences from microbial (meta)genomes. Where the host is human, sensitive classification and excision of host sequences is usually necessary to protect host genetic information. Precise classification is also critical in order to retain microbial sequences and permit accurate microbial genomic analysis. While human pangenomes have been shown to increase sensitivity of human sequence classification, existing bioinformatic host depletion approaches have either limited precision when used with metagenomes or large computing resource requirements.

ResultsWe present Deacon, an efficient and versatile sequence filter for raw sequence files and streams. We demonstrate its leading accuracy for the task of host depletion, using less computing resource than existing approaches. By querying a human pangenome index for minimizers contained in each input sequence, Deacon is able to accurately classify and discard diverse human sequences from long reads at over 250Mbp/s with a commodity laptop. We present validation of classification sensitivity, specificity and speed with simulated short and long reads for diverse catalogues of human, bacterial and viral genomes alongside existing methods. Beyond host depletion, Deacon is well suited to common sequence search and filtering applications, particularly those involving large queries. Capable of indexing a human genome in under 30s, Deacon is equipped to rapidly compose custom minimizer indexes using set operations, facilitating efficient search and filtering of massive sequence datasets using gigabase queries.

In bacteria, diverse clades of repurposed TnpB and CRISPR-associated proteins repress gene expression by blocking transcription initiation or elongation, enabling non-canonical modes of regulatory control and adaptive immunity1,6,7. Intriguingly, a distinct class of nuclease-dead Cas12f homologs (dCas12f) instead activates gene expression through its association with unique extracytoplasmic function sigma factors ({sigma}E) 8, though the molecular basis has remained elusive. Here we reveal a novel mode of RNA-guided transcription initiation by determining cryo-electron microscopy structures of the dCas12f-{sigma}E system from Flagellimonas taeanensis. We captured multiple conformational and compositional states, including the DNA-bound dCas12f-{sigma}E-RNAP holoenzyme complex, revealing how RNA-guided DNA binding leads to {sigma}E-RNAP recruitment and nascent mRNA synthesis at a precisely defined distance downstream of the R-loop. Rather than following the classical paradigm of {sigma}E-dependent promoter recognition, these studies show that recognition of the -35 element is largely supplanted by CRISPR-Cas targeting, while the melted -10 element is stabilized through unusual stacking interactions rather than insertion into the typical recognition pocket.

Among these, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and extracellular targeted protein degradation (eTPD) specifically depend on efficient lysosomal trafficking for activity. However, many tumor antigens exhibit poor internalization, limiting ADC effectiveness. To address this, we developed low-density lipoprotein receptor-targeting chimeras (LIPTACs), leveraging the constitutive endocytic and recycling activity of the LDLR to enhance lysosomal delivery. LIPTACs enable efficient and selective degradation of diverse extracellular membrane proteins. Additionally, by coupling LIPTACs with cytotoxic payloads to generate degrader-drug conjugates, we can achieve superior intracellular delivery and enhanced cytotoxicity compared to conventional ADCs. The dual modality addresses key challenges of inadequate internalization in conventional ADCs and cytotoxic potency for current eTPD strategies. Our findings demonstrate that LDLR-mediated trafficking can enhance eTPD and ADCs, providing a hybrid blueprint for developing next-generation antibody therapeutics with broader utility and improved efficacy in cancer treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580004

Growth suppression by ppGpp is implicated in the formation of persister cells, which survive antibiotic challenge only to regrow once the drug is removed. However, there is also evidence that low levels of ppGpp contribute to resistance to certain cell wall-active antibiotics in actively growing cells. To characterize ppGpps contribution to antibiotic resistance, we measured MICs of a panel of {beta}-lactams in actively growing Escherichia coli cells overexpressing a ppGpp synthase (relA*). Cells engineered to modestly overproduce ppGpp exhibited up to 64-fold increases in resistance to PBP2-targeting {beta}-lactams only, with mecillinam the most dramatically affected. Resistance required the transcription factor DksA and the class A penicillin binding protein (PBP) PBP1B. PBP1B variants defective for transpeptidase activity, glycosyltransferase activity, or both were incapable of mediating resistance, suggesting the full enzymatic activity of PBP1B is required for resistance. Transcriptomics revealed that ppGpp overproduction leads to increased expression of lpoB, which encodes an activator of PBP1B. LpoB was required for mecillinam resistance, with an lpoB deletion mutant exhibiting a loss of ppGpp-dependent resistance. Resistance was partially lost in an lpoB deletion strain expressing an LpoB-bypass variant of PBP1B (mrcB*). Together these results support a model wherein overproduction of ppGpp favors cell wall synthesis by PBP1B, in part via increased expression of lpoB, allowing PBP1B to substitute for PBP2 when it is inhibited by {beta}-lactams.

ImportanceAntimicrobial resistance is an increasing global health threat, but the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance remain incompletely understood. This work clarifies the role of the alarmone ppGpp in mediating antibiotic resistance in the model bacterium Escherichia coli. Elevated levels of ppGpp were found to cause resistance to {beta}-lactam antibiotics targeting the cell wall synthesis enzyme PBP2. Resistance required transcriptional regulation by ppGpp and enzymatic activity of the cell wall enzyme PBP1B. This work suggests that ppGpp causes resistance in part by increasing expression of lpoB, which encodes an activator of PBP1B. Because ppGpp levels are controlled by nutritional conditions, this work suggests that nutritional availability could impact the efficacy of antibiotics. Furthermore, this study adds to a number of studies demonstrating that cell wall synthesizing PBP enzymes can compensate for one another under certain conditions, leading to {beta}-lactam resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580004

The core challenge lies in balancing quality and scalability. Manual curation delivers high quality, reliable annotations but is time-intensive and non-scalable; automated approaches, including those based on natural language processing, can scale but often fall short in accuracy and completeness. This tradeoff is particularly severe in public datasets, where metadata is frequently distributed across multiple sources for a single dataset. A notable example includes multi-omics datasets available on GEO and similar public repositories, which are often accompanied by associated publications. These supplementary sources can be leveraged to substantially enhance metadata quality, thereby supporting downstream applications such as classifier model development or the identification of biologically relevant cohorts, etc.

We present a first-in-class multi-agent AI system that bridges the gap, achieving both high quality and scalability in metadata curation. Built on large-language models (LLMs), our system orchestrates a set of specialized agents that collaboratively extract, normalize, and infer critical metadata fields such as tissue, disease, cell line, sampling site, demographics, and experimental context from GEO entries, associated publications. A central orchestrator agent delegates tasks such as data retrieval, document parsing, ontology mapping, and context inference to expert sub-agents, enabling scalable, end-to-end automation.

Applied to GEO data sets, a notoriously difficult metadata domain, our system achieves a 93% recall on average across 23 key fields (all original terms, normalized terms, and corresponding ontology ids) that include information about disease, tissue, treatment, donor-related information, outperforming existing automated baselines and approaches expert level quality. We also present a system that can easily scale to curate hundreds of metadata fields of interest with similar precision. This work demonstrates that an LLM-based multi-agent architecture can overcome traditional trade-offs in metadata curation, enabling both precision and scale, and offers a promising path forward for curating large public biomedical repositories for downstream AI applications.","NA","biorxiv",1750284580004

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 E ion channel activity triggers the proton pump V-ATPases to recruit the ATG16L1 complex during infection. This results in ATG8 molecules such as LC3B decorating perturbed compartments. This recruitment of autophagy machinery does not inhibit viral replication, rather SARS-CoV-2 exploits this response.

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1750284580004
