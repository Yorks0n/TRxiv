A cohesive theory of the underlying mechanisms of the Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) remains unknown, primarily due to high variability in findings across independent studies. Here, we present a multimodal, cross-sectional MRI analysis of brain morphology (T1-MRI), tissue microstructure (diffusion-MRI), functional connectivity (functional-MRI), and cerebral blood flow (Arterial Spin Labeling MRI) in COVID-Recovered Patients (CRPs, N=76) and Healthy Controls (HCs, N=51). Although the global brain volumes did not differ between the two groups, CRPs showed focal atrophy in the right basal ganglia and limbic structures, along with cortical thinning in paralimbic regions (prefrontal cortex, insula) (p<0.05). Diffusion MRI analysis revealed reduced fractional anisotropy and elevated radial diffusivity in the uncinate fasciculus and cingulum. No differences were observed in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and cerebral blood flow between HCs and CRPs (p>0.05). We further investigated the effect of infection severity by stratifying the CRPs into hospitalized (HP; N = 21) and non-hospitalized (NHP; N = 46) groups. The microstructural damage was linked to infection severity, more pronounced in the HPs (p<0.05). In HPs, RSFC was diminished between components of the default mode network and the insula and caudate as compared to HCs and NHPs (p<0.05). Results suggest COVID-19 is associated with selective structural and functional alterations in basal ganglia-limbic-cortical circuits, with stronger effects in severe cases. Our findings are in line with common prevalent behavioral symptoms such as fatigue, memory impairment, attentional deficits, and insomnia. This study suggests that localized microstructural neuroinflammatory mechanisms contribute to post-COVID neurological symptoms and offers potential imaging biomarkers for targeted therapies and monitoring recovery.","NA","medrxiv",1750975760926

MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1750975760926

South Africa is unique in the region because its HIV programme is largely domestically funded, although donor funds and partnerships support key components. We estimated the epidemiological impact of ceased PEPFAR support for specific services and the costs and cost-effectiveness of the South African government (SAG) potentially taking over these services.

MethodsWe used a costed version of Thembisa, a South African HIV transmission model, to simulate four scenarios: a minimum scenario assuming intervention coverage reducing proportional to PEPFARs funding share of specific activities in 2023; a maximum scenario assuming additional health system impacts; and sub-scenarios either with 3-year recovery (2029-2031) or no recovery to previous coverage. HIV programme costs were estimated from the provider perspective (SAG) in 2024/25 US dollars.

ResultsOver 2025-2028, discontinuing PEPFAR funding in South Africa without replacement by SAG would result in 150,000-296,000 additional new HIV infections (29-56% increase) and 56,000-65,000 additional AIDS-related deaths (33-38%). Permanent discontinuation of currently PEPFAR-supported services over the next 20 years increases this to 1.1-2.1 million additional new HIV infections and 519,000-712,000 additional AIDS deaths. To sustain services, SAG needs to spend an additional $710 million to $1.5 billion between 2025 and 2028. Under a reduced budget, the most cost-effective interventions to preserve are ART and PrEP.

ConclusionUnmanaged PEPFAR exit from South Africa threatens to undo a decade of progress towards ending AIDS as a public health threat unless services are taken over by other funders, including SAG.","NA","medrxiv",1750975760926

Rationally predicting individual-specific success or failure of probiotic and prebiotic interventions remains an outstanding challenge. In this study, we leverage microbial community-scale metabolic models (MCMMs) to predict probiotic engraftment and shifts in microbiota-mediated short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in response to a synbiotic intervention. Using data from a placebo-controlled synbiotic intervention trial, involving a cocktail of five probiotic strains and the prebiotic inulin, we validate model engraftment predictions with quantitative PCR (qPCR), demonstrating that MCMMs accurately predict probiotic engraftment outcomes in the treatment group with over 85% accuracy. Engraftment varied by species, with Akkermansia muciniphila and Bifidobacterium infantis displaying higher engraftment rates than Clostridium beijerinckii, Anaerobutyricum hallii, and Clostridium butyricum. Furthermore, MCMMs predicted significant increases in butyrate and propionate production following synbiotic treatment. MCMM-predicted changes in propionate production in the treatment group were negatively associated with changes in C-reactive protein (CRP), a blood marker of systemic inflammation, from baseline to 12 weeks after the synbiotic intervention. Finally, we explore MCMM-predicted responses to a wider range of synbiotic combinations in a larger observational cohort, suggesting that personalized prebiotic selection can augment probiotic efficacy. These findings highlight the potential of metabolic modeling to inform precision microbiome therapeutics.","NA","medrxiv",1750975760926

Recently, a novel approach for the fast and efficient differentiation of ovarian support cells (OSCs) to generate a versatile platform for basic research and clinical applications was demonstrated. This study details the clinical process development and application of an OSC product, known as Fertilo, to improve the in vitro maturation (IVM) of human oocytes, a method referred to as OSC-IVM. First, transcription factor (TF) mediated OSC differentiation using research-grade raw materials was shown to produce granulosa-like cells that improve the MII maturation rate of human oocytes. To support clinical application, several raw material upgrades were initiated, including substitution of the differentiation matrix with a higher-quality alternative, laminin-521, and the generation of a clinically suitable hiPSC seed bank and master cell bank. Single cell RNA sequencing of OSCs generated using the updated protocol for clinical translation demonstrated the consistency and reproducibility of cellular outcomes. Next, analytical release testing of the clinical product was performed and a murine oocyte maturation assay was developed to establish the potency of OSCs for use in OSC-IVM. Finally, the qualified Fertilo product was applied in a two-phase longitudinal cohort analysis, with the results showing improvement in key outcomes compared to traditional IVM treatment. Our findings demonstrate the first-time clinical development and application of an hiPSC-derived product to improve reproductive outcomes after IVM and advance womens health.","NA","medrxiv",1750975760926

Symptoms of sympathetic dysfunction are prevalent in diabetes, affecting up to 90% of patients. The molecular and cellular composition of the human SCG and its alteration in diabetes remains poorly defined. To address this gap, we performed spatial transcriptomic profiling of lumbar SCGs from diabetic and non-diabetic organ donors. We identified 3 three distinct neuronal populations, two noradrenergic (NA1 and NA2) and one cholinergic (CHO), based on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and SLC18A3 expression, respectively. We also characterized 9 non-neuronal populations consisting of Schwann cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, adipocytes, and endothelial cells. In diabetic SCGs, we observed a significant loss of myelinating Schwann cells and a phenotypic shift of cholinergic neurons toward a noradrenergic identity. Additionally, diabetes was associated with a significant reduction in the transcripts of vasodilatory neuropeptides, such as VIP and CALCA, suggesting a mechanism for impaired vascular control. Upstream regulator analysis highlighted altered neurotrophic signaling in diabetes, with enhanced NGF/TRKA and diminished BDNF/TRKB activity, potentially driven by target-derived cues. Comparison between SCG and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons revealed ganglia-specific genes, like SCN3A and NPY (SCG) versus SCN10A and GPX1 (DRG), offering specific therapeutic targets for autonomic dysfunction or pain. Our findings provide a transcriptomic characterization of human SCG, revealing molecular signatures that underlie diabetic autonomic dysfunction. This work lays a foundation for the development of therapies to restore sympathetic function and avoid unintended autonomic effects in the development of analgesics.","NA","biorxiv",1750975760926

Discrepancies between these predictions and actual inputs, sensory prediction errors, guide perceptual inference. A fundamental yet largely unresolved question is which stimulus features the brain predicts, and therefore, what kind of surprise drives neural responses. Here, we investigated this question using EEG and computational modelling based on deep neural networks (DNNs). Participants viewed object images whose identity was probabilistically predicted by preceding cues. We then quantified trial-by-trial surprise at both low-level (early DNN layers) and high-level (late DNN layers) visual feature representations. Results showed that stimulus-evoked responses around 200ms post-stimulus onset over parieto-occipital electrodes were increased by high-level, but not by low-level visual surprise. These findings demonstrate that high-level visual predictions are rapidly integrated into perceptual inference, suggesting that the brain's predictive machinery is finely tuned to utilize expectations abstracted away from low-level sensory details to facilitate perception.","NA","biorxiv",1750975760926

ObjectiveTo identify causes and consequences of VaD by developing a polygenic risk score (PRS) for VaD and conducting a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), followed by Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using data from the UK Biobank.

MethodsUsing data from 334,758 UK Biobank participants, we first constructed a VaD PRS based on the most recent genome-wide association study (GWAS). We then performed an age-stratified PheWAS (39-53, 53-62, 62-72 years), examining 9,319 phenotypes associated with the VaD PRS. We followed up PheWAS hits with two-sample MR to evaluate causal relationships with VaD risk.

ResultsOur PheWAS revealed age-dependent associations, with many relationships strengthening as age increased. Associations were found with vascular and Alzheimers dementias; cerebrovascular traits such as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), stroke, and intracerebral haemorrhage; adverse lipid profiles; elevated systolic blood pressure and glucose levels; reduced brain volumes (subcortical and hippocampal); and poorer cognitive function. The VaD PRS was also associated with higher risk of depression, Parkinsons disease, neuroinflammatory disorders, and decreased basal metabolic rate and fat-free mass. MR analyses supported causal effects for WMH (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.39-2.40), depression (1.25, 1.02-1.54), lipid traits (e.g., apolipoprotein B/A1 ratio: 1.31, 1.06-1.62), HbA1c (1.14, 1.02-1.28), and diastolic (1.03, 1.01-1.04) and systolic (1.01, 1.01-1.02) blood pressure. Protective factors included years of schooling (0.76, 0.64-0.90), apolipoprotein A (0.74, 0.59-0.92), fat-free mass (0.84, 0.71-0.99), and basal metabolic rate (0.82, 0.69-0.97).

ConclusionsOur findings highlight the central role of cardiometabolic and educational factors in the development of vascular dementia. Several modifiable risk factors--particularly blood pressure, glucose regulation, lipid levels, and years of schooling--showed evidence of causal effects on VaD risk. Age-stratified results suggest that early intervention, ideally from midlife, may offer the greatest preventive benefit by mitigating the progressive accumulation of vascular damage contributing to dementia risk.","NA","medrxiv",1750975760926

Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures. Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods. We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","medrxiv",1750975760926

However, despite the available transcriptomic data, no focused phylotranscriptomic study has been conducted to characterize the patterns of molecular evolution in this group. In this study, we leverage a dataset composed predominately of publicly available transcriptomes to infer relationships within Apocynaceae and explore the molecular processes that have shaped their divergences. Methods: We extracted nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial genes from 47 publicly available and one newly sequenced transcriptome to assemble and infer species relationships across Apocynaceae. Leveraging the gene-rich nuclear phylotranscriptomic data, we inferred molecular dates and investigated the complex history of gene tree conflict, molecular rate shifts, and gene duplications. To investigate the genomic basis of adaptations, we analyzed the inferred 14,838 gene duplications at the base of Apocynaceae for shared functional enrichment of genes related to evolutionary innovations. Key Results: The Apocynaceae topology inferred from our phylotranscriptomic analysis is highly concordant with the current consensus. Notably, a genome-wide acceleration in molecular rate subtends the Ceropegieae tribe. We observed that a decreased time between divergences is associated with a higher rate of gene tree conflict, a pattern especially prevalent across the Apocynaceae's historically recalcitrant backbone relationships. Furthermore, gene duplications may underlie evolutionary innovations, such as immunity-related gene expansion in the genus Asclepias and duplications associated with trichome modifications in the epiphytic Hoya. Finally, we discuss the contentious history of whole-genome duplication (WGD) within the Apocynaceae and emphasize the need for further investigation into the placement of WGDs. Conclusions: Repurposing transcriptomes is a powerful means of accumulating data for novel insights in plant evolution, especially during uncertain funding and cases where budget restrictions exist. Leveraging this gene-dense dataset, we obtained novel insights into the molecular evolution of Apocynaceae and identified areas for future investigations.","NA","biorxiv",1750975760926

While vesicle trafficking is likely involved, we hypothesized a complementary mechanism involving direct membrane interactions. Using domain homology and proteomic profiling of chloroplast membrane fractions, we identified candidate lipid transport proteins enriched in a distinct, intermediate-density membrane population. This fraction was enriched in lipid metabolic enzymes and proteins homologous to known membrane organization factors. Several candidates, including TVP38 FAMILY PROTEIN (TVPFP), PLASMA MEMBRANE FUSION PROTEIN (PMFP), and LETM1-LIKE, localized to discrete subdomains within chloroplasts. Loss- of-function tvpfp or pmfp mutants exhibited altered chloroplast ultrastructure, including changes in thylakoid-envelope proximity, supporting their roles in maintaining membrane architecture. These findings identify a specialized chloroplast membrane region enriched in lipid-related functions and offer a foundation for elucidating the molecular architecture of these regions.","NA","biorxiv",1750975760926

This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive attention by examining beta-band power suppression during heartbeat and auditory discrimination tasks. Fifty-one healthy participants engaged in interoceptive (heartbeat detection) and exteroceptive (auditory discrimination) tasks while their brain activity was measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The results revealed significant beta suppression time-locked to the R-peak in the somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, mid-cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 310 to 530 ms post-R-peak. Beta suppression was more pronounced during interoceptive attention, correlating positively with interoceptive accuracy. The findings support the notion that beta suppression in fronto-cingulo-somatosensory network may serve as a neural marker of interoceptive processing, contributing to predictive coding models of interoception. This study highlights the potential for using beta suppression as an objective measure of interoceptive accuracy and suggests that neural oscillations play a critical role in the brain's regulation of heartbeat-related information. Furthermore, the study proposes that interoceptive attention involves a top-down mechanism that dynamically adjusts the brain's response to cardiac afferent signals, enhancing the precision of interoceptive processing. These findings have implications for understanding how the brain integrates interoceptive signals and may provide insights into clinical applications targeting interoceptive dysfunctions.","NA","biorxiv",1750975760926

This study investigates PM concentration and composition during sugarcane harvest and non-harvest periods (2019-2020), accidentally coinciding with the COVID-19 lockdowns. SEM-EDS enabled the classification of PM by size (Dust, PM10, and PM2.5) and by composition (Terrigenous PM and Carbonaceous PM). Higher PM concentrations were detected during harvest periods, with a notable increase in carbon-rich PM2.5 (PMC2.5) in 2019 compared to 2020. Unexpectedly, this variation was primarily attributed to reduced population mobility during the 2020 lockdowns, rather than changes in industrial activity. Satellite data on nitrogen oxides (NOx) supported these findings, revealing emission patterns consistent with vehicular activity. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of SEM-EDS in characterizing air pollutants and highlights the critical influence of population mobility on urban air quality. The findings support the implementation of targeted air pollution control strategies - particularly during harvest seasons- to mitigate both health and environmental impacts.","NA","medrxiv",1750975760926

MORU works closely with a network of community advisory boards (CABs), with members drawn from communities served by its research sites. In 2019, we set up the Bangkok Health Research and Ethics Interest Group (HREIG). HREIG is an urban CAB composed of Bangkok residents from all walks of life who have an interest in health research, but do not have a professional health research background. HREIG advises on clinical research and broader societal issues, complementing MORUs rural CABs in areas such as the Thai-Myanmar border and Cambodia. In 2022, the group had 14 members aged 22 to 51. Initially, meetings were held in person and in English, to support discussion with international researchers. During COVID-19 restrictions, meetings moved online and adopted Thai as the main language.

Main bodyTo evaluate the groups first two years, we conducted a mixed-methods study using focus group discussions and anonymous online surveys with group members, researchers and facilitators. We found that members joined to contribute to research and society, and for personal benefits such as learning about health research or meeting new people. While some valued practicing English, it made harder for members to contribute equally, and even those with good conversational English struggled with technical terms. Researchers reported that engaging with the group helped improve their communication skills, and that they valued hearing lay perspectives. Facilitators strengthened their skills in areas such as facilitation, online collaboration, and explaining research in lay terms. As HREIG is not tied to a specific study, its contributions have ranged from improving malaria messaging for the Thai public to testing COVID-19 surveys, or sharing opinions on vaccines and clinical trial participation.

ConclusionOur findings offer an in-depth insight into the experiences of HREIG members, researchers and facilitators. We share the outcomes of the groups activities, and the lessons learnt from running a CAB in an international research environment. We hope that our findings will help others who would like to set up a CAB in a similar context.

Plain English summaryThe Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU), headquartered in Bangkok, carries out research on tropical medicine and global health. MORU works closely with a network of community advisory boards (CABs). In 2019, we set up the Bangkok Health Research and Ethics Interest Group (HREIG). Its members are Bangkok residents from all walks of life who have an interest in health research, but do not have a professional health research background. HREIG advises on clinical research and broader societal issues, such as data sharing or artificial intelligence. By 2022, the group had 14 members aged 22 to 51. Initially, meetings were held in English and in person; during COVID-19 restrictions, they shifted online and adopted Thai as the main language.

After two years, we asked members, researchers and facilitators for their feedback on the group. HREIG members had joined the group to contribute to research and society, and for personal benefits, such as learning about health research or meeting new people. Although some members enjoyed practicing English, it made harder for members to contribute equally. Researchers had improved their communication skills, and valued hearing from non-scientists. Facilitators had expanded their professional skills as well. The groups feedback was important for many studies, including improving communications about malaria for the Thai public, testing COVID-19 survey questions or sharing views about vaccines.

Our findings offer an in-depth insight into the experiences of HREIG members, researchers and facilitators. We hope that our findings will help others who would like to set up a CAB in a similar setting.

Yet, the molecular mechanisms through which juvenile environments shape adult physiology and behavior via transstadial effects remain largely unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that larval competition, a key ecological stressor, profoundly alters adult body size, survival, reproductive output, host-seeking behavior, olfactory neurophysiology, and vector competence in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Crucially, using transcriptomic profiling and integrative network analyses, we identify seven regulatory hub genes whose expression is strongly associated with size-dependent variation in olfactory behavior, reproductive investment, and Zika virus transmission potential. These hub genes belong to gene modules enriched for functions in chemosensory processing, metabolic regulation, and signal transduction, revealing a molecular framework mediating environmentally induced plasticity across metamorphosis. Integrating these empirical findings into a transmission model, we show that incomplete larval control can inadvertently increase outbreak risk by producing larger, longer-lived, and more competent vectors. Our results uncover molecular mechanisms underpinning phenotypic plasticity in disease vectors and highlight the critical need to account for transstadial effects in models of vector-borne disease transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1750975760926

This qualitative study explores the lived experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) following the implementation of Covid-19 vaccine mandates in Albertas health sector. It draws on 80 responses to a single open-ended question from a survey of 190 HCWs in the province across vaccination statuses. We performed a manual sentiment analysis, classifying entries as positive, neutral, or negative - depending on their normative orientation towards vaccination mandates - using Weberian ideal types as a conceptual framework.

Most respondents (82.5%) expressed negative sentiments, with close to one fifth (17.5%) offering positive views; no entries were coded as neutral. Themes within negative responses included coercion, ethical conflict, professional exclusion, institutional betrayal, and suppression of dissent. Many vaccinated HCWs described complying under duress, challenging the assumption that uptake signals endorsement. The most salient theme was that of moral injury - defined as the distress caused by acting against ones conscience, witnessing perceived harm, or remaining silent under institutional pressure. In contrast, positive responses emphasized professional duty and public safety, often rejecting the legitimacy of dissenting perspectives.

Our findings underscore the deeply polarizing nature of vaccination mandates and complicate dominant narratives that equate compliance with consent. Further, in contrast to clinical conceptions rooted in combat or bedside trauma, our analysis situates moral injury in the structural conditions created by public health policies, offering a lens for assessing their implications for the wellbeing of HCWs, quality care, and ethical healthcare practice and policy. We conclude that future public health policies, especially those justified under claims of emergency, must include built-in safeguards for ethical integrity and democratic participation.","NA","medrxiv",1750975760926

Many organisms with symbiotic microorganisms have developed elaborate vertical transmission mechanisms, which are thought to be important for the evolution of intimate symbiotic relationships with microorganisms. One such case is the cockroach-Blattabacterium endosymbiosis, in which the symbiotic bacteria have been evolutionarily conserved and co-speciated with the host insects with stable vertical symbiont transmission via ovarial passage. While classical histological descriptions and recent electron microscopic observations have reported the vertical symbiont transmission processes in some cockroach-Blattabacterium associations, the full picture of the infection dynamics has not been fully understood. In this study, we conducted detailed histological and cytological observations of the localization of the bacteriocytes and the symbiotic bacteria during the postembryonic development of the German cockroach Blattella germanica. We found that the symbiont-filled bacteriocytes migrate into and associate with nymphal ovaries and are subsequently eliminated from adult ovaries, suggesting that symbiont infection to the ovaries may only occur during nymphal stages. We also found that the symbiotic bacteria are localized in the space between each oocyte and surrounding follicle cells, the symbiont-localized space is interconnected between neighboring oocytes, and therefore the symbiotic bacteria can move across oocytes within the same ovariole, suggesting the possibility that the symbiont-infected oocytes may serve as the source of symbiont supply to developing young oocytes upstream in the same ovariole. Based on these observations, we provide a hypothesis as to how the postembryonic developmental dynamics of the bacteriocytes are integrated into the vertical symbiont transmission and functioning in the cockroach-Blattabacterium endosymbiosis.","NA","biorxiv",1750975760926

This pattern, known as biological motion, is instantly recognizable and conveys ""animacy,"" even when body shape is removed and only a cloud of moving dots is shown. The motion alone is so informative that some animals can reconstruct the original shape. Jumping spiders, highly visual arthropods, divide motion detection and shape recognition between their four pairs of eyes. Previous studies showed that they can distinguish biological from non-biological motion using only their anterior lateral eyes, yet seemed unable to extract shape from motion. In this study, we examined how the anterior medial eyes of jumping spiders-which are used for shape recognition-respond to dot clouds depicting biological or non-biological motion. Using a custom eye tracker, we monitored retinal movements during presentation of static and moving stimuli. We found spiders change their retinal shifting pattern based on both the target's motion (biological or not) and implied structure (i.e., whether dots suggest a coherent shape). These results reveal that jumping spiders analyze motion with more complexity than previously thought, suggesting a deeper integration of motion and form processing within their minuscule, modular brains.","NA","biorxiv",1750975760926

They also require subjective choices to set the level of temporal and spatial heterogeneity assumed. We propose a novel framework to estimate Rt based on Generalized Linear and Additive Models (GLM/GAM). By integrating the renewal equation model within GLM/GAM, the proposed framework, ""Rt.glm"", allows smooth estimation of Rt variations over time and space without relying on arbitrary scaling parameters.

The performance of Rt.glm was evaluated using historical datasets and simulated outbreaks. It demonstrated improved overall performance and accuracy compared to EpiEstim, as measured by the CRPS scores and Mean Square Errors respectively. However, when case incidence was low and Rt estimation relied on a smoothing term, Rt.glm was marginally overconfident in its estimates.

The method offers substantial improvement for the real-time estimation of spatio-temporal trends in Rt, with improved performance and lower reliance on arbitrarily set parameters. The open-source and user-friendly R package developed will also simplify user experience. Finally, the framework bridges gaps between epidemic monitoring methodologies and sets the stage for future extensions to enhance statistical inference and integrate additional epidemiological complexities, including the evaluation of intervention strategies.

Understanding how the Healthy Eating Index-2020 (HEI-2020) can be used as a measure of diet quality to create benchmarks for national nutrition monitoring can assist in surveillance and improve the design of nutrition programs and policies.

ObjectiveTo examine the utility of the HEI-2020 to create benchmarks for national diet quality monitoring.

MethodsThis serial cross-sectional study used data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Nationally representative data for 22,168 US adults ([&ge;]20 years) who completed two 24-hour recalls were analyzed. We derived HEI-2020 scores (0-100) from participants two 24-hour dietary recalls. Diet quality categories were established: high diet quality (>70-100), marginal (>60-70), low (>50-60), and very low (0-50).

ResultsOnly 13% of US adults had high diet quality while nearly two-thirds had low or very low diet quality. Diet quality was higher for older adults, female, ""Other"" race or ethnicity, born outside of the US, have higher education attainment, higher income, and food security. Compared to adults with high diet quality, adults with very low diet quality had lower intakes of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and seafood and the highest intakes of ultra-processed foods, refined grains, and red and processed meats (all P-trends <0.01). Adults with very low diet quality were more likely to have elevated adiposity, lower HDL cholesterol, and higher triglycerides, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c (all P-trends [&le;]0.01).

ConclusionsThe HEI-2020 is a robust measure of diet quality that can be directly linked to biological measures associated with chronic disease risk.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the effects of Pycnogenol(R), a French maritime pine bark extract with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, versus placebo on patient-reported health status in individuals with PCC.

DesignSingle-center, placebo-controlled, quadruple-blind, randomized trial. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05890534

SettingGerman-speaking Switzerland.

ParticipantsAdults with PCC with at least one of the following symptoms: fatigue, post-exertional malaise, dyspnea, or brain fog.

InterventionDaily dose of 200 mg Pycnogenol(R) (50 mg capsules four times daily) or placebo for 12 weeks.

MeasurementsThe primary outcome was self-reported health status (EQ-VAS). Secondary outcomes included symptoms, quality of life, exercise capacity, physical activity and blood biomarkers.

ResultsBetween June 14, 2023, and July 5, 2024, 153 participants were randomized to receive Pycnogenol(R) (n=75) or placebo (n=78). Participants reported persisting symptoms for a median duration of 101 weeks. Unadjusted median EQ-VAS increased by 5.4 units and 7.9 units in the in the Pycnogenol(R) and placebo groups, respectively, with no difference observed between the groups ({beta}=0.54, 95% CI -3.45 to 4.54, p=0.79). 31 adverse events occurred in the Pycnogenol(R) group (11 probably related) and 18 in the placebo group (9 probably related). Three serious adverse events were reported, all unrelated to the study products. No between group differences were observed in secondary endpoints.

LimitationThe results may not be generalizable to individuals newly experiencing PCC.

ConclusionPycnogenol(R) (200 mg daily) did not improve health status compared to placebo over 12 weeks in PCC. Both groups showed clinically relevant improvements, suggesting non-therapeutic effects.

However, the insertion of these systems into enzymes is often performed with little consideration of the structural impact they might have. This is particularly relevant when modifying complex molecular machines that transition between numerous conformational states. Here, we address this issue by developing SIMPLIFE, a computational workflow that supports the design of optimal insertion sites for conjugation tags based on the structure of the proteins involved and performs localised residue redesign where needed. We demonstrate how SIMPLIFE can be used to effectively augment the function of T7 RNA polymerase using the DogCatcher-DogTag system, enabling diverse and dynamically varying mutations within a targeted region of DNA. This work demonstrates the power of combining biophysical and machine learning based approaches for protein structure prediction to efficiently augment the function of molecular machines, accelerating our ability to combine complex biochemical functionalities in new ways.","NA","biorxiv",1750975760926

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1750975760926

However, this sex/gender gap has been narrowing in recent decades, likely due to an increase in cannabis use among women and girls, who have been historically under-represented in cannabis research. The lack of sex- and gender-based approaches within cannabis research has been highlighted in previous reviews, some of which have synthesized existing literature of associations between sex, gender, and cannabis use. What is missing is a clinically-relevant synthesis of evidence for sex and gender influences on problematic cannabis use, including treatment-related outcomes that could be used to influence care. The objective of this scoping review is to identify and synthesize published evidence about the influence of sex and gender on correlates and outcomes of treatment among people with problematic cannabis use (including CUD). Furthermore, we will examine to what extent this published literature has considered how sex and gender intersect with other social categories such as race and sexuality.

Methods and AnalysisThis scoping review will follow the most commonly used methodology, the 2005 Arksey and OMalley scoping study framework (including the optional consultation exercise to solicit feedback from relevant stakeholders) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews reporting guidelines. We will search MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for articles published between 2010 and the present. Included studies must be conducted in human participants with problematic cannabis use (e.g., diagnosis or screening for CUD) and include an analysis of sex- and/or gender-related factors. Using Covidence software, two independent reviewers will screen each record at the title/abstract and full text phases. Two independent reviewers will then use a data charting form developed by the study team to extract data. Data charting and both phases of article screening will begin with a pilot process completed by the entire team to ensure consistency. Article data will be exported into a spreadsheet to facilitate summary and basic descriptive statistics. Studies will be grouped together first by content area (e.g., treatment correlates, treatment effectiveness), then by study design, and which sex- or gender-related factors are considered in the analysis.

DisseminationWe will disseminate findings using two main strategies. First, we will engage in traditional knowledge translation, including publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentation at both medical and scientific conferences. Second, we will engage in knowledge translation strategies that will reach a wider audience (e.g., presentations to non-researcher audiences, dissemination of findings through social media networks, and development of brochures, infographics, and short videos to summarize our findings for a lay audience). We aim to ultimately engage relevant stakeholders (including clinicians) to determine how the identified evidence can best support care of problematic cannabis use.","NA","medrxiv",1750975760926

Most AI palliative care research involves the use of routinely collected data from electronic healthcare records patient data; however, there is little data about the of the views of palliative care healthcare professionals on the role of AI in practice. Determining the opinions of palliative care healthcare professionals on potential uses of AI in palliative care will be useful for policymakers and practitioners to determine, and inform, meaningful use of AI in palliative care practice.

AimTo explore palliative care healthcare professionals views on the use of AI for analysis of patient data in palliative care.

MethodsPhenomenological study using qualitative semi-structured interviews of palliative care healthcare professionals with a minimum of one-year clinical experience in a hospice in the Northwest of England. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis.

ResultsWe interviewed six palliative care professionals comprising of doctors, nurses and occupational therapies. AI was viewed positively, although most participants had not used this in practice. No participants had received training in AI and said that education in AI would be beneficial. Participants described potential benefits of palliative care AI, which included identification of people requiring palliative care interventions, and to evaluate patient experience. Participants highlighted security and ethical concerns of AI, related to data governance, efficacy, patient confidentiality and consent issues.

ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of staff perceptions of AI in palliative care. Our findings support the role of AI in enhancing care, addressing education needs, and tackling trust, ethics, and governance issues. This study lays the groundwork for guidelines on AI implementation, urging further research on methodological, ethical, and practical aspects of AI in palliative care.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1750975760926

Human Siglecs count 14 unique proteins allocated to two subsets; group 1 includes four evolutionarily conserved proteins with clear orthologues in all mammals with low sequence similarity and group 2 includes ten rapidly evolving proteins with high sequence similarity and species specificity. In all Siglecs, the recognition and binding of the sialic acid on the glycan target involves a conserved, or canonical, Arg residue. Yet, for a subset of human Siglecs, namely MAG, Siglec-6, and Siglec-11, this Arg appears not to be essential, suggesting that a different binding mechanism may be at play. In this work, we used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding assays, and mutagenesis to investigate the structural, mechanistic and energetic details of the binding of Siglec-6 to monosialylated gangliosides. Our results show that Siglec-6 relies only partially on its conserved Arg (Arg122) for recognition of membrane-bound gangliosides and that it supplements its binding free energy through interactions with the phospholipids in the membrane surrounding the target epitope. We identified residues Lys126 and Trp127 as key players in this unique membrane interaction, and we confirmed by mutagenesis assays that the loss of these residues abrogates binding. These results provide a step-change in our understanding of the diversification of human Siglecs across group 2, where different members likely evolved as molecular precision tools, to bind specific sialosides by adapting their structure to recognize not only the epitope, but also the biological environment in which it is found.","NA","biorxiv",1750975760926

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1750975760927

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1750975760927
