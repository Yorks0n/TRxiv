During the tumult of war they are, however, challenging to obtain due to the conflicts themselves. The Gaza Ministry of Health (GMoH) has provided regular updates to their post-October-7 violent death tally for the Gaza Strip. However, GMoH reports have attracted both criticism and support. Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures. Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods. We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1753481416530

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

Similarly, visual working memory (WM) representations can reflect different priority states. However, it remains unknown whether the priority status of WM-guided novel actions similarly modulates their neural coding format, and how such dynamics unfold over time. We addressed these questions using EEG while human participants performed two consecutive choice reaction tasks. At the start of each trial, participants encoded two novel stimulus-response (S-R) mappings. A cue then indicated whether these mappings would be relevant immediately (""current"" condition), later after an intervening task (""prospective""), or after a free delay (""delayed""). Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found that the S-R category was decodable in all conditions during relevant time windows. Critically, pattern similarity analyses revealed that while mere maintenance demands allow for temporary preservation of neural codes (i.e., between current and delayed trials), shielding from interference (i.e., prospective trials) induced significant alterations to the neural code. Further exploration of the representational geometry revealed that priority status gained prominence dynamically over S-R category coding when preparing for such shielding demands. Importantly, some of these changes emerged anticipatorily, prior to target onset. Overall, our results show that, similar to visual WM, the priority of intended actions dynamically and anticipatorily reshapes their neural format. They further reveal how different demands induce content geometries compatible with previously proposed coding schemes, and that such representational changes can be implemented flexibly in time.","[{""name"":""MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033"",""award"":""PID2020-116342GA-I00;RYC2021-033536-I;PID2023-151104NA-I00;RYC2021-033940-I;CEX2023-001312-M;""},{""name"":""University of Granada"",""award"":""UCE-PP2023-11;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

This groundbreaking discovery, made in part possible through the genomic analysis of archaic remains, reshaped our understanding of human origins, and opened new research avenues to study the effects and consequences of archaic introgression. While significant progress has been made in identifying and quantifying archaic introgression, most studies have focused on contemporary individual genomic data. As a result, relatively little is known about the evolution of archaic variants within modern human populations shortly after interbreeding occurred. While analysis of ancient DNA from modern humans offers the potential to address this scientific gap, its poor quality has hindered its exploration. However, recent studies have shown that imputation using contemporary reference panels can accurately infer missing genotypes in ancient genomes. Here, we investigate the feasibility of using imputation to improve both global and local archaic ancestry inference in ancient genomes, by downsampling to different low-coverage values and imputing 20 high-coverage (>10X) ancient genomes, representing individuals from diverse temporal and geographical contexts. We tested the reliability of detecting and quantifying archaic introgression using D-statistics and the f4-ratio. We identified consistent results from the imputed and the original ancient genomes, suggesting that genomic estimates to detect and quantify introgression work well in imputed genomes. Regarding Local Ancestry Inference we find that we can identify more introgressed segments in imputed genomes than in non-imputed genomes. Surprisingly, we find that imputation accuracy is even higher in regions of archaic ancestry compared to other regions of the genome, facilitating the detection of introgressed segments in imputed genomes. Imputation also allows detection of Denisovan segments in Siberian and Alaskan individuals. We show that segments identified even at 0.0625X coverage can be used to reconstruct the history of introgressed haplotypes. For example, comparisons with archaic segments in contemporary humans reveal that the oldest individual analyzed, Ust'Ishim, carried segments that are now found exclusively in either European or East Eurasian populations, indicating that these segments co-occurred in a shared ancestral population. By comparing only ancient individuals, we demonstrate that clustering based solely on the identified archaic segments effectively groups individuals into genetic clusters that correspond to populations defined by geography and time. This analysis shows a clear distinction between individuals with Denisovan introgression and those without, as well as a more detailed separation between Mesolithic and Neolithic Europeans, with the latter closely resembling Central Eurasian individuals. Furthermore, despite the small sample size in this study, we are able to reconstruct the origins of genes identified as candidates for adaptive introgression in contemporary populations, such as the BCN2 gene, which is an adaptively introgressed gene identified in contemporary West Eurasians. Additionally, we identify new candidates for adaptive introgression including LEMD2 and MLN in Europe. In this gene-region, imputation helps resolve the introgressed haplotype, which is closest to the Vindija Neanderthal haplotype.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""award"":""ERC-2018-STG, 804994;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""award"":""RGY0075/2019;""},{""name"":""French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE45-0010;""},{""name"":""Taighde Éireann – Research Ireland"",""award"":""24/PATH-S/12372;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking).

However, it is not well understood whether personal light exposure patterns predicts and individuals risk of cardiovascular diseases.

ObjectiveTo assess whether day and night light exposure predicts incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and whether relationships of light with cardiovascular diseases differ according to genetic susceptibility, sex, and age.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

ParticipantsN=88,905, age (M{+/-}SD) = 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 56.9% female.

ExposureApproximately 13 million hours of personal light exposure data, tracked by wrist-worn light sensors (one week each).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, derived from UK National Health Service records, across a 9.5-year follow-up after light tracking.

ResultsPeople with the brightest nights (90-100th percentiles) had significantly higher risks of developing coronary artery disease (adjusted-HR range: 1.23-1.32), myocardial infarction (aHRs: 1.42-1.47), heart failure (aHRs: 1.45-1.56), atrial fibrillation (aHRs: 1.28-1.32), and stroke (aHRs: 1.28-1.30), compared to people with dark nights (0-50th percentiles). These relationships were robust after adjusting for established risk factors for cardiovascular health, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol, diet, sleep duration, socioeconomic status, and polygenic risk. Relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and coronary artery disease were stronger for women, and relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were stronger for younger individuals in this cohort.

Conclusions and RelevanceNight light exposure was a significant risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases in this cohort. In addition to current preventative measures, avoiding light at night may be a useful strategy for reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases.

Key Points

QuestionDoes personal light exposure predict incidence of cardiovascular diseases?

FindingsIn this study of [~]89,000 adults aged >40 years, exposure to brighter light at night predicted higher incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors.

In this study, we fit a family of two-population models to in-vitro data from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), tracking drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells under varying environmental conditions. The dataset, originally presented by Kaznatcheev et al., includes conditions with and without the drug Alectinib and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We compare combinations of growth models (logistic, Gompertz, von Bertalanffy) and drug efficacy terms (Norton-Simon, linear, ratio-dependent) to identify which best explains the observed dynamics. Our models incorporate density dependence, frequency-dependent competition, and drug response, enabling mechanistic interpretation of tumor cell interactions. The logistic model with ratio-dependent drug efficacy best fits monoculture data. Using growth parameters from monocultures, we infer inter-type competition coefficients in co-cultures. We find that growth rate and carrying capacity are stable across CAF conditions, while competition and drug efficacy parameters shift, altering interaction dynamics. Notably, CAFs promote coexistence between resistant and sensitive cells, whereas Alectinib induces competitive exclusion. Our results underscore the need to evaluate both model fit and biological plausibility to guide therapeutic modeling of cancer.

Author summaryHow cancer cells grow, compete, and respond to treatment depends not only on the drug, but also on their ecological context, including interactions with other cells and components of the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we explore how different mathematical models capture the behavior of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells under various conditions. We focus on two cell populations: one sensitive to treatment, and one resistant. Using in-vitro data, we compare growth models and drug response types to identify which model best explains the observed population dynamics. We also investigate how different factors, such as the drug Alectinib and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), change the way cancer cells interact. Our game-theoretic approach allows us to quantify how these external conditions affect competition between cell types, revealing when resistant and sensitive cells can coexist. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of tumor ecology and may support the development of adaptive cancer therapies that anticipate evolutionary responses to treatment.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

These interactions can support the persistence of resistant cells even in the absence of treatment, undermining standard aggressive therapies and motivating drug holiday-based approaches that leverage ecological dynamics. A key challenge in implementing such strategies is efficiently identifying interaction between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subpopulations. Evolutionary game theory provides a framework for characterizing these interactions. We investigate whether spatial patterns in single time-point images of cell populations can reveal the underlying game theoretic interactions between sensitive and resistant cells. To achieve this goal, we develop an agent-based model in which cell reproduction is governed by local game-theoretic interactions. We compute a suite of spatial statistics on single time-point images from the agent-based model under a range of games being played between cells. We quantify the informativeness of each spatial statistic and demonstrate that a simple machine learning model can classify the type of game being played. Our findings suggest that spatial structure contains sufficient information to infer ecological interactions. This work represents a step toward clinically viable tools for identifying cell-cell interactions in tumors, supporting the development of ecologically informed cancer therapies.

Author summaryDrug resistance is a major challenge in cancer treatment, often leading to relapse despite initially successful therapy. While mutations are a key driver, ecological interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells also play a critical role. These interactions are complex and dynamic, and few molecular biomarkers exist, making them difficult to study and account for in treatment planning. We use evolutionary game theory, a framework for quantifying interactions between cells, to investigate whether it is possible to infer these interactions using just a single time-point image of the cells. We develop an agent-based model where cells reproduce based on local interactions and quantify the resulting patterns in how cells are distributed across space using a suite of spatial statistics. We find that specific interaction types produce distinct spatial patterns that are evident in these metrics, and we train a simple machine learning model to classify the interaction type based on the metrics. Our results suggest that spatial data alone can offer valuable insights into tumor dynamics, potentially enabling more informed and adaptable cancer treatments based on eco-evolutionary principles.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""award"":""U01CA280829;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

Most current methods fall at one of two extremes: either opaque deep learning models that obscure biological meaning, or simplified frameworks that treat genes as isolated units. As such, these approaches overlook a crucial insight: gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cellular states can be harnessed to model perturbation responses. Here we present CIPHER (Covariance Inference for Perturbation and High-dimensional Expression Response), a conceptual framework leveraging linear response theory from statistical physics to predict transcriptome-wide perturbation outcomes using gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cells. We validated CIPHER on synthetic regulatory networks before applying it to 11 large-scale single-cell perturbation datasets covering 4,234 perturbations and over 1.36M cells. CIPHER robustly recapitulated genome-wide responses to single and double perturbations by exploiting baseline gene covariance structure. Importantly, eliminating gene-gene covariances, while retaining gene-intrinsic variances, reduced model performance by 11-fold, demonstrating the rich information stored within baseline fluctuation structures. Moreover, gene-gene correlations transferred successfully across independent experiments of the same cell type, revealing stereotypic fluctuation structures. Furthermore, CIPHER outperformed conventional differential expression metrics in identifying true perturbations while providing uncertainty-aware effect size estimates through Bayesian inference. Finally, most genome-wide responses propagated through the covariance matrix along approximately three independent and global gene modules. CIPHER underscores the importance of theoretically-grounded models in capturing complex biological responses, highlighting fundamental design principles encoded in cellular fluctuation patterns.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""award"":""DMS-2235451;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""award"":""MPTMPS-00005320;""},{""name"":""NUCATS T32, Northwestern University"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ryan Fellowship, Northwestern University"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""CSB postdoc fellowship, Northwestern University"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""IVADO"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Canada First Research Excellence Fund"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH"",""award"":""R35GM147400;""},{""name"":""Pew-Stewart Scholars Program"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Awards at the Scientific Interface"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

Comparison of stratigraphic architecture within the study area with published sections in the type area suggests that named sandstone marker horizons used for lithostratigraphic and sequence stratigraphic correlation in the type area have limited utility for regional correlation and need to be used with caution.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

The rapid transition to electric mobility, with projections of 40-45 million new electric vehicles (EVs) annually by 2030 (two in five new light-duty vehicles), promises quieter audible environments. However, a critical gap exists in our understanding of the acoustic trade-offs, especially of vehicle-generated ultrasound (frequencies >20 kHz). While ultrasound is known to be biologically potent, used for instance in wildlife repellents, its presence and potential impacts as an emission from traffic on sensitive species, such as bats, remain unaddressed. While the shift to EVs may reduce overall audible noise emissions, offering a green alternative, potential challenges for species with auditory systems tuned to ultrasound, and also actively using it via echolocation, could offset these benefits. This may set up a green-green dilemma, as the objective of decarbonising transport via e-mobility may undermine efforts to restore urban biodiversity. Our systematic review of 49 studies on anthropogenic/vehicular noise impacts on 114 bat species/species groups revealed that road noise, especially when overlapping with bat echolocation and communication frequencies, consistently elicited negative responses in playback experiments, whereas field observations were more variable. A meta-analysis from this dataset showed that the odds of bats being affected significantly increased with both noise intensity and frequency. Building on this evidence, this review explores the implications for a future dominated by EVs. We highlight the urgent need for further research to define acoustic thresholds and develop conservation strategies for wildlife in rapidly urbanising and electrifying landscapes.","[{""name"":""Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Sonderforschungsbereich (SFB) 1372"",""award"":""project-ID395940726;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

With the advancements of large-scale recordings, efficient and precise automated spike sorting methods have become essential. Existing approaches face challenges with channel quality variability, neuron-specific waveform drifts, and nonlinear changes in spike shapes that depend on neuronal morphology and electrode proximity. We introduce KIASORT (Knowledge-Integrated Automated Spike Sorting), which integrates knowledge from channel-specific classifiers trained on clustered spike waveforms to sort the data. KIASORT evaluates channel quality, automatically excludes noisy recordings, and identifies spike classes using a hybrid dimensionality reduction approach combining linear with nonlinear embeddings. To validate our approach against existing methods, we developed biophysical simulations demonstrating that conventional one-dimensional drift correction methods cannot address heterogeneous neuron-specific drift and nonlinear waveform changes. KIASORTs geometry-free, per-neuron tracking approach overcomes these limitations without assumptions about cluster shape or temporal stability. Specifically, KIASORT identified significantly greater number of high-quality units than Kilosort4 in ground-truth simulations with neuron-specific drift, while maintaining real-time processing capability. Complementing these advances, KIASORT also includes a unified graphical interface for data inspection, sorting, and curation, which is freely available online through link https://github.com/banaiek/KIASORT.","[{""name"":""Starr Foundation"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""award"":""R01MH123687;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.

We investigate the evolutionary emergence of enantioselectivity in plant borneol dehydrogenases (BDHs), which feature hydrophobic active-sites and are enantioselective towards dibornane-type monoterpenols. Ancestral sequence reconstruction provided a trajectory from the oldest unselective BDH ancestor N30 (E=12) toward the youngest selective ancestor N32, involving 19 mutations: 18 mutations are peripheral, one (I111L) occurs in the active-site. The mutation L111I in the hydrophobic pocket increased the selectivity of N30, while the back-mutation I111L decreased the selectivity of N32. Additional peripheral mutations (V136L/G169A/V183I) were required for high selectivity. Crystal structures suggested that protein dynamics, rather than structural changes shape these catalytic properties. Molecular simulations with funnel-metadynamics revealed a correlation between the active-sites solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) and selectivity.

We validate this approach by designing, hybridising, and deep sequencing single and dual substitution CDR region parts derived from nanobody GA10. Assembly of these parts into a full-length nanobody CDS facilitated the phage display of variant libraries for affinity maturation against its cyclic peptide target. Variants identified through enrichment analysis were expressed in isolation and yielded improved affinities by more than 100-fold.

However, reliance on datasets with pre-processed counts limits the size and diversity of these repositories and constrains downstream model training to data curated for divergent purposes.

Visual working memory and auditory working memory recruit different networks, which include posterior sensory cortices and multiple sensory-biased regions interleaved across frontal cortex. Additionally, a fronto-parietal network of supramodal regions is robustly recruited by working memory in both modalities. Here we examined functional connectivity among visual-biased, auditory-biased, and supramodal working memory networks by collecting fMRI data from 24 human participants (aged 18-43; 11 men and 13 women). Replicating and extending prior work from our laboratory (Tobyne et al., 2017; Noyce et al., 2022), resting-state fMRI (N=18) analysis revealed that the visual-biased WM network exhibits stronger functional connectivity with supramodal regions than does the auditory-biased network. These findings point to a potential functional asymmetry between visual and auditory working memory mechanisms; visual cognition may have more direct access to supramodal WM brain structures. Therefore, we hypothesized that auditory working memory task performance would evoke more robust changes in functional connectivity than would visual working memory task performance. To test this hypothesis, we examined changes in functional connectivity that occur when participants (N=21) perform visual or auditory working memory tasks equated for difficulty. Auditory working memory produced substantial network changes that increased the connectivity of the auditory-biased network to supramodal regions and visual-biased frontal regions. At the same time, connectivity from posterior visual areas to supramodal and frontal visual regions decreased. In contrast, the visual task produced more modest changes in functional connectivity. Moreover, we observed that the strength of auditory-biased network connectivity changes correlated with subject behavioral performance on the auditory task, with higher working memory precision observed in participants with greater connectivity changes. Therefore, the visual working memory network appears to have more robust connectivity to supramodal working memory cortical structures at rest, but during auditory working memory, dynamic network changes permit the auditory working memory network to increase connectivity to the supramodal and frontal visual working memory networks.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""award"":""BCS-1829394 to D.C.S;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

Our approach enables high-throughput screening of LRR receptor-ligand combinations and provides a computational framework for engineering plant immune systems.","[{""name"":""nih"",""award"":""1DP2AT011967-01;2R35GM136402;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

Despite its theoretical significance, the neural circuitry that implements precision-weighted prediction remains unclear. Using 7-Tesla fMRI and dynamic causal modelling (DCM), this study investigated how the brain encodes the precision of predictions during a visual cueing task with high- and low-precision conditions. We focused on the key regions implicated in predictive processing: the insular cortex, the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, and primary visual cortex (V1). Behaviourally, participants showed significantly greater accuracy in the high-precision condition (p < .001), confirming effective task manipulation. DCM analyses revealed that high-precision predictions elicited excitatory modulation of connectivity from the insula to V1 (Pp = .95), alongside inhibitory influences from the insula to the pulvinar (Pp = .99) and from the pulvinar to V1 (Pp = .89). Furthermore, leave-one-out cross validation revealed that individual differences in behavioural sensitivity to precision were positively predicted by pulvinar-to-insula connectivity (r = .36, p = .026) and negatively predicted by the connectivity between pulvinar and V1 (pulvinar to V1: r = .35, p = .033; V1 to pulvinar: r = .37, p = .026), highlighting the behavioural relevance of these pathways. Together, these findings suggest a dual-route mechanism whereby the insula directly enhances top-down predictions in V1 while indirectly dampening bottom-up sensory input via the pulvinar. This mechanism may facilitate Bayesian integration under uncertainty and offers new hypotheses into how precision weighting may be disrupted in neuropsychiatric conditions.","[{""name"":""The University of Melbourne"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

We found that elevated serum levels of soluble E-cadherin (sEcad), an 80-kDa fragment of E-cadherin, in patients with metastatic IBC correlated with poorer outcomes and increased rates of brain metastases. In our effort to understand the underlying mechanism, we discovered that sEcad binds to XIAP, an inhibitor of cell death, activating the pro-survival NF-k{beta} signaling in tumor cells. We also discovered that sEcad affects the tumor cell microenvironment by enhancing cancer cell adhesion to endothelial cells and inducing reactive astrocytosis in the brain. In addition, we found that sEcad-mediated reactive astrocytosis relies on the CXCL1/CXCL8-CXCR2 axis and treatment with a brain-permeable CXCR2 antagonist reduced brain metastatic burden and prolonged survival. These findings implicate sEcad in brain metastasis and provide new insights into potential therapeutic targets for IBC.

Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone. Because differentially prioritized variants are driven by Borzoi predictions, we leverage attribution techniques to characterize sequence features underlying fine mapping and generate mechanistic hypotheses for GWAS associations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

However, the role of astrocyte-mediated communication has been largely underappreciated. While astrocytes communicate with one another through gap junctions, the extent and specificity of this communication remain poorly understood. Astrocyte gap junctions are necessary for memory formation1,2, synaptic plasticity3-5, coordination of neuronal signaling6, and closing the visual and motor critical periods7,8. These findings indicate that this form of communication is essential for proper central nervous system development and function. Despite their significance, studying astrocyte gap junctional networks has been challenging. Current methods like slice electrophysiology disrupt network connectivity and introduce artifacts due to tissue damage. To overcome these limitations, we developed a vector-based approach that labels molecules as they are fluxed by astrocyte gap junctions in awake, behaving animals. We then used whole-brain tissue clearing9,10 to image these intact, three-dimensional astrocyte networks. We show that multiple astrocyte networks traverse the mouse brain. These networks selectively connect specific regions, rather than diffusing indiscriminately, and vary in size and organization. We observe local networks are confined to single brain regions and long-range networks robustly interconnecting multiple regions across hemispheres, often exhibiting patterns distinct from known neuronal networks. Further, we demonstrate that astrocyte networks undergo structural reorganization in adult brain following sensory deprivation. These discoveries reveal a previously unrecognized mode of communication between distant brain regions, mediated by plastic networks of gap junction-coupled astrocytes.","[{""name"":""Leon Levy Foundation"",""award"":""Postdoctoral Fellowship in Neuroscience;""},{""name"":""Pew Charitable Trusts"",""award"":""Postdoctoral Fellowship;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""award"":""SURFiN Fellowship;""},{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""award"":""320030-232028;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""award"":""K00 AG068343;5U19 NS107616;T32 MH019524;R01 EY033353;P30 CA016087;""},{""name"":""Cure Alzheimer’s Fund"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

However, functional studies of their development, evolution, and biology have been constrained by the lack of efficient and scalable genome editing tools. Here, we report a robust, high-efficiency, and transgene-free CRISPR-Cas12-based genome editing method applicable across four ecologically and biotechnologically important brown algal species. Using Ectocarpus as a model, we optimized a PEG-mediated RNP delivery system employing a temperature-tolerant Cas12 variant, achieving reproducible, high-efficiency editing across multiple loci without the need for cloning or specialized equipment. As proof of concept, we precisely recapitulated the hallmark imm mutant phenotype by editing the IMMEDIATE UPRIGHT (IMM) locus, a phenotype previously described only from a rare spontaneous mutation. APT/2-FA-based selection further improved specificity with minimal false positives. The protocol was readily transferrable to other species, including kelps long considered recalcitrant to transformation. This platform now makes functional genomics accessible in brown algae, enabling mechanistic dissection of developmental processes, life cycle transitions, and the independent origins of complex multicellularity. Our work enables the broader adoption of brown algae as experimental models and provides a valuable platform for marine biotechnology and evolutionary research.

MotivationAlthough most of biodiversity on Earth lives in oceans, a significant proportion of its organisms remain largely uncharacterized. Brown algae represent one of such understudied group of marine photosynthetic eukaryotes. Despite their importance as emerging models for developmental evolution and blue biotechnology, functional genomics in brown algae has remained largely inaccessible due to a lack of efficient and scalable genome editing tools. Our aim is to democratize genome editing in brown algae by developing a high-efficiency, transgene-free protocol that works across multiple species, without the need for specialized equipment. This high-efficiency method fully enables the field of functional genomics in an unexplored multicellular lineage.

ResultsIn this study we benchmark structure prediction methods on unseen antibody-antigen complexes reveals that: (i) increased sampling improves the chances of generating correct models in a roughly log-linear way, (ii) for all methods, a significant challenge is identifying the correct models among those generated, (iii) AlphaFold3 outperforms AlphaFold2, Boltz-1 and Chai-1, and (iv) AlphaFold3s performance declines significantly for complexes lacking structural similarities to the training set, indicating that it has primarily learnt to detect remote structural similarities rather than to learn the physics of interactions.

We identified 734 molecular features associated with cognitive rank within individual data layers, of which 227 features remain when integrating all data layers with each other. Among the single-layer predictors, several host and microbial features were highlighted, with host-associated markers being predominant. Host features associated with cognitive function mainly belong to innate and adaptive inflammatory activity (inflammaging) and developmental processes.

Such biases distort phylogenetic inference, particularly in deep or unevenly sampled phylogenomic datasets. While composition-aware models can mitigate this issue, their computational demands often preclude their use in large-scale analyses. We present WitChi, a computationally efficient tool for identifying and removing compositionally biased alignment columns using empirical significance testing. WitChi calculates taxon-specific chi-squared ({chi}{superscript 2}) scores and compares them to null distributions derived from column permutations that preserve the phylogenetic structure of the alignment. Sites most responsible for significant deviation are iteratively pruned using one of three scoring algorithms, continuing until no taxa remain significantly biased or until further pruning would reduce the overall alignment {chi}{superscript 2} score below the expected null range. Z-scores and p-values are provided for both taxa and alignments, offering interpretable metrics of bias severity. Pruning of simulated compositional heterogeneous alignments show that WitChi reliably restores correct topologies under standard, compositionally stationary models. In benchmarks, WitChi outperforms or matches BMGEs stationary-based trimming while scaling linearly with taxon number. Applied to the archaeal GTDB r220 dataset (5,869 taxa; 10,101 sites), WitChi completes pruning in under two hours on four CPU cores. The resulting phylogeny recovers key clades previously resolved only by in-depth analyses using complex models of sequence evolution. WitChi provides an efficient and scalable solution for detecting and removing compositional bias, enabling more accurate phylogenetic inference across the tree of life.","[{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""award"":""NWO-2021.059;VI.C.192.016;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""award"":""817834;101142180;""},{""name"":""Volkswagen Foundation"",""award"":""96725;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""award"":""73592LPI;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

Central to this decline is a complex interplay between inflammation and stem cell function. How these two processes are linked and influence regenerative capacity remains unclear. Here, we undertake a comprehensive assessment of age-related changes in the mouse colon at single-cell resolution. A survey of immune and epithelial compartments revealed a hyperactivated inflammatory state in the colon of old mice characterized by the induction of an interferon {gamma} (IFN{gamma}) response signature in immune cells. This does not result in increased inflammation under homeostasis, but triggers a disproportionate inflammatory response, disrupting regeneration after challenge with the enteropathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Colons of old mice exhibit higher production of IFN{gamma} by T and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that are associated with reduced Lgr5+ stem cells and decreased epithelial proliferation. Interestingly, we find aged intestinal epithelial cells to be hypersensitive to IFN{gamma} signaling, inducing a regeneration-associated fetal-like gene expression signature that, in turn, renders these cells more sensitive to IFN{gamma}-induced apoptosis. Our findings reveal an age-related imbalance in the interaction between the immune and epithelial compartments in the colon, priming the system for excessive inflammatory responses and the emergence of a hypersensitive epithelial cell state thus derailing proper repair of the intestinal epithelium after injury.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

Current methods struggle to capture this complexity at the single-molecule level. Here we introduce Iterative Mapping of Proteoforms (IMaP), a method that enables the massively-parallel interrogation of millions to billions of single-protein molecules through iterative probing with fluorescently labeled antibodies. Using 12 site-specific antibodies, the method is capable of measuring 212 (4,096) potential proteoform groups. We used IMaP to measure proteoform group profiles of the tau protein, a key player in neurodegenerative diseases, using two pan anti-tau antibodies (Tau-13, Tau-216), three isoform-specific antibodies (Anti-0N, Anti-2N, Anti-4R), and seven phosphosite-specific antibodies (Anti-pT181, Anti-pS202+pT205, Anti-pT205, Anti-pS214, Anti-pT217, Anti-pT231, and Anti-pS396). The method demonstrates high sensitivity (detecting proteoforms at 0.1% abundance), high reproducibility (median CV <5.5%), and broad dynamic range (>3 orders of magnitude), outperforming conventional techniques in resolving closely related proteoform groups. We demonstrated that the method can be used on relevant biological samples by examining various neuronal models (iNeuron cells, organoids, MiBrains, and mouse brains) and human samples. This examination revealed 130 distinct tau proteoform groups with as many as six phosphorylation events. The non-random distribution of these phosphorylation events suggests ordered and site-specific modification processes rather than random, stochastic accumulation. Certain combinations of phosphorylation events were more abundant than others; for example, pT217 preferentially co-occurred with pT181. In validating the applicability of the assay to human disease samples, we noted a specific pattern of multiple phosphorylation events in an advanced Alzheimers disease patient that suggests a sequential pathway of pathological tau modification. Iterative Mapping of Proteoforms provides insights into proteoform complexity at the single-molecule level, with significant implications for understanding protein regulation in neurodegenerative diseases and beyond.","[{""name"":""nih"",""award"":""RF1NS123568;1RF1NS142335;RF1NS123568;1RF1NS142335;R01AG089533;""},{""name"":""NASA"",""award"":""80ARC022CA004;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

The persistent infections thought to give rise to these variants, however, have been difficult to identify at scale. This study sought to detect and characterize persistent infection cases in California using routine epidemiologic and genomic surveillance data. We identified 69 persistent infection cases with collection dates between January 2021 and July 2023 ranging from 21 to 400 days in duration, with an average of 44 days. Significant differences were identified in age distribution, sex, hospitalizations, and deaths between persistent infection cases and all sequenced California SARS-CoV-2 cases.

Underlying health conditions were identified for the majority of cases with available medical records. The mutations found in these cases were suggestive of positive selection in the Spike receptor binding domain and convergent evolution toward immune evasion and residues observed in previous persistent infections. We describe a 400-day B.1.429 infection that demonstrates substantial intra-host evolution, and a BA.5.11 persistent infection revealing apparent competition between two intra-host viral subpopulations. By establishing a framework for detecting persistent infections, this study lays the groundwork for other public health organizations to monitor and investigate highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

Author SummaryGenomic surveillance has been used to monitor the evolution and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants throughout the pandemic. When a new variant emerges, it is often due to the accumulation of mutations during a persistent infection, i.e. in an individual who was unable to clear the virus after an infection. Using genomic and epidemiologic surveillance data, we identify 69 of these persistent infections in California and provide demographic and clinical characteristics of these infections compared to the broader population of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The identification of risk factors for persistent infections provides important insight into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, while the identification of shared mutations between these infections enhances our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolution that may result in new variants. Ultimately, our work may help public health labs to better monitor persistent infections in the future, prior to the potential emergence and spread of novel variants into the community.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

How does the brain use such error signals for learning? While global error signals can be useful, their ability to learn complex computation at the scale observed in the brain is lacking. In comparison, more local, neuron-specific error signals enable superior performance, but their computation and propagation remain unclear. Motivated by the breakthrough of deep learning, this has inspired the  backpropagation and the brain hypothesis, i.e. that the brain implements a form of the error backpropagation algorithm.

In this work, we introduce a biologically motivated, multi-area cortical microcircuit model, implementing error backpropagation under consideration of recent physiological evidence. We model populations of cortical pyramidal cells acting as representation and error neurons, with bio-plausible local and inter-area connectivity, guided by experimental observations of connectivity of the primate visual cortex. In our model, all information transfer is biologically motivated, inference and learning occur without phases, and network dynamics demonstrably approximate those of error backpropagation.

We show the capabilities of our model on a wide range of benchmarks, and compare to other models, such as dendritic hierarchical predictive coding. In particular, our model addresses shortcomings of other theories in terms of scalability to many cortical areas. Finally, we make concrete predictions, which differentiate it from other theories, and which can be tested in experiment.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""award"":""225643;""},{""name"":""Volkswagen Foundation"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

Instead, a counter-clockwise tissue rotation around Hensens node, the organizer of amniote development, repositions cells expressing L/R sidedness genes. Yet, the physical origin of this rotation remains elusive. Here, we provide evidence that in quail embryos, the node tissue generates an active chiral torque of [~]6{micro}N{micro}m to drive the chiral tissue flow. Microsurgery experiments reveal that this torque depends on actomyosin molecular activity, is generated within the dorsal node tissue, and requires the underlying ventral meso-/endoderm to act as a mechanical substrate sustaining the counter-torque.

Understanding whether gender disparities exist in retraction rates, especially among top-performing scientists, may inform broader efforts to promote equity and research integrity.

ObjectiveTo assess gender disparities in the likelihood of having retracted publications among highly cited and all other authors, and to explore how these vary across scientific fields, countries, and publication age cohorts.

DesignCross-sectional bibliometric analysis incorporating retraction data into Scopus-based databases of top-cited scientists (top 2%) and all authors with [&ge;]5 publications. Retraction data were obtained from Retraction Watch and linked with author-level citation metrics.

SettingGlobal, science-wide analysis using data from authors in all disciplines indexed in Scopus.

ParticipantsA total of 10,361,367 authors with [&ge;]5 publications were included; 217,097 were among the top 2% most-cited authors. Gender was confidently assigned using NamSor for 8,267,888 authors. Authors with uncertain gender were excluded from gender-specific analyses.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresGender-specific retraction rates and the relative propensity (R) of women vs men to have at least one retraction, overall and stratified by citation status, field, country income level, publication age cohort and publication volumes.

ResultsAmong highly cited authors, retraction rates were 3.3% in men and 2.9% in women; among all authors, rates were 0.7% for both genders. Differences varied by field: womens rates were at least one-third lower than mens (R < 0.67) in Biology, Biomedical Research, and Psychology (R{square}< {square}0.67), but higher (R{square}> {square}1.33) in Economics, Engineering, and Information and Communication Technologies. Among highly cited authors, younger cohorts showed increasingly higher rates among men (4.2% men vs. 3.0% women in those starting to publish in 2002-2011; 8.7% men vs. 4.9% women in those starting post-2011). Country-level differences among highly cited authors were pronounced in some countries, as in Pakistan (28.7% men vs. 14.3% women). Among all authors, country-level gender differences were small.

Conclusions and RelevanceGender differences in retraction rates exist but are modest. Field, country, and publication volume are stronger correlates. Structural and contextual factors likely drive retraction patterns and warrant further investigation.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAre there gender disparities in the likelihood of having retracted publications among highly cited scientists and the broader scientific population?

FindingsIn this cross-sectional bibliometric analysis of over 10 million authors with at least 5 publications, including 217,097 top-cited scientists, retraction rates were slightly lower in women than in men. Gender differences were modest compared with disparities by country, field, and citation volume, but varied across disciplines and publication age cohorts.

MeaningGender is a minor correlate of retraction, and structural or contextual factors likely drive retraction patterns in science.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

With this new implementation, Martini 3 allows more bead types and sizes, becoming more amenable to study dynamical phenomena involving small molecules such as protein-ligand interactions and membrane permeation. However, while there were some solutions to automatically model small molecules using the previous iteration of Martini force field, there is no simple way to generate such molecules for Martini 3 yet. Here, we introduce Auto-MartiniM3, an advanced and updated version of the Auto-Martini program, designed to automate the coarse-graining of small molecules to be used with the Martini 3 force field. We validated our approach by modeling 81 small molecules from the Martini Database and comparing their structural and thermodynamic properties with ones obtained from models designed by Martini experts. Additionally, we assessed the behavior of Auto-MartiniM3-generated models by calculating solute translocation and free energy across lipid bilayers. We also evaluated more complex molecules such as caffeine by testing its binding to the adenosine A2A receptor. Finally, our results from deploying Auto-MartiniM3 on a large dataset of molecular fragments demonstrate that this program can become a tool of choice for fast high-throughput creation of coarse-grained models of small molecules, offering a good balance between automation and accuracy.

Cross-modal analyses revealed robust OPM-fMRI correspondence, including inverse correlations at low frequencies and positive correlations at higher frequencies, consistent with known relationships between oscillatory power and BOLD responses. Comparisons of signal-to-noise (SNR) estimates further revealed that in some regions, the SNR of cross-modal alignment exceeded within-modality reliability, suggesting that bridging between modalities can sometimes enhance SNR by attenuating reliably shared noise.

MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1753481416530

We achieved > 90% success rate in creating per-patient models, including 227 tumor-derived and 203 neighboring normal PDOs. These organoids accurately mirror key features of the original tumors, such as their histology (e.g. microsatellite instability), mutations, and drug response, across treatment points. Notably, PDOs can predict individual patient responses to chemotherapy within five weeks, underscoring their clinical relevance. Furthermore, high-throughput drug screening on PDO subsets generates personalized chemosensitivity profiles for 22 drugs. Through a process of continued refinement of culture techniques and tumor sampling approach, our large-scale comprehensive collection of GEA avatars represents a unique and valuable preclinical experimental resource for precision oncology.

Cryo-EM structures of SlNRC3 in AVRcap1b-bound and unbound states reveal that AVRcap1b bridges multiple protomers, stabilizing a stalled intermediate and preventing formation of a functional resistosome. Leveraging AVRcap1b as a molecular tool, we also capture an additional SlNRC3 resistosome intermediate showing that assembly proceeds in a stepwise manner from dissociated monomers.

While various methods exist to study these interactions, investigating those that involve nuclear proteins, including structurally complex proteins containing long disordered regions, remains a significant challenge. Here, we developed nxReLo, a simple and fast cell culture-based colocalization assay, designed to identify and characterize interactions between nuclear proteins. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) safeguard germline genome integrity, and the PPIs that facilitate piRNA production are therefore essential for animal reproduction, yet remain incompletely understood. We used nxReLo to investigate interactions between members of the Drosophila melanogaster Rhino-Deadlock-Cutoff (RDC) complex and two associated components, Bootlegger and Moonshiner, a nuclear protein network required for piRNA expression. We demonstrate the utility of the nxReLo assay by systematically screening pairwise interactions within the RDC network and by assembling a multiprotein complex from multiple components. By combining nxReLo assays with AlphaFold structural prediction, we characterized the Cutoff-Deadlock and the Bootlegger-Deadlock complexes in detail, providing molecular and structural insights. Specifically, we refined the domains involved in the interaction and identified interface point mutations that interfered with complex formation, validating the predicted structures. In conclusion, nxReLo facilitates rapid and simple testing of direct interactions between nuclear proteins in a cellular context, which is particularly important when working with structurally challenging proteins or when established interaction assays prove unsuccessful.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""award"":""JE-827/1-1;JE-827/1-1;""},{""name"":""Chica and Heinz Schaller Foundation"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation"",""award"":""NNF18OC0030954;""},{""name"":""Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond"",""award"":""9064-00056B;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

In this regard, harnessing the inherent ability of cellular tissues to self-organize and generate robust force fields offers a promising strategy for creating self-shaping living surfaces. However, achieving precise control over tissue mechanics to direct specific morphogenetic outcomes remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a strategy to program tissue shape transformations through the nematic organization of cellular forces. By precisely controlling nematic order and topological defects, we generate millimeter-scale tissues programmed with specific multicellular tension fields. Using a theoretical framework that integrates contractile nematics with thin sheet mechanics, we explore the role of nematically guided tensions in shape morphogenesis. Experimentally, upon tissue detachment, nematically guided tension fields drive out-of-plane deformations, generating reproducible 3D shapes. By integrating tissue contractility and nematic patterning, our approach offers a robust framework for the rational design of shape-programmable living surfaces.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B “Meiosis”;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

As part of a broader long-term study on African leopard (Panthera pardus) population ecology in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, we deployed camera traps on animal trails and at Python Cave, a known roost site of Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and a confirmed Marburg and virus reservoir. This serendipitous deployment yielded the first visual documentation of a multi-trophic predator and scavenger guild interacting at a filovirus reservoir site. Over a five month period (February 16th - June 5th 2025) across 304 trap nights, we recorded at least 14 different vertebrate species, including leopards, primates, raptors, and small carnivores, engaging in bat predation, scavenging on bat remains, guano foraging, or cave exploration across 261 temporally and spatially independent events (>1 hour apart). These instances were structured, repeated and the species continuously made contact with the bats or entered their roosting space. Camera traps also recorded an estimated 400 human individuals visiting the cave -- including school groups, tourists, and local trainees -- the majority with no personal protective equipment. The shallow, accessible structure of Python Cave appears to collapse the typical spatial buffers between reservoir species and both predators and humans. These observations constitute the first ecological confirmation of a dynamic, multispecies exposure network at a known Marburg virus site, and may represent a Rosetta Stone for interpreting the real-time mechanics of zoonotic spillover.","[{""name"":""Denver Zoo"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Lion Recovery Fund, Wildlife Conservation Network"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Adventure Travel Conservation Fund"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

We establish the lifespan normative trajectories for 296 structural brain phenotypes, encompassing global, subcortical, and cortical measures. Cross-population comparisons with Western brain charts (based on data from 56,339 participants aged 0-100 years) reveal distinct neurodevelopmental patterns in the Chinese population, including prolonged cortical and subcortical maturation, accelerated cerebellar growth, and earlier development of sensorimotor regions relative to paralimbic regions. Crucially, these Chinese-specific charts outperform Western-derived models in predicting healthy brain phenotypes and detecting pathological deviations in Chinese clinical cohorts. These findings highlight the urgent need for diverse, population-representative brain charts to advance equitable precision neuroscience and improve clinical validity across populations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

The mechanism by which ectopic gene activation occurs through these gain-of-function enhancer mutations remains poorly understood. Using the ZRS, a benchmark disease-associated enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), as a model, we demonstrate that poised (i.e., accessible but inactive) chromatin sensitizes Shh to aberrant activation in anterior limb bud, leading to polydactyly. In the anterior limb cells of wild-type mice, Shh is inactive, but the ZRS is accessible and marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. We demonstrate that this poising signature explains how over 20 independent rare variants within the ZRS cause Shh misexpression in the same anterior limb bud cell population, resulting in similar limb malformations, despite affecting binding sites for different activators and repressors. Disabling pioneer transcription factor binding to the ZRS suppresses its poised state in anterior cells, prevents aberrant activation of the ZRS by rare variants, and fully rescues limb malformations in variant knock-in mice. A thorough examination of other disease-associated enhancers with pathogenic gain-of-function variants revealed that they are all poised in tissues with ectopic activity. We use this poising signature to predict and validate in vivo ectopic forebrain activity of previously uncharacterized autism-associated non-coding variants. Our findings suggest that spatial enhancer poising, likely a byproduct of development, creates a susceptibility to non-coding mutations and offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the burden of disease-associated non-coding variants.","[{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""award"":""R01HD115268;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

We find that the two primates and mouse share similar X chromosome expression dynamics, including X chromosome reactivation (XCR), and that in Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) testes, germ cells undergo female-like XCR and escape of X inactivation. New male-specific regulatory regions have emerged progressively during mammalian evolution, especially on the X following sex chromosome origination. Further analyses revealed that male-specific regulatory regions evolved faster than female-specific ones in both supporting and pre-meiotic germ cells. However, female meiotic germ cells show even higher rates of molecular evolution and exhibit a permissive chromatin state that facilitates the birth of new genes, thus resembling their adult spermatogenic counterparts. Finally, we traced both conserved and species-specific gene expression trajectories across the three mammals, uncovering candidate genes for disorders of sex development that are typically central to cell-type-specific regulatory networks.

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2. These structural predictions were based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database, together with corresponding protein sequences obtained from UniProt. We then assessed the predicted interaction structures through various confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we performed a limited evaluation against experimentally determined human protein complex structures not included in the Boltz-2 training regimen, which indicated prediction accuracy consistent with AlphaFold3. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, while highlighting both strengths and limitations. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","[{""name"":""Levy-Longenbaugh Donor-Advised Fund"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""award"":""DBI-2321666;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Energy"",""award"":""DE-SC0019749;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""award"":""R01GM157729;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

Correspondingly, current theories describe muscle activity as a function of cortical dynamics. Tasks like speech and locomotion, however, require the integration of voluntary commands with ongoing movements orchestrated by largely independent subcortical centers. In such cases, motor cortex must receive inputs representing the state of the environment and the state of subcortical networks, then transform these inputs into commands that modulate the rhythmic motor pattern. Here, we study this transformation in mice performing an obstacle traversal task, which combines a spinal locomotor pattern with voluntary cortical adjustments. Cortical dynamics contain a prominent representation of motor preparation that is linked to obstacle proximity and robust to removal of somatosensory or visual input, and also maintain a representation of the state of the spinal pattern generator. Readout signals resembling commands for obstacle traversal are consistent across trials, but small in amplitude. Using computational modeling, we identify a simple algorithm that generates the appropriate commands through phase-dependent gating. Together, these results reveal a regime in which motor cortex does not fully specify muscle activity, but must sculpt an ongoing, spinally-generated program to flexibly control behavior in a complex and changing environment.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""award"":""R01NS129576;""},{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"",""award"":""Postdoctoral fellowship to Eric Kirk;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription. Together, these findings redefine H3K4me3 as a post-transcriptional histone mark, revealing an unexpected layer of epigenetic regulation with broad implications for gene expression control.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

ObjectiveTo estimate the impacts of federal policy changes on PrEP coverage, new HIV infections and costs associated with new HIV infections

DesignEstimation of excess HIV infections under different policy impacts were conducted using parameters from a previously published ecological model of the relationship between PrEP coverage and new HIV infections. Costs were estimated for the treatment of infections not averted under different scenarios.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsThere was no individual participation in research activities; population-based data sources were used to describe the population-level PrEP use and new diagnoses under different hypothetical changes in PrEP coverage.

ExposuresPercent of people with indications for PrEP who are taking PrEP

Main Outcome and MeasuresEstimated change in new HIV infections under different assumptions of change in PrEP coverage; costs of treatment for avoidable HIV infections and net costs of avoidable infections after accounting for costs of PrEP medications.

ResultsEven modest reductions in PrEP coverage would result in thousands of avoidable HIV infections. An absolute 3.3% annual reduction in PrEP coverage over the next decade would result in 8,618 avoidable HIV infections, with lifetime medical costs of over $3.6 billion (discounted) for treatment of the unaverted HIV infections.

Conclusions and RelevanceChanges in policy that reduce PrEP uptake would result in avoidable HIV infections and increased costs for HIV treatment. Maintaining policies and programs that support PrEP uptake offers benefits for health and is estimated to result in net cost savings.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the likely impacts on HIV transmissions and healthcare costs if policy changes result in decreased PrEP utilization in the United States?

FindingsUnder assumptions of even modest reductions in PrEP use, we estimated thousands of HIV infections would fail to be averted over the next decade, and billions of dollars of additional treatment costs would accrue to the healthcare system.

Results of the studyWe used historical descriptive data on the US HIV epidemic to quantify the relationship between PrEP coverage and trends in HIV diagnoses and to estimate future trends in HIV infections if PrEP coverage were to be rolled back. If PrEP use declines modestly - about 3% annually - we estimate that 8,618 new infections would fail to be averted in a decade because of lowered PrEP uptake, and the estimated lifetime medical costs of these unaverted infections would be $3.6 billion (discounted) and $9.3 billion (undiscounted).

MeaningChanges in healthcare priorities and policies, especially those that increase out of pocket costs of PrEP or reduce the convenience of engaging in PrEP care, risk rolling back our progress in ending the HIV epidemic, accruing avertable HIV infections, and incurring increased costs for medical care of people whose HIV infections were avoidable.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1753481416530

In unicellular bacteria, the ParMRC DNA partitioning apparatus is well known for forming actin-like filaments that push low copy number plasmids to opposite cell poles. In multicellular cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the presence of a chromosomally encoded ParMR system suggests it may play an analogous role in chromosome segregation. However, we show here that it instead constitutes a novel cytoskeletal system - termed CorMR - whose loss does not impair DNA segregation but leads to severe morphological defects, revealing a role in maintaining cell shape. Using live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that CorM forms dynamically instable filaments. These filaments are recruited to the membrane by CorR, which has acquired a conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that CorM forms antiparallel double-stranded filaments, in contrast to the polar, parallel filament pair seen in ParM. Furthermore, CorMR filaments are excluded from the cell poles and division plane by MinC, via a long N-terminal extension also specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Comparative genomics suggests that cyanobacterial multicellularity co-evolved with the chromosomal relocation of ParMR genes, acquisition of the amphipathic helix in CorR, and functional extension of MinC, supporting an evolutionary link among these features. Our findings uncover a striking repurposing of ancestral biochemical systems, expanding the known roles of ParMR and Min systems beyond plasmid segregation and division site selection to include regulation of cell shape.

ImportanceThe ParMRC system is a well-characterized machinery for the segregation of low-copy-number plasmids to the cell poles and, until now, was primarily described to be encoded on plasmids. We found that during the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, a chromosome-encoded ParMR system has undergone extensive evolutionary and functional repurposing, resulting in a previously undescribed bacterial cytoskeletal system that controls cell shape. We also found that this new cytoskeleton, called CorMR, is under the control of the MinCDE system, which has evolved to not only antagonize Z-ring formation, but also to regulate CorM polymerization. Such interplay between different cytoskeletal systems highlights an intricate regulatory mechanism linking cell division and morphology. As this repurposing of existing cytoskeletal system coincided with the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, it may have played a key role for the evolution of cyanobacteria with distinct cell shapes. Overall, our discovery highlights the plasticity of bacterial polymeric systems and gives insight into the evolution of cellular and multicellular complexity.","[{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020"",""award"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Grant Agreement No.101034413;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""award"":""ActinID, 101076260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

Understanding how the Healthy Eating Index-2020 (HEI-2020) can be used as a measure of diet quality to create benchmarks for national nutrition monitoring can assist in surveillance and improve the design of nutrition programs and policies.

ObjectiveTo examine the utility of the HEI-2020 to create benchmarks for national diet quality monitoring.

MethodsThis serial cross-sectional study used data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Nationally representative data for 22,168 US adults ([&ge;]20 years) who completed two 24-hour recalls were analyzed. We derived HEI-2020 scores (0-100) from participants two 24-hour dietary recalls. Diet quality categories were established: high diet quality (>70-100), marginal (>60-70), low (>50-60), and very low (0-50).

ResultsOnly 13% of US adults had high diet quality while nearly two-thirds had low or very low diet quality. Diet quality was higher for older adults, female, ""Other"" race or ethnicity, born outside of the US, have higher education attainment, higher income, and food security. Compared to adults with high diet quality, adults with very low diet quality had lower intakes of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and seafood and the highest intakes of ultra-processed foods, refined grains, and red and processed meats (all P-trends <0.01). Adults with very low diet quality were more likely to have elevated adiposity, lower HDL cholesterol, and higher triglycerides, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c (all P-trends [&le;]0.01).

ConclusionsThe HEI-2020 is a robust measure of diet quality that can be directly linked to biological measures associated with chronic disease risk. Using evidence-based HEI categories could allow policymakers, public health practitioners, and nutrition professionals to set benchmarks and nationwide targets for achieving improved diet quality.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1753481416530

How these cancer-specific methylation changes are established in the decades before cancer, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we use a unique collection of longitudinal blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia to sensitively track the dynamics of DNA methylation changes at high temporal resolution. We identify thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that exhibit altered patterns of methylation up to 10 years before acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) diagnosis. Most of these DMRs are strongly associated with expanding clones carrying somatic driver mutations. We identify a subset of  epigenetic driver DMRs characterised by recurrent CpG alterations that are highly shared across pre-AML cases. These are likely to reflect early epigenetic reprogramming associated with AML development. We also reveal large numbers of stochastic  passenger CpGs whose differential methylation results from hitch-hiking with clonal expansions driven by somatically acquired genetic events. These passenger CpGs can be exploited for lineage tracing to discover clonal expansions driven by missing driver mutations. Our findings show widespread changes in methylation patterns during the early stages of cancer development which could be utilised for risk prediction and therapeutic intervention.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1753481416530

Here we analyzed evolutionarily unrelated signal-sequestering viral proteins, finding that they share structural and biophysical traits in their genetic organization, ternary structures and binding pocket properties. Based on these traits we developed a structure-guided computational pipeline that can sift through large phage genome databases to unbiasedly predict phage proteins that manipulate bacterial immune signaling. Numerous previously uncharacterized proteins, grouped into three families, were verified to inhibit the bacterial Thoeris and CBASS signaling systems. Proteins of the Sequestin and Lockin families bind and sequester the TIR-produced signaling molecules 3'cADPR and His-ADPR, while proteins of the Acb5 family cleave and inactivate 3'3'-cGAMP and related molecules. X-ray crystallography and structural modeling, combined with mutational analyses, explain the structural basis for sequestration or cleavage of the immune signals. Thousands of these signal-manipulating proteins were detected in phage protein databases, with some instances present in well-studied model phages such as T2, T4 and T6.
