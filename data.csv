Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1743199745505

Functional profiling reveals unique carbohydrate metabolism adaptations consistent with high-fiber diets. Longitudinal analysis over two years reveals microbiome instability, with shifts in taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential, including changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we characterize the gut virome and eukaryotic microbiome, identifying novel viral taxa, including Crassvirales phages, and a high prevalence of Blastocystis species in individuals with greater microbial diversity. Finally, by integrating host genomic data obtained from low-pass saliva whole-genome sequencing, we uncover significant host-microbiome associations, highlighting the influence of human genetic variation on microbial composition. People who are more genetically similar also have more similar gut microbiomes. These findings expand our understanding of microbiome diversity in non-industrialized populations, highlighting the uniqueness of those microbiomes and underscoring the need for global microbiome research.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

This study focused on intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), distinguishing their origin as either within-host mutations or parental. The whole genome analysis revealed accelerated evolution, with positive selection detected in key genes such as Spike, N, ORF9b, and nsp13, all involved in viral replication and immune evasion. Of the two evolutionary mechanisms involved, host-driven mutation has played a dominant role in this evolutionary story. C>T transitions emerged as the most widespread mutational signature, consistent with host-driven RNA editing mechanisms. Two host-internal mutations, A28271T in the translation initiation region of the N Kozak gene and C26858T in the M gene, were highly shared among the deposited SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Recombination with parental lineages played a major role particularly in Spike, ORF3a and M genes. In Spike, the B.1.1.7 sequence was selected, wild-type ORF3a and M were restored, suggesting a selective advantage in returning to an ancestral sequence. In addition, the temporary emergence of intra-host convergent mutations in Spike, notably L5F, D796H and T572I, underlines the strong selective pressures exerted on this gene. A 126-nucleotide deletion in ORF8 resulted in a truncated protein, reinforcing its uselessness for viral replication, as observed in circulating variants such as B.1.1.7. The present case highlights the complex interplay between viral recombination and mutations within the host in chronic infections and further underscores the remarkable evolutionary plasticity of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential to generate highly adapted viral strains.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

Here, we systematically profile the localization of protein isoforms generated by alternate start codon selection during translation. We identify hundreds of pairs of differentially-localized protein isoforms, many of which affect mitochondrial targeting and are essential for mitochondrial function. The emergence of dual-localized mitochondrial protein isoforms coincides with mitochondrial acquisition during early eukaryotic evolution. We further reveal that eukaryotes use diverse mechanisms, such as leaky ribosome scanning, alternative transcription, and paralog duplication, to maintain the production of dual-localized isoforms. Finally, we identify multiple isoforms that are specifically dysregulated by rare disease patient mutations and demonstrate how these mutations can help explain unique clinical presentations. Together, our findings illuminate the evolutionary and pathological relevance of alternative translation initiation, offering new insights into the molecular underpinnings of mitochondrial biology.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

Central to HIV infection and immune evasion is the envelope glycoprotein (Env), a heavily glycosylated class I fusion protein that mediates viral entry and is the sole immunogenic target. Despite the recent advancements provided by imaging techniques, the characterization of Envs structure and dynamics within its native membrane environment remains incomplete. Here, we present microsecond-long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the full-length Env glycoprotein embedded in a biologically relevant lipid bilayer with a complete glycosylation profile. Our simulations reveal a pronounced tilting motion of Env relative to the membrane, with supporting evidence from cryo-electron tomography, which also captures Env tilting within the native membrane. Importantly, we identify a critical role for N-linked glycans at N88 and N611 in modulating the tilting transition. These findings highlight the dual role of Envs glycan shield as both a protective barrier against neutralizing antibodies and a structural modulator of conformational plasticity. While providing an atomically detailed view of Env in a native membrane environment and advancing the general understanding of its glycan shield and its vulnerabilities, this work also suggests a possible strategy to modulate Envs conformational plasticity.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

Although CH frequently occurs with aging, it rarely progresses to overt malignancy. Population variation in the growth rate and potential of mutant clones suggests the presence of genetic factors protecting against CH, but these remain largely undefined. Here, we identify a non-coding regulatory variant, rs17834140-T, that significantly protects against CH and myeloid malignancies by downregulating HSC-selective expression and function of the RNA-binding protein MSI2. By modeling variant effects and mapping MSI2 binding targets, we uncover an RNA network that maintains human HSCs and influences CH risk. Importantly, rs17834140-T is associated with slower CH expansion rates in humans, and stem cell MSI2 levels modify ASXL1-mutant HSC clonal dominance in experimental models. These findings leverage natural resilience to highlight a key role for post-transcriptional regulation in human HSCs, and offer genetic evidence supporting inhibition of MSI2 or its downstream targets as rational strategies for blood cancer prevention.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

Some of those symptoms could be related to autonomic dysfunction. Our aim is to evaluate the prevalence of autonomic dysfunction in long COVID patients. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study and included all consecutive patients enrolled in several clinical research studies. We performed the following autonomic dysfunction markers: heart rate variability, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure changes during NASA lean test, cardiopulmonary exercise testing and a COMPASS-31 scale. We used linear regression to calculate the contribution of each dysautonomia measure on symptom burden as measured by the modified COVID-19 Yorkshire scale. Results We included 100 patients for this study. Our sample had a mean age of 56+/-11 years, included 53% minorities and 32% were women. Dysautonomia as defined by an abnormal COMPASS-31 was seen in 82%; 95% 72-89 while cardiovascular resting dysautonomia as represented by an abnormal heart rate variability was seen in 60%; 95% 48-70 of the population, orthostatic hypotension in 12% and POTS in 10%. In our adjusted analysis, we found that the beta coefficient for the COMPASS-31 score (0.37) was significant on changes in a self-reported long COVID symptom burden. The orthostatic intolerance and gastrointestinal domains of the COMPASS-31 was associated the highest long COVID symptom burden. Conclusion Dysautonomia is common in long COVID patients and contributes to the overall symptoms seen in long COVID. Identifying dysautonomia has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.","NA","medrxiv",1743199745505

Historically, research has prioritized protists associated with animals and plants, particularly those of medical significance, thereby overlooking the majority of protist diversity. Conventional molecular methods, such as 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, frequently encounter limitations, including primer binding bias and PCR bias caused by gene length variations, creating a biased perspective of understudied protistan diversity. Further, most protist lineages are notoriously difficult to cultivate. Here, we apply a cultivation-independent approach in which we analyzed over 27,000 assembled metagenomes and protist single cell genomes and 21 long 18S rRNA gene amplicon data sets from various global ecosystems, including marine, freshwater, and soil environments. We recovered 157,958 18S rRNA gene sequences ([&ge;]800 bp), which clustered into 103,338 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% sequence identity and 24,438 OTUs at 85% identity. Notably, 69% of 13,238 non-singleton clusters at 85% identity consisted exclusively of environmental sequences, uncovering a wealth of yet uncultivated and unclassified novel protist diversity. A comprehensive taxonomic framework of eukaryotes based on concatenated 18S and 28S rRNA genes that incorporated most novel lineages revealed substantial underrepresentation of Amoebozoa, Discoba, and Rhizaria in reference databases, with many lacking isolate or genome sequence representation. Further, we identified 13 eukaryotic lineages with novelty on higher taxonomic ranks, such as class and phylum-level, that lack representation in public databases. The corresponding 85% OTUs were primarily affiliated with Excavata, with some branching closely to the root of the eukaryotic tree. Comprehensive analysis of the global distribution of eukaryotes revealed uneven microbial eukaryotic diversity across supergroups and ecosystems, with notable novelty particularly in soil and marine environments. We then examined co-occurrence between protists and prokaryotes, predicting putative symbiotic or predator-prey relationships, particularly among understudied protist groups with bacteria such as Verrucomicrobia and Rickettsiales. Our results substantially enhance the understanding of protistan diversity and distribution, revealing taxonomic blind spots and laying groundwork for future studies of these organisms' ecological roles.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

Across four datasets, we found a topography of hemodynamic latencies that precisely distinguished the nucleus accumbens, a dopaminergic region implicated in motivation and substance abuse, from other striatal regions. Using PET, genetics, and pharmacology, we found that hemodynamic latencies are robustly related to dopamine function and dopamine-linked behavior. In individuals with cocaine use disorder, we observed a spatial gradient of altered hemodynamic latencies in the striatum. This pattern independently predicted nicotine use, revealing a conserved physiological profile associated with addictive substance use.

We present an optimized perchloric acid based workflow with neutralization - PCA-N - that addresses these limitations. By introducing a neutralization step following protein precipitation, PCA N enables direct enzymatic digestion without additional purification steps, reducing sample volume requirements to only 5 uL of plasma while maintaining deep plasma proteome coverage. The streamlined protocol allows preparation of over 10,000 samples per day using 384 well formats at costs comparable to undepleted plasma analysis (NEAT). Rigorous validation according to the recently introduced CLSI C64 guideline demonstrated that despite somewhat higher technical variability compared to NEAT, PCA-N maintained excellent biological resolution and reproducibility. We confirmed the workflow its exceptional stability through analysis of 1,500 quality control samples systematically interspersed among 36,000 plasma samples measured continuously over 311 days. Technical performance remained consistent across multiple instruments, sample preparation batches and nearly a year of measurements. Compared to NEAT plasma proteomics, PCA-N doubled the proteomic depth while maintaining comparable reagent costs and throughput. The minimal sample reequipments, operational simplicity while using only common laboratory chemical and exceptional scalability positions PCA-N as an attractive approach for population level plasma proteomics, democratizing access to deep plasma proteome analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

Toxicity models are among the most commonly used mouse models to induce demyelination; however, it remains unclear whether different demyelination models elicit distinct glial responses, and how comparable these changes are to MS. To address this gap, we integrated new and published single cell transcriptomic data of the subcortical white matter from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and cuprizone toxicity models, and compared them to an existing human MS dataset. We find that LPC and cuprizone treatments induce distinct oligodendrocyte (OL) states, but a highly conserved microglial response upon demyelination. Interestingly, remyelinating OLs converge on an altered maturation state in both LPC and cuprizone models, potentially due to persistent activation of microglia at remyelination stages. Comparison of the mouse models with MS tissue reveals that key OL gene signatures specific to LPC and cuprizone demyelination are observed in MS patients, while microglia appear more heterogeneous across the different types of MS lesions. Finally, cross-species analysis highlights a conserved phenotype shared between cuprizone and actively demyelinating MS lesions, with downregulation of genes required for stable myelin production and increased cellular stress pathways. Overall, this comparative analysis uncovers specific gene expression differences between mouse demyelination models and human MS lesions, providing a foundation for using the animal models effectively to advance remyelination therapies.

Highlights- LPC and cuprizone demyelination induce distinct disease-associated oligodendrocyte states with shared pathological changes to MS lesions.
- Remyelinating oligodendrocytes converge on an altered maturation state.
- Microglia response to demyelination is highly conserved in mice but comparatively more heterogeneous in humans.

A major translational challenge in analgesic development is the difference in gene expression and functional properties between human and rodent dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. Extensive work in rodents suggests that sensitization of nociceptors in the DRG is essential for the pathogenesis and persistence of pain; however, direct evidence demonstrating similar physiological sensitization in humans is limited. Here, we examine whether pain history is associated with nociceptor hyperexcitability in human DRG (hDRG). We identified three electrophysiologically distinct clusters (E-types) of hDRG neurons based on firing properties and membrane excitability. Combining electrophysiological recordings and single-cell RNA-sequencing (""Patch-seq""), we linked these E-types to specific transcriptionally defined nociceptor subpopulations. Comparing hDRG neurons from donors with and without evident pain history revealed cluster-specific, pain history-associated differences in hDRG excitability. Finally, we found that hDRG from donors with pain history express higher levels of transcripts encoding voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7 (NaV1.7) and 1.8 (NaV1.8) which specifically regulate nociceptor excitability. These findings suggest that donors with pain history exhibit distinct hDRG electrophysiological profiles compared to those without pain history and further validate NaV1.7 and 1.8 as targets for analgesic development.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

As they mature and gain independence from caregivers, juveniles stop producing infant calls and begin producing adult-like vocalizations in a variety of species-typical contexts. Neonatal mice (Mus musculus) produce ""isolation"" ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) when separated from the nest, and in contrast, adolescent and adult mice produce ""social"" USVs during interactions with conspecifics. Although this transition in vocal behavior is known to occur, its developmental timing remains poorly described. In the current study, we performed longitudinal measurements of mouse USVs to establish the age at which juvenile mice begin producing social USVs. Every 4 days (postnatal day (P)12-P28), USVs were first recorded from individual mice in solo sessions to establish rates of isolation/spontaneous USVs and then were recorded again during interactions between same-sex and opposite-sex pairs of age-matched, socially novel (non-littermate) C57BL/6J mice. We report that juvenile mice begin producing social USVs earlier than previously reported, at ages P20-P24. Moreover, although these early social USVs are produced at low rates compared to adult social USVs, they are nonetheless temporally coordinated with active social interaction. Our characterization of the timing of the transition from isolation USVs to social USVs forms a foundation to investigate brain mechanisms that enable the context-dependent regulation of vocal communication over development.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

We show that phage-encoded nucleases trigger degradation of the retron-associated DNA, leading to disassembly of the retron and activation of the HNH nuclease.

As ZIKV spread into new geographic regions, it now has the potential to interact with many novel potential host species whose susceptibility to the virus has yet to be determined. Mathematical models predict a sylvatic reservoir host of ZIKV, with non-human primates (NHPs) as the likely candidates, though outbreaks in areas without NHPs suggest the presence of other unidentified sylvatic reservoir hosts. Bats, with their ability to fly and live in or near human structures, are plausible ZIKV reservoirs. However, their competence as hosts for ZIKV remains unresolved. In this study, we investigate the immune response of Old World and New World bats to ZIKV infection in vitro. Through comparative growth curves and transcriptomic analyses, we assess ZIKV susceptibility of cells derived from the Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) and the Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus). R. aegyptiacus cells were susceptible to both African and Asian ZIKV isolates, while we observed little to no ZIKV replication in A. jamaicensis cells.

Objective To determine whether individuals hospitalized for severe COVID-19 exhibit a higher incidence of new onset cognitive impairment compared to those hospitalized for other conditions. Design A retrospective study emulating a target trial using Mass General Brigham electronic health records (March 2020-August 2024). The causal effect of COVID-19 hospitalization was estimated via cumulative incidence functions accounting for the competing risk of death. Setting Multicenter hospital-based study across the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. Participants A total of 221613 hospitalized patients met the eligibility criteria, including 6454 (2.0%) admitted due to COVID-19 and 215159 (98.0%) for all other conditions. Patients were excluded if they had less than three months of follow-up (due to censoring, cognitive impairment, or death), were younger than 55 years at baseline, or had no prior visit to Mass General Brigham in the year before baseline. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was new-onset cognitive impairment, identified via ICD codes and dementia medication prescriptions. The primary analysis estimated the hazard ratio for cognitive impairment with COVID-19 hospitalization relative to other hospitalizations, along with the risk difference at 4.5 years estimated via cumulative incidence functions. Inverse propensity score weighting was used to balance covariates (age, sex, comorbidities, hospitalization period). Results Among eligible patients (mean [SD] age, 69.55 [9.42] years, 55% female), those hospitalized for COVID-19 were significantly older and had more comorbidities (p < 0.05). COVID-19 hospitalization was associated with a higher risk of developing cognitive impairment (Hazard Ratio: 1.14 [95% CI: 1.02-1.30], P = 0.018). At 4.5 years, the cumulative incidence of cognitive impairment was 12.5% [95% CI: 11.3-13.5] in the COVID-19 group, compared to 11.6% [95% CI: 11.1-12.1] in the non-COVID-19 group. Conclusions and Relevance Severe COVID-19 infection was associated with an elevated risk of developing clinically recognized cognitive impairment. Future studies are needed to validate findings in other health care settings. Early screening and intervention for cognitive decline may help optimize long-term outcomes for COVID-19 patients.","NA","medrxiv",1743199745505

Paradoxically, high protein concentrations are typically required for condensate nucleation5, yet attaining sufficient protein levels in infection is thought to require IBs for viral transcription and replication. To uncover how viruses solve this paradox to establish IBs, we visualized early infection of RSV in real-time with single genomic viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) resolution. Our results reveal that IBs are nucleated from infecting vRNPs rather than de novo in the cytoplasm. IB nucleation further requires in-virion pre-assembly of viral protein-protein interaction networks on vRNPs to form  pre-replication centers (PRCs). PRCs are potent condensate nucleation seeds due to their resistance to disassembly and efficient recruitment of newly-synthesized viral proteins. The high protein affinity of PRCs also results in increased polymerase complex association, allowing efficient viral transcription even in the absence of IBs. Together, these activities create a feed-forward loop that drives rapid IB formation. Intriguingly, PRC assembly depends on in-virion viral protein levels and is highly heterogeneous among virions, explaining cell-to-cell heterogeneity in infection progression, and identifying heterogeneous virions as the origin of infection heterogeneity. Together, our results show that in-virion pre-assembly of PRCs kick-starts viral condensate nucleation upon host-cell entry, and explains cell-to-cell heterogeneity in RSV infection.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

In this study we analyzed genomes derived from cultures and environmental metagenome-assembled genomes focusing on characters indicative of genome evolution. Our results show an enrichment of short length transposable elements (TEs) and pseudogenes in the periplasmic endosymbiont genomes, suggesting an active and transitionary period in genome evolution. In contrast, genomes of endobionts exhibited fewer TEs and pseudogenes, reflecting advanced stages of genome reduction and increased host dependency in the endobionts. Pangenome analyses identified that endobionts streamline their genomes and conserve a majority of their genes in the core, whereas periplasmic endobionts and epibionts maintain larger flexible genomes, suggesting increased genomic plasticity. Functional gene comparisons with other N2-fixing cyanobacteria revealed that Richelia endobionts have similar patterns of metabolic loss but are distinguished by absence of specific pathways (e.g. cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase, lipid-A) that increase dependency and direct interaction with their respective hosts. In conclusion, our findings underscore the dynamic nature of genome reduction in N2-fixing cyanobacterial symbionts and demonstrate the diatom-Richelia symbioses as a valuable and rare model to study genome evolution in the transitional stages from a free-living facultative symbiont to a host-dependent endobiont.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

TEI can be initiated and maintained by small RNAs and histone modifications. The latter includes histone methylation, deposited by proteins with methyltransferase activity, including SET domain-containing proteins. Other SET domain-containing proteins with no catalytic methyltransferase activity also adopt roles in chromatin and gene expression regulation. Here, we describe SET-24, a SET domain-containing protein in Caenorhabditis elegans that belongs to a family of catalytically inactive SET proteins. SET-24 localises to germline nuclei and is required for germline immortality. Additionally, the inheritance of small RNA-driven epigenetic silencing is compromised in set-24 mutants. Using quantitative proteomics and yeast two-hybrid assays, we found that SET-24 interacts with Host Cell Factor 1 (HCF-1), a protein involved in epigenetic regulation and associated with known chromatin remodelling complexes, like COMPASS, which deposits H3K4me3. In set-24 mutants, hundreds of genes display increased H3K4me3 levels at their transcription start sites. While these changes are not matched at the transcriptional level, small RNA production is disrupted in approximately one fifth of those genes, which are normally targeted by small RNA pathways. We propose that SET-24 is a factor required to maintain epigenetic memory in the germline by maintaining a chromatin environment permissible to small RNA biogenesis over generations.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

Connexin-32 (Cx32) GJCs mediate intercellular coupling in a variety of tissues, and specifically in the myelinating Schwann cells. Mutations in Cx32, such as W3S, are associated with peripheral neuropathy, X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT1X) disease. Phospholipids and sterols have been shown to regulate permeation through Cx32 GJCs, although the mechanism of regulation of Cx32 and other GJCs by lipids remains poorly understood. Here, we determine the cryo-EM structures of Cx32 GJCs reconstituted in nanodiscs, revealing that phospholipids block the pore of Cx32 GJC by binding to the site formed by N-terminal gating helices. The phospholipid-bound state is contingent on the presence of a sterol molecule bound to a hydrophobic pocket formed by the N-terminus: the N-terminal helix of Cx32 fails to sustain a phospholipid binding site in the absence of cholesterol hemisuccinate. Consistent with this, the CMT1X-linked W3S mutant which has an impaired sterol binding site adopts a conformation of the N-terminus incompatible with phospholipid binding. Our results indicate that different lipid species control connexin channel gating directly by influencing the conformation of the N-terminal gating helix.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

However, it remains uncertain how strongly genome size is linked to microbial prevalence, relative abundance and co-occurrence in the environment. To address this gap, we present a systematic and global-scale evaluation of the relationship between genome size, relative abundance and prevalence in freshwater ecosystems, including 80,561 medium-to-high quality genomes. We identified 9,028 species (defined by ANI >95%) across a manually curated dataset of 636 freshwater metagenomes and calculated their relative abundance. Our results show that prokaryotes with reduced genomes exhibited higher prevalence and relative abundance, and a greater prevalence than expected based on their mean abundance, suggesting that genome streamlining may promote cosmopolitanism. Furthermore, our network analysis revealed that prokaryotes with reduced genomes are found in co-occurrent groups comprising up to 295 species. The species in these groups potentially possess a diminished capacity for synthesizing essential metabolites such as vitamins, amino acids and nucleotides, which may foster complex metabolic interdependencies within the community. Moreover, the fitness advantage of losing biosynthetic functions appears to be frequency dependent: while nucleotide biosynthesis is the most retained biosynthetic function, amino acid and then vitamin biosynthesis are more frequently lost. Our study finds that genome size is linked to microbial community structure and ecological adaptation to freshwaters. Our results underscore genome streamlining as a central ecological and evolutionary strategy that both shapes and is shaped by community dynamics, ultimately fostering interdependences among prokaryotes.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

Usage of resistant cultivars has been a successful strategy in controlling BB. However, constant selection pressure causes the evolution of hypervirulent pathogenic strains that break down resistance, thus necessitating additional sources of resistance. An induced-mutant line derived from the elite rice cultivar Samba Mahsuri was identified to exhibit broad-spectrum resistance to BB. Using next-generation gene mapping approaches, we identified a genomic interval in chromosome 6 to be linked to BB resistance. Analysis of the SNPs in the locus and subsequent linkage analysis indicated that a missense SNP located in the second exon of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 6 (OsMAPK6) could be the causal mutation. A detailed examination of OsMAPK6 gene sequences in over 4000 rice genomes revealed that the mutant allele identified in this study is novel to rice germplasm. The candidate SNP causes the substitution of an invariant Serine residue with a Proline residue (S84P), thus likely affecting the protein function. Global transcriptome, metabolome, biochemical, and molecular analyses suggested that BB42 exhibit constitutive immunity. On the mechanistic front, the mutation seems to result in diminished brassinosteroid signaling in BB42. Taken together, we report a novel allele of a highly conserved MAPK gene and provide evidence for its possible association with constitutive immunity and disease resistance in rice.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

Using the optical tension sensor FliptR and AFM-assisted tether force measurements, we investigate plasma membrane tension regulation in mitotic cells by measuring tension changes following cytoskeletal and cell shape perturbations. Our findings show that in both assays, reported tensions are critically influenced by the cytoskeleton, however, with partially deviating trends highlighting the conceptual differences between bare and apparent membrane tension. By integrating experimental data with theoretical modeling, we demonstrate that the actin cytoskeleton regulates bare membrane tension through two distinct mechanisms: (i) modulation of intracellular hydrostatic pressure and (ii) adjustment of polymerization forces in actin-rich finger-like protrusions.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

Individual plants mature at different rates due to genetics, environmental factors, and random chance. All of this contributes to trait heterogeneity. EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3), a core circadian clock component, determines developmental timing, and here we tested the hypothesis that it would shape trait heterogeneity. We developed a model predicting that faster-growing populations exhibit greater heterogeneity during development but reduced heterogeneity at maturity, while slower-growing populations show the opposite pattern. Experiments in Arabidopsis elf3 and barley Hvelf3 mutants supported this prediction. In Arabidopsis, ELF3 controlled hypocotyl elongation variability via maturation rate rather than direct regulation. Bolting time heterogeneity also decreased in faster-growing plants. In barley, Hvelf3 altered growth heterogeneity, but this was initially masked by germination timing differences. Finally, smaller barley plants were found to be more resilient to osmotic stress, suggesting that ELF3-driven trait heterogeneity may contribute to bet hedging. These findings highlight how modifying developmental rates influences population-level trait distributions and stress resilience.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

Here we use the sea star Patiria miniata as a non-chordate deuterostome representative to define the ovarian cell type toolkit in echinoderms. Sea stars continuously produce millions of new oocytes throughout their lifespan, making them a practical system to understand the mechanisms that drive oogenesis from a biomedical and evolutionary perspective. We performed scRNA-seq combined with high-resolution 3D-imaging to reveal the ovarian cell types and their spatial organization. Our data support the presence of actively dividing oogonial stem cells and granulosa-like and theca-like cells, which display similarities and possible homology with their mammalian counterparts. Lastly, our data support the existence of an endocrine signaling system between oogonial stem cells and intrinsic ovarian neurons with striking similarities to the vertebrate hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Overall, this study provides molecular evidence supporting the possible pre-chordate origins of conserved ovarian cell types, and the presence of an intrinsic neuroendocrine system which potentially controls oogenesis and predates the formation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

First the conservation of the GABA site explains the absence of insect-selective orthosteric compounds. Second, the classical modulation site, occupied here by abamectin, exists in a closed-pore conformation contrasting with ivermectin-bound states in other receptors. Third, using the fungal-derived Chrodrimamin B, we resolve an unanticipated membrane modulation pocket structurally analogous yet pharmacologically opposite to a neurosteroid site in mammalian receptors.

We evaluate this inference approach in an ecologically relevant system: Syn9, a T4-like cyanophage infecting Synechococcus strain WH8109, a representative of globally abundant marine cyanobacteria. The model infers heterogeneous distributions of latent period and burst size that were subsequently validated using a single-cell assay. We find observed latent period variation exceeds that found in coliphage with holin lysis systems and that burst size variability is largely explained due to latent period variation. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of inferring phage trait heterogeneity from population data in ecologically relevant systems even in the absence of single-cell experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

Defense-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems provide an intriguing counterpoint to this strategy by leveraging DNA synthesis instead2,3. We and others recently showed that DRT2 systems use an RNA template to assemble a de novo gene, leading to expression of an antiviral effector protein, Neo4,5. It remains unknown whether similar mechanisms of defense are employed by other DRT families. Focusing on DRT9, here we uncover an unprecedented mechanism of DNA homopolymer synthesis, in which viral infection triggers polydeoxyadenylate (poly-dA) accumulation in the cell to drive abortive infection and population-level immunity. Cryo-EM structures reveal how a conserved noncoding RNA serves as both a structural scaffold and reverse transcription template to direct hexameric complex assembly and RNA-templated poly-dA synthesis. Remarkably, biochemical and functional experiments identify conserved tyrosine residues within the reverse transcriptase itself that prime DNA synthesis, leading to the formation of high-molecular weight protein-DNA covalent adducts. Synthesis of poly-dA in vivo is regulated by the competing activities of phage-encoded triggers and host-encoded silencers of DRT9. Collectively, our work unveils a novel nucleic acid-driven defense system that expands the paradigm of bacterial immunity and broadens the known functions of reverse transcriptases.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

Most research focusses on Dictyostelium discoideum, which - due to its ease of culturing and genetic tractability - has been adopted as a model species in the fields of developmental biology, cell biology and microbiology. Over decades, genome editing methods in D. discoideum have steadily improved but remain relatively time-consuming and limited in scope, effective in a few species only. Here, we introduce a CRISPR-Cas9 editing protocol that is cloning-free, selection-free, highly-efficient, and effective across Dictyostelid species. After optimizing our protocol in D. discoideum, we obtained knock-out efficiencies of [~]80% and knock-in efficiencies of [~]30% without antibiotic selection. Efficiencies depend on template concentrations, insertion sizes, homology arms and target sites. Since our protocol is selection-free, we can isolate mutants as soon as one day post-transfection, vastly expediting the generation of knock-outs, fusion proteins and expression reporters. Our protocol also makes it possible to generate several knock-in mutations simultaneously in the same cells. Boosted by cell-sorting and fluorescent microscopy, we could readily apply our CRISPR-Cas9 editing protocol to phylogenetically distant Dictyostelid species, which diverged hundreds of millions of years ago and have never been genome edited before. Our protocol therefore opens the door to performing broad-scale genetic interrogations across Dicyostelids.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745505

To fill this gap, we investigated microbial communities encompassing all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) in the Northwestern Antarctic Peninsula.

However, microbial diversity and composition, especially among eukaryotic phytoplankton, displayed significant temporal changes among seasons and years.

In contrast, no eukaryotic group exhibited consistently high relative abundance across sampling periods.

This raises the question: how can embryos and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) tolerate TE expression without incurring widespread inflammation or DNA damage? Here, we reveal multiple mechanisms that prevent innate immune activation by TE-derived cytosolic DNA, including reduced cGAS/STING expression and signalling, dampening of Type I interferon responses by pluripotency factors, and post-transcriptional restriction of retrotransposition. These layers of protection are essential, as experimental perturbation triggers loss of ESC self-renewal and pluripotency.

We analyzed 5,778 domains 28-64 amino acids in length, revealing hidden variation in conformational fluctuations even between sequences sharing the same fold and global folding stability. Site-resolved hydrogen exchange NMR analysis of 13 domains showed that these fluctuations often involve entire secondary structural elements with lower stability than the overall fold. Computational modeling of our domains identified structural features that correlated with the experimentally observed fluctuations, enabling us to design mutations that stabilized low-stability structural segments.

The fine-tuning of the development according to endogenous and environmental signals requires exact intercellular signaling and a balanced response. Kinases of the Sucrose non-fermenting-1-Related protein Kinases type 2 (SnRK2s) family primarily take part in the response and adaptation to environmental stress factors. Notably, here we show that two ABA-non-activated SnRK2s, SnRK2.4 and SnRK2.10, are also activated in non-stress conditions in developmentally senescing leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana. Phenotypic, biochemical, and molecular analyses performed on single snrk2.4 or snrk2.10, and double snrk2.4/2.10 kinase mutants showed that SnRK2.4 and SnRK2.10, acting redundantly, promote developmental leaf senescence. Further, SnRK2.4 and SnRK2.10 enhance ABA accumulation in senescing leaves by inducing NCED2, one of key ABA biosynthesis-related genes. The two kinases induce developmental leaf senescence by modulating the expression of multiple ABA-responsive, osmotic stress, and senescence-related genes, such as the senescence master regulators ORE1, ORS1, WRKY33, WRKY75, and ANAC087. Furthermore, we show that SnRK2.4 and SnRK2.10 act upstream of MAPK signaling by enhancing the expression and activity of MAPKKK18, a senescence-inducing kinase. These results document a new regulatory function of SnRK2.4 and SnRK2.10: they are activated in Arabidopsis leaves in response to endogenous signals and redundantly induce developmental leaf senescence by stimulating ABA production and sustaining major ABA-dependent and -independent signaling pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745506

In particular biotechnological processes which use one carbon (C1) compounds as feedstock represent an interesting avenue. Many bacterial species evolved naturally to thrive on such compounds, among them Cupriavidus necator, which has been studied in the past due to its range of metabolic capabilities in utilization and production of compounds of interest. Cupriavidus necator strain H16 is the reference laboratory strain for this species and by far the most extensively studied. In contrast, research efforts and genomic characterization of other strains within this species have been limited and sporadic. Therefore, the genomic diversity and full metabolic potential across the broader species remain poorly understood.

In this work, we collected publicly available genomes along with newly sequenced ones. From a collection of 44 genomes we curated a final collection of 22 genomes deemed to be C. necator. We examined hallmark metabolic functions, including carbon dioxide fixation, formate assimilation, and hydrogen utilization. We identified methylation motifs and restriction modification systems. Finally, strains ATCC 25207, TA06, and 1978 are proposed as candidate strains of interest based on their genomic make-up and observations from literature. This work provides a comprehensive genomic resource for the C. necator species, facilitating its development as a biomanufacturing platform and advancing our understanding of its metabolic diversity and potential applications.

ImportanceThe green transition from petroleum-based manufacturing to a biomanufacturing economy requires new solutions. One of these is the development of bacterial platforms for production of valuable chemicals, in particular from CO2 and derived molecules. In this context, Cupriavidus necator is one of the most studied platform strains, although the genomic potential of this species has been seldom explored. This work provides a curated set of C. necator genomes, collected from public repositories and additional newly sequenced genomes. Through multiple analyses, C. necator ATCC 25207, TA06, and 1978 are proposed as strains of interest for further use. These findings lay the groundwork for advancing C. necator as a key organism in sustainable biomanufacturing, highlighting its potential for efficient carbon fixation, formate assimilation, and hydrogen utilization. The identification of methylation motifs and restriction modification systems further supports genetic engineering efforts, making these strains highly valuable for future biotechnological applications.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745506

Traditional analysis approaches make parametric assumptions about the functional form of these curves, limiting their usefulness for studying conditions that distort standard growth curves. In addition, modern robotics platforms enable the high-throughput collection of large volumes of growth data, thus requiring strategies that can analyze large-scale growth data in a flexible and efficient manner. Here, we introduce DGrowthR, a statistical R and standalone app frame- work for the integrative analysis of large growth experiments. DGrowthR comprises methods for data pre-processing and standardization, exploratory functional data analysis, and non-parametric modeling of growth curves using Gaussian Process regression. Importantly, DGrowthR includes a rigorous statistical testing framework for differential growth analysis. To illustrate the range of application scenarios of DGrowthR, we analyzed three large-scale bacterial growth datasets that tackle distinct scientific questions. On an in-house large-scale growth dataset comprising two pathogens that were subjected to a large chemical perturbation screen, DGrowthR enabled the discovery of compounds with significant growth inhibitory effects as well as compounds that induce non-canonical growth dynamics. We also re-analyzed two publicly available datasets and recovered reported adjuvants and antagonists of antibiotic activity, as well as bacterial genetic factors that determine susceptibility to specific antibiotic treatments. We anticipate that DGrowthR will streamline the analysis of modern high-volume growth experiments, enabling researchers to gain novel biological insights in a standardized and reproducible manner.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745506

Patients with cirrhosis are prone to systemic infections and are commonly prescribed the carbohydrate lactulose to manage hepatic encephalopathy (HE) 1. Commensal metabolism of lactulose is believed to reduce pathobiont colonization through short-chain fatty acid production, but its direct effects on gut pathobionts remain unexplored 2. Here, we show that lactulose consumption unexpectedly selects for mutations in Escherichia coli lactose (lac) operon regulation, enhancing its metabolic fitness and colonization capacity. This is mediated by selection for constitutive expression of the lac operon through mutations in its regulatory components. Using in vitro systems, murine models, and clinical samples, we demonstrate that these mutations enable E. coli to exploit lactulose as a carbon source, bypassing host carbohydrate metabolism and increasing its intestinal colonization. Despite its long-standing use in HE treatment, we find that lactulose has a paradoxical association with risk of infection hospitalization in patients with cirrhosis in a large epidemiologic study. The emergence of lactulose-adapted E. coli strains could be suppressed by a dietary oligosaccharide that competitively inhibits lactulose uptake. These findings reveal a mechanism by which dietary substrates exert selective pressure on the microbiome, with implications for diet-based strategies to modulate microbial evolution and infection risk.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745506

Using HeLa and macrophage cell models, the effect of repositioning lysosomes to either the cell periphery or the perinuclear region on inflammasome activation was studied. Lysosome positioning to the cell periphery increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to nigericin. This effect correlated with a change in the subcellular localisation of the inflammasome complex and an increase in its size.

We previously identified a gene encoding CYP71A27 connected to camalexin, which is necessary for a plant growth promoting (PGP) activity of a number of bacterial strains. To dissect its function, we compared multilevel responses in roots of wild type Arabidopsis and the cyp71A27 mutant to two bacterial strains, a PGP Pseudomonas fluorescens CH267 and a pathogen Burkholderia glumeae PG1. We show that incubation with these bacteria leads to significant and distinct transcriptional reprogramming. This is accompanied by a proteome remodelling in both shoots and roots and profound changes in accumulation of many metabolites, primarily sugars, amino acids, and TCA cycle intermediates, but also by alterations in the ionome. We then analysed the mutant cyp71a27 and identified number of genes and proteins differently regulated, particularly after interaction with the PGP strain, but only a very mild impact of the mutation on root metabolites and exudates. We analysed a variety of mutants in genes differentially regulated by Pseudomonas sp. CH267 in cyp71a27 and revealed that their response to this PGP bacterial strain is similar to cyp71a27. Thus, it seems that CYP71A27 is a non-canonical P-450 without a metabolic function but active in signalling pointing to a regulatory role of the CYP71A27 gene, particularly in interaction with a plant growth promoting bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745506

In the absence of any structures of activated PI3K, the molecular details of its activation remain unknown. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the PI3K/KRas complex embedded in lipid nanodiscs, revealing a rich ensemble of PI3K states adopted at the membrane surface. The sequential addition of a lipid bilayer, PIP2 and an activating phosphopeptide leads to the progressive release of key inhibitory domains from the PI3K catalytic core, which directly correlates with the reorganization of its active site. While association with POPC/POPS nanodiscs partially relieves PI3K autoinhibition, incorporation of PIP2 triggers near-complete displacement of PI3K inhibitory domains and significant restructuring of active site regulatory motifs. The addition of the activating phosphopeptide induces dimerization of the PI3K/KRas complex through a p110 catalytic subunit-mediated interface that is sterically occluded in autoinhibited PI3K. In cells, this dimeric PI3K complex amplifies Akt signaling in response to growth factor stimulation. Collectively, our structures map the conformational landscape of PI3K activation and reveal previously unexplored interfaces for potential therapeutic targeting.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745506

This activates the expression of various transcription factors and cytokines that promote anti-apoptosis and intercellular signaling.

Training focused on breast cancer risk factors, prevention, screening, genetics, staging, and treatment options. Effectiveness was measured through pre- and post-workshop confidence surveys and knowledge assessments. Results showed significant improvement in student confidence across educational domains, with average scores increasing from 6.30 to 8.59 (p<0.0001). Understanding of screening guidelines (mean difference: 4.30; p-value: <.0001) and target therapy options showed the greatest improvement (mean difference: 3.65; p-value: <.0001), while knowledge of BRCA gene inheritance showed the smallest change (mean difference: 0.369; p-value: ns), suggesting some pre-existing awareness but limited understanding of its clinical applications. Overall, this pilot program demonstrates how pharmacy education can address healthcare disparities in rural communities.

We document an exception to this pattern in the wider Rhine-Meuse area in communities in the wetlands, riverine areas, and coastal areas of the western and central Netherlands, Belgium and western Germany, where we assembled genome-wide data for 109 people 8500-1700 BCE. Here, a distinctive population with high hunter-gatherer ancestry ([~]50%) persisted up to three thousand years later than in continental European regions, reflecting limited incorporation of females of Early European Farmer ancestry into local communities. In the western Netherlands, the arrival of the Corded Ware complex was also exceptional: lowland individuals from settlements adopting Corded Ware pottery had hardly any steppe ancestry, despite a characteristic early Corded Ware Y-chromosome. The limited influx may reflect the unique ecology of the regions river-dominated landscapes, which were not amenable to wholesale adoption of the early Neolithic type of farming introduced by Linearbandkeramik, making it possible for previously established groups to thrive, and creating a persistent but permeable boundary that allowed transfer of ideas and low-level gene flow.

In metagenomic studies, fragments can be mapped against multiple references or de novo assembled contigs to identify those likely to be ancient. Generating and comparing damage profiles to identify samples or contigs that are likely to stem from modern contaminants, however, can be both tedious and time-consuming. Although tools exist for estimating damage in single reference genomes and metagenomic datasets, none efficiently cluster damage patterns.

ResultsTo address this methodological gap, we developed AdDeam, a tool that combines rapid damage estimation with clustering for streamlined analyses and easy identification of potential contaminants or outliers. Our tool takes aligned aDNA fragments from various samples or contigs as input, computes damage patterns, clusters them and outputs representative damage profiles per cluster, a probability of each sample of pertaining to a cluster as well as a PCA of the damage patterns for each sample for fast visualisation. We evaluated AdDeam on both simulated and empirical datasets. AdDeam effectively distinguishes different damage levels, such as UDG-treated samples, sample-specific damages from specimens of different time periods, and can also distinguish between contigs containing modern or ancient fragments, providing a clear framework for aDNA authentication and facilitating large-scale analyses.

Application of in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) made it possible to visualize the consequences of mitochondrial depolarization at higher resolution than heretofore attainable. Parkin-expressing U2OS cells were treated with the depolarizing agents oligomycin and antimycin A (OA), subjected to cryo-FIB milling, and mitochondrial structure was characterized by in situ cryo-ET. Phagophores were visualized in association with mitochondrial fragments. Bridge-like lipid transporter (BLTP) densities potentially corresponding to ATG2A were seen connected to mitophagic phagophores. Mitochondria in OA-treated cells were fragmented and devoid of matrix calcium phosphate crystals. The intermembrane gap of cristae was narrowed and the intermembrane volume reduced, and some fragments were devoid of cristae. A subpopulation of ATP synthases re-localized from cristae to the inner boundary membrane (IBM) apposed to the outer membrane (OMM). The structure of the dome-shaped prohibitin complex, a dodecamer of PHB1-PHB2 dimers, was determined in situ by sub-tomogram averaging in untreated and treated cells and found to exist in open and closed conformations, with the closed conformation is enriched by OA treatment. These findings provide a set of native snapshots of the manifold nano-structural consequences of mitochondrial depolarization and provide a baseline for future in situ dissection of Parkin-dependent mitophagy.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745506

The LacI/GalR family (LGF) of transcription factors provides a system for examining how these trade-offs evolve over billions of years but has seldom been studied from a full thermodynamic perspective. While the evolution of ligand specificity has been well-studied, the thermodynamic determinants underlying the changes in specificity is not well understood - especially how proteins alter thermodynamic strategies to optimize affinity. By reconstructing LGF ancestors, we reveal a shift from entropy-driven binding in the most distant ancestor, to enthalpy-driven binding in the most recent ancestor and extant LacI. The most distant ancestor is characterized by the ability to bind its ligand in an open and dynamic conformation, and we propose that entropically-driven binding is driven by the presence of entropic reservoirs. This thermodynamic binding trade-off between the most distant and most recent ancestor is in accordance with the concept of ancient life that existed in a hot Earth environment, where higher temperatures enhanced entropically-driven binding. This suggests that molecular binding mechanisms evolved not just for ligand specificity, but to adapt to environmental pressures such as cooling Earth temperatures where enthalpic binding modes are favored.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745506

Clade diversity trajectories follow rise and decline dynamics, with fast accumulation following recurrent speciation while slowdowns and losses are modulated primarily by changes in extinction. Diversity dynamics do not appear to be governed by clade-level processes expected from adaptive radiations or diversity equilibria. Rather, these patterns emerge from dynamics at the species-level, where lineages tend to become increasingly vulnerable to extinction and less likely to speciate with time. Those species that counteract this trend create and maintain biodiversity through deep time.

At anaphase onset, sister separation is triggered by cleavage of the cohesin subunit SCC1/RAD21 by the cysteine protease separase. SCC1 contains two cleavage sites, where cleavage is stimulated by SCC1 phosphorylation. The molecular mechanisms of substrate recognition and cleavage are only partly understood. Here, we determined a series of cryoEM structures of human separase in apo- or substrate-bound forms that, together with biochemical analysis, provide novel insights into the regulation of separase cleavage activity. We verify the first SCC1 cleavage site and reassign the second site. We show that multiple substrates, including separase autocleavage sites and the two SCC1 cleavage sites, interact with several docking sites in separase, including four phosphate-binding sites. We also describe the structural basis of the interaction between the cohesin subunit SA1/A2 and separase, which promotes cleavage at the second site in SCC1. Finally, using cross-linking mass spectrometry and cryoEM, we propose a model of how cohesin is targeted by human separase.

Although various nuclei isolation methods have been developed, systematic evaluations of their effects on nuclear integrity and subsequent data quality remain lacking, a critical gap with profound implications for the rigor and reproducibility. To address this, we compared three mechanistically distinct nuclei isolation strategies with brain tissues: a sucrose gradient centrifugation-based method, a spin column-based method, and a machine-assisted platform. All methods successfully captured diverse cell types but revealed considerable protocol-dependent differences in cell type proportions, transcriptional homogeneity, and the preservation of cell-type-specific and cell-state-specific markers. Moreover, isolation workflows differentially influenced contamination levels from ambient, mitochondrial, and ribosomal RNAs. Our findings establish nuclei isolation methodology as a critical experimental variable shaping snRNA-seq data quality and biological interpretation.

MOTIVATIONSingle-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) has become an essential tool for transcriptomic analysis of complex tissues. However, the quality and efficiency of data generation depend heavily on the method used for nuclear isolation. The existing isolation techniques vary in their ability to preserve nuclear integrity, minimize ambient RNA contamination, and optimize recovery rates. Despite these differences in quality, a systematic comparison of these methods, specifically for brain tissue, is lacking. This gap poses a challenge for researchers in choosing the most suitable approach for their particular experimental requirements. To address this critical issue, our study directly compared three nuclei isolation methods and evaluated their performance in terms of yield, purity, and downstream sequencing quality. By providing a comprehensive assessment, we aim to guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate isolation protocol for their snRNA-seq experiments, ensuring optimal results and advancing the study of complex brain tissues at the single-nucleus level.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745506

Ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has achieved mesoscopic (< 0.5 mm) imaging of angioarchitecture, revealing fine vascular details that were previously inaccessible in vivo. However, current mesoscopic MRI methods for imaging angioarchitecture face two major limitations. First, acquisition times are prohibitively long--often exceeding 40 minutes--making integration into everyday clinical practice and research projects impractical. Second, even with data successfully acquired, conventional data visualization methods--such as 2D slice browsing and 3D vessel segmentation renders--are rudimentary and have limited effectiveness for navigating and interpreting the complex vascular network. In this paper, we present a fast whole-brain MRI protocol that provides robust images of the brains venous network at 0.35 mm resolution in under seven minutes. Additionally, we introduce novel data processing and visualization techniques that enable identification of specific vessel types and more informative navigation of the complex vascular network. We demonstrate that, with these advancements, we can reproduce, in vivo and without intravenous contrast application, the seminal postmortem vasculature images of Duvernoy and Vannson (1999). Furthermore, leveraging the ability for MRI to cover the entire brain, we achieve, for the first time, whole-brain intracortical mesoscopic vein maps in humans. Our acquisition and post-processing methods lay the groundwork for detailed examination of vascular organization across individuals, brain regions, and cortical layers. More generally, these methods make mesoscopic imaging of angioarchitecture viable for broad neuroscientific and clinical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745506

Preliminary evidence has shown the gut microbiome influences the aging process of bone and muscle in animal studies. However, such evidence in humans is still scarce. This study aimed to assess the microbiome-bone and microbiome-muscle associations in two cohorts of community-dwelling older adults.

MethodsWe leveraged information from two large population-based cohorts, i.e., the Rotterdam Study (mean age 62.7 {+/-} 5.6 years; n=1,249) and the Framingham Heart Study (mean age 55.2 {+/-} 9.1 years; n=1,227). For individuals included in this study, gut microbiome 16S rRNA sequencing, musculoskeletal phenotyping derived from DXA images, lifestyle and socioeconomic data, and medication records were available. Per cohort, the 16S rRNA sequencing data, derived from stool, were processed with the DADA2 pipeline and taxonomies were assigned using the SILVA reference database. In addition, the microbiome functional potential was obtained with PICRUSt2. Further, we investigated the association between the human gut microbiome (alpha diversity, genera and predicted functional pathways) and appendicular lean mass (ALM), femoral neck bone mineral density (FN-BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) using multilinear regression models controlling for multiple confounders, and performed a joint analysis from both cohorts. Sex-stratified analyses were also conducted.

ResultsThe gut microbiome alpha diversity was not associated with either tested phenotype after accounting for multiple-testing (P>1.67e-02). In the joint analysis, lower abundance of Oscillibacter (beta= -0.51, 95%CI [-0.74, -0.29]), Anaerotruncus (beta=-0.41, 95%CI [-0.61, - 0.21]), Eisenbergiella (beta=-0.39, 95%CI [-0.59, -0.19]) and higher abundance of Agathobacter (beta=0.40, 95%CI [0.20, 0.60]) were associated with higher ALM (P<2.0e-04). Lower abundance of Anaerotruncus (beta=-0.32, 95%CI [-0.45, -0.19]), Hungatella (beta=-0.26, 95%CI [-0.38, -0.15]) and Clostridiales bacterium DTU089 (beta=-0.37, 95%CI [-0.55, -0.19]) was associated with higher ALM only in females (P< 2.0e-04). Moreover, the biotin biosynthesis II pathway was positively associated with ALM (beta=0.44, 95% CI [0.24, 0.64]) (P<1.90e-04) in females while no associations were observed in males. We did not observe any robust association of bone traits with gut microbiome features.

ConclusionOur results indicate that specific genera are associated with ALM in middle-aged and older adults and these associations can present in a sex-specific manner. Overall, our study suggests that the gut microbiome is linked to muscle aging in middle-aged and older adults. However, larger sample sizes are still needed to underpin the specific microbiome features involved.","NA","medrxiv",1743199745506

Here we present a major extension to the stdpopsim framework that enables simulation of various modes of selection, including background selection, selective sweeps, and arbitrary distributions of fitness effects (DFE) acting on annotated subsets of the genome (for instance, exons). This extension maintains stdpopsims core principles of reproducibility and accessibility while adding support for species-specific genomic annotations and published DFE estimates. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by benchmarking methods for demographic inference, DFE estimation, and selective sweep detection across several species and scenarios. Our results demonstrate the robustness of demographic inference methods to selection on linked sites, reveal the sensitivity of DFE-inference methods to model assumptions, and show how genomic features, like recombination rate and functional sequence density, influence power to detect selective sweeps.

In the intestinal tract, bidirectional communication occurs between the nervous and immune systems to affect local immune responses by modulating the activity of resident and recruited immune cells, and indirectly on the supporting stromal cells. These neuroimmune signaling pathways that alter host defense have focused on specialized sensory innervation and the unique neurotransmitters released from them. Although the sympathetic nervous system has been established to induce a tissue-protective phenotype in subpopulations of neuron-associated macrophages in the small intestine, the role of these neurons during enteric bacterial infection was unknown. Using genetic labeling of activated neurons with ArcTRAP, we demonstrate that colonic infection induces activation of the rostral ventrolateral medulla, a major sympathetic center in the brainstem. The importance of peripheral sympathetic neurons was further demonstrated using chemical sympathectomy that significantly increased bacterial burden during Citrobacter rodentium (C. rodentium) infection. Increased bacterial burden was matched by a deficit in host protection due to reduced IFN{gamma} production by colonic CD4+ T-cells. Sympathectomy, however, did not diminish the capacity to differentiate into IFN{gamma}- or IL-17A- producing T-cells in vitro, suggesting that the lack of sympathetic innervation during infection may alter this process in vivo without causing sustained T-cell intrinsic defects. In assessing which receptors could mediate these effects, pharmacological antagonists selective for - adrenergic receptors (AR), but not {beta}-adrenergic receptors, increased bacterial burden and reduced colonic IFN{gamma} production. Using isolated cell types from the colon of uninfected and infected mice, we identified the AR subtypes expressed on immune and stromal cells, with significant upregulation of these receptors on T-cells during C. rodentium infection. Together these data demonstrate the unique role of the sympathetic nervous system and AR in mucosal immune responses against enteric bacterial pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745506

However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive the onset and progression of synaptic pathology remain to be established. Here, we used synaptic density positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using the [11C]UCB-J radiotracer to reveal a prominent widespread pattern (pFWE < 0.05) of lower synaptic density in individuals with schizophrenia (n=29), compared to a large sample of healthy controls (n=93). We found that the spatial pattern of lower synaptic density in schizophrenia is spatially aligned (rcca = 0.67; p < 0.001) with higher normative distributions of GABAA/BZ, 5HT1B, 5HT2A, and 5HT6, and lower levels of CB1 and 5HT1A. Competing neighborhood deformation network models revealed that regional synaptic pathology strongly correlated with estimates predicted using a model constrained by both interregional structural connectivity and molecular similarity (.42 < r < .61; pFWE < 0.05). These data suggest that synaptic pathology in schizophrenia is jointly constrained by both global axonal connectivity and local molecular vulnerability. Simulation-based network diffusion models were used to identify regions that may represent the initial sources of pathology, nominating left prefrontal areas (pFWE < 0.05) as potential foci from which synaptic pathology initiates and propagates to molecularly similar areas. Overall, our findings provide in vivo evidence for widespread deficit in synaptic density in schizophrenia that is jointly constrained by axonal connectivity and molecular similarity between regions, and that synaptic deficits spread from initial source regions to axonally connected and molecularly similar territories.","NA","medrxiv",1743199745506

Understanding the cellular processes that occur in the later stages of life is essential to address age-related diseases. Although aging is a global process that affects the entire body, the brain is one of the most sensitive organs and is affected by numerous degenerative diseases. In this study, we investigate cell types and genes that are particularly sensitive to the aging process. To this end, we performed a time-course single-cell RNAseq experiment series in the brain of the killifish, the vertebrate model with the shortest lifespan, which makes it an excellent model for aging studies. Our analysis reveals that non-glial progenitor cells are among those populations that change the most between young and old animals. Furthermore, we identify specialized stromal clusters that seem to support a primitive hematopoietic program in the brain, which is active only during the embryonic stages in other vertebrate species. Our results show that the expression of embryonic genes in the adult brain appears to be a general feature in killifish, and that several cell populations in the adult killifish brain show a higher level of similarity to the zebrafish embryonic populations than to adult ones. Our study suggests that adult killifish maintain a neotenic gene expression status in the brain that may help in sustaining their characteristic high proliferation and metabolic rates, as well as combat the detrimental effects of this high metabolism on cells, especially at advanced ages.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745506

ObjectivesMulti-omic analyses defined the cellular and molecular mediators associated with RA dysfunction in pulmonary artery banded (PAB) swine.

Methods4-week-old castrated male Yorkshire pigs were subjected to PAB and aged six weeks to induce right heart failure. Cardiac MRI evaluated RA size and function. snRNAseq defined the cell-specific alterations in RA tissue. Mitochondrial proteomics and metabolomics analyses examined the metabolic alterations in RA samples. Inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (iPSC-ACM) were treated with tunicamycin to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial structure and function were probed.

ResultsPAB induced RA dilation/dysfunction and atrial cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. snRNAseq demonstrated PAB altered the cellular composition of the RA defined by increased inflammatory macrophages and an alteration of cardiomyocyte subpopulations. RA cardiomyocytes exhibited ER stress and mitochondrial metabolic enzyme dysregulation. PAB RAs, but not PAB right ventricles, had downregulation of branched chain amino acid degrading enzymes. Metabolomics profiling revealed BCAA and fatty acid metabolism were impaired in the dysfunctional RA. Tunicamycin-induced ER stress disrupted mitochondrial structure/function in iPSC-ACMs.

ConclusionsMulti-omic evaluations demonstrate RA dysfunction is characterized by cardiomyocyte metabolic derangements due to ER dysregulation and an accumulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745506

The origins of the seed membranes and their relationship to the lipid transport machinery are poorly understood. Using proximity labeling and a variety of fluorescence microscopy techniques, we show that ATG2A localizes to extra-Golgi ARFGAP1 puncta during autophagosome biogenesis. ARFGAP1 itself is dispensable during macroautophagy, but among other proteins associating to these membranes, we find that Rab1 is essential. ATG2A co-immunoprecipitates strongly with Rab1a, and siRNA-mediated depletion of Rab1 blocks autophagy downstream of LC3B lipidation, similar to ATG2A depletion. Further, when either autophagosome formation or the early secretory pathway is perturbed, ARFGAP1 and Rab1a accumulate at ectopic locations with autophagic machinery. Our results suggest that ATG2A engages a Rab1a complex on select early secretory membranes at an early stage in autophagosome biogenesis.

Significance StatementThis study elucidates the role of early secretory membranes in autophagosome biogenesis. The authors demonstrate that Rab1/ARFGAP1 positive membranes are essential to autophagy and are recruited to the phagophore assembly site at an early step of autophagosome biogenesis. These membranes interact with the bridge-like lipid transport protein ATG2A and are positive for LC3B and WIPI2, suggesting that Rab1 membranes are a direct source for autophagosome growth.","NA","biorxiv",1743199745506

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1743199745506

Examining the subcellular localization of proteins using fluorescence microscopy is a powerful approach to infer their putative function. Here we report a plasmid-based method that enables YFP-tagging of a gene at the endogenous locus. By examining the localization of proteins whose homologs are involved in chromosome segregation in other eukaryotes, we discovered several interesting features in mitotically dividing P. papillatum cells. Cohesin is enriched on condensed interphase chromatin. During mitosis, chromosomes organize into two rings (termed metaphase rings herein) that surround the elongating nucleolus. Homologs of chromosomal passenger complex components (INCENP, two Aurora kinases, and KIN-A), a CLK1 kinase, spindle checkpoint protein Mad1, and microtubule regulator XMAP215 localize in between the two metaphase rings, suggesting that kinetochores may assemble in between them. We also found that a homolog of the meiotic chromosome axis protein SYCP2L1 is enriched in between metaphase rings during mitosis. These features have some resemblance to the bivalent bridge (also known as the modified synaptonemal complex), which is thought to mediate the linkage between homologous chromosomes using axis components in Bombyx mori female meiotic metaphase I.
