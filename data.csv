It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar.

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis. In the first six months of follow-up in the two-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.27-0.46); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.19-1.94). In the first six months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9% (95% CI: 94.0-97.1) and 34.1% (95% CI: -46.4-76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

ConclusionA strong healthy vaccinee effect was observed in the first six months following vaccination. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

Most tumor data is from a large homogenous batch of non-viable cells after 23 passages of the primary tumor cells, along with some data from different passages to enable an initial understanding of genomic instability. These data will be used by the GIAB Consortium to develop matched tumor-normal benchmarks for somatic variant detection. In addition, extensive data from two different normal tissues from the same individual can enable understanding of mosaicism. Long reads also contain methylation tags for epigenetic analyses. We expect these data to facilitate innovation for whole genome measurement technologies, de novo assembly of tumor and normal genomes, and bioinformatic tools to identify small and structural somatic mutations.

A transdiagnostic factor for psychopathology is emotion regulation, which is influenced by sex hormones, such as estradiol (E2), across the menstrual cycle on the behavioral and neural level. Whether this is also the case in the antepartum period remains unknown. For the first time, behavioral and neural emotion regulation were investigated in healthy primiparous pregnant females with extremely high E2 levels during the second trimester (N = 15) using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm. Results were compared with naturally-cycling females with high E2 levels (after E2-administration, N = 16) and low E2 levels (early follicular phase, N = 16). Although pregnant females reported the lowest trait use of cognitive reappraisal, all females successfully regulated their emotions by applying cognitive reappraisal in the scanner. On the neural level, all females had increased activity in the left middle frontal gyrus during downregulation of negative emotions. Pregnant females showed no significant differences in functional connectivity (psychophysiological interaction, resting-state) related to emotion regulation compared to the nonpregnant group. However, group differences emerged for amygdala activation. In pregnant females, increased amygdala activity predicted reduced regulation success and was positively associated with depression scores. This first fMRI study during pregnancy indicates that depression scores are reflected in heightened amygdala activity already observable in the antepartum period. Thus, through its association with reduced regulation success, increased amygdala activity suggests a neural risk marker for peripartum mental health. Future research needs to investigate emotion regulation in pregnant and postpartum women to further understand pregnancy-related changes and associations of mood, emotional and neural functions. Eventually, this will allow enhanced identification, prevention, and treatment of peri- and postpartum mental ill-health.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

Compared to other helper NLRs, NRG1 and closely related RPW8-like NLRs (CCR-NLRs) possess extended N-termini with distinctive sequence signatures, enabling their assembly into longer structures than canonical coiled coil NLR (CC-NLR) resistosomes. Activated NRG1 associates with single- and double-membrane organelles via its N-terminal RPW8-like domain.

We performed a 48-week double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled decentralized study (Participatory Evaluation of Aging with Rapamycin for Longevity [PEARL]; NCT04488601; registration date 2020-07-28) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rapamycin in mitigating clinical signs of aging in a normative aging cohort. Participants received 5 or 10 mg / week of compounded rapamycin, or placebo for 48 weeks. Safety, adverse events (AEs) and blood biomarkers were collected. Efficacy was assessed using DEXA scan-based measures and standardized surveys assessing quality of life (QoL) and frailty. We did not detect significant differences in safety blood biomarkers, or moderate to severe AEs between the rapamycin treatment groups and placebo after 48 weeks. We detected dose-dependent (10 mg group) and sex-specific improvements in lean tissue mass, pain, social functioning, overall QoL, and overall osteoarthritis score in females, and in bone mineral content in men. Additionally, some individuals receiving rapamycin experienced significant improvements in body composition metrics that were associated with beneficial changes in gut health and lipid metabolism. We conclude that low-dose, intermittent rapamycin administration over the course of 48 weeks is safe and induces sex-specific improvements in multiple aspects of healthspan, with the most robust improvements in lean tissue mass in women taking 10 mg rapamycin/week. Future work will aim to identify biometric signatures of clinical effectiveness to inform personalized treatment strategies that more broadly maximize efficacy and minimize side effects.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

C_LI

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

We aimed to test whether epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) estimated using different epigenetic clocks predict long-term overall, cardiovascular or cancer mortality.

MethodsWe analyzed data from 2,105 participants to the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey aged [&ge;]50 years old who were followed for mortality through 2019. EAAs was calculated from the residuals of Horvath, Hannum, SkinBlood, Pheno, Zhang, Lin, Weidner, Vidal-Bralo and Grim epigenetic clocks regressed on chronological age. Using cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association of EAA (per 5-year) and the DunedinPoAm pace of aging (per 10% increase) with overall, cardiovascular and cancer mortality, adjusting for covariates and white blood cell composition.

ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 17.5 years, 998 deaths occurred, including 272 from cardiovascular disease and 209 from cancer. Overall mortality was most significantly predicted by Grim EAA (P < 0.0001; HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.32-1.71) followed by Hannum (P = 0.001; HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.07-1.27), Pheno (P = 0.001; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.21), Horvath (P = 0.007; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04-1.22) and Vidal-Bralo (P = 0.008; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.03-1.23) EAAs. Grim EAA predicted cardiovascular mortality (P < 0.0001; HR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.29-1.86), whereas Hannum (P = 0.006; HR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.07-1.44), Horvath (P = 0.02; HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.02-1.35) and Grim (P = 0.049; HR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.00-1.87) EAAs predicted cancer mortality. DunedinPoAm pace of aging was associated with overall (P = 0.003; HR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.08-1.38) and cardiovascular (P = 0.04; HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.01-1.55) mortality.

ConclusionsIn a U.S. representative sample, Horvath, Hannum, Pheno, Vidal-Bralo and Grim EAA all predicted overall mortality but only Grim EAA predicted cardiovascular mortality and Horvath, Hannum or Grim EAA predicted cancer mortality. Pace of aging predicted overall and cardiovascular mortality.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

These price caps may reduce revenue for the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) that negotiate the actual price paid for medicines in the US. To offset the resulting pressure on their profit margins, it is possible that PBMs would, in turn, increase patients out-of-pocket costs for medicines with capped prices. The model presented here evaluates how such increased out-of-pocket costs for the anticoagulants Eliquis (apixaban) and Xarelto (rivaroxaban) could impact patients financially and clinically.

MethodsCopay distributions for all 2023 prescription fills for Eliquis and Xarelto managed by the three largest PBMs were used to approximate current copay costs. Increased out-of-pocket costs were modeled as a shift of all Eliquis and Xarelto prescriptions to the highest copay tier. The known linear relationship between copay costs and treatment abandonment was used to calculate the potential resulting increase in treatment abandonment. Known rates of morbidity and mortality due to abandoning anticoagulants were used to estimate resulting increases in morbidity and mortality.

ResultsIf the three largest PBMs all shifted costs onto patients by moving all Eliquis and Xarelto prescriptions to the highest formulary tier, Tier 6, patients copay amount would increase by $235 to $482 million for Eliquis and $105 to $206 million for Xarelto. Such an increase could lead to 169,000 to 228,000 patients abandoning Eliquis and 71,000 to 93,000 abandoning Xarelto. The resulting morbidity and mortality could include up to an additional 145,000 major cardiovascular events and up to 97,000 more deaths.

ConclusionThe Medicare Price Negotiation Program could impact patients negatively if it causes PBMs to increase patients out-of-pocket costs for medicines. Policymakers should closely monitor changes in overall affordability, including all patient out-of-pocket expenditures, for medications in the program. Preemptive measures to ensure that the most vulnerable citizens are not placed in precarious situations leading to poorer health outcomes should be considered.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

Cladribine is a deoxyadenosine analogue that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier. It is used to treat multiple sclerosis. However, the mechanistic understanding of the effect of this highly effective therapy on B cells and plasma cells in the central nervous system compartment is limited. Objectives. The CLADRIPLAS study examined the effect of cladribine on peripheral and intrathecal B and plasma cell biology in people with MS. Methods. Thirty-eight people with progressive MS ineligible for- or rejecting- treatment with licenced therapies were recruited and supplied a baseline lumbar puncture. Those exhibiting gadolinium-enhancing or new/enlarging T2 magnetic resonance imaging lesions and/or elevated neurofilament levels were offered subcutaneous cladribine (Litak). Seven people were eligible; one person died before treatment, and only five completed the first year of treatment. Twenty-two ineligible people were willing to provide a repeat lumbar puncture twelve months later. Results. The CLADRIPLAS study found no evidence of a difference in the odds of a positive cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal band (cOCB) result between the cladribine-treated and untreated group. This is probably explained by microarray and in vitro studies, which demonstrated that plasmablasts and notably long-lived plasma cells are relatively resistant to the cytotoxic effect of cladribine compared to memory B cells at physiological concentrations. This was consistent with the loss of intracellular deoxycytidine kinase during antibody-secreting cell differentiation. Discussion. CLADRIPLAS indicates that cOCB are not rapidly eliminated in most people with MS.

This study aims to develop a rapid acquisition method that provides distortion-matched, artifact-mitigated structural reference data.

MethodsWe introduce an efficient sequence protocol termed T1234, which offers adjustable distortions. This approach involves a T1-weighted 2-inversion 3D-EPI sequence with four spatial encoding directions optimized for high-resolution fMRI. A forward Bloch model was used for T1 quantification and protocol optimization. Twenty participants were scanned at 7T using both structural and functional protocols to evaluate the utility of T1234.

ResultsResults from two protocols are presented. A fast distortion-free protocol reliably produced whole-brain segmentations at 0.8mm isotropic resolution within 3:00-3:40 minutes. It demonstrates robustness across sessions, participants, and three different 7T SIEMENS scanners. For a protocol with geometric distortions that matched functional data, T1234 facilitates layer-specific fMRI signal analysis with enhanced laminar precision.

ConclusionThis structural mapping approach enables precise registration with fMRI data. T1234 has been successfully implemented, validated, and tested, and is now available to users at our center and at over 50 centers worldwide.","NA","biorxiv",1727215730002

Real-time genomic surveillance using offers the potential to detect otherwise unidentified outbreaks. We initiated and evaluated the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-associated Transmission (EDS-HAT), a real-time genomic surveillance program for outbreak detection and mitigation. Methods: This study was conducted at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital from November 2021 to October 2023. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed weekly on healthcare-associated clinical bacterial isolates to identify otherwise undetected outbreaks. Interventions were implemented in real-time based on identified transmission. A clinical and economic impact analysis was conducted to estimate infections averted and net cost savings. Results: There were 3,921 bacterial isolates from patient healthcare-associated infections that underwent WGS, of which 476 (12.1%) clustered into 172 outbreaks (size range 2-16 patients). Of the outbreak isolates, 292 (61.3%) had an identified epidemiological link. Among the outbreaks with interventions, 95.6% showed no further transmission on the intervened transmission route. The impact analysis estimated that, over the two-year period, 62 infections were averted, with gross cost savings of $1,011,146, and net savings of $695,706, which translates to a 3.2-fold return on investment. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed EDS-HAT was cost-saving and more effective in 98% of simulations. Conclusion: Real-time genomic surveillance enabled the rapid detection and control of outbreaks in our hospital and resulted in economic benefits and improvement in patient safety. This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating genomic surveillance into routine infection prevention practice, offering a paradigm shift in healthcare outbreak detection and control.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

Yet, technical limitations associated with short reads challenge their use for detection of disease-associated variation in complex regions of the genome. Long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies may overcome these challenges, potentially qualifying as a first-tier test for all rare diseases. To test this hypothesis, we performed LRS (30x HiFi genomes) for 100 samples with 145 known clinically relevant germline variants that are challenging to detect using short-read sequencing and necessitate a broad range of complementary test modalities in diagnostic laboratories.

We show that relevant variant callers readily re-identify the majority of variants (120/145, 83%), including [~]90% of structural variants, SNVs/InDels in homologous sequences and expansions of short tandem repeats. Another 10% (n=14) was visually apparent in the data but not automatically detected. Our analyses also identified systematic challenges for the remaining 7% (n=11) of variants such as the detection of AG-rich repeat expansions. Titration analysis showed that 89% of all automatically called variants could also be identified using 15-fold coverage.

Thus, long-read genomes identified 93% of pathogenic variants that are most challenging to detect using short-read technologies. Even with reduced coverage, the vast majority of variants remained detectable, possibly enhancing cost-effective diagnostic implementation. Most importantly, we show the potential to use a single technology to accurately identify all types of clinically relevant variants.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

This technique produces networks where each target node is associated with a set of source nodes that are capable of providing explanatory power for its dynamics. Multivariate Transfer Entropy (TE) has proven to be a popular and effective tool for inferring these networks. Recently, a continuous-time estimator of TE for event-based data such as spike trains has been developed which, in more efficiently representing event data in terms of inter-event intervals, is significantly more capable of measuring multivariate interactions. The new estimator thus presents an opportunity to more effectively use TE for the inference of effective networks from spike trains, and we demonstrate in this paper for the first time its efficacy at this task. Using data generated from models of spiking neurons - for which the ground-truth connectivity is known - we demonstrate the accuracy of this approach in various dynamical regimes. We further show that it exhibits far superior inference performance to a pairwise TE-based approach as well as a recently-proposed convolutional neural network approach. Moreover, comparison with Generalised Linear Models (GLMs), which are commonly applied to spike-train data, showed clear benefits, particularly in cases of high synchrony. Finally, we demonstrate its utility in revealing the patterns by which effective connections develop from recordings of developing neural cell cultures.","NA","biorxiv",1727215730002

There are uncertainties about whether treatments in the acute or post-acute phase of infection can prevent PCC. We report an update to a previous systematic review on the effects of interventions to prevent PCC. Methods: We updated our previous peer-reviewed searches on February 9, 2024. We searched bibliographic databases and grey literature resources to identify trials and comparative observational studies reporting on any intervention provided during the acute (symptom onset to 4 weeks) or post-acute phase (4-8 weeks) of COVID-19 and our primary outcome of incidence of PCC, ascertained at 3 months or longer following infection and capturing, at a minimum, symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea and one or more aspects of cognitive function. Non-recovery from COVID-19 was included if necessary. Secondary outcomes included fatigue, breathlessness/dyspnea, post-exertional malaise, health-related quality of life, psychopathology, cognitive impairment, hospitalization, return to work/education, and adverse effects of the intervention. For screening we employed artificial intelligence to prioritize records and modified our methods to rely on single-reviewer screening after 50% of citations were screened in duplicate. Study selection and risk of bias assessments were conducted independently by two reviewers and data extraction relied on verification of another reviewers work. We grouped studies by intervention type and timing, and by acute-care setting, and performed meta-analysis where appropriate. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the primary outcome, excluding studies with high risk of bias, using non-recovery as a proxy outcome, and evaluating the outcome at more than 12 months of follow-up. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Results: Twenty-four studies (5 randomized and 19 non-randomized), all among adults, were included. The acute care setting in nine studies was outpatient and in 15 studies was in-patient; all but one intervention was administered during the acute-phase of illness. The use of convalescent plasma in outpatient acute COVID-19 care probably does not reduce the risk of PCC (relative risk [RR]: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.77-1.12; 1 RCT; moderate certainty). There was low-certainty evidence suggesting that probiotics (RR [95% CI]: 0.32 [0.13-0.78]; 1 RCT) and metformin (0.50 [0.25-0.99]; 1 RCT among individuals with a BMI >=25 kg/m2) reduce PCC to a small-to-moderate extent in outpatients, while ivermectin (outpatients), antivirals (outpatients), steroids (in-patients), and therapeutic-dose heparin (vs. prophylactic dose; in-patients) may not be effective. Evidence was very low certainty for several other acute-phase pharmacologic intervention and post-acute outpatient assessment and referrals. For outpatient antiviral treatment, while overall PCC risk may not decrease, there might be a slight reduction in psychopathology. Similarly, inpatient antiviral use may not prevent PCC but may offer a small reduction in prolonged general malaise after light exertion. Therapeutic-dose heparin may slightly reduce the risk of cognitive impairment compared to prophylactic-dose heparin among in-patients. The findings remained consistent across all these sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Evidence suggests that PCC can be prevented to some extent among outpatients with the use of probiotics and metformin during the acute phase of COVID-19. Effects from interventions used among in-patients and within the post-acute phase are uncertain at this time. Evidence on commonly recommended interventions including rehabilitation or multidisciplinary care was lacking. Protocol registration: CRD42024513247","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

Although its effectiveness has been estimated to range between 36-86%, the persistence of protection is still unknown. Aims of this study is to assess the immune response one year after vaccination with MVA-BN. Methods Observational prospective study at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome. All people at high risk for mpox infection who received MVA-BN as pre-exposure prophylaxis were enrolled. People previously primed with smallpox vaccination received a single-dose course of MVA-BN, while non-primed received a two-dose course. Blood samples were collected at the time of each dose and one, six and 12 months after vaccination. MPXV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers were assessed by immunofluorescence and plaque neutralization tests, respectively. Interferon-gamma producing T-cell specific response to the MVA-BN vaccine was analyzed by ELISpot assay. Antibody titers at pre- and post-vaccination were compared using the Friedman tests. Mann Whitney test was used to compare antibody titers in PLWH vs PLWoH. Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests were used to compare T-cells specific response to the MVA-BN vaccine for intra and inter-group differences, respectively. Results Fifty high-risk people were included. All were men, with 94% self-reporting having sex with men. The median age was 50 years (IQR 45-57), and 21 (42%) were people living with HIV (PLWH), all on antiretroviral therapy, and 71% with a CD4 cell count higher than 500 mmc. 25 (50%) have been primed with previous smallpox vaccination. In non-primed people, anti-MPXV IgG titers significantly increased from T1 to T3 and, despite a slight reduction, were still higher than T1 up to T4 and then gradually decreased until T5, when 64% of sera were still reactive. MPXV-nAb titers peaked at T3 and then dropped, with 56% and 32% of sera reactive at T4 and T5, respectively. IFN-g; production by MVA-BN-specific T-cells progressively rose across time, peaked at T3, and remained significantly higher than the baseline after 6 and 12 months from vaccination. A single-dose course of MVA-BN vaccination in smallpox-primed participants elicited an early increase in IgG and nAb titers, which remained significantly higher than baseline after 6 and 12 months. MPXV-nAbs were detected in 80% and 72% of vaccinees at T4 and T5, respectively. A similar improvement and maintenance were observed for the MVA-BN-specific T-cell response. No evidence for a difference in both humoral and cellular responses was found between PLWH and PLWoH in our cohort. Conclusions One year after vaccination, our data showed the persistent detectability of low levels of nAb against MPXV in one-third of non-primed individuals. At the same time, humoral response was still detectable in most previously vaccinated participants. Concurrently, the MVA-BN-specific T-cell response was robust and persistent.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

C_LIO_LIHere we use biparental mapping populations of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) with a common Paragon parent to explore the inheritance of homoeolog expression bias in the F5 generation.
C_LIO_LIWe found that homoeolog expression bias is inherited for 26-27% of triads in both populations. Most triads ([~]70%) conserved a similar homoeolog expression bias pattern as one or both parents. Inherited patterns were largely driven by changes in the expression of one homoeolog, allowing homoeolog expression bias in subsequent generations to match parental expression. Novel patterns of homoeolog expression bias occurred more frequently in the biparental population from a landrace x elite cross, than in the population with two elite parents.

Despite its significance in biology, there is a lack of conventional techniques suitable for studying biphasic samples in their biologically relevant form. Here, we present a label-free and non-invasive approach to characterize protein, RNA and water in biomolecular condensates termed LLPS REstricted DIFusion of INvisible speciEs (REDIFINE). Relying on diffusion NMR measurements, REDIFINE exploits the exchange dynamics between the condensed and dispersed phases to allow the determination of not only diffusion constants in both phases but also the fractions of the species, the average radius of the condensed droplets and the exchange rate between the phases. We can also access the concentration of proteins in both phases. Observing proteins, RNAs, water, and even small molecules, REDIFINE analysis allows a rapid biophysical characterization of multicomponent condensates which is important to understand their functional roles. In comparing multiple systems, REDIFINE reveals that folded RNA-binding proteins form smaller and more dynamic droplets compared to the disordered ones. In addition, REDIFINE proved to be valuable beyond LLPS for the determination of binding constants in soluble protein-RNA without the need for titration.","NA","biorxiv",1727215730002

Previously published in 2019, 57 HCM-associated genes were curated providing the first systematic evaluation of gene-disease validity. Here we report work by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel (HCVD-GCEP) to reappraise the clinical validity of previously curated and new putative HCM genes.

MethodsThe ClinGen systematic gene curation framework was used to re-classify the gene-disease relationships for HCM and related syndromic entities involving left ventricular hypertrophy. Genes previously curated were included if their classification was not definitive, and if the time since curation was >2-3 years. New genes with literature assertions for HCM were included for initial evaluation. Existing genes were curated for new inheritance patterns where evidence existed. Curations were presented on twice monthly calls, with the HCVD-GCEP composed of 29 individuals from 21 institutions across 6 countries.

ResultsThirty-one genes were re-curated and an additional 5 new potential HCM-associated genes were curated. Among the re-curated genes, 17 (55%) genes changed classification: 1 limited and 4 disputed (from no known disease relationship), 9 disputed (from limited), and 3 definitive (from moderate). Among these, 3 (10%) genes had a clinically relevant upgrade, including TNNC1, a 9th sarcomere gene with definitive HCM association. With new evidence, two genes were curated for multiple inheritance patterns (TRIM63, disputed for autosomal dominant but moderate for autosomal recessive; ALPK3, strong for autosomal dominant and definitive for recessive). CSRP3 was curated for a semi-dominant mode of inheritance (definitive). Nine (29%) genes were downgraded to disputed, further discouraging clinical reporting of variants in these genes. Five genes recently reported to cause HCM were curated: RPS6KB1 and RBM20 (limited), KLHL24 and MT-TI (moderate), and FHOD3 (definitive).

ConclusionsWe report 29 genes with definitive, strong or moderate evidence of causation for HCM or isolated LVH, including sarcomere, sarcomere-associated and syndromic conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

For this reason, there is great interest toward the development of tools to track burden and improve biotechnology applications. Fluorogenic RNA aptamers are excellent candidates for live monitoring of burden because their production is expected to impose a negligible load on transcription resources. Here we characterise the performance of a library of aptamers when expressed from different promoters in E. coli. We find that aptamer relative performance is dependent on the promoter and the strain, and that, contrary to expectation, aptamer expression impacts host fitness. By selecting two of the aptamers with brighter output and lower impact, we then design an intracellular biosensor able to report on the activation of the burden response in engineered cells. The sensor developed here adds to the collection of tools available for burden mitigation and may support bioprocessing applications where improved host performance is sought.","NA","biorxiv",1727215730002

Prior demographic surveys in English-speaking countries (e.g., Canada and the United States) suggest that SLPs gender, racial, linguistic, and cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds may not be aligned with those of their clientele. The aim of this study is to describe the demographic characteristics of current SLP students, to gauge whether the demographic composition of future clinicians is changing and is aligned with the population they are trained to serve. We designed an anonymous online survey, in the Canadian context, that enabled us to compare current SLP student demographics with statistics available about the target population at large. This survey was disseminated to all SLP students enrolled in an accredited institution in 2024. Participants answered questions about their age, sex and gender, linguistic, racial and cultural identities, and socioeconomic status. More than half (N=525, 53%) of currently enrolled SLP students completed the survey. Results indicate that SLP students are overwhelmingly cisgender females. SLP students spoke 48 unique languages, and while most were bi or multilingual, few felt competent enough in languages other than English and French to engage in clinical service delivery. There were 151 unique racial and ethnic identities reported, with the largest proportion of students identifying as ""North American."" Culturally most SLPs identified as ""Canadian."" Very few students identified as Black or Indigenous racially or culturally. Most respondents reported a higher-than-average total household income. Findings suggest that the demographic composition of current SLP students is more diverse than those currently practicing, however there is still over-, and underrepresentation of certain populations. Implications for practice and suggestions for future research are discussed.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

These challenges stem from concerns about the quality, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of LLM-generated answers. Most existing work has focused on fine-tuning LLMs based on foundation models, which have not yet fully addressed accuracy and reliability issues. In this work, we propose an agent-based approach that aims to make LLM-based systems clinically deployable for precision oncology, while mitigating common pitfalls such as hallucinations, incoherence, and ""lost-in-the-middle"" problems. To achieve this, we implemented an agentic architecture, fundamentally shifting an LLM's role from a simple response synthesizer to planner. This agent orchestrates a suite of specialized tools that asynchronously retrieve information from various sources. These tools include curated document vector stores encompassing treatment guidelines, genomic data, clinical trial information, drug data, and breast cancer literature. The LLM then leverages its planning capabilities to synthesize information retrieved by these tools, generating comprehensive and accurate responses. We demonstrate GeneSilico Copilot's effectiveness in the domain of breast cancer, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.

The ZCRB1 protein is a recently described core component of the U12 mono-snRNP minor spliceosome, but its functional significance to minor splicing, gene regulation, and biological signaling cascades is poorly understood. Using CRISPR-Cas9 and siRNA targeted knockout and knockdown strategies, we show that human cell lines with a partial reduction in ZCRB1 expression exhibit significant dysregulation of the splicing and expression of U12-type genes, primarily due to dysregulation of U12 mono-snRNA. RNA-Seq and targeted analyses of minor intron-containing genes indicate a downregulation in the expression of genes involved in ciliogenesis, and consequentially an upregulation in WNT signaling. Additionally, zcrb1 CRISPR-Cas12a knockdown in zebrafish embryos led to gross developmental and body axis abnormalities, disrupted ciliogenesis, and upregulated WNT signaling, complementing our human cell studies. This work highlights a conserved and essential biological role of the minor spliceosome in general, and the ZCRB1 protein specifically in cellular and developmental processes across species, shedding light on the multifaceted relationship between splicing regulation, ciliogenesis, and WNT signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1727215730002

Collectively referred to as 'pigweeds', these species are incredibly adaptive and have become successful competitors in diverse agricultural settings. Development of genomic resources for these species promises to facilitate the elucidation of the genetic basis of traits such as biotic and abiotic stress tolerance (e.g., herbicide resistance) and sex determination. Here, we sequenced and assembled chromosome-level genomes of these three pigweed weed species. By combining the haplotype-resolved assembly of A. palmeri with existing restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data, we identified a ~2.84 Mb region on chromosome 3 of Hap1 that is male-specific and contains 37 genes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed two genes within the male-specific region, RESTORER OF FERTILITY 1 (Rf1) and TLC DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN (TLC), were upregulated in male individuals across the shoot apical meristem, the floral meristem, and mature flowers, indicating their potential involvement in sex determination in A. palmeri. In addition, we rigorously classified cytochrome P450 genes in all three pigweeds due to their involvement in non-target site herbicide resistance. Finally, we identified contiguous extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) in A. palmeri, a critical component of glyphosate resistance in this species. The findings of this study advance our understanding of sex determination in A. palmeri and provide genomic resources for elucidating the genetic basis and evolutionary origins of adaptive traits within the genus.","NA","biorxiv",1727215730002

However, evidence on their incidence and prevalence remains limited. Objectives: To evaluate secular trends of incidence and prevalence of parkinsonism, Parkinson's Disease, Vascular Parkinsonism, and Drug-induced Parkinsonism from 2007 to 2021 in the United Kingdom. Methods: We used primary care data, Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD, from the United Kingdom. Individuals were included if they were registered from January 2007 to December 2021 with at least one year of prior observation. Incidence and prevalence were calculated on a yearly basis with 95% confidence intervals and then stratified by age and sex. Results: From 2007 to 2019, the incidence of parkinsonism and Parkinson's Disease decreased, with Parkinson's Disease incidence dropping from 35.86 (95% confidence interval: 34.22 - 37.56) to 31.40 (29.40 - 33.50) per 100,000 person-years. The prevalence of parkinsonism and Parkinson's Disease increased from 0.22% (0.22% - 0.23%) and 0.21% (0.21% - 0.22%) in 2007 to peak in 2016 with 0.25% (0.25% - 0.26%) and 0.23% (0.23% - 0.24%) respectively. The number of Vascular Parkinsonism diagnoses have increased from 2010, whereas incidence and prevalence of Drug-induced Parkinsonism remained stable. Incidence and prevalence increased with age and were generally higher in males, except for Drug-induced Parkinsonism, which was slightly higher in females. Conclusions: Given its association with aging, parkinsonism and these subtypes continue to present an increasing challenge to our aging society.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

We obtained geolocated, anonymised, laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, wastewater SARS-CoV-2 viral load data and socio-demographic data for Gauteng Province, South Africa. We spatially located all data to create a single dataset for sewershed catchments served by two large wastewater treatment plants. We conducted epidemiological, persons infected and principal component analysis to explore the relationships between variables. Overall, we demonstrate the co-contributory influences of socio-economic indicators on access to SARS-CoV-2 testing and cumulative incidence, thus reflecting that apparent incidence rates mirror access to testing and socioeconomic considerations rather than true disease epidemiology. These analyses demonstrate how WES provides valuable information to contextualise and interpret laboratory-based epidemiological data. Whilst it is useful to have these associations established for SARS-CoV-2, the implications beyond SARS-CoV-2 are legion for two reasons, namely that biases inherent in clinical surveillance are broadly applicable across pathogens and all pathogens infecting humans will find their way into wastewater albeit in varying quantities. WES should be implemented to strengthen surveillance systems, especially where economic inequalities limit interpretability of conventional surveillance data.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

Hydrodynamic processes linking the distinct nearshore and offshore trophic structures play a crucial role in transporting nutrient-loaded water along and across the shore. Despite the pivotal connection between algae growth and the development of nuisance proportions, the scales over which these processes operate remain poorly understood. This study delves into the exchange dynamics between nearshore and offshore areas of Lake Ontario throughout 2018, employing a validated three-dimensional numerical model. A virtual passive age tracer is utilized to discern horizontal mixing time scales between nearshore regions of the lake (water depth < 30 m) and offshore locations. The dispersal pattern, as revealed by a passive tracer released from eight points around the model lake's perimeter, indicates more extensive diffusion in late summer when lake-wide stratification is established, compared to the mixed period. Coastal upwelling events, leading to intrusions of hypolimnetic waters, significantly contribute to net cross-shore transport, with the most pronounced effects observed in May and June when the offshore thermocline is shallow. In the northern part of the lake, dispersal predominantly occurs alongshore, mirroring the prevailing cyclonic (counterclockwise) coastal circulation during the stratified season. This pattern is a consequence of a 45% increase in upwelling events compared to three decades ago. In the northwestern and southern sectors of the lake, elevated cross-shore mixing is attributed to geomorphology-induced cross-basin currents.","NA","biorxiv",1727215730002

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","NA","biorxiv",1727215730002

Herein, our goal was to map specific mucin glycoforms in diseased tissue, enabling correlation of the tumor glycan profile with malignant features. To this end, we developed a workflow implementing on-tissue digestion with mucinase StcE, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). To optimize our workflow, we analyzed four different mucinous carcinomas derived from colon, esophageal, and salivary gland tissue.

Using this technique, we deduced the spatial distribution of StcE-generated O-glycopeptides within mucinous tumors using MALDI-IMS. Subsequent LC-MS analyses revealed the identity of different species detected in imaging experiments, in addition to comprehensively characterizing the mucinome and proteome of each tissue. Our coupled MS approach unveiled a striking mucin 2 (MUC2) expression pattern in two colorectal mucinous adenocarcinomas, in which different glycoforms clearly stratified regions within the tumor. Notably, our LC-MS experiments obtained near-complete sequence coverage over the mucin domains of MUC2, enabling glycoproteomic mapping of this canonical mucin in unprecedented depth. MUC2 glycosylation was dominated by the T and Tn antigens, with surprisingly little sialylation detected. However, O-glycans containing mono- and di-O-acetylated sialic acid were detected in low abundance. Finally, we obtained spectral evidence for an endogenous O-acetylated GalNAc, an O-glycan structure not previously reported in the literature. Overall, this proof-of-concept work underscores the potential of this technique to generate new research avenues in oncology and beyond.

Significance StatementAberrant mucin expression and glycosylation are hallmarks of cancer, but how these changes promote malignant processes are not well understood. Solid tumors are highly heterogeneous in their cellular and molecular composition, and many advanced spatial techniques have emerged in recent years to study the tumor microenvironment (TME) for better understanding disease progression. Spatially resolved glycoprotein analyses typically detect either the protein or glycan components, but not both. We developed a workflow using a dual mass spectrometry approach to map the location of intact glycopeptides in mucinous tumors, enabled by on-tissue digestion with the mucin-specific protease StcE. Future applications of this method on larger patient cohorts will enhance our understanding of glycans in malignancy, identify disease biomarkers, and define therapeutic targets.","NA","biorxiv",1727215730002

This study analyzed over 26,000 genomes and their associated metadata collected between January and October 2021 to explore the introduction and dispersal patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in Greater Houston, a major metropolitan area noted for its demographic diversity. We identified more than a thousand independent introduction events, resulting in clusters of varying sizes, with earlier clusters presenting larger sizes and posing greater control challenges. Characterization of the sources of these introductions showed that domestic origins were more significant than international ones. Further examination of locally circulating clusters across different subregions of Greater Houston revealed varied transmission dynamics. Notably, subregions that served as primary viral sources sustained the local epidemic effectively, evidenced by: (1) a smaller proportion of new cases driven by external viral importations, and (2) longer persistence times of circulating lineages. Overall, our high-resolution spatiotemporal reconstruction of the epidemic in Greater Houston enhances understanding of the heterogeneous transmission landscape, providing key insights into regional response strategies and public health planning.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

Lesions damaging these neural pathways result in weakness of key muscles causing dysarthria and dysphagia, leading to profound social isolation and risk of aspiration and suffocation. Here we show that Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the motor thalamus improved speech and swallowing functions in two participants with dysarthria and dysphagia. First, we proved that DBS increased excitation of the face motor cortex, augmenting motor evoked potentials, and range and speed of motion of orofacial articulators in n=10 volunteers with intact neural pathways. Then, we demonstrated that this potentiation led to immediate improvement in swallowing functions in a patient with moderate dysphagia and profound dysarthria as a consequence of a traumatic brain lesion. In this subject and in another with mild dysarthria, we showed that DBS immediately ameliorated impairments of respiratory, phonatory, resonatory, and articulatory control thus resulting in a clinically significant improvement in speech intelligibility. Our data provide first-in-human evidence that DBS can be used to treat dysphagia and dysarthria in people with cerebral lesions.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

However, the systemic identification of these alleles has been challenging due to their scarcity in the general population. Here, we discovered and characterized rare coding alleles contributing to genetic dyslipidemia, a principal risk for coronary artery disease, among over a million individuals combining three large contemporary genetic datasets (the Million Veteran Program, n = 634,535, UK Biobank, n = 431,178, and the All of Us Research Program, n = 92,304) totaling 1,158,017 multi-ancestral individuals. Unlike previous rare variant studies in lipids, this study included 238,243 individuals (20.6%) from non-European-like populations.

Testing 2,997,401 rare coding variants from diverse backgrounds, we identified 800 exome-wide significant associations across 209 genes including 176 predicted loss of function and 624 missense variants. Among these exome-wide associations, 130 associations were driven by non-European-like populations. Associated alleles are highly enriched in functional variant classes, showed significant additive and recessive associations, exhibited similar effects across populations, and resolved pathogenicity for variants enriched in African or South-Asian populations. Furthermore, we identified 5 lipid-related genes associated with coronary artery disease (RORC, CFAP65, GTF2E2, PLCB3, and ZNF117). Among them, RORC is a potentially novel therapeutic target through the down regulation of LDLC by its silencing.

This study provides resources and insights for understanding causal mechanisms, quantifying the expressivity of rare coding alleles, and identifying novel drug targets across diverse populations.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730002

Many GxG interactions have been identified in model organisms through experimental breeding studies, but they have been difficult to identify in human populations. To address this challenge, we applied two complementary variance QTL (vQTL)-based approaches to identify GxG interactions that contribute to human blood traits and blood-related disease risk. First, we used the previously validated genome-wide scale test for each trait in [~]450,000 people in the UK Biobank and identified 4 vQTLs. Genome-wide GxG interaction testing of these vQTLs enabled discovery of novel interactions between (1) CCL24 and CCL26 for eosinophil count and plasma CCL24 and CCL26 protein levels and (2) HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 for lymphocyte count and risk of celiac disease, both of which replicated in [~]140,000 NIH All of Us and [~]70,000 Vanderbilt BioVU participants. Second, we used a biologically informed approach to search for vQTL in disease-relevant genes. This approach identified (1) a known interaction for hemoglobin between two pathogenic variants in HFE which cause hereditary hemochromatosis and alters risk of cirrhosis and (2) a novel interaction between the JAK2 46/1 haplotype and a variant on chromosome 14 which modifies platelet count, JAK2 V617F clonal hematopoiesis, and risk of polycythemia vera.

Studies conducted before 2022 provided evidence about the humoral response against the Vaccinia virus (VACV) after vaccination but not against the Mpox virus (MPXV). Moreover, no data are available on the T-cell response elicited by MVA-BN administered subcutaneously or intradermally. Here, we compare the two vaccine administration routes according to reactogenicity and immunogenicity based on data from 943 vaccine recipients during the 2022 vaccination campaign in Rome, Italy. We found that the intradermal route elicited slightly higher titers of MPXV-specific IgG and nAbs than the subcutaneous one. At the same time, no differences in cellular response were detected. MVA-BN was globally well tolerated despite higher reactogenicity for the intradermal than the subcutaneous route, especially for the reactions at the local injection site.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no validated scale to measure this habit. Given the need to raise awareness and its importance, a study was undertaken to develop, test, and validate the HWI. The Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A) was adapted and substantially modified to draft the first version of the index (HWQ). The COnsensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instrument (COSMIN) guided our approach. The HWQ The questionnaire consisted of six questions with a five-point scale response for each item, ranging from the lowest [1] to the highest activity [5] as scoring criteria. We followed a four-stage procedure in validating the instrument: Stage I: items were created from the review of the relevant literature (PAQ-A, COSMIN); Stage II: the study targeted and recruited 57 health professionals from different backgrounds and vetted them as decliners, non-regulars, and regular hand washers through a scoring process.

This crucial phase ensured that the respondents had hands-on experience in handwashing in addition to their expertise. In Stage III, 10 respondents from the regular hand washers were randomly selected as expert judges. They were divided into two (2) groups (Group one and Group two) of four and six members, respectively. Further comprehensibility and comprehensiveness of the HWQ were established through a review by the four members of Group 1, and revisions were made to create HWQ-I. At stage IV, the HWQ-I was administered to the six members of the second group for ratings and content validity index calculations. The final draft of the HWI includes 4 items. Item CVI ranges between 0.8 and 1.The average scale CVI was 0.9.

The HWI demonstrated excellent content validity, showing its relevance for monitoring handwashing, and individuals can track their compliance, promoting a healthy life. We propose further studies to test the psychometric properties of the scale.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730003

We report that in 2023-2024, MPXV clade Ib genomes are diverging at a faster rate than clade IIb (2022), primarily due to an unusually high incidence of recombination. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Ib strains have diverged into four lineages, and they have evolved into 14 subgroups based on nine tandem repeat (TR) polymorphisms. These findings confirms that TRs in MPXV Ib are mutating at a significantly higher frequency compared to the 2022 outbreak (clade IIb, 11 subgroups). Linkage disequilibrium analysis also identified 10 recombination clusters among all 4 lineages, with recombination incidence in Ib being twice as high as in IIb. This suggests that a higher rate of superinfection is contributing to ongoing recombination among populations infected with clade Ib.

We investigated whether a diverse refugee committee could utilize participatory methods to identify health priorities and a research agenda to address them.

MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study with focus groups of current and former refugees, asylum claimants and evacuees from a specialized refugee clinic over a year. We collected sociodemographic data using standardized instruments, then utilized a four-step nominal group technique process (idea generation, recording, discussion, and voting) to identify and rank participants health and research priorities. Participants ranked their top five priorities across three time periods: Pre-migration/early arrival (0-3 months), post-migration (3 months-2 years), and long-term health (>2 years). Participants created overarching priorities and corroborated findings via a member checking step.

FindingsTwenty-three participants (median age 35 years) attended one or more of five focus groups. Twenty-one completed sociodemographic surveys: 16/21 (76%) were women, representing 8 countries of origin. Participants identified ""more family physicians"" and ""improving health system navigation"" (11/60 votes each) as top health and research priorities respectively across all resettlement periods. Participants also prioritized pre-departure healthcare system orientation and improved post-arrival and long-term mental health services. Twelve participants completed the member checking process, affirming the results with minor clarifications.

InterpretationThis proof-of-concept study illustrates how refugees can use a rigorous consensus process without external influence to prioritize their healthcare needs, direct a health research agenda to address those needs, and co-produce research. These low-cost participatory methods should be replicated elsewhere.

Here we draw on drug checking results from around the United States to report a rapid shift in the illicit drug supply with important implications for public health. Bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl) sebacate, or ""BTMPS"" is a hindered amine light stabilizer with various industrial applications. Animal studies indicate multiple kinds of adverse health effects.

MethodsDrug samples collected by community-based drug checking programs in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, along with drug residue samples from other jurisdictions in California, Delaware, Maryland, and Washington, were submitted to the National Institute on Standards and Technology. Samples were qualitatively tested with Direct Analysis in Real Time mass spectrometry, with reflex to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) for confirmatory testing. Quantitation - percent by mass - was performed using LCMS. At both sites where drug samples were collected, participants were asked to respond to a survey that included questions about what the substance was sold as and any unexpected effects.

ResultsBetween June 1, 2024 and August 31, 2024, a total of 178 samples sold as fentanyl were tested. Of these, 43 (24%) contained BTMPS, with the proportion per month rising from 0% in June to more than a third in August. An additional 23 residue samples from sites doing residue testing contained BTMPS. Fentanyl samples with BTMPS also contained many other compounds, including local anesthetics and alpha-2 agonists. Average fentanyl purity was significantly lower in samples with BTMPS compared to samples without.

ConclusionsThe introduction of an industrial chemical to the illicit drug supply at this speed and scale is unprecedented and concerning. Further research is urgently needed to determine why it is present in the fentanyl supply and characterize effects on human health.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730003

As COVID-19 remains a threat, it is imperative to improve current forecasting approaches by incorporating reliable data and alternative forecasting targets to better inform decision-makers.

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a viable method to track COVID-19 transmission, offering a more reliable metric than reported cases for forecasting critical outcomes like hospitalizations. Recognizing the natural alignment of wastewater systems with city structures, ideal for leveraging WBE data, this study introduces a multi-city, wastewater-based forecasting model to categorically predict COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Using hospitalization and COVID-19 wastewater data for six US cities, accompanied by other epidemiological variables, we develop a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to generate two categorization types. The Hospitalization Capacity Risk Categorization (HCR) predicts the burden on the healthcare system based on the number of available hospital beds in a city. The Hospitalization Rate Trend (HRT) Categorization predicts the trajectory of this burden based on the growth rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Using these categorical thresholds, we create probabilistic forecasts to retrospectively predict the risk and trend category of six cities over a 20-month period for 1, 2, and 3 week forecasting windows.

We also propose a new methodology to measure forecasting model performance at change points, or time periods where sudden changes in outbreak dynamics occurred. We also explore the influence of wastewater as a predictor for hospitalizations, showing its inclusion positively impacts the models performance. With this categorical forecasting study, we are able to predict hospital capacity risk and disease trends in a novel and useful way, giving city decision-makers a new tool to predict COVID-19 hospitalizations.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730003

Previous research has demonstrated that targeting tissue senescence with senolytics can enhance tissue regeneration and repair by selectively eliminating SnCs in specific aged tissues. In this study, we focused on eliminating SnC skin cells in aged mice to assess the effects on subsequent wound healing. We applied ABT-263 directly to the skin of 24-month-old mice over a 5-day period. Following topical ABT-263, aged skin demonstrated decreased gene expression of senescent markers p16 and p21, accompanied by reductions in SA-{beta}-gal and p21-positive cells compared to DMSO controls. However, ABT-263 also triggered a temporary inflammatory response and macrophage infiltration in the skin. Bulk RNA sequencing of ABT-263-treated skin revealed prompt upregulation of genes associated with wound healing pathways, including hemostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, collagen synthesis, and extracellular matrix organization. Aged mice skin pre-treated with topical ABT-263 exhibited accelerated wound closure. In conclusion, topical ABT-263 effectively reduced several senescence markers in aged skin, thereby priming the skin for improved subsequent wound healing. This enhancement may be attributed to ABT-263-induced senolysis which in turn stimulates the expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and wound repair pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1727215730003

Limited research exists on the impact of School Distress on the parents/carers supporting these CYP. Using a case-control, concurrent embedded mixed-method design, we explored this lived experience. 947 parents of CYP with School Distress completed a bespoke online questionnaire, alongside two control parent groups (n=149, n=25) and one professional group (n=19).

Findings revealed a devastating impact on the mental health of parents, with parents displaying significantly heightened daily anxiety and significantly lower mood during, but not before, their childrens school attendance difficulties. In addition, parents with children experiencing School Distress reported significantly more negative emotion states and significantly fewer positive emotion states. Parents also reported overwhelmingly negative treatment from professionals, including being disbelieved or blamed for their childrens difficulties, threatened with fines and court action, and disempowered by the actions of professionals surrounding their child. Significant, deleterious impacts were also evident across all aspects of their lives, including their careers, finances, and other children. Perhaps unsurprisingly, half of these parents reported developing a new mental health condition since their childs difficulties began, with the experience itself rated as the second most threatening potential life event, superseded only by the death of a first-degree relative (including a child or spouse). On the other hand, professionals working with CYP with School Distress did not experience these deleterious mental health or wider life consequences. Despite understanding how threatening the experience is for parents, they were often quick to blame parents for their childrens difficulties. Professionals, like parents, expressed frustration with the lack of help available for these CYP and their families.

This study highlights a bleak, adversarial, and lonely picture for parents of CYP struggling to attend school. More specifically, the findings depict a system rife with parental blame; a system that appears to isolate parents through hostile, threatening, and punitive actions. A wider lack of societal understanding of the experience of School Distress further compounds this dearth of support for parents, placing parental mental health in further peril.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730003

However, recent and heavily disputed debates on data quality have raised questions on the accuracy of demographic data at older ages. Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730003

MethodsThis study included all rheumatology RCTs published from 2009 to 2023. The gender of authors was determined using forenames and countries of affiliation via the gender API service. The percentage of women in RCT publications and its association with potential factors was assessed using generalized estimating equations, considering women gender as the main binary outcome and the RCTs continent, international collaboration status, industrial funding, intervention type, sample size, journal adherence to ICMJE recommendations, impact factor, publication year, authors non-academic affiliation, and author position as covariates.

ResultsAmong the 1,092 RCTs authored by 10,794 persons, women accounted for 34.1% of authors. Woman authorship was more frequent in African-based RCTs compared to North America, when the author had a non-academic affiliation and when the last author was a woman (1.83 [1.46, 2.29], +6.1 percentage points - pp). Woman authorship was less frequent in Asian and European-based RCTs, industry-funded RCTs (OR 0.64 [0.56-0.73]; -10.3pp). Women were less often in the last (0.63 [0.54-0.74]; -10.2 pp) and second to last author position (0.73 [0.62-0.85]; -7.3pp). There were no difference looking at international status or year of publication.

ConclusionThe overall presence of women authors was 34.1%. The stagnant year-over-year representation of women in RCTs, and the lower likelihood of a woman having a position as senior author, underscores the need for more effective strategies to bridge the gender gap. RCTs with a woman last author were more likely to have a woman first author, suggesting a potential role-model effect.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730003

ME diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME patients low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730003

Here, we demonstrate that the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi is capable of reversal from mature lobate to early cydippid when fed following a period of stress. Our findings illuminate central aspects of ctenophore development, ecology, and evolution, and show the high potential of M. leidyi as a new model system to study reverse development and rejuvenation. Besides shedding light on the plasticity of developmental programs, our results raise fundamental questions about early animal development, body plans and life cycles.","NA","biorxiv",1727215730003

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1727215730003

The fossil, known on the basis of two specimens, has been historically assigned to seamoths (Pegasidae), then to oarfish and relatives (Lampriformes). We describe its enigmatic skeletal anatomy in detail, and provide a new genus name. ""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1727215730003

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1727215730003
