For such predictions to be useful, they should be updated when environments change. We investigated how and when new learning shapes hippocampal representations of temporally extended sequences, and how this updating relates to flexible predictions about future events. Human participants learned sequences of environments in immersive virtual reality. They then learned novel environment transitions connecting previously separate sequences. During subsequent fMRI, participants predicted multiple steps into the future in both the newly connected sequence and control sequences that remained separate. The hippocampus integrated representations of the connected sequence, such that activity patterns became more similar across trials for the connected sequence vs. the unconnected sequences. These integrated sequence representations in the hippocampus emerged soon after learning, incorporated representations of the initial sequences as well as new activity patterns not previously present in either sequence, and predicted participants' ability to update their predictions in behavior. Together, these results advance our understanding of how structured knowledge dynamically emerges in service of adaptive behavior.","[{""name"":""National Eye Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wkg3b53"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01EY034436;Zuckerman Institute Seed Grant for MR Studies;CU-ZI-MR-S-0016;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758060475480

Most TMPs follow a conventional secretory pathway confined to the cell soma, where they are translated at the rough ER, exit through ER exit sites (ERES) to reach the Golgi apparatus (GA), prior to their delivery to the plasma membrane (PM). Intriguingly, we recently found that many mRNAs encoding TMPs are associated with the axonally-enriched ER-protein P180, which facilitates axonal ER-ribosome interaction and regulates local translation. Given the absence of the GA in the axon, it remains unknown how locally synthesized TMPs leave the ER and reach the axonal PM. Here, we visualized the translation of different axonal TMPs within the axon and followed their trafficking from the ER. We found that a fraction of neosynthesized cargos follow an unconventional route, exiting the axonal ER and reaching the PM independent of the GA. Notably, we identified axonal ERES components tightly associated with the axonal ER. Removal of these components prevents TMP exit from the axonal ER, while addition of external cues increases the number of axonal ERES and Golgi-bypassing cargos. Moreover, we identified the ER-translation regulator HDLBP and the NRZ-SEC22B vesicular tether complex associated with axonal ERES and involved in unconventional secretion. Local removal of axonal ERES components or depletion of these identified players causes defects in axon growth and bouton assembly. We propose a novel mechanism coupling local TMP translation and secretion to the PM at the axonal ER, which is essential for neuronal development.

We replicated a localized, load-dependent increase in univariate BOLD activity in parietal cortex. However, we also observed both systematic increases and decreases in univariate activity with load across the visual hierarchy. Importantly, multivariate activation patterns encoded WM load regardless of the direction of the univariate effect, arguing against a restricted locus of load signals in parietal cortex.

Primary sensory cortices receive topographically segregated information from first-order thalamic nuclei, which process distinct sensory modalities. In contrast, higher-order cortical regions integrate information from multiple information channels. While such hierarchical processing and integration of information is the foundation for neural computations in the mammalian cortex, the fundamental principles of thalamocortical computations in non-mammalian vertebrates remains unexplored. The zebrafish pallium, located in the dorsal telencephalon, is regarded as the homolog of the mammalian cortex. However, it remains unclear how the zebrafish pallium receives and processes sensory information, and how the architecture and function of these processes compare to the thalamocortical circuits in other vertebrates. Using anatomical tracing, electrophysiological circuit mapping, and in vivo Ca2+ imaging, we revealed a thalamocortical-like pathway in the zebrafish brain. We found that the preglomerular nucleus (PG) is the primary source of visual and mechano-vibrational information to the zebrafish pallium. We demonstrated that PG neurons and their pallial projections exhibit sensory-specific and topographically organized responses. In contrast, the sensory responses of pallial neurons display multiple layers of topographically organized hierarchies, ranging from simple sensory-specific responses to multimodal and coincidence-detecting nonlinear responses. Notably, we observed a progressive increase in the complexity of sensory computations, which is organized topographically along the posterior-anterior axis of the zebrafish pallium. Collectively, our results suggest that hierarchical sensory processing across topographically organized pallial regions is a conserved functional feature of the vertebrate pallium.","[{""name"":""JSPS KAKENHI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JP24K02008;""},{""name"":""European Horizon Marie-Curie individual postdoctoral fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101066743;""},{""name"":""NFR FRIPRO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""239973;314212;""},{""name"":""RCN Centres of Excellence scheme"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""332640;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758060475480

YprA family helicases are central to widespread defense systems DISARM, Dpd, and Druantia. Here, through comprehensive phylogenetic and structural prediction analysis of the YprA family, we identify several major, previously unrecognized clades, with unique signatures of domain architecture and associations with other genes. Each YprA family clade defines a distinct class of defense systems, which we denote ARMADA (disARM-related Antiviral Defense Array), BRIGADE (Base hypermodification and Restriction Involving Genes encoding ARMADA-like and Dpd-like Effectors), or TALON (TOTE-like and ARMADA-Like Operon with Nuclease). In addition to the YprA-like helicase, ARMADA systems share two more proteins with DISARM. However, ARMADA YprA homologs are most similar to those of Druantia, suggesting ARMADA is a missing link connecting DISARM and Druantia. We show experimentally that ARMADA protects bacteria against a broad range of phages via a direct, non-abortive mechanism. We also discovered multiple families of satellite phage-like mobile genetic elements that often carry both ARMADA and Druantia Type III systems and show that these can provide synergistic resistance against diverse phages.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758060475480

This study identified over 421 million single-nucleotide variants and indels, as well as more than 600 million copy-number and structural variants. Small variants had 756 million molecular effects annotated. Of 7.7 million polymorphic variants having an allele frequency (AF) of more than 5% in EGP, 1,348 have a predicted deleterious effect on a protein. Characterization with respect to global variation shows that EGP represents a genetic continuum encompassing the range of African, Asian, and European populations. It is best described by two components: Arabian, Eurasian, and African, with the predominant Arabian component linked to mitochondrial haplogroups J and T, which are commonly attributed to the Middle East. Various aneuploidies of sex chromosomes were detected in 93 individuals overall, and specifically, aneuploidy of chromosome 21 was identified in 41 individuals. The median inbreeding coefficient and cumulative runs of homozygosity (ROHs) lengths were increased due to extensive consanguinity, were largest in the groups with Arabian main ancestry components, and were higher than those reported for Qatar. Families were identified based on genetic relatedness and classified into 264 families with unrelated parents and 247 families with third- and fourth-degree consanguineous parents. Representative consanguineous pedigrees of families in EGP were outlined. Cumulative ROHs were affected by the main ancestry component and significantly increased in offspring of consanguineous parents, with a pronounced difference between 3rd and 4th-degree relatedness. Investigation of cumulative AFs of variants causing Mendelian diseases highlighted genes related to alpha- and beta-thalassemia (HBB, HBA2) and revealed a high burden of variants associated with severe recessive diseases, metabolic and retinal disorders, and hearing loss. In summary, EGP represents a landmark effort in characterizing the genetic diversity of the Emirati population, leveraging the largest Middle Eastern cohort reported to date.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758060475480

Using CRISPR-Cas9 components delivered as RNA, we knocked out GABA-A receptor {beta} subunits in individual layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mouse visual cortex, eliminating fast inhibition. In vivo patch-clamp recordings revealed that cortical neurons adapted to inhibition loss through two sequential mechanisms: a transient reduction of excitatory synaptic input, followed by intrinsic membrane property changes that decreased input resistance. This sequential adaptation program ultimately prevented target neurons from contributing spikes to the cortical network.

This study investigates the transcriptional effects of music exposure in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using this non-invasive approach. To address saliva-specific limitations, we employed two complementary library preparation methods, Poly-A selection and Human-Enriched protocols, allowing us to maximize human transcript detection and ensure reproducibility. By merging them, we ensured reproducibility and captured both host and microbial signals. While each dataset individually revealed a limited number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), their integration enhanced biological resolution. Among the consistently modulated genes were HERC6, TSPAN5, and REM2, pointing to music-induced transcriptional changes relevant to neurodevelopmental and immune processes. Functional enrichment analyses highlighted pathways involved in immune regulation, oxidative phosphorylation, and epithelial differentiation. These findings align with evidence of immune dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered cellular communication in ASD. Importantly, co-expression network analysis identified modules significantly correlated with music exposure. Notably, the AKNA module, previously associated with ASD risk, was downregulated and enriched for Ras-related GTPase signaling and immune pathways, suggesting that music may modulate intracellular signaling and inflammation. Conversely, upregulation of the UBE2D3 module pointed to activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress response mechanisms, a known contributor to ASD neurodevelopmental deficits. These results suggest that music engages specific stress-adaptive and immunomodulatory networks in buccal cells, potentially reflecting systemic effects. Our exploratory metagenomic analysis highlights 15 microbial species with consistent abundance shifts across both methods. Notably, Acidipropionibacterium acidipropionici and Propionibacterium freudenreichii, associated with propionic acid production, emerged as music-responsive taxa. Elevated propionic acid has been implicated in ASD-like behaviors and neuroinflammation, suggesting a microbiota-mediated pathway. Music may influence both host gene expression and oral microbiota, potentially affecting neuroimmune processes via the microbiota-brain axis. Although exploratory, the results support the feasibility of using saliva for integrated molecular profiling in ASD.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758060475481

This kind of functional plasticity gives rise to habituation to pharmacological interventions (resulting in loss of efficacy over time), sensitization (resulting in unacceptable side effects after repeated use), or canalizing of undesired dynamics that recur even when the original problem has been resolved (persistent disease states). Our in silico analyses reveal that memories formed in gene regulatory networks can be erased by specific further experiences without any changes of network topology (leaving the connectivity in place). We present a method for discovery of stimuli that can be used to selectively delete physiological memories, which can be used to remove unwanted behaviors in biomedical and bioengineering contexts without gene therapy or genomic editing. Remarkably, not only are the training-induced gains in causal emergence not lost after stimuli that wipe memories, but we also find a positive relationship between the causal emergence and learning ability of a network, suggesting a deep asymmetry (ratchet) in the relationship between learning/forgetting and integration of collective intelligence which may have implications for evolution.","[{""name"":""John Templeton Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/035tnyy05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Templeton World Charity Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00x0z1472"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Astonishing Labs"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758060475481

Here, we custom-design fluorescent protein-based ticker tapes (FPTT) for multiplexed and longitudinal recording of physiological activities in single cells. FPTT integrates multi-spectral monomeric fluorescent proteins with self-assembling protein fibers, enabling massively parallel analysis of signaling dynamics under varying cellular conditions. Using FPTT, we were able to log dose-dependent and reversible transcriptional histories of endogenous cFos signaling in primary hippocampus neurons at a 3-hour temporal resolution via biological timestamps and an extended recording time of over 8 days. Furthermore, we expanded the imaging toolset by engineering genetically encoded FPTT variants for human NF{kappa}B, JAK/STAT3, mTOR, NFAT and cAMP signaling, allowing for the quantification of potential crosstalk between cFos and NF{kappa}B pathways in neurons, multiplexed recording of STAT3- and cAMP-specific promoters during drug-induced liver injury in mice, as well as simultaneous analysis of up to four major signaling pathways involved in experimental T-cell activation. This platform advances single-cell analysis by providing a versatile tool to investigate transcriptional histories and signaling interplay across diverse biological contexts, with broad applications in developmental biology and disease modeling.","[{""name"":""National Natural Science Foundation of China"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h0zpd94"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""32050410298;32171093;W2432024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758060475481

Using electrophysiological recordings of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) located in a target region of the primary visual cortex, we identified striatal modules that process basic visual features. SPNs from the direct and indirect pathways exhibited high orientation selectivity in the absence of behavioral contingencies. SPNs population activity reliably predicted different visual features. Pathway-specific silencing of SPNs revealed that high orientation selectivity depends on intra-striatal connectivity. Thus, specialized striatal modules are active participants in visual feature extraction.

We find that these mutations generate subpopulations of bacteria with reduced capsule expression and mucoidy. In vitro and in vivo infection models reveal that phase variation to the OFF state facilitates epithelial cell infection while ON switching enhances resistance to the bactericidal activity of human serum and systemic spread to the liver and spleen in a murine infection model. Genomic analysis reveals that the phase variation mechanism is a conserved feature of all HVKp and that additional novel DNA repeats in rmpD and rmpC drive different combinations of capsule mucoidy and hyperexpression phenotypes. These findings establish a mechanistic basis for how HVKp occupy such a diverse array of niches during infection, with important implications for the design and implementation of Kp-specific vaccines and therapies.","[{""name"":""The Anthony Mellow's Charitable Settlement"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Fellowship awarded to J.J.W.;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""320977/Z/24/Z;225315/Z/22/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758060475481

The alternative archaeal system comprises Cdv proteins and is thought to bear some resemblance to ESCRT-III-based membrane remodelling in other domains of life, including eukaryotes, especially during abscission. Here we present biochemical, crystallographic and cryo-EM studies of the Sulfolobus Cdv machinery. CdvA, an early non-ESCRT component, adopts a PRC-domain/coiled-coil fold and polymerises into long double-stranded helical filaments, mainly via hydrophobic interfaces. Monomeric CdvB adopts the canonical ESCRT-III fold in both a closed and a distinct ""semi-open"" conformation. Soluble CdvB2 filaments are composed of subunits in the closed state, appearing to transition to the open, active state only when polymerised on membranes. Short N-terminal amphipathic helices in all CdvB paralogues, B, B1 and B2, mediate membrane binding and are required for liposome recruitment in vitro. We provide a molecular overview of archaeal ESCRT-III-based cytokinesis machinery, the definitive demonstration that CdvB proteins are bona fide ESCRT-III homologues and we reveal the molecular basis for membrane engagement. Thus, we illuminate conserved principles of ESCRT-mediated membrane remodelling and extend them to an anciently diverged archaeal lineage.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U105184326;""},{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001aqnf71"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MC_UP_1201/27;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""227876/Z/23/Z;203276/Z/16/Z;222460/Z/21/Z;""},{""name"":""Volkswagen Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03bsmfz84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""94933;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CIBSS ‚Äì EXC-2189 ‚Äì Project ID 390939984;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758060475481

Here, we show that MAP65-1/PRC1 promotes microtubule nucleation on pre-existing lattices in vitro, particularly on microtubules with lattice defects and damage sites associated with mechanical stress. MAP65-1 preferentially binds bent microtubules both in vitro and in cells, likely because bending induces lattice damage, enhancing nucleation on and bundling of these microtubules in vitro. This creates a potential feedback loop where mechanical stress promotes MAP65-1 binding, which in turn stabilizes microtubules by nucleation and bundling and reinforces the alignment of the array with mechanical stress. Thus, we reveal a previously unknown role for MAP65/PRC1 proteins in lattice-based nucleation and suggest a mechanism by which cells record and respond to mechanical stress through microtubule reorganization.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""545084341;SFB 1027;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101019515;101115795;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758060475481

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mating-type switching is a central feature of the life cycle that enables homothallism, i.e., mating between mitotic descendants of the same haploid cell. Yet heterothallic isolates that have lost this ability are found across diverse niches, indicating that this trait is polymorphic. Here we experimentally characterized loss of mating-type switching in a representative panel of strains. Analysis of 117 telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies revealed multiple independent loss-of-function mutations in the Ho endonuclease gene and structural variants in the silent HML and HMR cassettes, the three loci essential for switching. We estimated that at least 13 independent transitions from homothallism to heterothallism have occurred in the species history. Analysis of the HO genotype of 2,915 strains show that at least 27% are heterothallic. We found that heterothallism is strongly associated with polyploidy and elevated genome-wide heterozygosity, although the strength of these associations varies between populations. Heterothallic isolates are most prevalent in domesticated and clinical clades, consistent with an origin linked to human-associated environments. However, they are also found, though less frequently, in natural niches. Signatures of recombination in HO sequences suggest that outcrossing contributed to the ecological and geographical distribution of the trait. Our findings reveal that mating-type switching has undergone repeated losses in S. cerevisiae evolution, with major consequences for genome architecture and ecological diversification.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE12-0020;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758060475481

The anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (ADn) contains a high density of head direction (HD) cells that process sensorimotor inputs for subsequent synaptic integration in postsynaptic cortical areas. We tested the hypothesis that individual HD cells show differences in their firing patterns and connectivity by recording and juxtacellularly labeling single HD cells in subregions of the ADn in awake mice during passive rotation. We identified HD cells that exhibited different response profiles to light, sound, and movement. We also identified a mediolateral gradient of calretinin-expressing (CR+) ADn cells, with CR+ HD cells having narrower tuning widths, lower maximal firing rates, and different intrinsic properties compared to CR- cells. Axons of labeled HD cells could be followed to the retrosplenial cortex, with collaterals innervating the thalamic reticular nucleus (type I cells); others additionally innervated the dorsomedial striatum (type II cells). Most medial CR+ cells preferentially projected to ventral retrohippocampal regions. Surprisingly, we also identified a subpopulation of medial CR+ cells with twisted dendrites and descending axons that avoided the thalamic reticular nucleus, termed tortuosa HD cells (type III cells).

These CA subtypes are mechanistically uncoupled, exhibiting distinct spatial distributions, age-dependent dynamics, and associations with histological tumour grade, hormone receptor status, genomic alterations, and nodal involvement. Discordant CA profiles at tumour margins are linked to local aggressiveness and stromal remodelling, underscoring their clinical relevance. To support broad adoption and reproducibility, CenSegNet is released as an open-source Python library.

Reaggregated early gastrula cells (here called gastruloids) of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis are able to regenerate with only little delay whole organisms that are virtually indistinguishable from normal developing polyps. However, the molecular control underlying the restoration of body axis and germ layers remains largely unknown. To address this, we established a standardized protocol, which reproducibly generates gastruloids developing into polys with a single body axis. Here, we show that committed mesodermal and endodermal cells are sorted out to the surface of the aggregate, where mesodermal cells form clusters of about 30 cells. At a critical time point, one mesodermal cluster immigrates, along with peripherally attached endodermal cells. Thereby, the inner germ layer and the oral-aboral axis is established in one and the same process. Functional studies demonstrated that this polarization of the endodermal cells requires a feedback loop of Notch and Wnt signaling. The dissociation of the early embryo disrupts Notch signaling in the endodermal cells, which leads to transient adoption of an endomesodermal profile, marked by the expression of the mesodermal cadherin1 until the boundaries between the germ layer identities are re-established. Our results highlight distinct morphogenetic behaviors of mesodermal and endodermal cells and the hitherto unknown role of Notch signaling in germ layer boundary formation in self-organizing gastruloids. Conservation of Notch-mediated boundary formation between endoderm and mesoderm mirrors bilaterian mechanisms, demonstrating how adoption of ancestral regulatory networks governing morphogenesis likely enabled the diversification of metazoan body plans.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P34404;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758060475481

Here we propose to replace interstitial material by air to enhance X-ray phase contrast of the ultrastructural features. We used critical point drying (CPD) of heavy metal-stained mouse brain tissue to produce mechanically stable samples with preserved ultrastructure and enhanced refractive index boundaries, a nanofoam-like material that remains compatible with follow-up conventional resin embedding. Using two complementary synchrotron-based setups, a high-throughput microtomography beamline (P14, DESY) and a nanoscale holographic tomography beamline (ID16A, ESRF), we found that CPD samples consistently showed 2-4x stronger phase-shift signal than conventional resin-embedded tissue. The contrast gain remained consistent across samples, imaging conditions, and beamlines. Our results suggest that CPD offers a versatile route for preparing tissue for subcellular and ultrastructural-resolution X-ray imaging. It retains structural detail while improving signal, and is compatible with other processing procedures like femtosecond laser milling or electron microscopy, paving the path for biological tissue imaging beyond the mm3 scale.","[{""name"":""Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01js2sh04"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""XIMG-13;""},{""name"":""European Synchrotron Radiation Facility"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02550n020"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS3231;IHMA106;""},{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC2036;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC2036;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC2036;110174/Z/15/Z;EP/W024292/1;""},{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/W024292/1;EP/V007661/1;""},{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101094250;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""852455;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758060475481

However, it remains unclear whether this is intrinsically mediated or driven by age-related changes in neighboring cells. Here, we describe a scalable, genetically modifiable system for in vivo heterochronic myeloid cell replacement. We find reconstituted myeloid cells adopt region-specific transcriptional, morphological and tiling profiles characteristic of resident microglia. Young donor cells in aged brains rapidly acquired aging phenotypes, particularly in the cerebellum, while old cells in young brains adopted youthful profiles. We identified STAT1-mediated signaling as one axis controlling microglia aging, as STAT1-loss prevented aging trajectories in reconstituted cells. Spatial transcriptomics combined with cell ablation models identified rare natural killer cells as necessary drivers of interferon signaling in aged microglia. These findings establish the local environment, rather than cell-autonomous programming, as a primary driver of microglia aging phenotypes.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Cure Alzheimer‚Äôs Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758060475481

Yet the molecular basis underlying niche-specific colonization remains poorly defined. To address this, we conducted a time-resolved dual RNA-seq experiment to simultaneously monitor the transcriptional co-adaptations of human commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and human gut epithelial cells in an anaerobe-epithelium co-culture system. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of mucus-associated versus supernatant Bacteroides populations unveiled small RNAs (sRNAs) that are differentially regulated between spatially segregated subpopulations. Among these, we identified IroR as a key sRNA that facilitates B. thetaiotaomicron adaptation to the mucus-rich, iron-limiting niche, partly by modulating expression of bacterial capsule genes. This work provides new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of gut colonization and underscores a previously underappreciated role for bacterial sRNAs in shaping mutualistic interactions between the human microbiota and the gut epithelium.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758060475481

Here we introduce EXPAND (EXplainable Pathologist Aligned Nuclear Discriminator), the first pathologist-interpretable AI model to predict breast cancer tumor subtypes and patient survival. EXPAND focuses on a core set of 12 nuclear pathologist-interpretable features (NPIFs), composing the Nottingham grading criteria used by the pathologists. It is a fully automated, end-to-end diagnostic workflow, which automatically extracts NPIFs given a patient tumor slide and uses them to predict tumor subtype and survival. EXPANDs performance is comparable to that of existing deep learning non-interpretable black box AI models. It achieves areas under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.73, 0.79 and 0.75 for predicting HER2+, HR+ and TNBC tumor subtypes, respectively, matching the performance of proprietary models that rely on substantially larger and more complex interpretable feature sets. The 12 NPIFs demonstrate strong and independent prognostic value for patient survival, underscoring their potential as biologically grounded, interpretable biomarkers for survival stratification in BC. These results lay the basis for building interpretable AI diagnostic models in other cancer indications. The complete end-to-end pipeline is made publicly available via GitHub (https://github.com/ruppinlab/EXPAND) to support community use and reproducibility.","[{""name"":""Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758060475481

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.
