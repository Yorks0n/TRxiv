This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1744409337870

Biophysical models are governed by biologically meaningful parameters, many of which can be experimentally measured. Some parameters are unknown, and optimizing their values can dramatically improve adherence to experimental data, significantly enhancing biological plausibility. Previous optimization methods - such as exhaustive search, gradient descent, evolutionary strategies and Bayesian optimization - require repeated, computationally expensive numerical integration of biophysical differential equations, limiting scalability to population-level datasets. Here, we introduce DELSSOME (DEep Learning for Surrogate Statistics Optimization in MEan field modeling), a framework that bypasses numerical integration by directly predicting whether model parameters produce realistic brain dynamics. When applied to the widely used feedback inhibition control (FIC) mean field model, DELSSOME achieves a 2000x speedup over Euler integration. By embedding DELSSOME within an evolutionary optimization strategy, trained models generalize to new datasets without additional tuning, enabling a 50x speedup in FIC model estimation while preserving neurobiological insights. The massive acceleration facilitates large-scale mechanistic modeling in population-level neuroscience, unlocking new opportunities for understanding brain function.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

RNU4-2 is a non-protein-coding gene that is transcribed into the U4 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of the major spliceosome. ReNU syndrome variants disrupt spliceosome function and alter 5' splice site selection. Here, we performed saturation genome editing (SGE) of RNU4-2 to identify the functional and clinical impact of variants across the entire gene. The resulting SGE function scores, derived from variants' effects on cell fitness, discriminate ReNU syndrome variants from those observed in the population and dramatically outperform in silico variant effect prediction. Using these data, we redefine the ReNU syndrome critical region at single nucleotide resolution, resolve variant pathogenicity for variants of uncertain significance, and show that SGE function scores delineate variants by phenotypic severity. Further, we identify variants impacting function in regions of RNU4-2 that are critical for interactions with other spliceosome components. We show that these variants cause a novel recessive NDD that is clinically distinct from ReNU syndrome. Together, this work defines the landscape of variant function across RNU4-2, providing critical insights for both diagnosis and therapeutic development.","NA","medrxiv",1744409337870

Highly active enzymes have been designed starting from such descriptions using the generative AI method RFdiffusion, but there are two current methodological limitations. First, the geometry of the active site can only be specified at the residue level, so for each catalytic residue functional group placed around the reaction transition state, the possible locations of the residue backbone must be enumerated by building side chain rotamers back from the functional group. Second, the location of the catalytic residues along the sequence must be specified in advance, which considerably limits the space of solutions which can be sampled. Here we describe a new deep generative method, RoseTTAFold diffusion 2 (RFdiffusion2), that solves both problems, enabling enzymes to be designed from sequence agnostic descriptions of functional group locations without inverse rotamer generation. We first evaluate RFdiffusion2 on an in silico enzyme design benchmark of 41 diverse active sites and find that it is able to successfully build proteins scaffolding all 41 sites, compared to 16/41 with prior state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Next, we design enzymes around three diverse catalytic sites and characterize the designs experimentally; in each case we identify active catalysts in testing less than 96 sequences. RFdiffusion2 demonstrates the potential of atomic resolution generative models for the design of de novo enzymes directly from their reaction mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

Early cases were associated with this market, and environmental sequencing placed the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity within the market. Phylogenetic analysis also suggested separate introductions of lineages A and B into the human population, a finding that can be tested with additional data. Here, we curated an expanded sequence dataset of early SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes, including newly available sequences from mid-January 2020. In this dataset, we found no additional support for previously proposed alternative progenitor sequences, or for any evolutionary intermediates between lineages A and B in the human population. Instead, we identified SARS-CoV-2 lineages that may have spread from the market, and additional samples of a sublineage of lineage A with three mutations, including one found in closely related bat coronaviruses. Although our analysis of early pandemic genomes suggests that this mutation is unlikely to characterize the immediate SARS-CoV-2 ancestor, it is more plausible than two previously proposed ancestral genomes. These findings reinforce the proposed emergence of SARS-CoV-2 from the wildlife trade at the Huanan market, demonstrating how new data continues to both solidify and clarify our understanding of how the pandemic began.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

However, these powerful algorithms present an intriguing paradox regarding image resolution: contrary to intuition, lower-resolution images can yield superior performance for specific image analysis carried out by deep learning. This phenomenon is particularly significant in microscopy imaging, where high-resolution acquisitions come with substantial costs in throughput, data storage requirements, and potential photodamage to specimens. Through systematic experimentation, we evaluate how varying image resolution impacts deep learning performance in cellular image segmentation tasks. We trained popular architectures on datasets downsampled to 6-50% of their original resolution, mimicking acquisitions at lower image magnification, and compared their performance against models trained on native-resolution images. Our results show that segmentation accuracy either improves (by up to 25% of mean Intersection over Union (IoU)) or experiences only minimal degradation (<5% of mean IoU) when using images downsampled by up to a factor of 4 (25% of the original resolution). This downsampling proportionally increases information throughput while reducing data storage requirements and inference time. With these findings, we contribute systematic guidelines to deep learning practitioners in creating efficient experimental pipelines for image-driven discoveries. This approach improves the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of bioimaging studies by reducing data and computing needs while optimising microscopy techniques.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

This effect size grew over the course of the experiment (~10 minutes), consistent with learning effects. A biologically plausible recurrent neural network model showed that learning and oddball representation are an emergent property of flexible tone discrimination. Last, when we played language stimuli, single units and ensembles carried information about the semantic and grammatical features of natural speech, even predicting semantic information about upcoming words.

This is because it is especially useful for incorporating fossil data into such analyses, integrating fossils along with their age information directly into the tree as tips or sampled ancestors. Two approaches are common for placing fossil taxa in trees: inference based on morphological character data or using taxonomic constraints to control their topological placement. These approaches have historically been treated as alternatives, though combining the two is theoretically possible. For phylogenetic inference of entirely extinct organisms, additional related fossil taxa other than those for which morphology is available are generally overlooked. Here, we implement a combined approach on an empirical dataset for a group of trilobites. We use a morphological matrix and ages for 56 taxa and age information for another 196 taxa from the Paleobiology Database. To evaluate the effects of a combined approach, we conducted FBD dated phylogenetic analyses using a combined approach with morphology and taxonomic constraints and compared them to analyses of taxa with morphology alone. We find that a combined approach yields topologies that are more stratigraphically congruent, substantially more precise parameter estimates (e.g., divergence times), and more informative tree distributions. These findings are a consequence of the substantial increase in stratigraphic age information and a more representative sample of their temporal distributions.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

The Movile Cave, isolated from external influences 5.5 million years, offers a unique opportunity to explore microbial evolution under prolonged environmental stability. Here, we analyzed metagenome-assembled genomes from this cave, revealing that prokaryotes exhibit lower gene diversity and higher levels of pseudogenization compared to those from non-isolated environments, mainly affecting housekeeping functions involved in translation. Functional redundancy across genomes remained comparable to related habitats. Our results suggest that pseudogenization may serve as a fine-tuning mechanism to reduce excess redundancy. Although horizontal gene transfer is limited overall, the cave virome seems to contribute to microbial adaptation through the transfer of auxiliary metabolic genes. Movile microorganisms harbor fewer phage-defense systems than counterparts in related environments, suggesting a long-term adaptation to a relatively stable virosphere. Our findings indicate that prolonged isolation under stable selective pressures does not necessarily lead to major genomic divergence, but rather promotes adaptive gene loss.

Disrupting this interaction or binding an activating SLiM dislocates the TPR shoulder, freeing the motor domains and promoting transition between its closed, inactive, and open states.

He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

Translation is often modulated at the initiation stage by RNA binding proteins through either promotion or repression of ribosome recruitment to the mRNA. However, it largely remains unknown how the kinetics of mRNA ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) assembly on untranslated regions (UTRs) relates to its translation regulation activity. Using Sex-lethal (Sxl)-mediated translation repression of msl-2 in female fly dosage compensation as a model system, we show that different mechanisms in mRNP assembly synergistically achieve tight translation repression. Using multi-color single-molecule fluorescence microscopy we show that 1) Sxl targets its binding sites via sliding and double-binding, 2) that Unr recruitment is accelerated over 500-fold by RNA-bound Sxl and 3) that Hrp48 further stabilizes RNA-bound Sxl indirectly via ATP-independent RNA remodeling. Overall, we provide a framework to study how multiple RBPs dynamically cooperate with RNA to achieve function.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

A hallmark of the co-translational folding (coTF) of many proteins are highly stable folding intermediates that are absent or only transiently populated off the ribosome, yet persist during translation well-beyond complete emergence of the domain from the ribosome exit tunnel. Intermediates are important for folding fidelity; however, their structures have remained elusive. Here, we have structurally characterised two coTF intermediates of an immunoglobulin-like domain by developing comprehensive 19F NMR analyses using chemical shifts, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), and protein engineering. We integrated these experimental data with extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to obtain atomistic structures of the folding intermediates on the ribosome. The resulting structures are distinguished by native-like folds initiated from either their N- or C-termini, and reveal multiple parallel folding pathways, which are structurally conserved within the protein domain family, in contrast to their in vitro refolding mechanisms. By redirecting proteins to fold along hierarchical, parallel routes, the ribosome may promote efficient folding by avoiding kinetic traps, and regulate nascent chain assembly and targeting by auxiliary factors to maintain cellular proteostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

These breaks are scheduled to maintain tolerably high levels of tumor burden, employing competitive suppression of treatment-resistant sub-populations by treatment-sensitive sub-populations. AT has been integrated into several ongoing or planned clinical trials, including treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and BRAF-mutant melanoma, with initial clinical results suggesting that it can offer significant extensions in the time to progression over the standard of care.

However, these clinical protocols may be sub-optimal, as they fail to account for variation in tumor dynamics between patients, and result in significant heterogeneity in patient outcomes. Mathematical modeling and analysis have been proposed to optimize adaptive protocols, but they do not account for clinical restrictions, most notably the discrete time intervals between the clinical appointments where a patients tumor burden is measured and their treatment schedule is re-evaluated. We present a general framework for deriving optimal treatment protocols which account for these discrete time intervals, and derive optimal schedules for a number of models to avoid model-specific personalization. We identify a trade-off between the frequency of patient monitoring and the time to progression attainable, and propose an AT protocol based on a single treatment threshold. Finally, we identify a subset of patients with qualitatively different dynamics that instead require a novel AT protocol based on a threshold that changes over the course of treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1744409337870

There has been increasing evidence for post-transcriptional control of SPI gene expression by Hfq-dependent small RNAs (sRNAs) such as PinT. This 80-nucleotide sRNA is highly expressed after Salmonella enters host cells and modulates the transition from the SPI-1 to SPI-2 program by targeting different virulence factor mRNAs. It has been elusive, however, how PinT activity could be counteracted when virulence gene suppression were to be relieved. To identify putative inhibitors of PinT, we have mapped the RNA interactome of Salmonella recovered from infected macrophages, using an optimized version of the RIL-seq method. Next to offering an unprecedented view of Hfq-mediated RNA interactions during Salmonellas intracellular infection stage, RIL-seq uncovered the 3 end-derived sRNA InvS as a direct negative regulator of PinT. Biochemical and genetic experiments suggest a decoy mechanism whereby InvS lifts the PinT-mediated repression of virulence factors. Additionally, InvS acts as an mRNA repressor of the host cell adhesion protein, MipA, and PinT interaction with InvS relieves mipA repression. Together, our work identifies a unique pair of antagonistic sRNAs in a growing post-transcriptional network of virulence gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

Here, we used single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate the developmental trajectories of Nestin-expressing progenitors (NEPs) in the neonatal mouse cerebellum. We identified FOXO1 as a key regulator of NEP-to-inhibitory neuron differentiation, acting directly downstream of ASCL1. Genome occupancy and functional experiments using primary NEPs showed that both ASCL1 and FOXO1 regulate neurogenesis genes during differentiation while independently regulating proliferation and survival, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated that WNT signalling promotes the transition from an ASCL1+ to a FOXO1+ cellular state. Finally, we showed that the role of WNT signalling in promoting neuron production via FOXO1 is conserved in primary human NEPs. By resolving how cerebellar interneurons differentiate, our findings could have implications for cerebellar disorders such as spinocerebellar ataxia, where cerebellar interneurons are overproduced.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

While many existing studies have primarily focused on omics data, they often fail to integrate clinical heterogeneity, which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of disease biology. Although significant progress has been made in researching crosstalks between inter-pathways and inter-cells, and tools like CellChat have emerged to analyze these interactions, they have notable limitations. These include the assumption that mRNA expression directly reflects protein activity, a heavy reliance on pre-established ligand-receptor interactions, and an inability to connect ""chats"" with clinical phenotypes. Furthermore, existing methods have limitations in distinguishing between paracrine signaling (interactions between different cell types) and autocrine signaling (self-signaling within the same cell type). These limitations hinder the ability to translate molecular insights into phenotypic outcomes, thereby limiting clinical applicability. To provide another solution for these challenges, we introduce RNAchat, a novel approach that utilizes machine learning techniques to identify metapathways for crosstalks among pathways at not only the bulk level but also cell types at the single-cell level, incorporating both clinical and multi-omics data. Results: RNAchat provides another solution by providing an interactive, reproducible platform designed to analyse metapathways between inter-pathways and inter-cell types using multi-omics level data in a clinical context. This tool enables researchers to integrate diverse datasets, conduct exploratory analyses, and identify cooperated pathways. The platform facilitates hypothesis generation and produces intuitive visualizations to support further investigation. As a proof of concept, we applied RNAchat to connect omics data to pain, drug resistance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), disease severity to RA and Heart Failure (HF). We discovered cooperated molecular pathways associated with different treatments using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) values. Then, we demonstrated how to use it to find cellular interactions at single cell level. Last but not the least, we further extended crosstalk exploration between host and parasites and found potential novel important pathways interaction not mentioned by previous studies. Conclusion: We introduce RNAchat, a computational platform designed to identify pathway communications with clinical and multi-omics data in real-time. This tool supports both user-generated and publicly available datasets, offering a robust solution and enhancing our understanding of complex diseases such as RA and HF.

We show that RAG-ESM models outperform larger ESM2 models for masked amino acid prediction. We find that sequence alignment capabilities spontaneously emerge in specific cross-attention heads of RAG-ESM. By using a discrete diffusion objective for training, and by conditioning on homologs during inference, RAG-ESM reaches state-of-the-art performance for conditional protein sequence generation and motif scaffolding, among sequence-based models. Our method thus possesses strong potential for scalable, efficient and controlled protein engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

Here, we implemented a multi-institutional collaborative approach to define the robust and replicable effects of the psychedelic drug psilocybin on mouse behavior. Five laboratories performed the same experiments to test the acute and persistent effects of psilocybin (2 mg/kg, IP) on various behaviors that psychedelics have been proposed to affect, including anxiety-related approach-avoidance, exploration, sociability, depression-related behaviors, fear extinction, and social reward learning. Through this coordinated approach, we found that psilocybin had several robust and replicable acute effects on mouse behavior, including increased anxiety- and avoidance-related behaviors and decreased fear expression. Surprisingly, however, we found that psilocybin did not have replicable effects 24 hours post psilocybin administration on reducing anxiety- and depression-like behaviors or facilitating fear extinction learning. Additionally, we were unable to observe psilocybin-induced alterations in social preference or social reward learning. Overall, our comprehensive characterization of psilocybins acute and persistent behavioral effects using [~]200 total male and female mice per experiment spread across five independent labs demonstrates with unique certainty several acute drug effects and suggests that psilocybins persistent effects in mice may be more modest and inconsistent than previously suggested.

To achieve such cognitive flexibility, the brain is wired by plastic synapses that are hotspots of energy consumption. Supplying energy to distant synapses is challenging as they are distributed throughout dendrites and axons, spanning hundreds of microns from their cell body. Synapses, therefore, require an instant and local energy supply provided by mitochondria stabilized near dendritic spines. However, the mechanisms by which synapses communicate their energy demands to locally stable mitochondria to drive local energy production and sustain synaptic plasticity is unknown. Using highly sensitive spine- and mitochondrial ATP reporters and two-photon glutamate uncaging to stimulate individual spines, we find that synaptic plasticity input drives instant and sustained increase in spine ATP levels, provided by local ATP synthesis in ~10-20 m spatially confined compartments within mitochondria. This spatially localized mitochondrial ATP generation is driven by a spatially localized mitochondrial calcium influx independent of the endoplasmic reticulum. Notably, the initial spine ATP increase, supported by local mitochondrial ATP synthesis, is independent of CaMKII and the energy demands of spine structural plasticity. Without local calcium signaling and mitochondrial stabilization, synapses do not meet their instant and sustained energy needs, resulting in synaptic plasticity defects, as observed in neurological disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

Depending on cell state, cell type, and cell fate, a cell's mitochondrial phenotype might range from relatively isolated mitochondrial segments to complex branching networks, and from stationary mitochondria to highly motile structures. While isolated mitochondrial phenotypes have been described for a subset of cell states, types, and fates, an integrated map of how mitochondrial phenotypes change over the full course of tissue development has so far been lacking. Here, we identify the mitochondrial phenotypes that appear throughout the course of lung and intestinal epithelial development from stem cells to differentiated tissue. Using human stem cell-derived intestinal and branching lung organoids that mimic developing human organs as model systems, we extract and analyze key mitochondrial biophysical phenotypes in human development. To achieve this, we employ lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM), which enables high-resolution, 4D (x, y, z, time) imaging of mitochondria in organoid tissues with minimal damage to the sample. We image at key developmental time points from stem cell differentiation into mature organoid tissue. For data processing, we utilize the MitoGraph and MitoTNT software packages along with our developed custom computational tools. These tools allow for automated 4D organoid to single cell image processing and quantitative 4D single cell mitochondrial temporal network tracking. This work represents the first 4D high spatiotemporal-resolution quantification of live human organoid tissues at the single-cell level through development. We identified distinct mitochondrial phenotypes unique to each organoid type and found correlations between mitochondrial phenotypes, cellular age, and cell type. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mitochondrial network characteristics can predict both organoid type and cell age. Our findings reveal fundamental aspects of mitochondrial biology that were previously unobservable, offering new insights into cell-type-specific mitochondrial dynamics and enabling new findings in relevant human model systems. We believe that our findings and methods will be essential for advancing 4D cell biology, providing a powerful framework for characterizing organelles in organoid tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

This task is especially difficult for complex genomic readouts such as MNase-seq, which maps nucleosome occupancy but is confounded by experimental bias. To overcome these limitations, we introduce pairwise influence by sequence attribution (PISA), an interpretation tool that combinatorially decodes which bases are responsible for the readout at a specific genomic coordinate. PISA visualizes the effects of transcription factor motifs, uncovers previously hidden motifs with complex contribution patterns, and reveals experimental biases of genomics assays. Inte-grated into a deep learning suite called BPReveal, PISA enables accurate MNase-seq nucleosome prediction models with reduced experimental bias, allowing the de novo discovery of motifs that mediate nucleosome positioning and the design of sequences with altered nucleosome configurations. These results show that PISA is a versatile tool that expands our ability to extract novel cis-regulatory sequence rules from genomics data, paving the way towards deciphering the cis-regulatory code.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

A protein destined for degradation is first tagged with a polyubiquitin chain, which is selected by the proteasome. Different ubiquitin chain topologies serve as distinct signals, with K48-linked chains acting as the canonical degradation signal and K11/K48-branched chains providing even more potent targeting, particularly during cell cycle regulation. However, the structural basis for how the proteasome distinguishes between these different chain architectures has remained unclear. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the human 26S proteasome bound to both a K48-linked tetraubiquitin chain and a K11/K48-branched chain. Our structures reveal distinct binding modes for these two types of chain linkage. K48 chains wrap around the Ubiquitin interaction motif of the receptor RPN10 in an unexpected spiral conformation, while K11 branches engage the proteasome through previously uncharacterised interfaces in a cleft formed between RPN2 and RPN10. Through structure-guided mutagenesis and cellular studies, we demonstrate that these binding modes are essential for efficient substrate degradation and cell cycle progression. These findings establish how the proteasome achieves selective substrate recognition through chain topology-specific interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

Despite being the first recombinant therapeutic approved by the FDA, insulin remains challenging to access for many around the globe. Here we report on advancements in manufacturing insulin using cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems to rapidly produce mature desB30-insulin in less than a day. This is a major advance towards decentralizing insulin manufacturing and bringing production closer to the point-of-care, thereby improving diabetic patient accessibility. To this end, a purified cell-free extract, PUREfrex(R) 2.1, was utilized to synthesize a tagged proinsulin construct that can be captured and converted into mature insulin using an on-column affinity chromatography process. Notably, two chaperones, peptidyl prolyl isomerase (FkpA), and seven kilodalton protein (Skp) were observed to play a critical role during cell-free expression of proinsulin. The proinsulin was then immobilized on a Ni-NTA column where the purification and conversion of cell-free products were performed sequentially to yield desB30-insulin. Following further optimization, this method serves as a time and resource-efficient production process as compared to current methods. When applied simultaneously, the cell-free expression and on-column conversion methods reported here can be adopted to enable rapid on-demand insulin manufacturing in order to improve the accessibility of insulin and prevent future shortages.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

These events reduce overall protein expression levels of affected genes, potentially contributing to gene regulation and disease mechanisms.

Here, we present LeafCutter2, which enables identification and quantification of unproductive splicing from short-read RNA-seq data. LeafCutter2 requires minimal gene annotations (start and stop codons) to annotate NMD-inducing splicing events, and identifies differential unproductive splicing between groups, providing insights into its contributions to differential gene expression. Moreover, LeafCutter2 enables mapping of unproductive splicing quantitative trait loci (u-sQTLs), which often colocalize with expression QTLs and GWAS loci.

Applying LeafCutter2 to RNA-seq data across human and 6 non-human species, we uncovered a broad landscape of unproductive splicing, which varies widely across tissues. Strikingly, we observed a conserved developmental-stage-specific increase in unproductive splicing during testis maturation across all species.

In Alzheimers disease (AD), we analyzed RNA-seq data from the AD Functional Genomics consortium FunGen-xQTL project and identified unproductive splicing events in 18 AD risk genes, including TSPAN14, PICALM, and CASS4, likely mediating genetic effects on disease risk. We performed an integrative analysis using gene expression QTLs, protein expression QTLs, and AD GWAS data, showing that unproductive splicing provides unique regulatory insights beyond traditional approaches. Thus, LeafCutter2 represents a powerful tool for understanding the functional impact of alternative splicing on gene expression and disease mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

Immunohistochemical analysis of the synaptic architecture of these spinal circuits has been notoriously difficult in formaldehyde-fixed tissue and often requires antigen retrieval techniques to reveal antigen binding epitopes. To avoid the damage this harsh treatment can induce, studies have used antibodies raised against scaffolding proteins Homer1 and gephyrin, which anchor glutamate and GABA receptors to the membrane, respectively, to identify synaptic associations in rodent spinal cord underlying pain and itch transmission. In contrast, few studies have attempted to visualise spinal cord synapses in the human, partly due to a lack of high-quality tissue with low postmortem intervals. In this study, we reveal both excitatory and inhibitory synapses at a high resolution in human lumbar spinal cord tissue using antibodies to Homer1 and gephyrin and show that the basic organisation of these proteins within the dorsal horn is similar to that seen in the rodent. We show these postsynaptic markers are highly colocalised with glutamate and GABA receptor subunits and are in close apposition to presynaptic markers, confirming their specificity. Finally, we use Homer1-immunolabelling to demonstrate that primary afferents can form complex synaptic arrangements in human. We conclude that these antibodies can be used as reliable tools for the study of the human CNS and we have used them to reveal insight into the microanatomy of somatosensory connections in the human spinal cord that can be expanded upon in future studies.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

A key component of such studies is the protection function, the mathematical relationship between the value of an immunological assay and the relative risk of disease. This function is often estimated using lo-gistic regression, comparing the odds of disease at a given assay value to the odds at assay value zero. Here, we show through mathematical analysis and simulation experiments that logistic regression, while common, fundamentally constrains the functional forms of protection that can be inferred from data in TNDs, potentially leading to overly simplistic estimates of the protection function. To address this limitation, we adapt and analyze a scaled logit model, originally developed for case-control data, as a flexible alternative that allows for greater flexibility in estimating protection functions from TND data. We demonstrate that this approach improves accuracy across a range of biologically plausible protection functions, highlight conditions under which it may fail, and provide practical guidance for researchers to adopt it as a new standard for TND studies evaluating correlates of protection.","NA","medrxiv",1744409337870

Reinforcement learning (RL) has provided a computational framework to study this process, and neural signals linked to RL have been identified in the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex. More recently, hippocampal contributions to this kind of value-learning have been proposed, at least under some conditions. Here, we test whether the hippocampus provides a signal of the option's identity that aids in credit assignment when learning about several perceptually similar items, and evaluate how this process differs across the lifespan. A sample of 251 younger and older adults, including a subset (n = 76) with simultaneous fMRI, completed an RL task in which they learned the value of four houses through trial-and-error. Older adults showed decreased choice accuracy, accompanied by reduced neural signaling of value at choice but not feedback. Using representational similarity analysis, we found that the precision with which choice options were represented in the posterior hippocampus during choice predicted accurate decisions across age groups. Interestingly, despite previous evidence for neural de-differentiation in older adults, we found no support for a ""blurring"" of these stimulus representations in older adults. Rather, we observed reduced connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and the medial PFC in older adults, and this connectivity correlated with choice consistency. Taken together, these findings identify a hippocampal contribution to incremental value learning, and that reductions in incremental value learning in older adults are associated with the reduced transfer of information between the hippocampus and mPFC, rather than the precision of the information in the hippocampus itself.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

This sensing is done by redistribution of charged membrane proteins on the cell's surface (""sensors"") via electrophoresis and electroosmotic flow. If membrane proteins have to physically rearrange on the cell's surface, how quickly can a cell respond to an applied signal? What limits the cell's ability to respond? Are galvanotaxing cells, like chemotaxing cells, limited by stochasticity from the finite number of molecules? Here, we develop a model for the response dynamics of galvanotaxing cells and show that, for weak enough field strengths, two relevant timescales emerge: the time for the cell's sensors to rearrange, which depends on their diffusion across the cell, and the time for the cell's orientation to respond to an applied field, which may be very different. We fit this model to experimental measurements on the recently-identified sensor galvanin (TMEM154) in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells, finding that given the dynamics of a cell responding to an applied field, we can predict the dynamics of the cell after the field is turned off. This fit constrains the noise of the galvanotaxis process, demonstrating that HL-60 is not limited by the stochasticity of finite sensor number. Our model also allows us to explain the effect of media viscosity on cell dynamics, and predict how cells respond to pulsed DC fields. These results place constraints on the ability to guide cells with pulsed fields, predicting that a field on half of the time is no better than a field that is always on with half the magnitude.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

This studys goal was to determine prospective registration, results reporting, trial registration number reporting, and publication accessibility status for trials with primary completion dates from 2014 to 2017 affiliated with seven California universities.

MethodsWe identified trials with investigators, sponsors, or responsible parties affiliated with seven California universities and searched for their results publications manually. We then used semi-automatic methods to determine prospective registration, summary results reporting in a registry, publication status, and reporting of registration numbers in the abstract and the full text of manuscripts.

ResultsWe identified 1,091 unique trials. Most trials were single-center (n=752, 69%) and had a median of 50 participants (IQR 21 to 150). Overall, 64% of trials (n=698) were prospectively registered, 46% (n=500) had summary results reported in the registry, 69% (n=750) had results published as articles, and an additional 3% (n=36) as abstracts or posters. Results reporting (summary, articles, abstracts or posters) occurred for 58% of trials (n=637) within 2 years, and for 81% (n=888) within 5 years of study primary completion date. Of journal publications, 77% (n=579) were open access publications, 37% (n=276) had trial registration numbers listed in their abstract, and 45% (n=336) in the manuscript.

We studied the consequences of EPB41L4A-AS1 perturbation in breast cancer cells and found that it acts both in cis, to enhance transcription of the proximal EPB41L4A gene and additional genes in its two flanking topologically associated domains, and in trans by broadly regulating gene expression, including expression of snoRNAs, transcription of genes involved in nucleolar biology and the distribution of nucleolar proteins.

The mechanisms linking this peripheral disease to cognitive symptoms are thought to include heightened circulating cytokines and other inflammatory mediators resulting in a leaky blood-brain barrier and increased neuroinflammation (i.e., inflammation taking place in the brain). This can lead to aberrant synaptic transmission and cognitive dysfunction. A key component of neuroinflammation is the reactivity of astrocytes, in a process termed astrogliosis, associated with altered morphology, proliferative capacity, gene expression, and function. Accumulating evidence suggests astrogliosis likely occurs in mild to moderate COVID-19 ; however, there has been limited investigation. In this study, we quantified changes to astrocytes in a Syrian hamster model of mild to moderate respiratory COVID-19. Methods: We used an intranasal inoculation model to produce mild to moderate respiratory COVID-19 in 8-10-week-old male and female Syrian hamsters. We extracted brains at 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 31-days post-inoculation and from uninfected controls, and immunolabelled brain sections with astrocyte- (GFAP and SOX9) and neuron-specific (NEUN) markers. We captured tiled confocal micrographs of entire brain sections and analyzed the resulting signals from five regions of interest: cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, third ventricle, and dorsal striatum. Results: To systematically quantify cell-type-specific labelling for astrogliosis markers, we first developed an unbiased pipeline. We found a transient increase in GFAP signal density in female hamster, specifically in the cortex at 3 days post-inoculation. There were no corresponding changes noted in astrocyte (SOX9), neuron (NEUN) or total cell (Hoechst) numbers. Moreover, there were no changes in male hamsters at any timepoint in any region of interest. Conclusions: Our findings provide the first spatiotemporal insight into astrogliosis in a hamster model of mild to moderate respiratory COVID-19. We identified a transient and sex-specific increase in GFAP signal density, indicative of astrogliosis. Our findings contribute to the literature surrounding sex differences in (neuro)immune responses and add to the growing body of COVID-19 literature, in which sex-specific outcomes are apparent in both human patient populations and rodent experimental models.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1744409337870

Traditional bulk eQTL methods rely on averaged gene expression across a possibly heterogeneous mixture of cells, which can obscure underlying regulatory heterogeneity. Single-cell eQTL methods circumvent the averaging artifacts, providing an immense opportunity to interrogate transcriptional regulation at a much finer resolution. Recent developments in metric space regression methods allow the use of full empirical distributions as response objects instead of simple summary statistics such as mean. Here, we leverage Frechet regression to identify distribution QTLs (distQTLs) using population-scale single-cell RNA sequencing data. We apply distQTL to the OneK1K cohort, consisting of scRNA-seq data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 982 donors, and compare results to various eQTL approaches based on summary statistics and mixed effects modeling. We demonstrate the superior performance of distQTL across different gene expression contexts compared to other methods and benchmark our results against findings from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project. Finally, we orthogonally validate calls from distQTL using cell-type-specific epigenomic profiles.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

Identifying genes involved in specialized metabolism remains difficult. While coexpression analysis is a widely used approach to identify genes acting in the same pathway or process, it has limitations, particularly in distinguishing genes coexpressed due to shared regulatory triggers from those directly involved in the same pathway. To enhance functional predictions, integrating phylogenetic analysis provides an additional layer of confidence by considering evolutionary conservation. Here, we introduce CoExpPhylo, a computational pipeline that systematically combines coexpression analysis and phylogenetics to identify candidate genes involved in specialized biosynthetic pathways across multiple species based on one to multiple bait gene candidates. Results CoExpPhylo systematically integrates coexpression information and phylogenetic signals to identify candidate genes involved in specialized biosynthetic pathways. The pipeline consists of multiple computational steps: (1) species-specific coexpression analysis, (2) local sequence alignment to identify orthologs, (3) clustering of candidate genes into Orthologous Coexpressed Groups (OCGs), (4) functional annotation, (5) global sequence alignment, (6) phylogenetic tree generation, and optionally (7) visualization. The workflow is highly customizable, allowing users to adjust correlation thresholds, filtering parameters, and annotation sources. Benchmarking CoExpPhylo on multiple pathways, including anthocyanin, proanthocyanidin, and flavonol biosynthesis, confirmed its ability to recover known genes while also suggesting novel candidates. Conclusion CoExpPhylo provides a systematic framework for identifying candidate genes involved in the specialized metabolism. By integrating coexpression data with phylogenetic clustering, it facilitates the discovery of both conserved and lineage-specific genes. The resulting OCGs offer a strong foundation for further experimental validation, bridging the gap between computational predictions and functional characterization. Future improvements, such as incorporating multi-species reference databases and refining clustering for large gene families, could further enhance its resolution. Overall, CoExpPhylo represents a valuable tool for accelerating pathway elucidation and advancing our understanding of specialized metabolism in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

VP is becoming a reality through technological advances across several domains, including in situ structural biology and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM). However, widespread adoption remains limited due to the complexity and cost of the various VP approaches reported to date. Here we present the VP-CLEM-Kit, a disruptive cost-effective pipeline for super resolution volume CLEM (SR-vCLEM) that can be implemented with minimal advanced electron microscopy expertise and equipment, making it accessible to light microscopy facilities and research labs. SR-vCLEM is based on in-resin fluorescence (IRF), where fluorophores are preserved through processing into resin. The easyIRF protocol reported here reduces the requirement for complex costly sample preparation equipment and toxic chemicals compared to standard IRF protocols. easyIRF blocks are cut into ultrathin sections that are imaged using tomoSTORM, a new modular and cost-effective openFrame-based light microscope controlled by the open-source software package Micro-Manager that provides serial single molecule localisation microscopy in array tomography format. Sections are then post-stained and imaged using a tabletop scanning electron microscope controlled by open-source SBEMimage software to run in array tomography format. We demonstrate the potential of the VP-CLEM-Kit by imaging organelle reporters in human cell lines and stem cell derived neurons, fluorescently labelled protein in neurons, and immunolabelled cells in human kidney biopsy tissue from transplant patients. The VP-CLEM-Kit delivers a ~5-fold improvement in resolution at a ~7-fold lower cost, and thus provides new technical capability as well as a blueprint for more equitable access to advanced imaging workflows.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

However, this high structural heterogeneity has limited their observation at high-resolution. Here, we have used an integrated structural biology approach to explore the structures of the multi-domain immunoglobulin-like FLN5-6 during its biosynthesis, capturing early folding through to native folding. We developed an in-silico purification approach for cryo-EM of ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs), and integrated the resulting cryo-EM maps with NMR spectroscopy and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to produce experimentally reweighted structural ensembles of RNC. The resulting atomistic structures reveal insights into the orientational heterogeneity of the nascent chain and its dynamic interactions with the ribosome. In particular, we find that two distinct pathways exist for nascent polypeptides in the exit tunnel vestibule, influenced by their stage of biosynthesis, folding conformational state and ribosomal RNA helices lining the tunnel. Our systematic analysis of the structures of nascent proteins translation-stalled at multiple time-points provides insights into how the ribosome dynamically modulates its pathway out of the exit tunnel to regulate its folding and accessibility for auxiliary factors of other co-translational events.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

What neural mechanisms support this increase of movement vigor for greater rewards? We had three rhesus monkeys perform reaching movements to targets worth different magnitudes of reward. We recorded neural population activity from primary motor and dorsal premotor cortex, brain areas at the output of cortical processing for voluntary movements, and asked how neural activity mediated the translation of reward into increased vigor. We identified features of neural activity during movement preparation, initiation, and execution that were both correlated with vigor and modulated by reward. We also found that the neural metrics that correlate with different aspects of movement vigor exhibit only limited correlation with one another, suggesting that there are multiple mechanisms through which reward modulates vigor. Finally, we note that the majority of reward's modulation of motor cortical activity cannot be accounted for by reward-mediated vigor differences in behavior, indicating that reward modulations within motor cortex may serve roles in addition to affecting vigor. Overall, our results provide insight into the neural mechanisms that link reward-driven motivation to the modulation of the details of movement.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

Unfortunately, the extent to which microbiomes from different populations are characterised is limited by their economic resources. Over 70% of the sequenced human microbiomes come from analyses of European and North American populations, skewing our understanding by focusing excessively on just 15% of the global population. Thus, entire continents rely on results from research conducted in wealthier countries whose main findings are unlikely to generalize across other world regions. Moreover, statistical models perform poorly when applied to minorities, a blind spot with serious consequences in biomedicine, and which can only be addressed by analysing microbiome data from currently neglected areas. To address this problem, we created saMBA, the largest archive of gut microbiomes from South America, one of the worlds most biodiverse regions in terms of the gut microbiome of its inhabitants, yet the one with the fewest samples. ""saMBA"" includes 33 gut microbiome studies, ~73% of which were incorporated in a microbiome archive for the first time. By leveraging this resource, we uncovered a high biodiversity within, and uniqueness between, gut microbiomes across the continent, expanding the concept of the healthy microbiome to be more globally representative. Additionally, our results highlight that the gut microbiome biodiversity of this region remains far from fully characterized. We demonstrate how saMBA can guide new sampling efforts to better capture this diversity. Finally, the code deployed to build saMBA is compatible with that of a previous global compendium and is openly available to researchers from other underrepresented regions, fostering the inclusion of other neglected populations to accelerate microbiome research globally.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337870

However, most preclinical studies rely on inbred mouse strains that do not capture the genetic complexity of human populations. One key area of translational research focuses on identifying the neural and behavioral consequences of early life trauma. Rodent models of childhood neglect, such as maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW), have been used in isogenic mouse strains like C57BL/6J (B6) to identify behavioral domains and neural loci of deficits stemming from exposure to MSEW. To understand how genetic diversity may contribute to the outcomes produced by MSEW, and thus inform future studies on the topic, we utilized the Jackson Laboratory Diversity Outbred (DO) line, a population derived from eight founder strains that exhibit broad genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. We first compared MSEW effects on social behavior in DO mice versus B6 mice, because we have previously found social behavior deficits in B6 mice with a history of MSEW. Indeed, we established that MSEW incited social motivation deficits in DO mice, in a sex-specific manner. We then expanded our investigation of DO mice to test MSEW-related changes in anxiety-like behavior, fear learning and expression, and reward-seeking. Results revealed that MSEW produces distinct, sex-specific phenotypes: female DO mice displayed reduced social motivation and elevated anxiety-like behavior, while male DO mice showed attenuated CS-evoked fear expression and diminished reward-seeking behavior. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased Fos expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in MSEW-exposed DO mice, both at baseline and following acute stress.

Using multiparametric deep mutational scanning across eight substrates and two energy conditions, we deconvolute the contributions of substrate recognition, energetic coupling, and protein stability, providing an integrated, high-resolution view of multidrug transport. We find that substrate specificity arises from a distributed network of residues extending beyond the binding site, with mutations that reshape binding, coupling, conformational flexibility, and membrane interactions. Further, we apply a pH-based selection scheme to measure the effect of mutation on pH-dependent transport efficiency. By integrating these data, we reveal a fundamental relationship between efficiency and promiscuity: highly efficient variants exhibit broad substrate profiles, while inefficient variants are narrower. These findings establish a direct link between energy coupling and polyspecificity, uncovering the biochemical logic underlying multidrug transport.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337871

MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS-O (MLO) proteins act downstream of FERONIA (FER) receptor-like kinases in pollen tubes and synergids to regulate calcium dynamics. This study uses a constitutively active MLO (faNTA) to identify a new role for the FER/MLO signaling module in regulating [Ca2+]cyt oscillations in growing root hairs. faNTA bypasses FER signaling in root hairs, complementing not only the previously reported fer-4 root hair bursting phenotype, but also the complete loss of polarity in spherical root hairs. This complementation correlates with the restoration of tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt oscillations that are disrupted in fer mutants, suggesting that MLOs are involved in regulating [Ca2+]cyt dynamics in growing root hairs. MLO15 was identified as a regulator of root hair tip-growth based on disrupted root hair growth and [Ca2+]cyt signatures in mlo15-4. We also link the FER/MLO module to ROS accumulation by showing that faNTA is sufficient to restore ROS levels in fer-4 root hairs and that ROS levels are decreased in mlo15-4 root hairs. We propose that MLOs act downstream of FER to mediate Ca2+ influx and promote ROS production in order to regulate root hair tip-growth.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337871

We present BromoCatch, a novel SLP platform based on a small [~]13 kDa bromodomain (BD) engineered with a nucleophilic cysteine for covalent ligand engagement. A structure-based designed library of 16 ""bumped"" binders bearing diverse electrophilic warheads was screened against two different cysteine mutants using differential scanning fluorimetry and intact protein mass spectrometry to monitor covalent complex formation. The para-acrylamide bumped derivative MR116 and the Brd4-BD2 double mutant L387A,E438C formed the most potent and stable adduct, and its binding mode through covalent modification was confirmed by an X-ray cocrystal structure solved to 1.3 [A] of resolution. BromoCatch exhibited potent and irreversible target engagement in cells through nanoBRET and residence time assays. Practicality and scope are further demonstrated through the design and proof-of-concept application of a biotinylated conjugate, PROTAC tag degraders, and fluorescent probes of both full-on and switch-on types for ex-cellulo and live-cell imaging. Together, we qualify BromoCatch as a novel, versatile and efficient protein labelling tool and technology platform.

The effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in adolescents in real-world settings is not well understood.

OBJECTIVETo evaluate the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in adolescents aged 12 to 20 years given within the first five days of acute COVID-19 illness on illness severity during the acute (days 0 to 27) and post-acute phases (days 28 to 179).

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSThis target trial emulation used the electronic health records (EHR) data from twenty-nine medical institutions participating in the NIHs RECOVER consortium. We included data collected between April 1, 2022 and December 31, 2023, and included all patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not hospitalized on the day of entry. Those who were treated with oral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days after the positive test (n=2,923) and those who did not received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days after the positive test during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (control group, n=31,947) were identified.

EXPOSURESTreatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir based on prescription records.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESWe used modified Poisson regression models for binary outcomes to examine the effects of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir on acute phase hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits, and outpatient visits as well as progression to moderate or severe acute illness among individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir compared to control counterparts. Additionally, we assessed the medications associations with 16 conditions and symptoms during the acute phase of illness and its subsequent association with specific Long COVID diagnostic code U09.9 during the post-acute phase. We reported the absolute risks and estimated the relative risks (RRs), with adjustments made for demographic variables, clinical characteristics, and healthcare utilization, using propensity score matching.

RESULTSThe study cohort included 34,870 adolescents (median [Q1, Q3] age 16.0 [14.0, 18.0]); 46.0% male and 43.2% Non-Hispanic White. Among these patients, 2,923 were treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days of cohort entry and 31,947 received no treatment. The absolute rates were 0.58% vs. 0.96% for hospitalization, 74.17% vs. 82.66% for outpatient visits, 1.81% vs. 2.28% for ED visits, 3.08% vs. 3.99% for moderate/severe acute illness, and 0.21% vs. 0.20% for long COVID diagnosis in the treatment vs. control group. After propensity score matching, during acute-phase period, compared to the control group, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with reduced risk of any hospitalization (relative risk (RR) 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29-0.80), outpatient visit (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.82-0.90), and moderate/severe acute illness (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.56-0.87). Additionally, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with reduced risk of 7 of 16 specified conditions in chest pain (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.26-0.63), fatigue and malaise (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32-0.76), generalized pain (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.45-0.95), headache (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.44-0.83), mental health (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.39-0.80), musculoskeletal (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.94), and respiratory signs and symptoms (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52-0.71). No evidence was found to suggest that the treatment was associated with the risk of long COVID diagnosis U09.9 (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.40-2.32).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEThis study found that treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in adolescents within 5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection, was associated with reduced risk of acute-phase COVID-19 illness and subsequent healthcare utilization. However, treatment was not associated with a lower risk of Long COVID diagnosis.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduce the acute COVID-19 illness severity and the risk of developing Long COVID in adolescents aged 12 to 20 years?

FindingsIn this target trial emulation study of 34,870 adolescents with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not hospitalized on the cohort entry day, 2,923 who were treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir exhibited lower acute illness severity including reduced risk of 7 of 16 specified conditions and symptoms, as well as reduced risk of acute-phase hospitalization and outpatient visits, compared with 31,947 who received no treatment. The association with reduced risk of Long COVID was not observed in this study.

MeaningIn adolescents, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir appears to be effective at reducing the severity of acute COVID illness but was not associated with the risk of developing Long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1744409337871

However, how adaptive TEs arise in populations and historical contingencies affect TE dynamics remains unknown. Fungal pathogens in agriculture provide unique frameworks to address such questions due to the availability of spatially explicit sampling and well-characterized niche conditions. We characterised TE evolutionary dynamics using an extensive intraspecies sampling of 1,953 genomes across the global distribution range of the major fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Employing a pangenomic approach, we characterise genomic diversity and benchmark methods to robustly infer TE insertion polymorphism, before systematically assessing TEs as a source of adaptive variation. We annotated [~]3.2 million TE loci among genomes, finding substantial variation in TE content within and among populations. TE activity surged during the pathogens expansion from its centre of origin in the Middle East, with unique TE activity profiles arising in derived populations. TE-mediated adaptation emerged from distinct waves of TE mobilization. The highest rates of TE activity were observed over timescales as short as 25 years. 45 TE loci showing local adaptation signatures within 1kb of 49 host genes were identified, with adaptive TE insertions likely related to adaptation to antifungals and the plant host environment. This work highlights the power of vast genomic datasets to unravel intraspecies TE invasion histories and pinpoint factors likely driving recent adaptation. This argues for a shift in focus to incorporate deep population-level TE activity surveys in our pursuit to uncover the molecular drivers of adaptive evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337871

While vaccination played a key role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, variants of concern (VOC) with immune evasive substitutions emerged on multiple occasions, causing widespread breakthrough infections. The combined threats of zoonosis and newly emerging VOCs, coupled with the potential for recombination, underscore the need to assess the breadth of existing vaccine-mediated protection. Here, we investigate a cohort of older individuals (median age 68.5 years) for the potential of cross-neutralisation against Omicron lineage VOC and animal sarbecoviruses induced by four COVID-19 vaccine doses. Despite the recent use of a bivalent mRNA vaccine dose (encoding spike from Wu-1 and omicron), we observed that neutralisation of Omicron lineage VOCs such as BA.1 and BA.2 were reduced compared to SARS-CoV-2 Wu-1, suggesting an imprinted immune response from pre-Omicron lineage viruses. Similarly, both SARS-CoV-1 and a SARS-CoV-1-related bat CoV were neutralised less efficiently than SARS-CoV-2 Wu-1. Unexpectedly, however, we observed that two animal SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, BANAL-20-52 (from bats) and a pangolin-CoV, were more sensitive to serum neutralising antibodies than SARS-CoV-2 Wu-1 itself. These surprising findings suggest that vaccine-mediated adaptive immunity may provide efficient cross-protection against certain animal sarbecoviruses.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337871

Despite nearly a century of research, the computations underlying this projection have not been adequately addressed. In the present study, we employed model-driven psychophysics to fill this gap. We hypothesized that tool-based sensory projection involves the remapping of touch from sensory feedback in the hand into an egocentric coordinate system. We first formalized the computational steps underlying tactile remapping. We designed a novel tool-sensing experiment that allowed us to rigorously test this model. In this task, participants contacted an object with a hand-held rod and then judged whether the object was above or below where they were currently looking. This comparison would only be possible if touch on the tool was projected outside the hand. Crucially, both object location and gaze position varied independently, allowing us to characterize the hand-to-space-to-gaze remapping process. Model-based curve fitting provided strong evidence that all participants in our task projected touch outside their body and into gazecentered coordinates. Crucially, the resolution of this projection was similar to what has been found for touch on the body. These findings provide the first step towards characterizing the computations underlying the spatial projection of touch on external objects, highlighting the incredible versatility of the sensorimotor system.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337871

Among these, histone modifications like H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 play opposing roles in gene activation and repression, respectively. In Arabidopsis thaliana, H3K27me3 is deposited by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), while Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins mediate H3K4me3 deposition. While the functions of these writer complexes have been extensively studied, far less is known about the histone mark readers that interpret these modifications during development. Here, we investigate the antagonistic interplay between H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 during Arabidopsis embryogenesis. We identify a developmentally specific interaction between the FIS-PRC2 complex and ALFIN-LIKE (AL) proteins--a family of plant-specific PHD domain proteins that read H3K4me3. Our findings reveal a dynamic competition between these two marks during early embryogenesis that helps shape the epigenomic landscape of the developing seed. Disruption of AL function leads to severe developmental defects and loss of cell identity in early embryos. Moreover, loss of ALs impairs H3K4me3 deposition, resulting in aberrant spreading of H3K27me3, misregulation of developmental genes, and defects that persist into adult plant traits.

Together, our results show that proper embryonic development relies on a finely tuned antagonism between activating and repressive chromatin states--an interplay orchestrated not only by their writers but also by specific readers that translate these epigenetic cues into developmental outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337871

These models rely on tokenizers to split input sequences into manageable chunks --- a straightforward task in natural language but more challenging for long DNA sequences that lack distinct ""words"". Most biological tokenizers are data-driven and do not align with ""the central dogma of molecular biology"": DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins, with each three-letter codon specifying a particular amino acid, some of which are synonymous for the amino acids they represent. Start codons signal the beginning of protein synthesis, while stop codons signal its termination. The Genomic Tokenizer (GT) incorporates this biological process flow into a standard tokenizer interface within the HuggingFace transformer package. GT can be used to pre-train foundational transformer models on DNA sequences. We compare the performance of GT with two alternate tokenization strategies and discuss its potential applications.

This siloed approach prevents generalization across biomolecular classes and limits the ability to model interaction interfaces systematically. We introduce ATOMICA, a geometric deep learning model that learns atomic-scale representations of intermolecular interfaces across diverse biomolecular modalities, including small molecules, metal ions, amino acids, and nucleic acids. ATOMICA uses a self-supervised denoising and masking objective to train on 2,037,972 interaction complexes and generate hierarchical embeddings at the levels of atoms, chemical blocks, and molecular interfaces. The model generalizes across molecular classes and recovers shared physicochemical features without supervision. Its latent space captures compositional and chemical similarities across interaction types and follows scaling laws that improve representation quality with increasing biomolecular data modalities. We apply ATOMICA to construct five modality-specific interfaceome networks, termed ATOMICANO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOWs, which connect proteins based on interaction similarity with ions, small molecules, nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins. These networks identify disease pathways across 27 conditions and predict disease-associated proteins in autoimmune neuropathies and lymphoma. Finally, we use ATOMICA to annotate the dark proteome--proteins lacking known structure or function--by predicting 2,646 previously uncharacterized ligand-binding sites. These include putative zinc finger motifs and transmembrane cytochrome subunits, demonstrating that ATOMICA enables systematic annotation of molecular interactions across the proteome.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337871

Yet, the mechanisms by which electrical signals are generated, sensed and transmitted upon damage to promote organ growth remain unclear. Here, we uncover that organ regeneration relies on dynamic electrochemical coupling between tissue-wide depolarization and intracellular proliferative signalling. By sub-second live imaging of injured zebrafish larval fins, we identify events across timescales: a millisecond tissue depolarization gradient, followed by seconds-persistent intracellular Calcium responses. Subsequently within one hour, Voltage Sensing Phosphatase activity translates depolarisation into proliferation. Connecting these timescales with an electro-diffusive model showed that ionic fluxes and electric potential become coupled in the fins interstitial space, enabling organ-wide signal spreading. Our work reveals the coupling between fast electrical signals and slower intracellular signalling, ensuring organ regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1744409337871

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1744409337871

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1744409337871
