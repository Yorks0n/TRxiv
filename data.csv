A major unresolved question concerns whether these changes are driven by the illness itself or represent iatrogenic effects of antipsychotic medication. Methods: We report findings from a triple-blind randomised placebo-controlled MRI study where 62 antipsychotic-naive people with first episode psychosis (FEP) received either an atypical antipsychotic or a placebo pill over a treatment period of 6 months. A healthy control group (n=27) was also recruited. Anatomical T1-weighed scans were collected at baseline, 3-months, and 12-months. Linear mixed effects models were fitted to >160,000 cortical surface loci to examine illness- and antipsychotic-related changes in cortical thickness. We also examined whether cortical changes were enriched within canonical functional networks or cytoarchitectonic types of laminar differentiation, and whether these changes spatially correlated with normative in vivo receptor/transporter densities via PET imaging and ex vivo transcriptomically-imputed cell densities. Results: We found widespread cortical thinning over 12 months (p<.05FDR) in people with FEP who received placebo compared to healthy controls, with the largest effects occurring in frontal, cingulate, and occipital areas. No significant difference was detected in antipsychotic-treated people with FEP compared to healthy controls. Thickness differences in placebo group were not preferentially concentrated within any specific functional networks, although highly differentiated koniocortical areas were relatively protected from cortical thinning (pspin<.05FDR). Thinning in the placebo group spatially aligned with normative distributions of GABAA/BZ, 5HT1B, 5HT2A, and H3 receptors (.17 < r < .28; pspin<.05FDR). No significant associations between cortical thinning and symptom changes were identified. Conclusions: Widespread thinning of cortical grey matter occurs over the first year of FEP in people who do not receive antipsychotic treatment. No such thinning is evident in patients receiving antipsychotics during the study intervention phase. These findings suggest that cortical thinning in the early stages of psychosis is an illness-related phenomenon that may be mitigated by early antipsychotic exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

However, its robustness against pre-analytical variation has not been sufficiently characterized. Here, we systematically evaluate five plasma proteomics workflows, including three bead-based methods and two conventional protocols, using controlled spike-ins of low-abundance proteins and defined cellular contaminants. We find that bead-based approaches enhance detection of low-abundance proteins but can be highly susceptible to systematic bias from platelet and PBMC contamination, even at low levels. This can easily inflate results by thousands of proteins, likely accounting for some of the very high literature-reported numbers. In contrast, a perchloric acid-based workflow shows notable resistance to erythrocyte and platelet-derived interference. We further investigate how centrifugation conditions, anticoagulant choice, and buffer-bead combinations modulate contamination profiles and demonstrate that bias can be partially mitigated by optimized sample handling. In total, we identify more than 13,000 protein groups from various conditions, including cellular components from the circulating proteome. Our results provide a quantitative framework for assessing workflow performance under variable sample quality and offer guidance for both biomarker discovery and quality control in clinical proteomics studies.","NA","biorxiv",1747087756588

The J2 monoclonal antibody is the gold-standard method to discover and map endogenous dsRNAs across subcellular locations and cell surfaces, detect exogenous RNAs in viral infection, and surveil mRNA prophylactics and therapeutics for inflammatory dsRNAs. To define its epitope, specificity, and mechanism, we determine a 2.85 [A] co-crystal structure of J2 antigen-binding fragment (Fab) bound to dsRNA. J2 uses its heavy and light chains in tandem to track the dsRNA minor groove, recognizing a staggered 8-bp duplex. J2 is exquisitely selective for dsRNAs, requires 14 bp for robust binding, and exhibits greatly diminished binding for GC-rich dsRNAs. J2 and R-loop-specific S9.6 antibody share a common recognition strategy distinct from intracellular dsRNA-binding proteins. This study provides mechanistic insights into dsRNA recognition and establishes a framework for reliable application and data interpretation of the J2 antibody in RNA discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1747087756588

Apart from technical challenges such as the sparsity and heterogeneous noise properties of these data, the crucial problem is that we know little about the potentially very complex high-dimensional structures that the data represent. Consequently, there is an urgent need for exploratory analysis methods that allow rigorous representation and visualization of the structure in the data. However, currently popular methods such as UMAP and t-SNE are unsatisfactory because they are ad hoc, stochastic, uninterpretable, and known to severely distort the structure in the data.

Here we show that these challenges can be overcome by representing the data on tree structures and present Bonsai : a novel method that reconstructs the most likely tree relating any set of high-dimensional objects while rigorously accounting for heterogeneous measurement noise.

We show that, in contrast to other visualization methods, distances along the Bonsai trees accurately represent true distances between the objects in high-dimensional space across many types of datasets. Moreover, Bonsai automatically regularizes measurement noise, outperforming even methods specifically designed for that purpose on tasks such as nearest-neighbor identification.

By analyzing a blood cell dataset, we show that Bonsai trees not only capture known lineage relationships but also provide novel biological insights. For example, Bonsai uncovers that different subsets of NK cells derive from the myeloid and lymphoid lineage, and pinpoints genes that distinguish myeloid-NK from lymphoid-NK cells.

Bonsai is free from tunable parameters and scales to datasets of hundreds of thousands of cells. The accompanying tool, Bonsai-scout, provides visualizations of the Bonsai trees and allows for interactive data exploration such as identifying subclades and their markers, visualizing features along the tree, changing the tree layout, and zooming in on substructures. Finally, application to a dataset of football statistics shows the generality of Bonsai in successfully capturing complex structures in high-dimensional data.","NA","biorxiv",1747087756588

Recent work has extended this concept to gray matter morphology in the brain, but no such reference framework currently exists for white matter (WM) even though WM constitutes the essential substrate for neuronal communication and large-scale network integration. Here, we present the first comprehensive WM brain charts, which describe how microstructural and macrostructural features of WM evolve across the lifespan, by leveraging over 26,199 diffusion MRI scans from 42 harmonized studies. Using generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS), we estimate age- and sex-stratified trajectories for 72 individual white matter pathways, quantifying both tract-specific microstructural and morphometric features. We demonstrate that these WM brain charts enable four important applications: (1) defining normative trajectories of WM maturation and decline across distinct pathways, (2) identifying previously uncharacterized developmental milestones and spatial gradients of tract maturation, (3) detecting individualized deviations from normative patterns with clinical relevance across multiple neurological disorders, and (4) facilitating standardized, cross-study centile scoring of new datasets. By establishing a unified, interpretable reference framework for WM structure, these brain charts provide a foundational metric for research and clinical neuroscience. The accompanying open-access trajectories, centile scoring tools, and harmonization methods facilitate precise mapping of WM development, aging, and pathology across diverse populations.

Few data are available on the combined effect of concurrent underlying conditions on risk of severe outcomes from RSV disease among inpatients.

ObjectiveTo identify underlying condition profiles associated with increased risk of severe outcomes among adults hospitalized with RSV.

DesignWe applied Bayesian profile regression, an outcome-informed statistical clustering model, to identify profiles of conditions associated with increased risk of RSV-associated severe outcomes separately among adults aged 18-59 and [&ge;]60 years. Seventeen underlying conditions were selected after excluding those with rare prevalence ([&le;]1%) or high pairwise tetrachoric correlation ([&ge;]0.7).

Setting26 hospitals in 20 U.S. states

ParticipantsProspectively enrolled adults hospitalized with RSV disease admitted January 2022-July 2024

Main Outcomes and MeasuresRisks of ICU admission, acute organ failure, and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death

ResultsWe analyzed data from 1111 adults hospitalized with RSV (median age [IQR] = 66 [53-75]). Among 397 adults aged 18-59 years, two profiles were identified characterized by (1) fewer underlying conditions (""minimal prevalence"" profile; 308 cases [78%]; median number of conditions = 1; IQR 1-2) with a posterior median ICU admission risk of 20.5% (95% credible interval = [16.1{square}25.0]), and (2) a cardiorenal/diabetes profile (89 cases [22%]) with frequent heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and increased ICU admission risk (37.1% [27.3{square}47.6]). Among 714 adults aged [&ge;]60 years, four profiles were identified: (1) minimal condition prevalence (460 cases [64%]; ICU admission risk = 21.6% [18.4{square}25.5]), (2) cardiorenal/diabetes (183 cases [26%]; 27.3% [21.4{square}33.6]), (3) hematologic malignancy and transplant receipt (52 cases [7%]; 11.8% [5.7{square}21.0]), and (4) chronic pulmonary disease with home oxygen dependence (19 cases [3%]; 44.0% [24.5{square}65.8]). Similar differences in risk were observed for acute organ failure and IMV or death.

Conclusion and RelevanceDistinct underlying condition profiles with varying risks of severe outcomes were identified in adults hospitalized with RSV. These findings could support recognition of high-risk patients to inform RSV prevention strategies and suggest that the role of multimorbidity in increasing severe RSV disease risk warrants further attention.

Key pointsQuestion: How does multimorbidity influence risk of severe outcomes among adults hospitalized with RSV?

Findings: In this cohort study of 1,111 U.S. adults hospitalized with RSV during 2022-2024, approximately one in four patients aged 18-59 and [&ge;]60 years had a profile of frequent heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and elevated risk of ICU admission and acute organ failure. Adults aged [&ge;]60 years with chronic pulmonary disease with home oxygen dependence had the highest risk for ICU admission and acute organ failure.

Meaning: The role of distinct multimorbidity profiles in increasing severe RSV disease risk warrants further attention.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

In CASP16, blind predictions for 42 targets canvassing a full array of nucleic acid functions, from dopamine binding by DNA to formation of elaborate RNA nanocages, were submitted by 65 groups from 46 different labs worldwide. In contrast to concurrent protein structure predictions, performance on nucleic acids was generally poor, with no predictions of previously unseen natural RNA structures achieving TM-scores above 0.8. Even though automated server performance has improved, all top-performing groups were human expert predictors: Vfold, GuangzhouRNA-human, and KiharaLab. Good performance on one template-free modeling target (OLE RNA) and accurate global secondary structure prediction suggested that structural information can be extracted from multiple sequence alignments. However, 3D accuracy generally appeared to depend on the availability of closely related 3D structures, and predictions still did not achieve consistent recovery of pseudoknots, singlet Watson-Crick-Franklin pairs, non-canonical pairs, or tertiary motifs like A-minor interactions. For the first time, blind predictions of nucleic acid interactions with small molecules, proteins, and other nucleic acids could be assessed in CASP16. As with nucleic acid monomers, prediction accuracy for nucleic acid complexes was generally poor unless 3D templates were available.

Their strict vertical transmission greatly reduces their effective population size, making selection less efficient and driving a pattern of molecular evolution where genome size reduces. Contrastingly, there are sporadic observations of genome expansion in symbionts from clades where the genome has previously reduced in size. It is currently unclear whether these events are an idiosyncratic consequence of exposure to novel active mobile elements, or are driven by the host context. In this paper, we report the concerted genome expansion of two co-infecting heritable symbionts that supports a host-related driver of expansion. We assembled the genomes of Spiroplasma and Rickettsia bacteria that co-infect the lacewing Mallada desjardinsi. Both symbionts had the largest genome reported to date in their clade, approximately twice the median size for their respective genus. Genome expansion was driven by proliferation of mobile elements in both cases, but the underpinning elements were distinct. The observation that the proximate causes of expansion differed between symbionts led us to reject the hypothesis that concerted expansion was driven by a common mobile element invasion. We hypothesize these processes are driven either by bottleneck events impacting host population size, by the host environment causing stress-induced activation of mobile genetic elements, or by both symbionts having undergone a recent and coincident transition to vertical transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1747087756588

A 90% year on year increase from 2022 to 2023 in prevalence of blaNDM in clinical isolates was identified in a clinical microbiology laboratory serving Merseyside, UK hospitals and GP practices in 2023. We analysed isolates identified to disclose the species and plasmid diversity and to understand the mechanism of dissemination of blaNDM across Merseyside hospitals. Methods: Data regarding the sample type, the isolation date and location of samples was collected and analysed to establish initial transmission hypotheses; 64 Gram-negative bacterial isolates which tested positive for blaNDM using routine diagnostics underwent short read whole-genome sequencing. The samples were derived from seven Merseyside hospitals and a Merseyside GP practice, of these, 24 were also long-read sequenced to produce local reference assemblies and enable us to confidently resolve resistance gene locations and plasmids. Results: Overall, six species were identified, including Enterobacter hormaechei (n=22) Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=21), Escherichia coli (n=15) Citrobacter freundii (n=3), Citrobacter brakii (n=1) and Enterobacter kobei (n=1). Most multi-isolate species belonged to a number of sequence types (IQR, 1-10), apart from K. pneumoniae where 18/21 were ST101. Four variants of blaNDM were identified: blaNDM-1 (n=43), blaNDM-5 (n=12), blaNDM-6 (n=1), blaNDM-14 (n=1), and in six isolates blaNDM was not identified by sequencing. Long-read sequencing of 24 representative isolates found that blaNDM-1 was commonly encoded by a IncHI2/IncHI2A plasmid (82.4%, n=14) whereas blaNDM-5, (n=4) was encoded on different plasmids in each isolate but had the same conserved gene cassette including blaNDM-5 in all instances. Potential evidence of transposition events was noted in two isolates, where blaNDM-1 was found on a small (8.5kbp) untypable plasmid. Conclusions: This study captures an outbreak of blaNDM positive Enterobacterales in Merseyside hospitals and highlights the complex epidemiology of spread mediated both by expansion of successful lineages (K. pneumoniae ST101) and plasmids. A dominant IncHI2/IncHI2A plasmid that has disseminated blaNDM-1 across different species and subsequently led to small clonal outbreaks within-hospitals.

Several mucosal vaccines are in development, and consistent methodologies assessing mucosal IgA are crucial for evaluation across clinical trials.

MethodsWe compared SARS-CoV-2 ancestral spike-specific IgA and secretory IgA (SIgA) in nasal secretions and saliva from 20 adults enrolled at Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, and 23 adults enrolled at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA. Nasal secretions were collected by Nasosorption(R) and nasal swabs, and saliva by passive drooling, Salivette(R), and saliva swabs. Antibody levels were measured in all samples using an electrochemiluminescence assay (ECL) and two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).

FindingsSpike-specific IgA and SIgA levels measured by ECL correlated well with those measured by ELISA across nasal and saliva samples (range 0.42-0.94, p<0.01), except for saliva collected by saliva swabs yielding lower IgA concentrations and weaker correlations (range -0.21-0.27). Spike-specific IgA levels also correlated well across collection methods (range 0.7-0.9, p<0.0001), with a weaker correlation between saliva collected by passive drooling and saliva swab (r=0.55, p<0.001). Although antibody levels correlated well between nasal secretions and saliva collected by passive drooling or Salivette(R) (range 0.64-0.86, p<0.01), they were >3-fold higher in nasal secretions than in saliva (p<0.01).

InterpretationThis multi-center study demonstrates an overall good comparability between spike-specific IgA and SIgA across assays and collection methods, except for saliva swabs. Our findings suggest that nasal secretions may be preferable due to higher spike-specific IgA levels compared to in saliva.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

The analysis incorporated imputation for missing data on race and parametric bootstrapping to account for sampling and imputation uncertainty. We found that legal intervention injury rates remained relatively stable over time, with Black individuals consistently experiencing rates over five times higher than White individuals, and Latinx individuals showing moderately higher rates than Whites with some evidence of decline.

Estimates of long COVID risk after a first COVID-19 infection vary, and data on risk following reinfections remain lacking. Objective: To estimate and compare long COVID risk and severity with first COVID-19 infection versus reinfections among healthcare workers (HCWs). Design: Retrospective cohort study based on an electronic survey among Quebec HCWs conducted between May 16 and June 15, 2023. A short telephone survey among randomly selected non-respondents further assessed potential response bias. Setting: Population-based study in Quebec, Canada. Participants: 397222 HCWs were invited to participate in the electronic survey and 10500 in the telephone survey. Main outcomes and measures: We defined long COVID cases as HCWs self-reporting COVID-19-attributed symptoms lasting [&ge;]12 weeks, classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on perceived symptom intensity. We compared self-reported symptoms and functional limitations of cases to COVID controls (infected participants without long COVID) and non-COVID controls (uninfected participants). Risk and prevalence were estimated by number of infections, likely infecting variant and perceived acute COVID-19 severity. We conducted symptom clustering analyses using unsupervised learning techniques. Results: Estimated long COVID risk following any COVID-19 infection was similar among 22496 online survey participants (17.0% [95%CI, 16.3%-17.6%] and 3978 telephone survey participants (15.9% [14.6%-17.2%]. The cumulative risk increased with the number of infections, but reinfections were associated with three times lower risk of long COVID than first infections. Pre-Omicron infections and severe acute COVID-19 episodes correlated with higher long COVID risk and severity. Among prevalent long COVID cases, 43% were moderate and 33% severe. Compared to controls, dyspnea, neurocognitive symptoms, post-exertional malaise and smell/taste disturbances were most strongly associated with long COVID. Cluster analysis identified seven symptom groups with systemic, neurocognitive, pulmonary, and mood-related clusters being the most prevalent. Severe long COVID cases exhibited multiple symptom clusters and greater functional limitations. Conclusions: Long COVID is a common and disabling condition among HCWs. Societal and healthcare burden remains important and will continue to accrue given ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and long COVID risk with reinfections.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

However, the HAs of Siamese algae-eater influenza-like virus (SAEILV) and chum salmon influenza-like virus (CSILV) bind to 2,3 linked sialic acid. Furthermore, SAEILV HA binds to sialyated Lewis X, is activated by human airway enzymes and is fusogenic at a wide range of pH conditions. SAEILV NA has a highly conserved active site and a similar structure to other known NAs. We also determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the HA of a previously described virus from the same sister clade, the Wuhan spiny eel influenza virus (WSEIV). Importantly, no cross-reactive antibodies against these HAs or NAs were found in the human serum, suggesting that humans are immunologically naive to these viruses.

To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls.

In 2024, IAV H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the United States moved into cattle. While the outbreak is currently of low risk to the public, there is an urgent need to monitor the disease and prevent spread.

MethodsWe conducted a nationwide study evaluating the relationship between H5 hemagglutinin gene RNA concentrations in wastewater and reported outbreaks of IAV H5N1 in animals and humans. We utilized an H5-specific droplet digital RT-PCR test to quantify H5 RNA in wastewater in 40 states across the United States, and 1) examined the temporal association between outbreaks and wastewater detections and 2) utilized linear mixed models (LMM) to determine the relationship between measurements in wastewater and outbreak-related factors in the local area.

ResultsWe find that there is a significant temporal association between wastewater H5 detections and the incidence of outbreaks in poultry and wild birds, but not in cattle or with human infections. However, outbreaks tended to occur at the same time across populations - wild bird detections were also associated with H5N1 in herds, poultry, and humans. Utilizing a LMM, we find that for individual sites, there is a relationship between H5 measurements in wastewater and both poultry outbreaks and the presence of dairy industry locally, but that there was either no relationship or a negative relationship with H5 measurements and either combined systems that accept storm water or those with detection of H5 in wild birds.

ConclusionsThe study highlights how wastewater monitoring can supplement traditional surveillance, providing vital data that reflects public health threats. The findings underscore the potential of scaled wastewater surveillance as a proactive tool in monitoring and managing future outbreaks.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

Low-resource settings face challenges in AI model development due to limited data, small sample sizes, and inconsistent data quality. Moreover, models developed from high-resource settings are often not readily applicable in low-resource contexts. Transfer learning (TL) is an AI technology that adapts established models to new settings and offers a potential solution. This study explores the feasibility of TL in clinical contexts, using neurological outcome prediction for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) as a proof of concept. The Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study (PAROS) network provides a multicenter registry for OHCA across the Asia-Pacific region. We applied TL to adapt a neurological outcome prediction model for OHCA, originally developed using a large Japanese cohort (i.e., the external model), to two PAROS registry countries: Vietnam (243 patients) and Singapore (15,916 patients). Separate TL models, calibrated with local data from Vietnam or Singapore, were developed and compared with the external model. Their predictive performance was then compared with that of the external model. The external model performed poorly on the Vietnam cohort, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.467 (95% CI: 0.141-0.785). The TL-Vietnam model significantly improved performance (AUROC = 0.807, 95% CI: 0.626-0.948). In Singapore, the TL-Singapore model demonstrated modest improvements (AUROC = 0.955, 95% CI: 0.940-0.967), up from 0.945 (95% CI: 0.929-0.958) in the external model. This study highlights the potential of TL to improve prediction accuracy in low-resource settings worldwide, promoting global healthcare equity.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

Although some methods developed in previous studies are available for large-scale data, they do not consider evolutionary times or gene gain/loss are not counted properly. Moreover, the results can be altered just by rotating the phylogenetic tree. Results: We proposed two new phylogenetic methods, Ancestral State Adjustment (ASA) and Simultaneous EVolution test (SEV), which consider the ancestral state of gene presence/absence to evaluate the evolution of ortholog groups (OGs) more properly and guarantee the robustness of the results. In evaluations using three distinct prokaryotic datasets, ASA and SEV showed better performance than methods previously proposed for large-scale data. We compared the functionally related genes detected by each method and found that SEV and its predecessor can identify slowly evolving genes, such as housekeeping genes. In contrast, ASA and its predecessors can detect functionally related genes that tend to be gained or lost in a fixed-order, indicating a strong evolutionary constraint that provides clues for functional prediction. Using matrix multiplication, we showed that SEV is scalable in the latest genome databases.

Deep proteomic profiling of plasma is hindered by the dominance of high-abundant proteins that mask the detection of low-abundant proteins. To overcome this, we compared five plasma protein enrichment methods, MagNet, ENRICHplus, ENRICHiST, EasySep, and EXONET, against neat plasma using LC-MS proteomics. All five methods substantially increased protein identifications, with MagNet, ENRICHplus, EasySep, and EXONET yielding up to 4200 proteins per sample, over 7-fold more than neat plasma, using a 44-minute gradient on the Evosep One and data-independent acquisition on the timsTOF Pro 2. These methods enriched extracellular vesicle-associated proteins while effectively depleting high-abundant proteins. We further optimized the cost-effective MagNet protocol by increasing the plasma-to-bead ratio and automated the workflow, including Evotip loading, on the Biomek i5 liquid handler. Automated MagNet demonstrated high reproducibility and a remarkably low total cost of just a few dollars per sample.

As the hippocampus is pivotal for cognition and dementia, understanding these relations and their specificity for the hippocampus would elucidate microRNA involvement in brain health and neurodegeneration. Here, using population-based data, we cross-sectionally and longitudinally examined the associations of blood-derived microRNAs with left and right hippocampal volume, hippocampal asymmetry, and total brain volume. Expression of microRNAs and their putative target genes was measured at study baseline in whole blood using RNA sequencing. Brain imaging measures were examined at baseline and re-examined 4.60 to 8.02 years later using 3T MRI. We investigated microRNA associations with imaging measures cross-sectionally using linear regression and longitudinally using linear mixed-effect models. Cross-sectionally, six microRNAs (miR-199a-3p, miR-199b-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-6859-5p, miR-505-5p) were associated exclusively with left hippocampal volume. Longitudinally, another five microRNAs (miR-361-3p, miR-4473, miR-381-3p, miR-543, miR-370-3p) were associated with left hippocampal, right hippocampal, and total brain atrophy rates. Twenty-one microRNAs were exclusively associated with total brain atrophy rate. MicroRNAs identified in the cross-sectional analysis regulated target genes involved in brain development, memory, and synapse assembly. MicroRNAs from the longitudinal analysis regulated genes related to axonal and dendritic growth. Our findings suggest an asymmetric and specialized role of the cross-sectional microRNA signature during left hippocampal early-life development and a more universal role of the longitudinal signature during whole-brain aging or neurodegeneration. Importantly, some identified microRNAs have been previously linked to dementia and could be investigated as presymptomatic blood-based biomarkers.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

We investigated whether metabolomic ageing in mid-life is associated with incident dementia and dementia age of onset. We also explored joint associations and interactions with genetic risk, including APOE genotype and dementia polygenic scores. Methods: The UK Biobank is a community-based observational study of middle-aged and older adults. The Nightingale Health platform was used to quantify plasma metabolites at baseline. Metabolomic age (MileAge) delta represents the difference between metabolite-predicted and chronological age. Dementia cases were identified from primary care, hospital inpatient, death registry and self-reported physician diagnosis data. Associations between MileAge delta and incident dementia were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Amongst 223,496 participants, 3976 developed dementia. A metabolite-predicted age exceeding chronological age was associated with higher hazards of all-cause, unspecified and vascular dementia (HR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.28-2.02, p = 0.001). A higher MileAge delta was also associated with an earlier dementia onset. Key contributors to the MileAge clock included lipids, lipoproteins and amino acids, which were also associated with dementia. Genetic risk and MileAge delta were jointly associated with incident dementia. For example, individuals with a MileAge exceeding chronological age and two copies of the APOE e4 allele had 10.27-fold higher hazards of all-cause dementia (95% CI 7.93-13.30, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Metabolomic ageing in mid-life was associated with incident vascular, unspecified and all-cause dementia, as well as an earlier onset, including of Alzheimer's disease. Genetic risk and MileAge delta were jointly associated with incident dementia, likely representing independent pathways.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

This study investigates the workplace support provided to people with Long COVID (PwLC) in the UK, focusing on their return- to-work (RTW) experiences. It encompasses perspectives from both PwLC and managers of PwLC.

MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 PwLC and two managers experienced in managing employees with LC. Thematic analysis was performed using NVivo14.

FindingsThis qualitative research explored barriers and facilitators to supporting PwLCs RTW. LC is characterised by a wide range of mostly ""invisible"" and fluctuating symptoms and unpredictable recovery trajectories during which relapses can occur. Existing support mechanisms for RTW with LC include phased return, reduced hours, Occupational Health services, work adjustments, and government support. However, the study identified challenges in implementing these measures, such as unrealistic phased return plans, managers neglecting advice or guidance (e.g. from Occupational Health), unsuitable work adjustments and the burden of navigating government support. The financial impact of reduced hours or sick leave was one of the main reasons for returning to work. Both PwLC and managers highlighted significant gaps in knowledge, training, policy and guidance for RTW support, emphasising the need for tailored support. Managers reported limited resources and inflexible policies as main challenges, which they addressed through creative solutions.

ConclusionThis qualitative study highlights potential barriers, challenges and gaps in supporting PwLCs RTW. To ensure equitable access to work for PwLC, a flexible and personalised approach is crucial, given the variability in LC symptoms and recovery rates. RTW support that fails to accommodate these characteristics may exacerbate symptoms or cause relapses. A supportive work environment is essential, as LC symptoms can be invisible and concerns about stigma may prevent PwLC from communicating openly and seeking support. Lack of resources is a major barrier for managers in supporting PwLC. Effective government support can potentially fill this gap but must be well-designed and implemented to reduce the burden on applicants.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

This study aimed to understand demand for HIV vaccines currently in development, using behavioral economics, examining cross-cultural differences between Nigerian (n=119) and United States (n=63) participants. They responded to three behavioral economic tasks: a simulated COVID-19 Vaccine Purchase Task (CVPT), HIV Vaccine Purchase Task (HVPT) and the Monetary Probability Discounting Task (MPDT). Demand curves were fitted using an exponentiated model with both purchase tasks demonstrating excellent fit (R^2 = .98). Multiple regression analyses examined relationships between behavioral economic indices and demographic factors. Nigerian participants showed significantly higher price sensitivity for both COVID-19 ({beta}=1.10, p<.001) and HIV vaccines ({beta}=0.90, p=.001) compared to U.S. participants, while baseline demand intensity and risk tolerance were similar between countries. Monetary risk-taking behavior predicted HIV vaccine demand ({beta} = -1.10, p = .02), and higher socioeconomic status was associated with lower price sensitivity ({beta} = -1.09, p = .04). The study demonstrates the utility of behavioral economic frameworks in modeling vaccine demand across cultures, revealing cross-cultural differences in price sensitivity and the potential relationship between COVID-19 and future HIV vaccine acceptance. These findings may have important implications for developing targeted public health interventions and policy frameworks for vaccine distribution, particularly in lower-income populations, to ensure equitable access to future HIV vaccines.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

However, the underlying immunological causes of impaired neutralization remain poorly characterized. Furthermore, non-neutralizing antibody functions can contribute to reduced disease severity but remain understudied within high-risk populations. We dissected polyfunctional antibody responses in STM patients and age-matched controls who received adenoviral vector- or mRNA- based COVID-19 vaccine regimens. Elevated inflammatory biomarkers, including agalactosylated IgG, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, and an expanded population of CD11c-CD21- double negative 3 (DN3) B cells were observed in STM patients. These inflammatory biomarkers were associated with impaired neutralization and reduced IgG targeting the antigenically novel receptor binding domain. In contrast, mRNA vaccination induced Fc effector functions that were comparable in patients and controls and were cross-reactive against SARS-CoV-2 variants, supported by robust generation of IgG against the antigenically conserved spike 2 domain in STM patients. These data highlight the resilience of Fc functional antibodies and identify systemic inflammatory biomarkers that may underpin impaired neutralizing antibody responses, suggesting potential avenues for immunomodulation via rational vaccine design.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

While deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the globus pallidus internus (GPi) can be highly effective for managing tremor, rigidity and limb bradykinesia, its impact on gait remains limited, highlighting the need for dedicated gait therapies. Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS)(R) has been used to improve PD gait parameters, such as cadence and velocity. This pilot study aims to investigate the neurophysiological underpinnings of two RAS approaches: pure rhythmic RAS, which uses metronome-generated beats, and melodic RAS, which incorporates composed music along with rhythmic beats. We will record local field potentials (LFP) from the DBS devices already implanted in individuals with PD as part of their routine care, along with gait parameters, to assess neurophysiological and behavioral responses to RAS. By recording neural signals from the STN and GPi simultaneously with assessment of gait parameters, this study will examine how different RAS paradigms influence motor performance and underlying brain activity. This innovative approach will provide insights into how pure and melodic RAS paradigms modulate neural activity in basal ganglia structures, advancing our understanding of RAS effects on motor function in PD.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

However, its efficacy is often hindered by the fact that normative gait data is almost always used worldwide as a basis for CGA, regardless of differences in critical parameters such as BMI, age, gender, and walking speeds. To address this, we developed multiple regression models for predicting lower limb sagittal kinematic waveforms. We recorded anthropometric, demographic, spatiotemporal, and kinematic data from 30 healthy individuals. Leveraging the gait cycle time and joint angles as dependent variables, and BMI, age, gender, and walking speeds as predictors, we developed 46 regression equations. We employed PCHIP utilizing 80% of the kinematic data to reconstruct the waveforms and validated via leave-one-out cross validation. Our models successfully reconstructed hip, knee, and ankle kinematic waveforms, achieving R2 [&ge;] 0.9 and RMSE [&le;] 6{degrees} from the validation study.

Later, as some of them resisted vaccine mandates, they were reframed as threats, regardless of personal behaviour, workplace setting, or evidence of their harmfulness. This discursive shift and the institutional mechanisms supporting it remain underexamined. Goal: This protocol outlines a mixed-method study investigating the implementation of COVID-19 vaccine mandates in medical establishments across Ontario, Canada. Methods: This is a two-phase mixed methods planned study. Phase 1 is an environmental scan of institutional vaccine mandate policies across a purposive sample of diverse Ontario medical establishments. It will track policy implementation timelines, mandates scope, exemptions eligibility criteria, and supporting scientific evidence presented. Phase 2 is a critical interpretive analysis of documents collected in Phase 1 that draws on the theory of bureaucracy and legitimacy developed by Max Weber, the What Is the Problem Represented to Be (WPR) approach developed by Carol Bacchi, and a framework on suppression of dissent developed by Brian Martin to identify patters in the institutional framing and treatment of challenges to mandated vaccination.

Despite these benefits, widespread adoption is limited by operator dependency, moderate interrater reliability, and training requirements. Deep learning (DL) could potentially address these challenges, but development of effective algorithms is hindered by the scarcity of comprehensive image repositories with proper metadata. Methods: We created an open-source dataset of LUS images derived a multi-center study involving N=226 adult patients presenting with respiratory symptoms to emergency departments between March 2020 and April 2022. Images were acquired using a standardized scanning protocol (12-zone or modified 8-zone) with various point-of-care ultrasound devices. Three blinded researchers independently analyzed each image following consensus guidelines, with disagreements adjudicated to provide definitive interpretations. Videos were pre-processed to remove identifiers, and frames were extracted and resized to 128x128 pixels. Results: The dataset contains 1,874 video clips comprising 303,977 frames. Half of the participants (50%) had COVID-19 pneumonia. Among all clips, 66% contained no abnormalities, 18% contained B-lines, 4.5% contained consolidations, 6.4% contained both B-lines and consolidations, and 5.2% had indeterminate findings. Pathological findings varied significantly by lung zone, with anterior zones more frequently normal and less likely to show consolidations compared to lateral and posterior zones. Discussion: This dataset represents one of the largest annotated LUS repositories to date, including both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. The comprehensive metadata and expert interpretations enhance its utility for DL applications. Despite limitations including potential device-specific characteristics and COVID-19 predominance, this repository provides a valuable resource for developing AI tools to improve LUS acquisition and interpretation.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

While the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) has provided substantial insights into visual processing in humans (Allen et al., 2022), its reliance on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) limits the exploration of individual neuron contributions. To bridge this gap, we present a new dataset: the Triple-N (Non-human Primate Neural Responses to Natural Scenes) dataset, which extends the NSD framework to non-human primates, incorporating single-neuron activity and fMRI recorded from the inferotemporal (IT) cortex. Using Neuropixels probes, we recorded neural responses from five macaques as they passively viewed 1,000 shared NSD images. The dataset includes 59 sessions across 27 sub-regions, capturing over 30,000 visual responsive units. Many recordings were obtained from fMRI-defined category-selective regions, such as face-, body-, scene-, and color-selective areas. Our dataset enables in-depth exploration of neural responses at multiple levels - from population dynamics to single-neuron activity, providing new insights into various aspects of visual processing, including the heterogeneity of object selectivity within functional regions and the temporal dynamics of responses to natural images. Furthermore, the dataset enables joint cross-species analyses, by integrating the macaque neural recordings with human fMRI data, offering a framework for comparing and aligning visual representations across primate species. Overall, our dataset provides a valuable resource for advancing our understanding of visual perception, bridging the gap between large-scale neuroimaging and fine-grained electrophysiological signals, while also facilitating the development of computational models of the high-level visual system.","NA","biorxiv",1747087756588

However, the interpretation of WBS data is often challenged by substantial variability and bias in viral load measurements, which can stem from differences in laboratory protocols, population demographics, and in-sewer fate and transport processes. Methods and Findings: We analysed 23,025 wastewater samples collected between February 2022 and November 2023 from 118 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across Switzerland. Samples of influent wastewater were processed by 8 independent laboratories using distinct concentration, extraction and quantification methods to estimate SARS-CoV-2 concentrations. Concentrations were converted to daily viral loads using wastewater flow rates, and normalized by the size of the population served by the treatment plant. To characterise the contributions of different sources of variation, we applied a Bayesian modelling framework, incorporating fixed effects and spatio-temporal random effects to separate the contributions of laboratory protocols, demographic factors, and geographic structure to the observed variability in SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. Our analysis revealed that laboratory-specific biases were substantial, and that local demographic characteristics (particularly the age structure of the catchment population) also influenced viral load estimates. Adjusting for these sources of bias improved the reliability of interpretations based on viral loads, as indicated by an increased correlation with regional COVID-19 hospitalization data (from 0.55 for raw data to 0.77 for adjusted temporal trends). Dynamic time warping clustering of the adjusted temporal trends uncovered distinct geographic clusters, highlighting persistent spatial structures that evolved over successive epidemic phases. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that variability in WBS data during the 2022-2023 Swiss national SARS-CoV-2 surveillance campaign is driven by a complex interplay of laboratory methods, population demographics, and spatio-temporal dynamics. Standardization of laboratory protocols and the implementation of robust statistical adjustment methods such as the one demonstrated here can enhance the reliability of WBS as a public health surveillance tool. These findings provide underscore the importance of advanced data processing methods for enhancing future surveillance efforts and for the effective integration of wastewater data into public health decision-making frameworks.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

Effector CD4+ T cells (CD4+ Teffs) are critical for antitumor immunity, but their function is often inhibited by regulatory T cells (Tregs), which accumulate in lung tumors and perform suppressive functions through multiple mechanisms. This suppression leads to tumor progression and poor patient outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying Treg-mediated suppression are not fully understood. Here, we identify the extracellular ATP receptor P2RX7 as a key regulator of Treg function in lung tumors. Using a murine lung cancer model induced by Lewis lung carcinoma cells, we demonstrate that P2RX7 enhances the suppressive capacity of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, promoting tumor growth. In T cell-specific P2RX7-KO mice, reduced Treg infiltration was accompanied by increased CD4+ Teff accumulation and improved tumor control. Treg-specific P2RX7-KO mice exhibit reduced tumor growth, confirming a cell-intrinsic role of P2RX7 in Tregs. Suppression assays revealed that tumor-infiltrating WT Tregs have greater suppressive activity compared to P2RX7-KO Tregs, which failed to inhibit type 1 and Tfh-like responses. This was associated with increased tumor-specific IgG production by lung B cells in P2RX7-KO mice. We also observed that WT Tregs express higher levels of the immunosuppressive surface molecule CTLA-4 when compared to P2RX7-KO Tregs. In summary, we show that P2RX7 expression on Tregs is essential for their suppressive function in lung cancer, and targeting of P2RX7 may constitute a novel strategy to improve lung cancer treatment by alleviating Treg-mediated immune suppression.","NA","biorxiv",1747087756588

Both protein RNAi factors and miRNAs, however, are present in mammalian cell nuclei. It is unclear how this nuclear localization affects endogenous gene expression. Here, we use chimeric eCLIP to identify complexes of Argonaute 2 (AGO2) and miRNAs. We identify the most abundant miRNAs associated with chromatin and their chromatin-associated RNA targets. Chimeric eCLIP revealed that High mobility group AT-Hook A (HMGA2) was the most compelling target for miRNA-mediated gene binding. There are four confirmed let-7 miRNA sites within the 3-UTR in the cytoplasm or nucleus and three within chromatin-associated RNA. The expression of mature HMGA2 mRNA was repressed by let-7 in the cytoplasm and nucleus. let-7 had little effect splicing or transcription. Our data validate chimeric eCLIP as a powerful method for experimentally identifying promising miRNA:RNA interactions. Rather than a solely cytoplasmic event, binding of RNAi factors to mRNA targets may begin in the nucleus through a mechanism that can reduce RNA levels in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. miRNA-mediated silencing of mRNAs may be influenced by both nuclear and cytoplasmic interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1747087756588

However, the lack of scalable and efficient methods to integrate large-scale multi-omics data limits deeper insights into xQTL regulation. Here, we propose ColocBoost, a multi-task learning colocalization method that can scale to hundreds of traits, while accounting for multiple causal variants within a genomic region of interest. ColocBoost employs a specialized gradient boosting framework that can adaptively couple colocalized traits while performing causal variant selection, thereby enhancing the detection of weaker shared signals compared to existing pairwise and multi-trait colocalization methods. We applied ColocBoost genome-wide to 17 gene-level single-nucleus and bulk xQTL data from the aging brain cortex of ROSMAP individuals (average N = 595), encompassing 6 cell types, 3 brain regions and 3 molecular modalities (expression, splicing, and protein abundance). Across molecular xQTLs, ColocBoost identified 16,503 distinct colocalization events, exhibiting 10.7({+/-} 0.74)-fold enrichment for heritability across 57 complex diseases/traits and showing strong concordance with element-gene pairs validated by CRISPR screening assays. When colocalized against Alzheimers disease (AD) GWAS, ColocBoost identified up to 2.5-fold more distinct colocalized loci, explaining twice the AD disease heritability compared to fine-mapping without xQTL integration. This improvement is largely attributable to ColocBoosts enhanced sensitivity in detecting gene-distal colocalizations, as supported by strong concordance with known enhancer-gene links, highlighting its ability to identify biologically plausible AD susceptibility loci with underlying regulatory mechanisms. Notably, several genes including BLNK and CTSH showed sub-threshold associations in GWAS, but were identified through multi-omics colocalizations which provide new functional support for their involvement in AD pathogenesis.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

The disease mechanism of ME/CFS is unknown, with no effective curative treatments. In this study, we present a multi-site ME/CFS whole-genome analysis, which is powered by a novel deep learning framework, HEAL2. We show that HEAL2 not only has predictive value for ME/CFS based on personal rare variants, but also links genetic risk to various ME/CFS-associated symptoms. Model interpretation of HEAL2 identifies 115 ME/CFS-risk genes that exhibit significant intolerance to loss-of-function (LoF) mutations. Transcriptome and network analyses highlight the functional importance of these genes across a wide range of tissues and cell types, including the central nervous system (CNS) and immune cells. Patient-derived multi-omics data implicate reduced expression of ME/CFS risk genes within ME/CFS patients, including in the plasma proteome, and the transcriptomes of B and T cells, especially cytotoxic CD4 T cells, supporting their disease relevance. Pan-phenotype analysis of ME/CFS genes further reveals the genetic correlation between ME/CFS and other complex diseases and traits, including depression and long COVID-19. Overall, HEAL2 provides a candidate genetic-based diagnostic tool for ME/CFS, and our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the genetic, molecular, and cellular basis of ME/CFS, yielding novel insights into therapeutic targets. Our deep learning model also offers a potent, broadly applicable framework for parallel rare variant analysis and genetic prediction for other complex diseases and traits.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

Sex and gender mandates were introduced in grant competitions to increase womens health research. This study aimed to understand what type of womens health research is being funded and prioritized in open grant competitions in Canada.

MethodsPublicly available funded Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) project grant abstracts from 2020 and 2023 were coded for the mention of sex, gender, two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer plus (2S/LGBTQ+), and female-specific research and assessed for changes in research representation and funding. A deeper analysis of funded female-specific grant abstracts from 2023 and 2009-2020 was conducted to assess if grant abstracts focused on the 11 areas of global disease burden and death that disproportionately affect females, and if this has evolved over time.

ResultsThe percentage of abstracts mentioning sex, gender and 2S/LGBTQ+ doubled or quadrupled from 2020 to 2023, but remained at under 10% of overall funded abstracts. In contrast, female-specific research representation did not change over time, and remained at [~]7% of all research. Importantly, female-specific research largely focused on cancers (breast, gynecologic) or pregnancy. We also examined research funding representation for the top 11 global burden of disease or death for females across the 13 years and observed that cancer accounted for 2.07% of funding, whereas the other top 10 collectively accounted for 2.21% across 13 years.

ConclusionsDespite mandates for integrated sex and gender based analyses in Canada, research acknowledging which population is explored remains under 10%. Mandates are not affecting the percentage of funding for womens health grants. More efforts and support beyond sex and gender mandates are needed to increase funding for and to diversify female-specific research beyond pregnancy and cancer. Research devoted to womens health factors is key to achieving personalized medicine and improved health outcomes for everyone.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

Starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in the mammalian retina have a highly stereotyped, radially symmetric dendritic arbor that is essential for their role in direction-selective circuits in the retina. We show that PTEN, the primary negative regulator of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway that is highly implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, regulates SAC morphology in a cell-autonomous manner.

Pten-deficient SACs show a nearly twofold increase in the number of dendritic branches, while other morphological properties remain largely unchanged. These morphological changes arise late in SAC development after dendrite development is largely complete and persist into adulthood. Mechanistically, excessive dendritic branching appears to arise from dysregulated mTOR activity. Despite this dramatic increase in dendritic branches, Pten-deficient SACs maintain a normal population number, organization of synaptic outputs, and intact direction-selectivity in the retina. Collectively, these results show that PTEN is essential for the normal development of highly stereotyped neuronal morphology.","NA","biorxiv",1747087756588

Nasal anti-CD3 treats animal models of progressive MS by inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and lessen clinical disease.

MethodsTen patients with non-active secondary progressive MS (naSPMS) that continued to progress on B cell therapy were treated with nasal anti-CD3 (foralumab) for a minimum of six months in an open label study. Safety monitoring included otolaryngology evaluation and neurologic assessments including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC-4), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) and Low Contract Visual Acuity (LCVA). MRI and microglial translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging with [F-18]PBR06 were conducted. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic biomarkers and single cell RNA sequencing of blood was performed to evaluate foralumab-induced immunomodulation. The endpoints of our study were safety, clinical effects, microglial signal and immune measures.

ResultsAll patients stabilized on EDSS scores and three of four patients treated continuously for 12 months had improvement on EDSS. Six of 10 patients had improvement in fatigue on the MFIS scale. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) or severe AEs and no new T2 lesions were observed on MRI. There was a reduction in TSPO-PET signal over six months (p<0.05). Changes in peripheral blood gene expression occurred as early as three months and affected antigen presentation, interferon responses and regulatory pathways in multiple cell types including FoxP3+ Tregs, CD4+ Tcm cells, CD8+ Tem cells, CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes and B cells. TGF{beta} expression was increased across cell multiple subsets.

InterpretationThese findings identify a novel, non-toxic immune based therapy for the treatment for PIRA that acts by the induction of a regulatory immune responses and dampens microglial inflammation. Double blind placebo-controlled trials are warranted to explore nasal foralumab for the treatment of naSPMS.","NA","medrxiv",1747087756588

We present a methodological platform that enables segment-resolved profiling of mitochondrial respiration, conductance, and membrane potential in freshly isolated mouse nephron segments. Combining mechanical sieving and adhesion-based enrichment with permeabilized high-resolution respirometry, we adapted the creatine kinase clamp to quantify oxygen flux and mitochondrial membrane potential across defined free energies. Using this approach, we found that proximal tubules exhibit high respiratory conductance and dynamic mitochondrial polarization, while distal tubules and glomeruli maintain static membrane potential and low conductance. In a model of adenine-induced nephropathy, only proximal tubule mitochondria showed marked reductions in respiration and ATP production. This segment-specific dysfunction was not detectable in bulk mitochondrial isolates. Our approach provides thermodynamically anchored, segment-resolved insight into mitochondrial adaptation under physiological and pathological conditions. It is broadly applicable to other tissues with metabolic heterogeneity and compatible with disease models, genetic tools, and pharmacological interventions. This platform bridges a critical gap between conventional respirometry and functional mitochondrial phenotyping in native tissue structures.","NA","biorxiv",1747087756588
