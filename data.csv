Here, we engineered pluripotent stem cells in which cohesin loop extrusion can be inducibly disrupted without causing confounding cell cycle defects. While evident, transcriptional dysregulation was cell-type specific, and not all loci with distal enhancers depend equally on cohesin extrusion. Using comparative genome editing, we demonstrate that enhancer-promoter communication across as little as 20 kilobases can rely on cohesin. However, promoter-proximal regulatory elements can support long-range, cohesin-independent enhancer action - either upon disabling extrusion or across strong CTCF insulators. Finally, transcriptional dynamics and the emergence of new embryonic cell types in response to differentiation cues remained largely robust to disrupting cohesin extrusion. Beyond establishing novel experimental strategies to study cohesin functions in enhancer biology, our work provides mechanistic insight accounting for both cell type- and genomic context-specificity.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

Objective: This SLR summarizes the evidence across studies among predominately adults that report an adjusted measure of association for the relationship between vaccination and PCC, by timing of vaccination relative to infection or PCC onset and across different study characteristics. Evidence review: A comprehensive search strategy was developed within the OVID platform across EMBASE, MEDLINE and Evidence Based Medicine reviews, and supplemented with WHO COVID library and Google Scholar searches, to collate evidence on vaccination and PCC published or posted as pre prints between January 1st, 2020 and July 18th, 2023. JBI Critical Appraisal Checklists were used to assess each study's risk of bias. Findings: This review included 97 studies and synthesized results from 56 studies with low risk of bias that reported adjusted measures for the association between vaccination and PCC. Overall, 77% of pre infection adjusted VE (aVE) estimates (vs. unvaccinated) were statistically significant (range: 7% to 95%), 80% of estimates reflecting a mix of those vaccinated before and after infection were statistically significant (range: 62% to 73%), one of five estimates reflecting vaccination after PCC onset was statistically significant (aVE=41%), 43% of post infection vaccination estimates were statistically significant (two were protective [range: 28% to 40%] and one was not [aVE= minus 47%]), and 46% of estimates not specifying vaccination timing were statistically significant (23 were protective [range: 29% to 75%] and one was not [aVE= minus 132%]). Statistically significant pre-infection aVE estimates were slightly higher for mRNA (range: 14% to 84%) than non mRNA vaccines (range: 16% to 38%) and aVE ranges during (4 studies; range: 10% to 70%) and before Omicron predominance (10 studies; range: 7% to 50%) overlapped. Pre-infection vaccination was protective regardless of vaccine type, number of doses received, PCC definition, predominant variant, and severity of acute infections included. Conclusions and Relevance: Collectively our findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination received prior to SARS CoV 2 infection reduces the subsequent risk of developing PCC regardless of the predominant variant circulating.","NA","medrxiv",1728252541579

PC states that the brain computes internal models of expected events and responds robustly to unexpected stimuli with prediction errors that feed forward. This can be studied using oddball tasks. A repetitive sequence interrupted by a novel stimulus is a ""local"" oddball. ""Global"" oddballs defy expectations while repeating the local context. This dissociates expectation-driven neuronal prediction error responses vs. merely stimulus-history-driven release from adaptation. We recorded neuron spiking activity across the visual hierarchy in mice and monkeys viewing these oddballs. Local oddball responses largely followed PC hypotheses. They were robust, emerged early in layers 2/3, and fed forward. Global oddball responses challenged PC. They were weak, absent in most visual areas, more robust in prefrontal cortex, and emerged in non-granular layers. Contrary to the most popular PC models that emphasize prediction error computations occurring in early sensory areas and feeding forward, this implies that genuine predictive coding computations take place in more cognitive, higher-order areas.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

This study evaluates the value of using Google Trends indices of dengue-related keywords to complement official dengue data for nowcasting dengue in Brazil, a country frequently affected by this disease. We compare various nowcasting approaches that incorporate autoregressive features from official dengue cases, Google Trends data, and a combination of both, using a naive approach as a baseline. The performance of these methods is evaluated by nowcasting weekly dengue cases from March to June 2024 across Brazilian states. Error measures and 95% coverage probabilities reveal that models incorporating Google Trends data enhance the accuracy of weekly nowcasts across states and offer valuable insights into dengue activity levels. To support real-time decision-making, we also present Dengue Tracker, a website that displays weekly dengue nowcasts and trends to inform both decision-makers and the public, improving situational awareness of dengue activity.

Author summaryDengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that poses significant public health challenges in tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide. Surveillance systems are crucial for dengue prevention and control. Unfortunately, traditional systems often rely on delayed data, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, nowcasting methods are needed to estimate underreported cases, enabling more timely decision-making. This study evaluates how Google Trends indices of dengue-related keywords can complement official dengue data to improve nowcasting of dengue in Brazil, a country frequently affected by this disease. We compare the performance of various nowcasting approaches that incorporate Google Trends data with other approaches that rely solely on official reported cases data, assessing their accuracy and uncertainty in nowcasting weekly dengue cases from March to June 2024 across Brazilian states. To support real-time decision-making, we also present Dengue Tracker, a website that displays weekly dengue nowcasts offering valuable insights into dengue activity levels. The study demonstrates the potential of digital data sources in enhancing traditional surveillance systems for better-informed decision-making.","NA","medrxiv",1728252541579

However, in such experiments high-fat diet is typically provided freely to animals, so it remains unclear how increasing dietary fat would impact body weight if the high-fat diet required more effort to obtain. Here, we hypothesized that unrestricted access is necessary for mice to overeat high fat diets, and the corollary that requiring mice to perform small amounts of work to obtain high-fat diets would reduce food intake and weight gain in a high-fat diet model of obesity. To test this hypothesis, we utilized home-cage-based feeding devices that either provided food freely or required mice to briefly poke their noses into a port - a simple action that is easy for them to do - to receive food. With both low-fat and high fat diets, requiring mice to nose-poke just one time to access food strongly reduced food intake, and in the case of high-fat diet, prevented the development of obesity. We conclude that unrestricted access to food promotes overeating in mice, and that making mice perform a simple action such as a nose-poke to access food reduces over eating and weight gain. We posit that ubiquitous access to low-cost food is a critical contributor to the human obesity epidemic, and that changes in the availability of unhealthy food may be part of the solution for addressing the obesity epidemic.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

Biomolecular condensates, which have emerged as key principles of cellular organization, are suggested to provide robustness to cells, yet they can also respond sensitively to small changes in environmental conditions - or tagging of their components, as our findings suggest. Here, we investigated the effects of sixteen widely used tags on condensate formation in various model organisms, in vitro, in cells and by computational modelling. We find that tagging strongly influenced condensation for some proteins, while others remained unaffected. Effects varied, with some tags enhancing and others decreasing condensation, and depended on the protein being tagged. Coarse-grained simulations suggest that the charge of the fluorescent protein tags is a critical factor modulating condensation behavior. Together, our results underscore the importance of rigorous experimental design and interpretation in condensate experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

Objective: This study aimed to verify the association between SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of Stroke, based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, in order to assess the inclusion of the virus as a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. Methods: A metaumbrella was conducted, which included 34 systematic reviews, of which 4 were selected for the final analysis based on methodological quality and consistency. The analysis aggregated the results of 70 primary studies, considering different stroke subtypes and outcomes associated with COVID-19. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 index, and significance bias was verified using Egger's test. Results: The analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 is significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 1.55 - 3.95), particularly for ischemic stroke (eOR = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.80) and hemorrhagic stroke (eOR = 3.86; 95%CI: 1.79 - 8.33).

Here, we investigate the longstanding question of how, and indeed whether, G3BPs and SGs shape the stress translation response. We find that SGs are enriched for mRNAs that are resistant to the stress-induced translation shutdown. Although the accurate recruitment of these stress-resistant mRNAs does require the context of stress, a combination of optogenetic tools and spike-normalized ribosome profiling demonstrates that G3BPs and SGs are necessary and sufficient to both help prioritize the translation of their enriched mRNAs and help suppress cytosolic translation. Together these results support a model in which G3BPs and SGs reinforce the stress translation program by prioritizing the translation of their resident mRNAs.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

Here, we utilized acute depletion of NIPBL to characterize the role of cohesin-mediated loop extrusion in vivo. Using this approach, we found that many chromatin loops are rapidly diminished upon loss of NIBPL, consistent with recent single locus imaging studies showing that chromatin loops are transient. However, we also identified cohesin-dependent chromatin loops that are associated with distinct chromatin states and may be long-lived, given that they require NIPBL for their establishment upon mitotic exit, but are persistent when NIPBL is depleted from interphase cells. In addition to the reformation of 3D genome structures, mitotic exit coincides with widespread transcriptional activation. We found that NIPBL is essential for establishing the expression of lineage-defining genes during the M-G1 transition but has diminished impact on the steady-state maintenance of their expression. At genes sensitive to its depletion, NIPBL supports a unique local genome organization defined by greater spatial proximity to nearby super-enhancers and weaker transcription start site insulation of genomic contacts. Overall, we show that NIPBL-mediated loop extrusion is critical to genome organization and transcription regulation in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

While most of these features have been extensively characterized, the determinants of plasmid copy number (PCN) remain poorly understood. Here, we leveraged extensive DNA sequencing data to comprehensively analyze the copy number of thousands of diverse bacterial plasmids. We found that the copy number of natural plasmids is highly variable, spanning nearly three orders of magnitude, and that it is intrinsically robust against changes in genomic context. We further show that PCN variability is tightly associated with plasmid lifestyles and develop the concept of replicon dominance to explain interactions in widespread multi-replicon plasmids. Finally, we uncover a universal scaling law that links copy number and plasmid size across phylogenetic boundaries, indicating that pervasive constraints orchestrate the PCN-size trade-off. Altogether, our work pioneers large-scale analyses of PCN while uncovering the fundamental rules that govern plasmid biology.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

These phenotypes are heterogeneous, dependent on the cell type arrested and the insult inciting arrest. Because a universal biomarker for CS has yet to be identified, combinations of senescence-associated biomarkers linked to various biological stress responses including lysosomal activity ({beta}-galactosidase staining), inflammation (senescence-associated secretory phenotypes, SASPs), and apoptosis (senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways) are used to identify senescent cells. Using in vitro human bulk RNA-seq datasets, we find that senescent states enrich for various stress responses in a cell-type, temporal, and insult-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that various gene signatures used to identify senescent cells in the literature also enrich for stress responses, and are inadequate for universally and exclusively identifying senescent samples. Genes regulating stress responses - including transcription factors and genes controlling chromatin accessibility - are contextually differentially expressed, along with key enzymes involved in metabolism across arrest phenotypes. Additionally, significant numbers of SASP proteins can be predicted from senescent cell transcriptomes and also heterogeneously enrich for various stress responses in a context-dependent manner. We propose that 'senescence' cannot be meaningfully defined due to the lack of underlying preserved biology across senescent states, and CS is instead a mosaic of stress-induced phenotypes regulated by various factors, including metabolism, TFs, and chromatin accessibility. We introduce the concept of Stress Response Modules, clusters of genes modulating stress responses, and present a new model of CS and CQ induction conceptualised as the differential activation of these clusters.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

In particular, the relationship between neuronal cell types, networks and function has been difficult to establish. Here, we propose principles by which functions arise primarily from spatial features of the cord. First, we suggest that distinct cell types with dissimilar length of projection constitute an asymmetrical ""Mexican hat"" topology, i.e. local excitation and surrounding inhibition, along the rostro-caudal axis. Second, the transversal segregation of cell types conveniently allows synapses to form with appropriate targets. We demonstrate these principles in a model of the mouse spinal cord, where networks are constructed by probabilistic sampling of synaptic connections from cell-specific projection patterns, which are gleaned from literature. The cell-type distributions are derived from single-cell RNA sequencing combined with spatial transcriptomics. We find that essential aspects of locomotion are recapitulated and easily controlled, and several experimental observations can now be explained mechanistically. Further, two main features are predicted: propagating bumps of neural activity and asymmetric neuronal projections with local excitation and wider inhibition. Besides linking cell types, structure and function, our approach provides a unifying framework for understanding motor activity across limbed and undulatory species.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

To address these issues, we present a computationally efficient pre-processing pipeline for subcellular signal detection, movement artifact identification, and ROI grouping. For subcellular signal detection, we capture the frequency profile of calcium transient dynamics by applying Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on smoothed time-series calcium traces collected from axon ROIs. We then apply band-pass filtering methods (e.g. 0.05 to 0.12 Hz) to select ROIs that contain frequencies that match the power band of transients. To remove motion artifacts from z-plane movement, we apply Principal Component Analysis on all calcium traces and use a Bottom-Up Segmentation change-point detection model on the first principal component. After removing movement artifacts, we further identify calcium transients from noise by analyzing their prominence and duration. Finally, ROIs with high activity correlation are grouped using hierarchical or k-means clustering. Using axon ROIs in the CA1 region, we confirm that both clustering methods effectively determine the optimal number of clusters in pairwise correlation matrices, yielding similar groupings to ""ground truth"" data. Our approach provides a guideline for standardizing the extraction of physiological signals from subcellular compartments during behavior with 2-photon calcium imaging.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

How these GTPases are appropriately positioned at the opposite poles of a migrating cell is unknown. Here we leverage optogenetics, manipulation of cell mechanics, and mathematical modeling to reveal a surprising long-range mutual activation of the front and back polarity programs that complements their well-known local mutual inhibition. This long-range activation is rooted in two distinct modes of mechanochemical crosstalk. Local Rac-based protrusion stimulates Rho activation at the opposite side of the cell via membrane tension-based activation of mTORC2. Conversely, local Rho-based contraction induces cortical-flow-based remodeling of membrane-to-cortex interactions leading to PIP2 release, PIP3 generation, and Rac activation at the opposite side of the cell. We develop a minimal unifying mechanochemical model of the cell to explain how this long-range mechanical facilitation complements local biochemical inhibition to enable robust global Rho and Rac partitioning. Finally, we validate the importance of this long-range facilitation in the context of chemoattractant-based cell polarization and migration in primary human lymphocytes. Our findings demonstrate that the actin cortex and plasma membrane function as an integrated mechanochemical system for long-range partitioning of Rac and Rho during cell migration and likely other cellular contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

Stamping cells in suspension onto imaging slides, STAMP supports single-modal (RNA or protein) and multimodal (RNA and protein) profiling and flexible, ultra-high-throughput formats. STAMP allows the analysis of a single or multiple samples within the same experiment, enhancing experimental flexibility, throughput and scale. We tested STAMP with diverse sample types, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), dissociated cancer cells and differentiated embryonic stem cell cultures, as well as whole cells and nuclei. Combining RNA and protein profiling, we applied immuno-phenotyping of millions of blood cells simultaneously. We also used STAMP to identify ultra-rare cell populations, simulating clinical applications to identify circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Performing in vitro differentiation studies, we further showed its potential for large-scale perturbation studies. Together, STAMP establishes a new standard for cost-effective, scalable single-cell analysis. Without the need for sequencing, STAMP makes high-resolution profiling more affordable and accessible. Designed to meet the needs of research labs, diagnostic cores and pharmaceutical companies, STAMP holds the promise to transform our capacity to map human biology, diagnose diseases and drug discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

Epidemiological investigations consistently demonstrate an overrepresentation of the elderly in COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities. Despite this, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms explaining how old age constitutes a critical risk factor remains elusive. To unravel this, we designed an animal study, juxtaposing the course of COVID-19 in young adults (2 months) and geriatric (15-22 months) mice. Both groups of K18(hACE2) mice were intranasally exposed to 500 TCID50 of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with a variety of outcomes assessed on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infections (DPI). Analyses included pulmonary cytokines, RNA, viral loads, lipidomic profiles, and histological assessments, with a concurrent evaluation of the percentage of mice reaching humane endpoints. The findings unveiled notable distinctions between the two groups, with aged mice exhibiting impaired viral clearance at 7 DPI, correlating with diminished survival rates together with an absence of weight loss recovery at 6-7 DPI. Additionally, elderly-infected mice exhibited a deficient Th1 response characterized by diminished productions of IFNg, CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL9 relative to younger mice. Furthermore, mass-spectrometry analysis of the lung lipidome indicated altered expression of several lipids with immunomodulatory and pro-resolution effects in aged mice such as Resolvin, HOTrEs, and NeuroP, but also DiHOMEs-related ARDS. Collectively, disease severity implies a dysregulation of the antiviral response in elderly-infected mice relative to younger mice, resulting in compromised viral clearance and a more unfavorable prognosis. This underscores the potential efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments for elderly subjects experiencing symptoms of severe COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

Within seconds after damage, cells in neighbouring unwounded roots sense the acidification and activate tissue-specific Ca2+ damage signalling.

However, rationally creating enzymes with high activity comparable to most naturally occurring enzymes remains challenging. Here, we attempted to design an ATPase de novo, through the exploration of an optimal backbone blueprint to incorporate a conserved phosphate binding motif, the P-loop, into designed structures. The designed protein, based on the identified blueprint, was found to be a monomer with high thermal stability, and exhibited the ATPase ability. The crystal structure was closely matched to the design model, both at the overall structure level and within the P-loop motif. Interestingly, AlphaFold was not able to predict the designed structure accurately, indicating the difficulties of predicting folded structures for novel protein sequences. Remarkably, the designed protein exhibited ATPase ability even at temperatures around 100 {degrees}C, with significantly increased activity. However, the ATPase activity was still not comparable to those of naturally occurring enzymes. This suggests that the P-loop motif alone is insufficient to achieve the high ATPase activity seen in naturally occurring enzymes, indicating that other structural components are necessary to reach such activity levels.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

The importance of PTEN signaling is evident from the broad spectrum of human pathologies associated with its loss of function. Moreover, loss or gain of PTEN function in animal models leads to aberrant cellular morphology, function, and metabolic regulation. However, despite the important role of PTEN signaling, there is currently no method to dynamically monitor its activity with cellular specificity within intact biological systems. Here, we describe the development of a novel PTEN biosensor, optimized for two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (2pFLIM). This biosensor is designed to measure PTEN activity within intact cells, tissues, and organisms. Our approach is based on monitoring FRET-dependent changes in PTEN conformation, which serves as a proxy for the activity state in living cells. We identify a point mutation that allow us to express this biosensor with minimal interference to endogenous PTEN signaling and cellular function. We demonstrate the utility of imaging PTEN signaling in cell lines, developing C. elegans, and in the living mouse brain. To complement this approach, we developed a red-shifted PTEN sensor variant that permits simultaneous imaging with GFP-based sensors. Finally, we use in vivo PTEN imaging in the mouse brain to identify cell-type specific dynamics of PTEN activity in excitatory and inhibitory cortical cells. In summary, our approach enables dynamic imaging of PTEN activity in vivo with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

In recent years, genome-wide studies have used catalogs ranging in size from fewer than 200,000 to over 7 million loci. Where these catalogs overlapped, they often disagreed on locus boundaries, hindering the comparison and reuse of results across studies. Now, with multiple groups developing public databases of TR variation in large population cohorts, there is a risk that, without sufficient consensus in the choice of locus definitions, the use of divergent repeat catalogs will lead to confusion, fragmentation, and incompatibility across future resources. In this paper, we compare existing TR catalogs and discuss desirable features of a comprehensive genome-wide catalog. We then present a new, richly annotated catalog designed for large-scale analyses and population databases. Our catalog stratifies TRs into two groups: 1) isolated TRs suitable for repeat copy number analysis using short read or long read data and 2) so-called variation clusters that contain TRs within wider polymorphic regions that are best studied through sequence-level analysis. To define variation clusters, we present a novel algorithm that leverages long-read HiFi sequencing data to group repeats with surrounding polymorphisms. We show that the human genome contains at least 25,000 complex variation clusters, most of which span over 120 bp and contain five or more TRs. Resolving the sequence of entire variation clusters instead of individually genotyping constituent TRs leads to a more accurate analysis of these regions and enables us to profile variation that would have been missed otherwise.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

Despite inherent thermal instability of individual proteins at body temperature, collagen manages to assemble into higher-order structures that provide mechanical support to tissues. Sequence features that enhance collagen stability have been deduced largely from studies of collagen-mimetic peptides, as the large sizes of collagens have precluded high-resolution studies of their structure. Thus, there is a need for new methods to analyze the structure and mechanics of native collagen proteins. In this study, we used AFM imaging to investigate the temperature response of collagen types I, III and particularly IV. We observed a time-dependent loss of folded structures upon exposure to body temperature, with structural destabilization along the collagenous domain reflected by a shorter overall contour length. We characterized the sequence-dependent bending stiffness profile of collagen IV as a function of temperature and identified a putative initiation site for thermally induced unfolding. Interchain disulfide bonds in collagen IV were shown to enhance thermal stability and serve as the primary nucleation sites for in vitro refolding. In contrast to the canonical C-to-N terminal folding direction, we found an interchain cystine knot to enable folding in the opposite direction. Multiple sequence alignments revealed that this cystine knot is evolutionarily conserved across metazoan phyla, highlighting its significance in the stabilization of early collagen IV structures. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the unfolding and refolding pathway of collagen IV, providing valuable insight into how its heterogeneous sequence influences stability and mechanics.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

We investigated the pandemics impact on brain ageing using longitudinal neuroimaging data from the UK Biobank.

These models were then applied to an independent cohort of 1,336 participants with two MRI scans: either both collected before the pandemic (""Control"" groups), or one before and one after the pandemic onset (""Pandemic"" group). Our findings reveal that, even with initially matched brain age gaps (predicted brain age vs. chronological age), the pandemic significantly accelerated brain ageing. The ""Pandemic"" group showed on average 11-month higher deviation of brain age gap at the second time point compared with controls. Accelerated brain ageing was more pronounced in males and those from deprived socio-demographic backgrounds, with average increases of 3.3 and 7 months, respectively. These deviations existed regardless of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, accelerated brain ageing correlated with reduced cognitive performance only in COVID-infected participants.

We use computationally tractable, yet biologically realistic phenotypes in the form of RNA secondary structures, and model plasticity by considering the Boltzmann distribution of secondary structures for a given genotype. Using evolutionary simulations we show that phenotypes of high plasticity emerge in rapidly changing environments. These phenotypes have near-equal Boltzmann probabilities of two different target structures, which are the fittest structures in the two environments between which we alternate during the evolutionary process. Plasticity therefore provides an optimal evolutionary response to fluctuating environmental conditions. Additionally, we find that solutions of high plasticity are more likely to be found for target pairs of higher structural similarity and phenotypic frequency.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

Here, we demonstrate a ""brain-to-voice"" neuroprosthesis that instantaneously synthesizes voice with closed-loop audio feedback by decoding neural activity from 256 microelectrodes implanted into the ventral precentral gyrus of a man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and severe dysarthria. We overcame the challenge of lacking ground-truth speech for training the neural decoder and were able to accurately synthesize his voice. Along with phonemic content, we were also able to decode paralinguistic features from intracortical activity, enabling the participant to modulate his BCI-synthesized voice in real-time to change intonation, emphasize words, and sing short melodies. These results demonstrate the feasibility of enabling people with paralysis to speak intelligibly and expressively through a BCI.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

With growing knowledge of the genetic basis for PAD and related risk factors, this study sought to construct a new polygenic score for PAD (GPSPAD). Methods: GPSPAD was constructed by integrating multi-ancestry summary statistics for PAD and related traits. GPSPAD was trained in a UK Biobank dataset of 96,239 individuals and validated in a holdout UK Biobank dataset (N=304,294) and All of Us (AoU; N=237,173) and Mass General Brigham Biobank (MGBB, N=37,017). Results: GPSPAD was associated with an OR-per SD increase of 1.64 in the UK Biobank dataset (95% CI 1.60-1.68). Compared to previously published PAD polygenic scores, GPSPAD was more strongly associated with PAD in AoU and MGBB, including enhanced transferability to non-European subgroups. GPSPAD improved discrimination of incident PAD ({Delta}C-statistic 0.030) that was nearly equivalent to the additive performances of diabetes ({Delta}C-statistic 0.029) and smoking ({Delta}C-statistic 0.034). GPSPAD was associated with reduced ankle-brachial index in the MGBB with the top 8% of individuals having a mean ABI <0.90 when assessed. Among individuals with prevalent PAD, GPSPAD consistently identified individuals at high MALE-risk in the UK Biobank (HR 1.48; 95% CI 1.24-1.77), MGBB, (HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.12-1.60), and AoU (HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.12-1.58). Conclusions: An integrated, multi-ancestry polygenic score for PAD predicts disease and adverse limb outcomes in three diverse cohorts. Incorporating polygenic risk into PAD care has the potential to guide screening and tailor management to prevent MALE.","NA","medrxiv",1728252541579

To achieve this, we needed five types of improvements: 1) optimization of aaRS sequences for efficient translation, 2) optimization of the composition of the translation system to enhance translation, 3) employment of another bacterial AlaRS and SerRS to improve each aminoacylation activity, 4) diminishing the translational inhibition caused by certain aaRS sequences by codon optimization and EF-P addition, and 5) balancing the DNA concentrations of 20 aaRSs to match each requirement. After these improvements, we succeeded in the sustainable regeneration of all 20 aaRSs for up to 20 cycles of 2.5-fold serial dilutions.

Sporozoites use myosin molecular motors to generate retrograde flow of actin filaments. These are linked to plasma-membrane spanning adhesins, which in turn bind to the extracellular environment, resulting in forward directed gliding motility. The gliding motility machine of sporozoites leads to high speeds in the range of micrometer per second, which are essential for efficient migration in the skin. Yet, it is not clear how the individual parts of the machinery work together to generate force during migration. Sporozoites are elongated and curved cells and move on circular tracks in vitro. Sporozoites lacking the adhesin thrombospondin related anonymous protein (TRAP) like protein, TLP, can still migrate in the skin, but at a lower level. TLP lacking sporozoites generate a lower force on the dorsal (non-substrate facing) surface as measured by laser tweezers. Here we use traction force microscopy to investigate motile sporozoites and the forces they produce during migration on their ventral surface. Both wild type and tlp(-) sporozoites show distinct foci of force generation, but tlp(-) sporozoites generating overall lower forces. Our findings demonstrate that TLP is an important element of the force-generating machinery during sporozoite gliding motility.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

Such adverse effects on immunity might increase with ageing, worsening disease conditions later in life. Furthermore, malnutrition may persist across generations, imposing strong natural selection to survive the nutrient shortage. However, it is unclear how the evolutionary history of ancestral generations with chronic malnutrition could influence pathogen resistance and infection susceptibility, as well as their age-specific changes in extant generations. To address this, we used Drosophila melanogaster populations adapted against chronic juvenile malnutrition and exposed them to a bacterial pathogen, Providencia rettgeri, during their early and late adulthood. Surprisingly, we observed that in populations adapted to chronic malnutrition, young flies survived infection better by tolerating the infection, while control flies displayed higher infection susceptibility despite carrying a similar pathogen load. However, this pattern in post-infection survival is reversed with ageing. There was no change in pathogen resistance, but evolved flies succumbed more to infection than control flies regardless of the input infection doses. Our study thus revealed new evolutionary insights into the development of contrasting early vs late-life immune strategies and age-specific vulnerabilities to infection as a function of early-life malnutrition.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

We aim to predict the circumstances in which pLMs can successfully perform zero-shot fitness estimation. Our work studies trends observed over hundreds of deep mutational scans across multiple different fitness objectives. We find that the likelihood, or abstractly, implicit preference of a certain protein sequence imbued during pretraining is predictive of fitness prediction capabilities. Both over-preferred and under-preferred wild type sequences harm performance. Using influence functions to causally understand how individual data points increase protein likelihoods, we find that there exists a power law tail due to sequence homology. Lastly, under-performance on low likelihood wild type proteins can be remedied by unsupervised finetuning. These findings that pLM zero-shot fitness estimation can be predicted by the likelihood of the engineered sequence can motivate and improve pLMs' deployment in protein maturation campaigns.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

Loss of maternal LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (LHP1) causes an inability of progeny seeds to sense temperature and this is linked mechanistically to reduced ABA levels in seeds and activation of the primary nitrate response. At the single cell level, small changes in temperature activate nitrate signalling specifically in the mother, and ABA biosensor imaging reveals temperature-dependent fluxes of ABA into seeds necessary for dormancy induction. Thus, we reveal that progeny seeds inherit the climate adaptation of mother plants via active hormone transport during seed set.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

Methods: The haemagglutination test (HAT) was carried out to determine the presence of antibodies against the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants XBB.1.5 and BA.2.75 and the RBD of the Sabecoviruses RaTG13, WIV1, Khosta-2 and SARS-CoV-1, in individuals aged 5 to 80 years of age in years 2020 (n=381), 2022 (n=432) and 2023 (n=382). Results: The highest positivity rates for BA.2.75, RaTG13, WIV1, Khosta-2 and SARS-CoV-1 were seen in 2022, with positivity rates significantly declining to many of the viruses except XBB.1.5 and Khosta-2 by 2023. The positivity rates for Khosta-2 (p<0.001) and WIVI (p<0.001) were significantly lower in children <14 years age, but not for XBB.1.5, BA.2.75 and RaTG13. Children <14 years who were SARS-CoV-2 unvaccinated had the lowest positivity rates for all tested viruses except BA.2.75. <20% of individuals in all age groups had antibody titres equivalent to 1:80, which correspond to neutralising antibody titres by 2023. Conclusions: Population immunity to omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants and selected sarbecoviruses had significantly declined in Colombo, Sri Lanka by 2023. Therefore, although T cells might still offer some protection against severe disease, immunizing vulnerable individuals in the community with protective vaccine designs, might be important to consider at this stage.","NA","medrxiv",1728252541579

The capacity of a plasmid to express genes is constrained by two parameters: length and copy number. However, the interplay between these parameters and their constraints on plasmid evolution have remained elusive due to the absence of comprehensive quantitative analyses. To address this gap, we developed Probabilistic Iterative Read Assignment (PIRA), a new computational method that overcomes previous computational bottlenecks, enabling rapid and accurate determination of plasmid copy numbers at an unprecedented scale. Applying PIRA to all microbial genomes in the NCBI RefSeq database with linked short-read sequencing data in the Sequencing Read Archive (SRA), we analyzed 4,317 bacterial and archaeal genomes encompassing 11,338 plasmids, spanning the microbial tree of life. Our analysis reveals three scaling laws of plasmids: first, an inverse power-law correlation between plasmid copy number and plasmid length; second, a positive linear correlation between protein-coding genes and plasmid length; and third, a positive correlation between metabolic genes per plasmid and plasmid length, particularly for large plasmids. These scaling laws imply fundamental constraints on plasmid evolution and functional organization, indicating that as plasmids increase in length, they converge toward chromosomal characteristics in copy number and functional content. Our findings not only advance the understanding of plasmid dynamics but also have implications for microbial evolution, biotechnology, and the design of synthetic plasmids.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

However, the methylation state of a genomic region can also be characterized by a mixture of patterns (epialleles) with variable frequencies, and the relative proportions of such patterns can provide insights into its mechanisms of formation. Traditional methods based on bisulfite conversion and NGS, due to the read size (150 bp), allow epiallele frequency analysis only in high-CpG-density regions, limiting differential methylation studies to just 50% of the human methylome. Nanopore sequencing, with its long reads, enables the analysis of epiallele frequency across both high- and low-CpG-density regions. We introduce a novel computational approach, PoreMeth2, an R library that integrates epiallelic diversity and methylation frequency changes from Nanopore data to identify DMRs, assess their formation mechanisms, and annotate them to genic and regulatory elements. We applied PoreMeth2 to cancer and glial cell datasets, demonstrating its ability to distinguish epigenomic changes with a strong effect on gene expression from those with a weaker impact on transcriptional activity.

Therefore, structural changes, energy transformations, and protein function are intimately related. Despite its central importance, this relationship remains elusive. For example, while many AAA+ assemblies are known to function using a hand-over-hand alternation of subunits, how energy transduction throughout the assembly structure drives hand-over-hand is not known. In this work, we unravel the energetic basis of hand-over-hand in a model AAA+ motor, RuvB. To do so, we develop a general method to compute the residue scale elastic energy due to structure changes and apply it to RuvB structures, recently resolved through cryo-EM. This allows us to quantify how progression through RuvB's mechanochemical cycle translates into residue scale energy transduction. In particular, we find that DNA binding is associated with overcoming a high energy barrier. This is possible through inter-subunit transmission of energy, and ultimately driven by binding of ATP. Furthermore, we show how this structure-inferred energetic quantification can be integrated into a non-equilibrium model of AAA+ assembly dynamics, consistent with single-molecule biophysics measurements. Overall, our work elucidates the energetic basis for the hand-over-hand mechanism in RuvB's cycle. Furthermore, it presents a generally applicable methodology for studying the energetics of conformational cycles in other proteins, allowing to quantitatively bridge data from structural biology and single-molecule biophysics.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

The ability to lyophilize, store, and use on demand makes these sensors usable in the field, and the lack of membranes means there are no analyte transport issues and new sensors can be deployed by simply adding a different DNA molecule. The lack of membranes also enables high-throughput screening of sensor designs and reaction optimizations. While shelf stability has been demonstrated in specific cases using additives, these approaches are not universal to the myriad cell-free expression methods and formats. Here, we present new high-throughput screening methods to optimize cell-free expression formulations when embedded into paper for use as sensors. Our method leverages acoustic liquid handling to dispense reactions onto 384-well paper ticket formats and machine vision to quantify reaction performance from a colorimetric reporter enzyme. The throughput enabled shifts the bottleneck from experimental execution to selecting the experiments to execute; we therefore implement design-of-experiments to optimize the information gained from each design-build-test-learn cycle. We used these approaches to first optimize the performance of a low-cost cell-free expression formulation that was initially non-functional when embedded in paper, then further optimize it for tolerance to heat exposure. With only two rounds of experimentation lasting four days total for each goal, the results are an energy mixture with 8% of the materials cost of a commonly used version and a formulation of excipients that maintain 60% of activity after six hours of storage at 50 C. Finally, we showcase the use of the cost-optimized formulation in a 3D-printed paperfluidic device where it outperforms the standard formulation at much lower cost.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

The technology is applied to model pathological cardiac hypertrophy in vitro, using either (i) acute adrenergic agonism or (ii) chronic culture within stiff hydrogel molds. Treated EHTs exhibit increased levels of pathology-associated gene expression and activation of signaling cascades involved in pathological remodeling compared to untreated controls or treated 2D iPSC-CMs. Thus, our method results in robust yet simpler, cheaper, and faster EHTs to study cardiac disease.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

However, optimal subcortical targets for therapeutic stimulation are not well established. Here, we leveraged 7 Tesla resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data from 168 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project to map the subcortical connectivity of six canonical cortical networks that modulate higher-order cognition and function: the default mode, executive control, salience, dorsal attention, visual, and somatomotor networks. Based on spatiotemporally overlapped networks generated by the Nadam-Accelerated SCAlable and Robust (NASCAR) tensor decomposition method, our goal was to identify subcortical hubs that are functionally connected to multiple cortical networks. We found that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain and the central lateral (CL) and parafascicular (Pf) nuclei of the thalamus - regions that have historically been targeted by neuromodulatory therapies to restore consciousness - are subcortical hubs widely connected to multiple cortical networks. Further, we identified a subcortical hub in the pontomesencephalic tegmentum that overlapped with multiple reticular and extrareticular arousal nuclei and that encompassed a well-established ""hot spot"" for coma-causing brainstem lesions. Multiple hubs within the brainstem arousal nuclei and thalamic intralaminar nuclei were functionally connected to both the DMN and SN, emphasizing the importance of these cortical networks in integrative subcortico-cortical signaling. Additional subcortical connectivity hubs were observed within the caudate head, putamen, amygdala, hippocampus, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, regions classically associated with modulation of cognition, behavior, and sensorimotor function. Collectively, these results suggest that multiple subcortical hubs in the brainstem tegmentum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and medial temporal lobe modulate cortical function in the human brain. Our findings strengthen the evidence for targeting subcortical hubs in the ventral tegmental area, central lateral thalamus, and pontomesencephalic tegmentum to restore consciousness in patients with DoC. We release all subcortical connectivity maps to support ongoing efforts at therapeutic neuromodulation of consciousness.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

Here, we report that Tectonin-{beta}-propeller repeat containing protein 2 (TECPR2), a protein mutated in a form of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN), is an effector of early endosomal Rab protein, Rab5, and interacts with Rab5 via its C-terminal TECPR repeats. The HSAN-associated TECPR2 (R1336W) missense variant was deficient in Rab5-binding and, consequently, in membrane recruitment. TECPR2-depletion led to perinuclear collapse of recycling endosomes and increased overlap of sorting and degradative subdomain markers on early endosomes. Consistent with a possible role in endocytic recycling, we observed impaired recycling and increased lysosomal degradation of 5{beta}1 integrin receptors upon TECPR2 knockdown. TECPR2 regulates the early endosomal localization of the cargo adaptor for {beta}1 integrins, SNX17, and its-associated protein complex WASH, which mediates actin polymerization on early endosomes. Finally, TECPR2 depletion in the zebrafish model resulted in delayed motility and changes in the neuromuscular junction. Our study supports an early endosomal role for TECPR2 in cargo recycling and provides insights into how its loss-of-function results in a neurodegenerative genetic disorder.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

The formation and maintenance of osteocyte dendrites is closely linked to bone health, yet the mechanisms regulating these processes are poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that osteocytes transport mRNA to their dendrites for local translation as a mechanism of regulating the formation and maintenance of these subcellular structures. Using molecular and imaging approaches, we demonstrated that a subset of mRNAs are enriched in Ocy454 osteocyte-like cell dendrites. To understand how certain mRNAs are directed to dendrites, we performed a massively parallel reporter assay with 7115 oligonucleotide sequences designed from the 3 untranslated regions of eight dendrite-enriched transcripts. We identified localization sequences within some 3UTRs that were both sufficient and necessary for trafficking to osteocyte dendrites, indicating that localization directions are specifically encoded in enriched transcripts. Furthermore, we found that dendrites contain the elements necessary for local translation, and trafficked transcripts were engaged in active translation within dendrites. Together this work describes a molecular regulatory mechanism novel to osteocyte biology with many potential consequences for the spatiotemporal control of the cytoskeleton and dendrites.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

However, the role of microglia in GB pathogenesis remains unclear, especially regarding the in vivo dynamics of their interplay. Performing three-photon imaging in an autochthonous, immunocompetent mouse GB model, we examined tumor/microglia dynamics within previously inaccessible regions at the GB far infiltration zone in the corpus callosum. Initially, microglia increased tissue surveillance upon encountering GB-cells in sparsely infiltrated areas. In contrast, when GB-cell density increased, microglia reduced surveillance, suggesting a biphasic response to tumor invasion. Additionally, microglia were not uniformly attracted to infiltrating GB-cells; only a subset moved directionally toward them within a defined spatial range. This study provides insight into the heterogeneity of the immune response to tumor invasion and the dynamics of microglia-GB interactions in vivo.

However, to date, CAR Treg therapy has not achieved long-lasting tolerance in mouse models, suggesting that additional engineering is required to unlock the full potential of these cells. We previously found that human Tregs produce minimal amounts of IL-10 and have a limited capacity to control innate immunity in comparison to type I regulatory (Tr1) cells. Seeking to create 'hybrid' CAR Tregs that were engineered with Tr1-like properties, we examined whether the PDCD1 locus could be exploited to endow Tregs with the ability to secrete high levels of IL-10 in a CAR-regulated manner. CRISPR-mediated PD1-deletion increased the activation potential of CAR Tregs without compromising in vivo stability. Knock-in of IL10 under control of the PD1 promoter facilitated CAR-mediated secretion of IL-10 in large quantities, and improved CAR Treg function, as determined by significant inhibition of dendritic cell antigen presentation and enhanced suppression of alloantigen- and islet autoantigen-specific T cells. Overall, CRISPR-mediated engineering to simultaneously remove an inhibitory signal and enhance suppressive mechanisms is a new approach to enhance the therapeutic potency of CAR Tregs.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

Leveraging brain imaging and behavioral data from over 4,000 children and a Bayesian computational model of cognitive dynamics, we investigated brain-behavior relationships underlying cognitive control at both between-subjects and within-subjects levels. Strikingly, we observed a reversal of associations of inhibitory control brain activations with dynamic behavioral measures when comparing between-subjects and within-subjects analyses, revealing the nonergodic nature of these processes. This nonergodicity was pervasive throughout the brain but most pronounced in the salience network. Additionally, within-subjects analysis uncovered dissociated brain representations of reactive and proactive control processes, as well as distinct brain-behavior associations for individuals who adaptively versus maladaptively regulated cognitive control. Our findings offer insights into dynamic neural mechanisms of cognitive control during a critical developmental period.

Here, we used proteomics to confirm the prediction that certain Archaea consistently incorporate pyrrolysine at TAG codons, supporting a new archaeal genetic code which we designate Genetic Code 34. This genetic code has 62 sense codons encoding 21 amino acids, and only two stop codons. In contrast with monophyletic genetic code distributions in bacteria, Code 34 occurs sporadically. This, combined with evidence for lateral gene transfer of the code change machinery and anticipated barriers to code reversal, suggests Code 34 arose independently in multiple lineages. TAG codon distribution patterns in Code 34 genomes imply a wide range in time since code switch. We identified many new enzymes containing Pyl residues, raising questions about potential roles of this amino acid in protein structure and function.

However, the phylogenetic resolution of its sister lineage remains unclear, obscuring whether contrasts in histories of diversification provide insights into the factors that gave rise to this clade's diversity. Using 887 ultraconserved element loci and Sanger-sequenced nuclear genes, we resolve the phylogenetic relationships of the three closest relatives of Percomorpha-the roughies, flashlightfishes, porcupinefishes and fangtooths (Trachichthyiformes), the squirrelfishes and soldierfishes (Holocentridae), and the whalefishes, bigscales, and alfonsinos (Berycoidei)-and the placement of percomorphs among them. Contrary to expectations from the fossil record, we demonstrate that living lineages of Berycoidei, Holocentridae, and Trachichthyiformes all diversified after the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction. Our findings show that multiple clades in Trachichthyiformes and Berycoidei independently colonized deep ocean habitats during the climatically unstable Eocene and Oligocene and shallow-water reefs during the extensive hotspot migration and faunal turnover of the Early Miocene.

We utilise a systematic chimaera approach to define the differential functionality of two closely related Medicago truncatula SCAR proteins in plant development. We show that SCAR/WAVE contribution to Medicago truncatula root hair or Arabidopsis thaliana trichome formation is dependent on two central intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs).

These diseases, if left untreated, can be lethal within hours. Hyperinvasive N. meningitidis strains often express a genomically encoded filamentous bacteriophage called MDA{Phi}, which promotes colonisation of mucosal host surfaces to facilitate invasion. How this phage is organised and how it promotes biofilm formation and infection at the molecular level is unclear. Here, we present an electron cryomicroscopy structure of the MDA phage, showing that MDA{Phi} is a class I filamentous inovirus, with the major capsid protein arranged within the phage as a highly curved and densely packed -helix. Comparison with other filamentous bacteriophages offers clues about inoviral genome encapsidation mechanisms, providing a framework for understanding the evolutionary diversity of inoviruses. A disordered, N-terminal segment in the major capsid protein presents hydrophobic patches on the surface of assembled phage particles, which, together with electron cryotomography data of phage bundles, furnishes a structural rationale for phage-phage interactions that were seen previously in an epithelium adhesion infection model of N. meningitidis.

To successfully infect, colonize and complete their life cycle, plant pathogens are under constant selective pressures imposed by hosts, leading to genetic adaptation and possibly lineage radiation or speciation. Population and comparative genomics approaches are powerful tools to identify signatures of selection associated with host specialization in pathogen genomes and further allow recapturing population histories. Implementing such approaches, we identified evolutionary signatures of divergent host specialisation in distinct lineages of the fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici, a major disease causing-agent of wheat. Unique collections of Z. tritici were isolated from wild (Aegilops spp.) and domesticated (Triticum aestivum) host grasses in the Middle East and whole-genome sequencing was performed in a selected subset of isolates from each collection. We observed distinct population structure between the two host-diverging pathogens and identified particular genomic features in the Aegilops-infecting isolates that may have shaped their evolutionary history. Phylogenomic analyses revealed that A. cylindrica and A. tauchii -infecting populations of Z. tritici form separate clusters, possibly reflecting incipient speciation driven by divergent host specialization. Using infection experiments, we confirm that Z. tritici isolates collected from Aegilops spp. only infect their respective host species and not T. aestivum. Population genomics analyses and demographic inference furthermore allowed us to detect signatures of recent selection and show that divergence of the wheat-infecting lineage likely coincided with wheat domestication. At last, we confirm a virulence-related role for one candidate effector located in a selective sweep region of the A. cylindrica-infecting pathogen. Taken together, our findings highlight the interplay between agricultural and wild hosts on the evolution of fungal plant pathogens and illustrate host specialization as a possible route of rapid pathogen emergence.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

However, current transcriptomic profiling technologies result in destruction of the biological sample, preventing direct analysis of transcriptional dynamics in the same living cells over time. Here, we developed a synthetic RNA export system called cellular 'self-reporting' to address this fundamental technological limitation. We repurposed the murine leukemia virus retroviral protein Gag to enable diverse types of immortalized and primary mammalian cells to package cellular RNA molecules in virus-like particles (VLPs) for export into the extracellular environment. We applied self-reporting to interrogate the transcriptome-wide dynamics that occur during neuronal differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells and detected gene expression profiles from individual live cells. Leveraging this genetically encodable approach, we expanded the capabilities of self-reporting through molecular engineering of VLP components. Pseudotyping VLPs with epitope-tagged envelope proteins enabled multiplexed selective live-cell readout of transcriptional states from heterogeneous co-cultures. Furthermore, structure-guided protein engineering of Gag fusions with human RNA binding domains improved the mRNA representation in self-reporting readouts and enabled the directed export of libraries of synthetic barcode transcripts.

We report a case of a novel, idiosyncratic gesture in a Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus) at  La Foret des Singes, Rocamadour, France. One adult male, Jomanix, was observed hand-clapping. To our knowledge, hand-clapping has never been described before in this species. To hand-clap, the male briefly shifted his weight onto his legs, lifted his upper body, and clapped both hands together. We recorded 30 instances of hand-clapping. Twenty-five of these hand-claps occurred in combination with other agonistic signals, such as lunges and open mouth threats. Recipients either responded with counter-aggression (N = 9) or a submissive response (N = 16). In five of the 30 events, the context was unclear. These observations suggest that the gesture constitutes an agonistic signal. According to the staff at  La Foret des Singes, the hand-clapping may have been copied from staff members who occasionally hand-clap to shoo the animals away from areas where they were not supposed to be, but that notion remains speculative. In the meantime, another subject from the same group reportedly started to hand-clap, but the subject had passed away before we could document the behaviour. The observations show that Jomanix can flexibly combine a novel gesture with other established communicative signals. The hand-clap is goal-directed and fulfils the criteria for first-order intentional communication. This case, as well as anecdotal reports from a Tonkean macaque (Macaca tonkeana) hand-clapping to get attention, reveals greater flexibility in the gestural communication of this genus than previously assumed but also underscores that social learning of the production of communicative gestures occurs rarely in this taxon.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

This response leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells required for viral clearance. Some of these recruited cells remain within the lung following infection and contribute to enhanced viral control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells can also display long-term changes following infection or insults. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection and find that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes associated with communication with T cells. Lung epithelial cells from IAV-infected mice display functional changes by more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naive animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells could be effective targets for vaccines to boost durable protective immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

We identify H3K27me3, deposited by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), as the modification with the strongest cell type-specific enrichment. Inhibition of PRC2 in human cortical organoids resulted in a shift of neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation towards differentiation. Cell type- specific profiling of H3K27me3 not only identified neuronal differentiation genes in the human neocortex, but also extra-cellular matrix (ECM) genes. PRC2 inhibition resulted in increased production of the proteoglycan Syndecan 1. Overall, this study comprehensively characterizes the epigenetic state of specific neural cell types and highlights a novel role for H3K27me3 in regulating the ECM composition in the human developing neocortex.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

To uncover the molecular determinants of high-efficiency editing, we conducted biochemical, biophysical and cell-based assays on S. pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9) variants with wide-ranging genome editing efficiencies that differ in PAM binding specificity. Our results show that reduced PAM specificity causes persistent non-selective DNA binding and recurrent failures to engage the target sequence through stable guide RNA hybridization, leading to reduced genome editing efficiency in cells. These findings reveal a fundamental trade-off between broad PAM recognition and genome editing effectiveness. We propose that high-efficiency RNA-guided genome editing relies on an optimized two-step target capture process, where selective but low-affinity PAM binding precedes rapid DNA unwinding. This model provides a foundation for engineering more effective CRISPR-Cas and related RNA-guided genome editors.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541579

The prevailing hypothesis has been that Tau degradation is stymied due to an imbalance in proteostasis that occurs with age. Here, we used Airyscan super resolution imaging to illustrate that a pathogenic FTD mutation in the MAPT gene, which encodes Tau, is sufficient to alter multiple steps of the autophagy lysosomal pathway and impair Tau degradation. We discovered lysosomes clogged with both Tau and phosphorylated Tau, stalled lysosome motility, disrupted molecular motors, enhanced autophagic flux, and slowed cargo degradation in mutant Tau neurons. Treatment of mutant Tau neurons with a small molecule autophagy enhancer drug increases autophagic flux and cargo degradation, reduces phospho-Tau levels, and reduces Tau accumulation in lysosomes without restoring defects in lysosomal motility. This study reveals novel effects of mutant Tau and provides a window through which therapeutic treatments targeting autophagy may promote Tau homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

Canopy architecture is determined by several component traits, including leaf length, width, number, angle, and phyllotaxy. Phyllotaxy may be among the most difficult of the leaf canopy traits to measure accurately across large numbers of individual plants. As a result, in simulations of the leaf canopies of grain crops such as maize and sorghum, this trait is frequently approximated as alternating 180{degrees} angles between sequential leaves. We explore the feasibility of extracting direct measurements of the phyllotaxy of sequential leaves from 3D reconstructions of individual sorghum plants generated from 2D calibrated images and test the assumption of consistently alternating phyllotaxy across a diverse set of sorghum genotypes. Using a voxel-carving-based approach, we generate 3D reconstructions from multiple calibrated 2D images of 366 sorghum plants representing 236 sorghum genotypes from the sorghum association panel. The correlation between automated and manual measurements of phyllotaxy is only modestly lower than the correlation between manual measurements of phyllotaxy generated by two different individuals. Automated phyllotaxy measurements exhibited a repeatability of R2 = 0.41 across imaging timepoints separated by a period of two days. A resampling based genome wide association study (GWAS) identified several putative genetic associations with lower-canopy phyllotaxy in sorghum. This study demonstrates the potential of 3D reconstruction to enable both quantitative genetic investigation and breeding for phyllotaxy in sorghum and other grain crops with similar plant architectures.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

However, selection of host communities across ecological gradients and co-evolutionary processes may influence both the distribution of phages and the susceptibility of individual hosts through virus interactions and local adaptation within distinct ecological niches. Metagenomic-based analyses have revealed that soil pH selects for distinct populations and community structures for both phage and hosts at local and global scales. However, whether contrasting soil pH represents a selective barrier for phages capable of infecting an individual host is unknown. To examine the influence of pH on individual host-virus interactions, two closely related Bacillus strains were isolated and characterized from pH 7.5 soil associated with a long-term contiguous pH gradient (pH 4.5 to 7.5). Phages infecting each strain were subsequently enriched from soils across the pH gradient (pH 4.5, 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5), enumerated using a plaque assay, and characterized via metagenomic analysis. Phages infecting each strain were cultivated from all soils but their community composition and abundance varied with pH. Phage populations infecting each of the two strains were distinct despite the close relatedness of the two hosts, indicating relatively narrow host ranges for each virus. These results suggest that while phage community structures vary substantially across an ecological gradient, soil pH alone does not represent a barrier for the distribution of phages capable of infecting an individual host.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

Since cell-to-cell variation in epigenetic programming can reflect important differences in cell state and fate, it is clear that single-cell methods are essential to understanding this key epigenetic mark in heterogeneous tissues. Existing single-cell whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (scWGBS) methods have significant shortcomings, including very low CpG coverage or inefficient library generation requiring extremely deep sequencing. These methods offer limited insight into focal regulatory regions and generally preclude direct cell-to-cell comparisons. To address these shortcomings, we have developed an improved method, scDEEP-mC (single-cell Deep and Efficient Epigenomic Profiling of methyl-C). We show that high-coverage promoter methylation profiling by scDEEP-mC can identify multiple cell types, while allele-resolved methylation calls allow assessment of X-inactivation state in single cells and identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) enriched for hemi-methylation. We also use scDEEP-mC to profile single-cell copy number alterations, identify actively replicating cells, and track DNA methylation dynamics during and after DNA replication. The high coverage of scDEEP-mC creates an exceptional opportunity to explore DNA methylation biology in individual cells.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

While rational design strategies can expedite the discovery of heterobifunctional CIPs, molecular glues have predominantly been discovered by serendipity. Envisioning a prospective approach to discover molecular glues for a pre-selected target, we hypothesized that pre-existing ligands could be systematically decorated with chemical modifications to discover protein-ligand surfaces that are tuned to cooperatively engage another protein interface. Using high-throughput chemical synthesis to diversify a ligand for the transcriptional coactivator ENL with 3,163 structurally diverse chemical building blocks, we discovered a compound dHTC1 that elicits potent, selective, and stereochemistry-dependent degradation of ENL by induced binding to CRL4CRBN. Unlike prior CRBN-based degraders, dHTC1 binds the ligase with high affinity only after forming the ENL:dHTC1 complex, relying on a hybrid interface of protein-protein and protein-ligand contacts. Altogether, this study points toward an expanded chemical space for co-opting the therapeutically important substrate receptor, CRBN, and a second proof-of-concept extending this approach to BRD4 further validates high-throughput chemistry as a facile tool to discover new degraders.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

Longer-lived mammals tend to gain fewer noisy CpGs with age, irrespective of whether these originate from hyper- or hypomethylation processes.

However, they are threatened by climate change and even face the risk of local or global extinction. The responses of these species to climate change have received little attention. In this study, we examine the effects of climate change on state flowers and insects in the United States by employing correlative species distribution models (SDMs). We select a variety of commonly used SDM algorithms to construct an ensemble forecasting framework aimed at predicting the potential habitats for each species under both historical and future climate scenarios, and how these changes might influence the distributions of state flower and insect species. Our results show that more than half of the state flowers ([~] 66%) and insects ([~] 51%) are predicted to experience a substantial decrease in regions with favorable climates within the states they represent. Conversely, only a small number (Flowers: [~] 2%; Insects: [~] 10%) are projected to see an increase in habitat suitability in the future. Certain states may no longer possess suitable habitats for their state-designated species. Our findings indicate that cultural heritage might be at risk due to reduced habitat suitability and local extinctions driven by climate change. These findings can provide guidance regarding the protection or replacement of state species to preserve cultural heritage.

Significance StatementWe have known for decades that climate change may lead to species local or global extinction. However, the vast majority of such research has focused on species of ecological or economic importance. Only recently have researchers begun to seriously consider the impacts of climate change on our cultural heritage, and that research has mainly focused on tangible cultural assests such as buildings and anthropological sites. Here, we consider the impacts of climate change on species of cultural significance, namely U.S. state flowers and insects. We find that the majority of these species are threatened with local extinction from climate change, and the loss of these species will take with them important aspects of our history and culture.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

Despite being observed for the first time twenty years ago, their structure and how they are assembled remains unknown. Here, we reconstituted in vitro the ESCRT-0 clathrin assembly onto various types of membranes. The ESCRT-0 protein HRS, a known clathrin adaptor on endosomes, was found to form protein condensates. These condensates spread into a thin layer on PI(3)P-rich membranes. Platinum replica electron microscopy revealed that, surprisingly, the assembly of clathrin was different depending on the HRS phase. Protein droplets recruited clathrin as a dense, curved lattice, with many cage-like structures. On two-dimensional condensates, HRS recruited clathrin as a dense flat assembly. Two-dimensional HRS-clathrin condensates promoted the clustering of cholesterol in the underlying membrane, while cholesterol enhanced PI(3)P- dependent HRS recruitment on the membrane. On free-standing membranes, two-dimensional HRS-clathrin condensates promoted membrane flattening. Overall, these results show that a two- dimensional HRS condensate creates a unique membrane structure for sorting cargo molecules, defining a new mechanism in membrane trafficking processes.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

C_LI

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar.

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis. In the first six months of follow-up in the two-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.27-0.46); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.19-1.94). In the first six months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9% (95% CI: 94.0-97.1) and 34.1% (95% CI: -46.4-76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

ConclusionA strong healthy vaccinee effect was observed in the first six months following vaccination. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations.","NA","medrxiv",1728252541580

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

To explore it, we analyzed deep proteomic and transcriptomic data from over 1,000 human samples, including 6 cancer types and 26 healthy human tissues. This global analysis identified 60,024 high confidence substitutions corresponding to 8,801 unique sites in proteins derived from 1,990 genes. Some substitutions are shared across samples, while others exhibit strong tissue-type and cancer specificity. Surprisingly, products of alternate translation are more abundant than their canonical counterparts for hundreds of proteins, suggesting sense codon recoding. Recoded proteins include transcription factors, proteases, signaling proteins, and proteins associated with neurodegeneration. Mechanisms contributing to substitution abundance include protein stability, codon frequency, codon-anticodon mismatches, and RNA modifications. We characterize sequence motifs around alternatively translated amino acids and how substitution ratios vary across protein domains, tissue types and cancers. The substitution ratios are positively associated with intrinsically disordered regions and genetic polymorphisms in gnomAD, though the polymorphisms cannot account for the substitutions. Both the sequence and the tissue-specificity of alternatively translated proteins are conserved between human and mouse. These results demonstrate the contribution of alternate translation to diversifying mammalian proteomes, and its association with protein stability, tissue-specific proteomes, and diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1728252541580

Attention can also be seen as a solution to the binding problem: concurrent attention to all parts of an entity allows separating it from the rest. However, the rich models of attention in computational neuroscience are generally not scaled to real-world problems and there are thus many behavioral and neural phenomena that current models cannot explain. Here, we propose a bidirectional recurrent model of attention that is inspired by modern neural networks for image segmentation. It conceptualizes recurrent connections as a multi-stage internal gating process where bottom-up connections transmit features, while top-down and lateral connections transmit attentional gating signals. Our model can recognize and segment simple stimuli such as digits as well as objects in natural images and is able to be prompted with object labels, attributes or locations. It can learn to perform a range of behavioral findings, such as object binding, selective attention, inhibition of return, and visual search. It also replicates a variety of neural findings, including increased activity for attended objects, features, and locations, attention-invariant tuning, and relatively late onset attention. Most importantly, our proposed model unifies decades of cognitive and neurophysiological findings of visual attention into a single principled architecture. Our results highlight that the ability to selectively and dynamically focus on specific parts of stimulus streams can help artificial neural networks to better generalize and align with human brains.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

However, these dances have attracted little scientific attention and their structure and meaning remain largely obscure. Here we analyse close-range video recordings of captive crested gibbons, extracting descriptions of dance in four Nomascus species (N. annamensis, N. gabriellae, N. leucogenys, and N. siki). Additionally, we report results from a survey amongst relevant professionals clarifying behavioural contexts of dance in captive and wild crested gibbons. Our results demonstrate that dances in Nomascus represent a common and intentional form of visual communication restricted to sexually mature females. While primarily used as a proceptive signal to solicit copulation, dances occur in a wide range of contexts related to arousal and/or frustration in captivity. A linguistically informed view of this sequential behaviour demonstrates that dances follow a grouping organisation and isochronous rhythm - patterns not described for visual displays in other non-human primates. We argue that applying the concept of dance to gibbons allows us to expand our understanding of the communicative behaviours of non-human apes and develop hypotheses on the rules and regularities characterizing this behaviour. We propose that gibbons dances likely evolved from less elaborate rhythmic proceptive signals, similar to those found in siamangs. Although dance displays in humans and crested gibbons share a number of key characteristics, they cannot be assumed to be homologous. Nevertheless, gibbon dances represent a model behaviour whose investigation could be extended to the study of complex gestural signals in hominoid primates.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

This degeneracy impacts the efficiency of heterologous protein production due to the codon usage preferences of each organism. The process of tailoring organism-specific synonymous codons, known as codon optimization, must respect local sequence patterns that go beyond global codon preferences. As a result, the search space faces a combinatorial explosion that makes exhaustive exploration impossible. Nevertheless, throughout the diverse life on Earth, natural selection has already optimized the sequences, thereby providing a rich source of data allowing machine learning algorithms to explore the underlying rules. Here, we introduce CodonTransformer, a multispecies deep learning model trained on over 1 million DNA-protein pairs from 164 organisms spanning all kingdoms of life. The model demonstrates context-awareness thanks to the attention mechanism and bidirectionality of the Transformers we used, and to a novel sequence representation that combines organism, amino acid, and codon encodings. CodonTransformer generates host-specific DNA sequences with natural-like codon distribution profiles and with negative cis-regulatory elements. This work introduces a novel strategy of Shared Token Representation and Encoding with Aligned Multi-masking (STREAM) and provides a state-of-the-art codon optimization framework with a customizable open-access model and a user-friendly interface.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1728252541580

Here, we report cryoEM structures of two FCoV-23 spike (S) isoforms explaining that the in-host loss of domain 0 observed in clinical samples enhances entry into cells and fusogenicity by facilitating protease access, leading to biotype switching and lethality. We show that FCoV-23 can use several aminopeptidase N (APN) orthologs as receptors and reveal the molecular determinants of receptor species tropism, including a glycan modulating human receptor utilization.

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

Yet, no efficient mechanisms for their removal have been identified. Here we report bioaccumulation of PFAS by several gut bacterial species over a wide range of concentrations from nanomolar up to 500 M. For bioaccumulating Bacteroides uniformis, a highly prevalent species, we estimate intracellular PFAS concentration in the mM range - above that of most native metabolites. Despite this high bioaccumulation, B. uniformis cells could grow appreciably up to 250 M perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure. Escherichia coli, which accumulated PFAS to a much lesser extent, substantially increased PFAS bioaccumulation when lacking TolC efflux pump indicating trans-membrane transport in PFAS bioaccumulation. Electron microscopy and cryogenic Focused Ion Beam-Secondary Ion Mass-spectrometry revealed distinct morphological changes and intracellular localisation of PFNA aggregates. Bioaccumulation of PFAS and transmembrane transport is also evident in proteomics, metabolomics, thermal proteome profiling, and mutations following adaptive laboratory evolution. In an in vivo context, mice colonized with human gut bacteria showed, compared to germ-free controls or those colonized with low-bioaccumulating bacteria, higher PFNA levels in excreted feces. As the gut microbiota is a critical interface between exposure and human body, our results have implications for understanding and utilizing microbial contribution to PFAS clearance.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

Mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction is associated with lack of physical activity and considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs) aflicting our societies such as T2D, CVD, metabolic syndrome, and even AD.

To our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies on the metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular characteristics of ""healthy sedentary"" individuals living without clinical symptoms. Hence, the main aim of our study herein was to characterize multiple metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular bioenergetic signatures in ""healthy sedentary"" individuals which could already be downregulated compared to moderately active individuals.

Nineteen subjects, 9 sedentary (SED) and 10 moderately active (AC) volunteered for multiple assessments including muscle biopsies, in order to assess muscle metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics both at rest and during exercise.

For our exercise studies, we performed graded exercise testing (GXT) to assess carbohydrate and fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity according to our previously developed methodology.

Resting studies showed decreased mitochondrial respiration including decreases in complex I (-36%) and II (-28%) as well as total electron system capacity (-34%) and electron system capacity coupled to ATP production via ATP synthase (-30%). Regarding muscle carbohydrate metabolism, SED individuals showed a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation (-37%) as well as reduced expression (-49%) of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Regarding fatty acid metabolism, SED showed decreased activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1)(-51%) and CPT2 (-44%) as well as decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (-35%). Metabolomics analysis also confirmed downregulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) identified distinct metabolic phenotypes through intermediates of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Further, we found significant differences in cardiolipin (CL) species expression between SED and AC groups, which, due to the important role of CL in mitochondrial structure, function, biogenesis and bioenergetics, deserves further attention.

Exercise studies also showed significant differences in substrate utilization between groups where SED possessed a significantly lower fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity. The correlation of different bioenergetic parameters between resting and exercise conditions were robust, suggesting the possibility of performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as a non-invasive methodology to indirectly assess metabolic function in multiple populations. In summary, in our study herein, we show that ""healthy sedentary"" individuals already possess a significant decrease in cellular metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics compared to moderately active individuals both during resting and exercising conditions.

Since large numbers of sedentary individuals evolve to develop cardiometabolic disease, a better understanding of decreased cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial function is needed in order to improve both diagnosis and treatment of multiple metabolic diseases.

- Despite similar GLUT-4 concentrations, sedentary individuals show significant decreased pyruvate oxidation as well as expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC).
- During exercise studies, sedentary individuals show significantly decreased levels of fat oxidation and lactate clearance capacity which correlate with mitochondrial and bioenergetics parameters from resting muscle biopsies. Hence, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) accompanied by measuring blood lactate levels could be a practical manner to assess muscle mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in a non-invasive and ambulatory manner.
- Identifying early signatures of decreased mitochondrial function and bioenergetics capacity could be an important approach to prevent or improve different metabolic diseases through lifestyle changes mainly from exercise and nutrition.","NA","biorxiv",1728252541580

We investigated whether a diverse refugee committee could utilize participatory methods to identify health priorities and a research agenda to address them.

MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study with focus groups of current and former refugees, asylum claimants and evacuees from a specialized refugee clinic over a year. We collected sociodemographic data using standardized instruments, then utilized a four-step nominal group technique process (idea generation, recording, discussion, and voting) to identify and rank participants health and research priorities. Participants ranked their top five priorities across three time periods: Pre-migration/early arrival (0-3 months), post-migration (3 months-2 years), and long-term health (>2 years). Participants created overarching priorities and corroborated findings via a member checking step.

FindingsTwenty-three participants (median age 35 years) attended one or more of five focus groups. Twenty-one completed sociodemographic surveys: 16/21 (76%) were women, representing 8 countries of origin. Participants identified ""more family physicians"" and ""improving health system navigation"" (11/60 votes each) as top health and research priorities respectively across all resettlement periods. Participants also prioritized pre-departure healthcare system orientation and improved post-arrival and long-term mental health services. Twelve participants completed the member checking process, affirming the results with minor clarifications.

InterpretationThis proof-of-concept study illustrates how refugees can use a rigorous consensus process without external influence to prioritize their healthcare needs, direct a health research agenda to address those needs, and co-produce research. These low-cost participatory methods should be replicated elsewhere.
