Reconstruction of visual input from human fMRI data has garnered significant attention in recent years. Comparatively less focus has been directed towards vision reconstruction from single-cell recordings, despite its potential to provide a more direct measure of the information represented by the brain. Here, we achieve high-quality reconstructions of videos presented to mice, from the activity of neurons in their visual cortex. Using our method of video optimization via gradient descent through a state-of-the-art dynamic neural encoding model we reliably reconstruct 10-second movies at 30 Hz from two-photon calcium imaging data. We achieve a {approx} 2-fold increase in pixel-by-pixel correlation compared to previous reconstructions of static images from mouse V1, while also capturing temporal dynamics. We find that critical for high-quality reconstructions are the number of neurons in the dataset and the use of model ensembling.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

While loading LNPs with mRNA has many uses, loading DNA would provide additional advantages such as long-term expression and availability of promoter sequences. However, here we show that plasmid DNA (pDNA) delivery via LNPs (pDNA-LNPs) induces acute inflammation in naive mice which we find is primarily driven by the cGAS-STING pathway. Inspired by DNA viruses that inhibit this pathway for replication, we co-loaded endogenous lipids that inhibit STING into pDNA-LNPs. Specifically, loading nitro-oleic acid (NOA) into pDNA-LNPs (NOA-pDNA-LNPs) ameliorates serious inflammatory responses in vivo enabling prolonged transgene expression (at least 1 month). Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to iteratively optimize NOA-pDNA-LNPs expression by performing a small LNP formulation screen, driving up expression 50-fold in vitro. Thus, NOA-pDNA-LNPs, and pDNA-LNPs co-loaded with other bioactive molecules, will provide a major new tool in the genetic medicine toolbox, leveraging the power of DNAs long-term and promoter-controlled expression.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

Human genetic studies established a causal role for protein assembly in neurodegeneration. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown, which is limiting progress in developing clinical tools for these diseases. Recent advances in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled the structures of the protein filaments to be determined from patient brains1. All diseases studied to date have been characterised by the self-assembly of a single intracellular protein in homomeric amyloid filaments, including that of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) Types A and B. Here, we used cryo-EM to determine filament structures from the brains of individuals with FTLD-TDP Type C, one of the most common forms of sporadic FTLD-TDP. Unexpectedly, the structures revealed that a second protein, annexin A11 (ANXA11), co-assembles with TDP-43 in heteromeric amyloid filaments. The ordered filament fold is formed by TDP-43 residues G282/284-N345 and ANXA11 residues L39-L74 from their respective low-complexity domains (LCDs). Regions of TDP-43 and ANXA11 previously implicated in protein-protein interactions form an extensive hydrophobic interface at the centre of the filament fold. Immunoblots of the filaments revealed that the majority of ANXA11 exists as a ~22 kDa N-terminal fragment (NTF) lacking the annexin core domain. Immunohistochemistry of brain sections confirmed the co-localisation of ANXA11 and TDP-43 in inclusions, redefining the histopathology of FTLD-TDP Type C. This work establishes a central role for ANXA11 in FTLD-TDP Type C. The unprecedented formation of heteromeric amyloid filaments in human brain revises our understanding of amyloid assembly and may be of significance for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

However, assessing the bioactivity of extract from culture to identify novel natural molecules remains a strenuous process due to the cumbersome order of production, purification, and assaying. Thus, extensive genome mining of microbiomes is underway to identify biosynthetic gene clusters or BGCs that can be profiled as particular natural products, and computational methods have been developed to address this problem using machine learning. However, existing tools are ineffective due to a small training dataset, dependence on old genome mining tools, lack of relevant genomic descriptors, and prevalent class imbalance. This work presents a new tool, NPBdetect, that can detect multiple bioactivities and has been designed through rigorous experiments. Firstly, we composed a larger training set using MIBiG database and a test set through literature mining to build and assess the model respectively. Secondly, the latest antiSMASH genome mining tool was used to obtain BGC and introduced new sequence-based descriptors. Thirdly, neural networks are used to build the model by dealing with class imbalance issues through the class weighting technique. Finally, we compared the NPBdetect tool with an existing tool to show its efficacy and real-world utility in detecting several bioactivities with high confidence.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

These communication patterns can be comprehensively mapped using noninvasive functional imaging, resulting in functional connectivity (FC) networks. Despite its popularity, FC is a statistical construct and its operational definition is arbitrary. While most studies use zero-lag Pearsons correlations by default, there exist hundreds of pairwise interaction statistics in the broader scientific literature that can be used to estimate FC. How the organization of the FC matrix varies with the choice of pairwise statistic is a fundamental methodological question that affects all studies in this rapidly growing field. Here we comprehensively benchmark the topological and geometric organization, neurobiological associations, and cognitive-behavioral relevance of FC matrices computed using a large library of 239 pairwise interaction statistics. We comprehensively investigate how canonical features of FC networks vary with the choice of pairwise statistic, including (1) hub mapping, (2) weight-distance trade-offs, (3) structure-function coupling, (4) correspondence with other neurophysiological networks, (5) individual fingerprinting, and (6) brain-behavior prediction. We find substantial quantitative and qualitative variation across FC methods. Throughout, we observe that measures such as covariance (full correlation), precision (partial correlation) and distance display multiple desirable properties, including close correspondence with structural connectivity, the capacity to differentiate individuals and to predict individual differences in behavior. Using information flow decomposition, we find that differences among FC methods may arise from differential sensitivity to the underlying mechanisms of inter-regional communication, with some more sensitive to redundant and some to synergistic information flow. In summary, our report highlights the importance of tailoring a pairwise statistic to a specific neurophysiological mechanism and research question, providing a blueprint for future studies to optimize their choice of FC method.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

SWI/SNF subunits are among the most frequently mutated genes in cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. These mutations are often heterozygous loss-of-function alleles, indicating a dosage-sensitive role for SWI/SNF subunits in chromatin regulation. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate SWI/SNF subunit dosage to ensure proper complex assembly remain largely unexplored. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR KO screen, using epigenome editing in mouse embryonic stem cells, and identified Mlf2 and Rbm15 as regulators of SWI/SNF complex activity. First, we show that MLF2, a poorly characterized chaperone protein, regulates a subset of SWI/SNF target genes by promoting chromatin remodeling activity. Next, we find that RBM15, part of the m6A RNA methylation writer complex, controls m6A modifications on specific SWI/SNF mRNAs to regulate protein levels of these subunits. Misregulation of m6A methylation causes overexpression of core SWI/SNF subunits leading to the assembly of incomplete complexes lacking the catalytic ATPase/ARP subunits. These data indicate that targeting modulators of SWI/SNF complex assembly may offer a potent therapeutic strategy for diseases associated with impaired chromatin remodeling.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

To minimize repetition and utterance length, languages use pronouns, like the word 'she', to refer to nouns and phrases that were previously introduced. It has been suggested that language comprehension requires that pronouns activate the same neuronal representations as the nouns themselves. Here, we test this hypothesis by recording from individual neurons in the human hippocampus during a reading task. We found that cells that are selective to a particular noun are later reactivated by pronouns that refer to the cells' preferred noun. These results imply that concept cells contribute to a rapid and dynamic semantic memory network which is recruited during language comprehension.

This is especially the case in challenging listening conditions, such as in real-life social environments. Autism has been associated with atypicalities in integrating audio-visual information, potentially underlying social difficulties in this population. The present study investigated multisensory integration (MSI) in speech processing among autistic (N=35) and neurotypical (N=35) adults. Participants performed a speech-in-noise task in a realistic multispeaker social scenario with audio-visual, auditory, or visual trials while their brain activity was recorded using EEG. The neurotypical group demonstrated a non-linear audio-visual interaction in alpha suppression, whereas the autistic group showed merely additive processing of these same inputs. Despite these differences in neural correlates, both groups achieved similar behavioural audio-visual facilitation outcomes. These findings suggest that although autistic and neurotypical brains might process multisensory cues differently, they achieve comparable benefits from audio-visual speech. These results contribute to the growing body of literature on MSI atypicalities in autism.","NA","medrxiv",1719439693093

Previous studies indicate that this is likely due to some form of indirect assortative mating but there is not a consistent understanding of this process. Understanding indirect assortment is crucial for correctly adjusting for assortative mating, and for understanding intergenerational transmission. We attribute previous inconsistencies to idiosyncratic models and inconsistent use of relevant terms. In this paper, we develop a new framework for understanding indirect assortative mating and provide updated definitions of key terms. We then develop a model (the iAM-ACE-model) that can use partners of twins and siblings to distinguish the degree of assortment on genetic, social, and individual characteristics. We also expand this model to include children of twins and siblings (the iAM-COTS model), allowing us to explain parent-offspring similarity while accounting for indirect assortative mating and geneenvironment correlations. We apply the models on educational attainment using 1,529,144 individuals in 209,792 extended families from Norwegian registry data and the Norwegian Twin Registry. The analysis suggests that partners correlate .67 (95% CIs: .66, .70) on a latent sorting factor associated with educational attainment, which we estimate to be about 30% (26%, 35%) heritable, 42% (37%, 47%) sibling-shared environment, 8% (4%, 13%) twin-shared environment, 17% (16%, 19%) gene-environment correlations, and 3% (2%, 5%) non-shared environment. The implied genotypic correlation between partners (r = .33) is comparable to earlier studies, and higher than expected under direct assortment. Most of the parent-offspring correlation (r = .33) was attributable to passive genetic transmission (62%), with the rest attributable to passive environmental transmission (23%) and direct phenotypic transmission (15%). Environmental transmission was estimated lower in alternative models that assumed direct assortment, but these did not fit the data well.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

Here, we demonstrate that the cross-talk between the ERECTA (ER) receptor pathway and auxin signalling controls the amount and choice of output tissue in these two stem cell regions. Mechanistically, we show that the ER pathway phosphorylates the transcription factor ANTEGUMENTA, thereby modulating bilateral stem cell activity and favouring the differentiation of only one type of cell. Our results thus show that the phosphorylation status of ANT regulates root girth and biomass accumulation by influencing bilateral stem cell production.

Pathological anxiety is prevalent in up to 59% of patients with Tuberous Sclerosis complex (TSC)2, a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) caused by loss-of-function mutations in genes for Tuberin (Tsc2) and/or Hamartin (Tsc1) that together comprise the eponymous protein complex. Here, we generated cell type-specific heterozygous knockout of Tsc2 in cells expressing oxytocin receptor (OTRCs) to model pathological anxiety-like behaviors observed in TSC patient population. The stress of prolonged social isolation induces a sustained negative affective state that precipitates behavioral avoidance, often by aberrant oxytocin signaling in the limbic forebrain3,4. In response to social isolation, there were striking sex differences in stress susceptibility in conditional heterozygote mice when encountering situations of approach-avoidance conflict. Socially isolated male mutants exhibited behavioral avoidance in anxiogenic environments and sought more social interaction for buffering of stress. In contrast, female mutants developed resilience during social isolation and approached anxiogenic environments, while devaluing social interaction. Systemic and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-specific inhibition of downstream effector of TSC, the integrated stress response (ISR), rescued behavioral approach toward anxiogenic environments and conspecifics in male and female mutant mice respectively. Further, we found that Tsc2 deletion in OTRCs leads to OTR-signaling elicited network suppression, i.e., hypofrontality, in male mPFC, which is relieved by inhibiting the ISR. Our findings present evidence in support of a sexually dimorphic role of prefrontal OTRCs in regulating emotional responses in anxiogenic environments, which goes awry in TSC.

Brain imaging studies in living humans show changes in brain metabolism and structure that may contribute to the MT-associated brain disease risk. Although deficits in ovarian hormones have been implicated, cellular and molecular studies of the brain undergoing MT are currently lacking, mostly due to a difficulty in studying MT in postmortem human brain. To enable this research, we explored 39 candidate biomarkers for menopausal status in 42 pre-, peri-, and post-menopausal subjects across three postmortem tissues: blood, the hypothalamus, and pituitary gland. We identified thirteen significant and seven strongest menopausal biomarkers across the three tissues. Using these biomarkers, we generated multi-tissue and tissue-specific composite measures that allow the postmortem identification of the menopausal status across different age ranges, including the ""perimenopausal"", 45-55-year-old group. Our findings enable the study of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying increased neuropsychiatric risk during the MT, opening the path for hormone status-informed, precision medicine approach in womens mental health.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

In Ghana, no published studies have been conducted to evaluate the quality of COVID-19 data submitted onto the national web-based platform, District Health Information Management System version 2 (DHIMS-2) during the COVID-19 period. In this regard, this study seeks to assess the estimates and determinants of COVID-19 data quality in the DHIMS-2 in the Ahafo region of Ghana.

MethodsA facility-based cross-sectional study design was employed, with a desk review of COVID-19 records in DHIMS-2 and primary data sources (registers and monthly reporting forms). This study involved all 23 different levels of healthcare facilities that reported on COVID-19 in the Ahafo region from March 2020 to December 2022. We assessed COVID-19 data quality using three dimensions of completeness, accuracy, and timeliness according to the World Health Organization data quality guide. Mixed-effect logistic regression was then employed to identify the determinants of COVID-19 data quality at a 95% confidence interval.

ResultsThe overall COVID-19 data quality was estimated at 35.9% (95%CI=32.6%, 39.4%) while the rate of the data dimensions of timeliness, completeness, and accuracy were 50.2% (95%CI=46.7%, 53.8%), 50.6% (95%CI=47.1%, 54.2%), and 72.4% (95%CI=69.1%, 75.5%) respectively. It was found that the availability of a functional data validation team at the health facilities (AOR=18.3; 95%CI=1.62, 20.7; p= 0.019), training of data managers in COVID-19 data management (AOR=9.37; 95%CI=2.56, 34.3; p=0.001), and data managers with two-year professional training (certificate background) (AOR=3.42; 95%CI=1.95, 12.2; p=0.025) were independently associated with COVID-19 data quality.

ConclusionThe overall COVID-19 data quality in the Ahafo region was quite poor. Dimensionally, while the rate of data timeliness was high, that of data completeness, and accuracy were relatively low. The interaction of the independent correlates of COVID-19 data quality requires the healthcare system to identify stringent measures to strengthen the health information system to enhance planning and decision-making, especially during disease outbreaks.","NA","medrxiv",1719439693093

These events constitute a nationwide trauma with major ramifications for public mental health. This article presents an evidence-based model for the prediction of the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to the terrorist attack and the war.

Main bodyThe creation of the model consisted of several steps. Firstly, the Israeli population was divided into six groups based on the intensity, context, and type of traumatic exposure (direct exposure to terror, close proximity to terror, soldiers in combat and support units, intense exposure to rocket attacks, moderate exposure to rocket attacks, and indirectly affected communities), and the population size of each group was assessed using official national databases. Secondly, an estimation of the expected prevalence of PTSD in each of the exposure groups was based on a review of the relevant literature. A random-effects meta-analysis of the prevalence rates was conducted separately per each exposure group. Finally, the predicted number of PTSD causalities in the population was calculated by multiplying the group size and the PTSD prevalence estimation. Based on population size and estimated PTSD prevalence within each exposure category, the model predicts that approximately 5.3% (N=519,923) of the Israeli population (95% prediction interval, 160,346-879,502), may develop PTSD as a result of the terrorist attack and the war.

ConclusionsThe predicted number of individuals with PTSD following mass trauma is expected to be considerable. The presented model can assist policymakers, clinicians, and researchers in preparing and devising adequate interventions for the mental health needs of large populations. Moreover, this model can be applied in other instances of mass-trauma exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1719439693093

Episodic memory enables us to remember events from the past whereas spatial memory enables us to form a map-like representation of the environment. Interestingly, these seemingly different functions rely on the same brain structure: the hippocampus. Yet, how the hippocampus supports both at the same time remains unclear. Here, we tested the hypotheses that the hippocampus supports these two systems either via a common coding mechanism or via a parallel processing mechanism. To this end, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an episodic life-simulation task and a spatial virtual reality task to manipulate episodic and spatial context associations of objects. We then investigated fMRI adaptation effects between these objects as a result of shared contexts. We found that the fMRI signal in the anterior hippocampus scaled with the combined prediction of shared episodic and spatial contexts, in line with the idea of a common coding mechanism. We found no evidence for a parallel processing mechanism, as there were no differences between episodic and spatial effects. The common coding effect for episodic and spatial memory dovetails with the broader notion of domain-general hippocampal cognitive maps.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

However, evidence for a dominant female role in these societies has been scarce. We studied social organisation, mobility patterns and gendered practices in Neolithic Southwest Asia using 131 paleogenomes from Catalhoyuk East Mound (7100-5950 BCE), a major settlement in Central Anatolia with an uninterrupted occupation and an apparent egalitarian structure. In contrast to widespread genetic evidence for patrilocality in Neolithic Europe, the Catalhoyuk individuals revealed no indication of patrilocal mobility. Analysing genetic kin ties among individuals buried in the same house (co-burials) across 35 Catalhoyuk buildings, we identified close ties concentrated within buildings and among neighbours in Catalhoyuks Early period, akin to those in the preceding Pre-Pottery Neolithic in Southwest Asia. This pattern weakened over time: by the late 7th millennium BCE, subadults buried in the same building were rarely closely genetically related, despite sharing similar diets. Still, throughout the sites occupation, genetic connections within Catalhoyuk buildings were much more frequently connected via the maternal than the paternal line. We also identified differential funerary treatment of female subadults compared to those of males, with a higher frequency of grave goods associated with females. Our results reveal how kinship practices changed while key female roles persisted over one thousand years in a large Neolithic community in western Eurasia.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

While Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast is used extensively in research and biotechnology, it is a unicellular organism capable of only limited multicellular states. Here we expand the possibilities for engineering multicellular behaviours in yeast by developing modular toolkits for two key mechanisms seen in multicellularity, contact-dependent signalling and specific cell-to-cell adhesion. MARS (Mating-peptide Anchored Response System) is a toolkit based on surface-displayed fungal mating peptides and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling which can mimic juxtacrine signalling between yeasts. SATURN (Saccharomyces Adhesion Toolkit for multicellUlar patteRNing) surface displays adhesion-proteins pairs on yeasts and facilitates the creation of cell aggregation patterns. Together they can be used to create multicellular logic circuits, equivalent to developmental programs that lead to cell differentiation based on the local population. Using MARS and SATURN, we further developed JUPITER (JUxtacrine sensor for Protein-protein InTERaction), a genetic sensor for assaying protein-protein interactions in culture, demonstrating this as a tool to select for high affinity binders among a population of mutated nanobodies.

To approach this question, we investigated how working memory affects two different timing tasks: time reproduction and time discrimination. We found that delay interval led to an overestimation in the reproduction task but did not lead to any bias in the perception of time in the time discrimination task. Delay intervals affected perception of time when subjects had to actively reproduce the perceived interval, but not when subjects were going to just recall the content of the working memory. In a subsequent Bayesian modeling, we showed that in the reproduction task, subject updated their measurement of the stimulus on the current trial(likelihood), based on the delay interval, rather than changes in motor system, or updating prior based on the delay interval. Our findings suggest that brain processes that are involved in time reproduction and discrimination are not completely overlapped, and delay interval in working memory task leads to changes in updating the likelihood.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

Plants actively guard these openings through defense mechanisms that have been described extensively for stomates, the most common points of entry. However, bacteria from the genus Xanthomonas have specialized in that they enter their host via hydathodes--a poorly studied organ at the leaf margin involved in guttation. While hydathodes can mount an effective immune response against bacteria, a dedicated perception mechanism still needs to be discovered. To identify a hydathode-specific immune receptor, we mapped a novel resistance gene against X. campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) in Arabidopsis using an inoculation procedure that promotes natural entry via hydathodes. Using Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) between susceptible accession Oy-0 and resistant Col-0, a QTL for resistance was identified on the right arm of Chromosome 5 in Col-0. Combining this finding with results of a genome-wide association analysis, a single candidate gene was fine-mapped that encoded a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (CNL) immune receptor protein called SUPPRESSOR OF TOPP4 1 (SUT1). Whereas the ZAR1 immune receptor acts in the vasculature against Xcc, we establish that SUT1 already restricts Xcc in hydathodes but is ineffective in the vasculature. In corroboration, we confirm promoter activity of SUT1 in the epithem tissue within hydathodes. Altogether, we provide evidence for an NLR that confers hydathode-specific resistance in Arabidopsis against infection by Xcc.

Author summaryBlack rot disease, caused by the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc), is an economically relevant disease of cabbage crops. Xcc is rather unique in that it enters the plant interior through specialized organs at the edge of the leaf. These structures called hydathodes contain water pores and are involved in leaf water regulation. Although we know that hydathodes can mount an immune response against these bacteria, specific immune receptors still need to be discovered. In our search for hydathode resistance mechanisms, we use the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to identify genetic targets that could be translated to cabbage breeding practices. Here, by screening large populations of genetically diverse Arabidopsis plants, we could pinpoint a genetic locus that is involved in hydathode resistance. On this locus, we identified a gene, SUT1, that confers resistance against Xcc, restricting early hydathode colonization by the bacteria and reducing subsequent disease symptoms. Interestingly, this resistance is ineffective in later stages of infection when the bacteria colonize the plant vascular system. Therefore, this study provides new insights in hydathode-specific resistance and opens doors for more research on these tissue- or organ-specific resistance mechanisms in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

Previous research has uncovered symbiosis tradeoffs, including suppression of the NF-{kappa}B immune pathway in cnidarians hosting intracellular algae and correlations between symbiotic state and pathogen susceptibility. Here, we used a multiomic approach to characterize symbiotic states of the facultatively symbiotic coral Oculina arbuscula by generating genotype-controlled fragments of symbiotic and aposymbiotic tissue. Metabarcoding of 16S rRNA showed no difference in bacterial communities between symbiotic states. Consistent with previous whole-organism RNA-seq studies, whole-organism proteomics revealed differential abundance of proteins related to immunity, consistent with immune suppression during symbiosis. Moreover, single-cell RNAseq identified diverse cell clusters within six cell types across symbiotic states. Specifically, the gastrodermal cell cluster containing algal-hosting cells from symbiotic tissue had higher expression of nitrogen cycling and sugar transport genes than gastrodermal cells from aposymbiotic tissue. Furthermore, lower expression of genes involved in immune regulation, including NF-{kappa}B pathway genes, was observed in these gastrodermal cells from symbiotic tissue. However, no differences in gene expression in the immune cell cluster were observed between symbiotic states. This work reveals a compartmentalization of immune system suppression in specific gastrodermal cells in symbiosis, which likely limits symbiosis tradeoffs by dampening immunity in algal hosting cells while still maintaining general organismal immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

CISSc from Streptomyces coelicolor are distinct because they induce regulated cell death under stress, impacting the organisms life cycle. It remains unknown whether CISSc require accessory proteins to function.

Here we characterize the putative membrane adaptor CisA, a conserved factor in CISSc gene clusters across Streptomyces species. We show by cryo-electron tomography imaging and in vivo assays that CISSc contraction and function depend on CisA. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we provide an atomic model of the extended CISSc apparatus; however, CisA is not part of the complex. Instead, our findings show that CisA is a membrane protein with a cytoplasmic N-terminus predicted to interact with CISSc components, thereby providing a possible mechanism for mediating CISSc recruitment to the membrane and subsequent firing.

Our work shows that CIS function in multicellular bacteria is distinct from Type 6 Secretion Systems and extracellular CIS, and possibly evolved due to the role of CISSc in regulated cell death.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

We hypothesized that the locus coeruleus (LC), as the primary source of cortical norepinephrine (NE) and promoter of cortical and sympathetic arousal, is well-positioned to mediate movement-arousal coupling. Here, using a combination of physiological recordings, fiber photometry, optogenetics, and behavioral tracking, we show that the LCNE activation is tightly coupled to the return of organized movements during waking from an anesthetized state. Moreover, in an awake animal, movement initiations are coupled to LCNE activation, while movement arrests, to LCNE deactivation. We also report that LCNE activity covaries with the depth of anesthesia and that LCNE photoactivation leads to sympathetic activation, consistent with its role in mediating increased arousal. Together, these studies reveal a more nuanced, modulatory role that LCNE plays in coordinating movement and arousal.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

Molecular divergence times have pointed to a Tonian or Cryogenian origin for sponges. This contrasts with the oldest unequivocal fossil evidence for sponges, consisting of isolated siliceous spicules from the latest Ediacaran, resulting in a 150-million-mismatch with molecular clock estimates. This mismatch may arise because molecular clock estimates are inaccurate, the fossil record is incomplete, and/or the fossil record has been misinterpreted in the calibration of molecular clock analyses or some combination of the above. To resolve the deep evolutionary history of sponges we compiled an extensive phylogenomic dataset of sponges, revised fossil calibration evidence to derive a new phylogeny and timescale for sponge evolution, and investigated the evolutionary origin of the sponge spicules. Our results confirm that sponges include two main lineages: Silicea (Hexactinellida plus Demospongiae) and Calcarea plus Homoscleromorpha. Our molecular clock analyses identify an early Ediacaran estimate for the crown ancestor of sponges. Our study of spicule evolution shows that neither the last common sponge ancestor, nor the last common ancestors of Silicea and (Calcarea plus Homoscleromorpha) possessed siliceous spicules, which independently evolved four times in sponges: once in Hexactinellida, twice in Demospongiae, and once in Homoscleromorpha. Furthermore, diversification rate analyses demonstrate that the origin of spicules did not align with species radiations within the phylum. Our dating analyses substantially reduce the mismatch between molecular clock estimates for the antiquity of sponges and their fossil record. Our study of the evolutionary history of siliceous spicules reconciles the remaining difference as a consequence of crown-sponges primitively lacking siliceous spicules. As such we demonstrate the power of combining molecular and palaeontological approaches to establishing evolutionary timescales which together allow us to calibrate genome evolution to geological time and read evolutionary history within the gaps in the fossil record.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

Using electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we investigated how interactions between GABAARs and nAChRs influence dopaminergic axon excitability. Direct axonal recordings showed that benzodiazepine application suppresses subthreshold axonal input from cholinergic interneurons (CINs). In imaging experiments, we used the first temporal derivative of presynaptic calcium signals to distinguish between direct- and nAChR-evoked activity in dopaminergic axons. We found that GABAAR antagonism with gabazine selectively enhanced nAChR-evoked axonal signals. Acetylcholine release was unchanged in gabazine suggesting that GABAARs located on dopaminergic axons, but not CINs, mediated this enhancement. Unexpectedly, we found that a widely used GABAAR antagonist, picrotoxin, inhibits axonal nAChRs and should be used cautiously for striatal circuit analysis. Overall, we demonstrate that GABAARs on dopaminergic axons regulate integration of nicotinic input to shape presynaptic excitability.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

Although the process is now understood to be of mechanochemical origin, direct mechanical characterization and associated biochemical underpinnings are lacking. Here, we employ tissue-scale stress and compressibility measurements and theoretical modeling to unveil a mechanical imbalance between normal and transformed cells, which drives cell competition. In the mouse intestinal epithelium and epithelial monolayer, transformed cells get compacted during competition. Stress microscopy reveals an emergent compressive stress at the transformed loci leading to this compaction. A cell-based self-propelled Voronoi model predicts that this compressive stress originates from a difference in the collective compressibility of the competing populations. A new collective compressibility measurement technique named gel compression microscopy then elucidates a two-fold higher compressibility of the transformed population than the normal population. Mechanistically, weakened cell-cell adhesions due to reduced junctional abundance of E-cadherin in the transformed cells render them collectively more compressible than normal cells. Taken together, our findings unveil a mechanical basis for epithelial homeostasis against oncogenic transformations with implications in epithelial defense against cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

To address this question, we combined an immortalised mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) line with adjustable Piezo1 expression with soft (400 Pa) and stiff (25 kPa) viscoelastic hydrogels with independently tuneable Young's modulus and stress relaxation.

PV-INs are particularly vulnerable to cell loss, potentially due to their increased metabolic demands arising from their uniquely high level of electrical activity, which render them susceptible to metabolic pressure. Here, we use single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNAseq) data from a rodent model of TBI, as well as human TBI data, and demonstrate PV-INs have unique metabolic specializations that are lost after injury and can be rescued by in vivo treatment with the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose. We generated a novel PV-IN transcriptional identity module comprised primarily of genes encoding specialized ion channels, metabolic enzymes, and synaptic machinery, that identifies heterogenous subsets of injury-associated PV-INs with loss of PV-IN transcriptional identity. We show that changes in metabolic specialization are coupled to changes in transcriptional identity in PV-INs and implicate the PV-IN-enriched transcriptional co-activator, Ppargc1a, as a key driver of PV-IN transcriptional metabolic dysfunction. We also identify a family of long non-coding RNAs enriched in this subset of transcriptionally dysfunctional PV-INs that negatively correlates with PV-IN metabolic specialization. Lastly, we utilize these tools to interrogate a published human TBI snRNAseq data set and find nearly identical changes, underscoring the importance of PV-IN metabolic dysfunction in the pathology of TBI.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

This challenge can be tackled from two angles: by directed evolution, based on labor-intensive experimental testing of enzyme variant libraries, or by computational methods, where sequence-function data are used to predict biocatalyst improvements. Here, we combine both approaches into a two-week workflow, where ultra-high throughput screening of a library of imine reductases (IREDs) in microfluidic devices provides not only selected  hits, but also long-read sequence data linked to fitness scores of >17 thousand enzyme variants. We demonstrate engineering of an IRED for chiral amine synthesis by mapping functional information in one go, ready to be used for interpretation and extrapolation by protein engineers with the help of machine learning (ML). We calculate position-dependent mutability and combinability scores of mutations and comprehensively illuminate a complex interplay of mutations driven by synergistic, often positively epistatic effects. Interpreted by easy-to-use regression and tree-based ML algorithms designed to suit the evaluation of random whole-gene mutagenesis data, 3-fold improved  hits obtained from experimental screening are extrapolated further to give up to 23-fold improvements in catalytic rate after testing only a handful of designed mutants. Our campaign is paradigmatic for future enzyme engineering that will rely on access to large sequence-function maps as profiles of the way a biocatalyst responds to mutation. These maps will chart the way to improved function by exploiting the synergy of rapid experimental screening combined with ML evaluation and extrapolation.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

The hypervirulence is strongly linked to the overproduction of hypermucovisous capsule, but the underlining regulatory mechanism of hypermucoviscosity (HMV) has been elusive, especially at the post-transcriptional level mediated by small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs). Using a recently developed RNA interactome profiling approach, we interrogate the Hfq-associated sRNA regulatory network and establish the intracellular RNA-RNA interactome in HvKP. Our data reveal numerous interactions between sRNAs and HMV-related mRNAs, and identify a plethora of sRNAs that repress or promote HMV. One of the strongest repressors of HMV is ArcZ, which is activated by catabolite regulator CRP and targets many HMV-related genes including mlaA and fbp. We discover that MlaA and its function in phospholipid transport is crucial for capsule retention and HMV, inactivation of which abolished Klebsiella virulence in mice. ArcZ overexpression significantly reduced bacterial burden in mice and reduced HMV in multiple carbapenem-resistant and hypervirulent clinical isolates with diverse genetic background, indicating it is a potent RNA inhibitor of bacterial pneumonia with therapeutic potential. In summary, our work unravels a comprehensive map of the RNA-RNA interaction network of HvKP and identifies a novel CRP-ArcZ-MlaA regulatory circuit of HMV, providing mechanistic insights into the posttranscriptional virulence control in a superbug of global concern.

The aging ovary assumes a fibro-inflammatory milieu which negatively impacts gamete quantity and quality as well as ovulation. Here we tested whether the systemic delivery of anti-inflammatory (Etanercept) or anti-fibrotic (Pirfenidone) drugs attenuates ovarian aging in mice. We first evaluated the ability of these drugs to decrease the expression of fibro-inflammatory genes in primary ovarian stromal cells. Whereas Etanercept did not block Tnf expression in ovarian stromal cells, Pirfenidone significantly reduced Col1a1 expression. We then tested Pirfenidone in vivo where the drug was delivered systemically via mini-osmotic pumps for 6-weeks. Pirfenidone mitigated the age-dependent increase in ovarian fibrosis without impacting overall health parameters. Ovarian function was improved in Pirfenidone-treated mice as evidenced by increased follicle and corpora lutea number, AMH levels, and improved estrous cyclicity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Pirfenidone treatment resulted in an upregulation of reproductive function-related genes at 8.5 months and a downregulation of inflammatory genes at 12 months of age. These findings demonstrate that reducing the fibroinflammatory ovarian microenvironment improves ovarian function, thereby supporting modulating the ovarian environment as a therapeutic avenue to extend reproductive longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

While it is known that the infralimbic region (IL) of the medial prefrontal cortex mediates retrieval of an extinction memory through projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the contribution of the IL to extinction learning is not well-understood. Given the strong projection from the IL to the basal forebrain (BF), a center of attentional processing, we investigated whether this pathway participates in extinction, and compared it to the IL-BLA pathway. Using retrograde tracing, we first demonstrate that projections from the IL to the BF originate from superficial (L2/3) and deep cortical layers (L5), and that they are denser than IL projections to the BLA. Next, combining retrograde tracing with labeling of the immediate early gene cFos, we show increased activity of the L5 IL-BF pathway during extinction learning and increased activity of the L2/3 IL-BLA pathway during extinction retrieval. Our in vitro recordings demonstrate that neurons in the IL-BF pathway become more excitable towards the end of extinction learning, but less excitable during extinction retrieval. Finally, using optogenetics we show that inactivation of the IL-BF pathway impairs extinction learning, leaving retrieval intact. We propose that the IL acts as a switchboard operator during extinction, with increased L5 IL-BF communication during learning and increased L2/3 IL-BLA communication during retrieval. Anxiety and stress-related changes in IL physiology could affect one or multiple lines of communication, impairing different aspects of extinction.

Significance StatementExtinction of conditioned fear is a widely used behavioral approach to diminish fear, with projections from infralimbic prefrontal cortex to the amygdala known for mediating extinction memory retrieval. However, less is known about infralimbic pathways involved in extinction learning. We use neuroanatomical tracing, behavior, slice recordings, and circuit manipulation to show that infralimbic output to the basal forebrain, an attention processing center, is denser than to the amygdala, and is active during extinction learning rather than retrieval. Neurons in the infralimbic-basal forebrain pathway become more excitable as extinction learning progresses, and then less excitable during extinction retrieval. Moreover, inhibiting this pathway impairs extinction learning. Our findings identify different lines of communication the infralimbic cortex uses for extinction learning and retrieval.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

Vimentin is important for proper cellular adhesion and force generation, which are critical to cell migration; yet the vimentin cytoskeleton also hinders the ability of cells to squeeze through small pores in ECM, resisting migration. To identify the role of vimentin in collective cell migration, we generate spheroids of wide-type and vimentin-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mEFs) and embed them in a 3D collagen matrix. We find that loss of vimentin significantly impairs the ability of the spheroid to collectively expand through collagen networks and remodel the collagen network. Traction force analysis reveals that vimentin null spheroids exert less contractile force than their wild-type counterparts. In addition, spheroids made of mEFs with only vimentin unit length filaments (ULFs) exhibit similar behavior as vimentin-null spheroids, suggesting filamentous vimentin is required to promote 3D collective cell migration. We find the vimentin-mediated collective cell expansion is dependent on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) degradation of the collagen matrix. Further, 3D vertex model simulation of spheroid and embedded ECM indicates that wild-type spheroids behave more fluid-like, enabling more active pulling and reconstructing the surrounding collagen network. Altogether, these results signify that VIF plays a critical role in enhancing migratory persistence in 3D matrix environments through MMP transportation and tissue fluidity.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

Actinoporins are a family of -pore-forming proteins that bind specifically to sphingomyelin-containing lipid membranes, where they oligomerize and form transmembrane pores. The numerous contacts they form with the lipid membrane make them an exemplary object for studying the different roles that lipids play in the structure and function of membrane proteins. Through a comprehensive cryo-electron microscopic analysis of a pore formed by an actinoporin Fav from the coral Orbicella faveolata, we show that the octameric pore interacts with 112 lipids in the upper leaflet of the membrane. The structures of Fav pores formed on different lipid membranes reveal the different roles of lipids and demonstrate that the actinoporin surface is perfectly suited for binding multiple receptor sphingomyelin molecules. When cholesterol is present in the membrane, it forms nanodomains associated with the pore, leading to a tighter arrangement of lipids, which in turn increases the stability of the pores. Atomistic simulations support the structural data, show that the protein-bound lipids are not mobile, and reveal additional effects of the pore on the lipid membrane. Overall, these data reveal a complex network of protein-lipid and lipid-lipid interactions, and an underrated role of lipids in the structure and function of transmembrane protein complexes.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

Here, we characterize EVs produced by the dominant human gut methanogen, Methanobrevibacter smithii, which, unlike most archaea, contains a peptidoglycan cell wall. Using quantitative proteomics, we show that M. smithii EVs are enriched in various proteins responsible for chromatin structure, including histones, and DNA repair. Consistently, the M. smithii EVs carry DNA, with fragments covering the entire cellular chromosome. Notably, the EVs are strongly enriched in extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) molecules which originate from excision of a 2.9-kb chromosomal fragment and a proviral genome. The eccDNA encodes two of the key methanogenesis enzymes and could boost their expression inside the cells through the gene dosage effect. Furthermore, four of the top ten most abundant EV proteins are implicated in methanogenesis. Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) suggests that EVs are formed by budding from the cell membrane and are trapped under the cell wall prior to liberation through local disruptions in the cell wall. Collectively, our results reveal parallels with EV biogenesis in bacteria and suggest that M. smithii EVs facilitate the export of both cellular and viral DNA as well as key metabolic proteins in the gut environment, with potential impact on methane production.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

One factor that can bias trait estimations is the proportion of eukaryotic DNA in a metagenome, as some bioinformatic tools assume that all DNA reads in a metagenome are non-eukaryotic. Here, we help resolve a recent debate about the influence of eukaryotic DNA in the estimation of average genome size from a global soil sample dataset using a new bioinformatic tool. Contrary to what was assumed, our reanalysis of this dataset revealed that soil samples can contain a substantial proportion of eukaryotic DNA (~38.8%), which severely inflated average genome size estimates. We report that correcting for this bias significantly improves the statistical support for the negative relationship between average bacterial genome size and soil pH. These results highlight that metagenomes can contain large quantities of eukaryotic DNA, and that new methods that correct for this can improve microbial trait estimation.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

However, despite their remarkable clinical successes, a substantial majority of patients fail to achieve a lasting response to ICIs. To address this challenge and gain insights into the complex landscape of the tumor microenvironment (TME), we conducted an extensive analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA; ~216K cells across 39 samples) and single-nucleus transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (snATAC; ~43K cells from 15 samples) in a metastatic melanoma cohort. This systematic approach delineates 14 distinct cell types and 55 cell subtypes, including the identification of 15 transcriptional hallmarks of malignant cells. Through correlation analysis of cell subtype proportions, we unveiled six distinct clusters associated with varying tumor responses. Particularly intriguing was the identification of the mature DC enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mregDC) subtype exhibiting correlations with naive T and B cells, forming an anti-tumor program that underscores the importance of multiple immune cell types in mediating anti-tumor immunity. Notably, we found that mregDC abundance represents a good prognostic predictor of progression-free survival (PFS) in the context of ICI treatment, and when combined with the TCF7+/- CD8 T cell ratio, it reliably predicts patient PFS across treatments beyond ICI. We validated our findings using an independent cohort of 274 ICI-treated melanoma samples analyzed using tissue-level expression. We next compared mregDCs and conventional dendritic cell types 1 and 2 (cDC1 and cDC2) using transcriptome signature, differentiation trajectory, interactome, cytokine milieu, and epigenome landscape analyses. This comparative analysis shed light on the unique attributes of mregDCs within the TME. Finally, we investigated cell type/subtype-specific genes, pathways, immune response enrichment, and ligand-receptor interactions closely associated with the proportions of mregDCs within the TME. These molecular and cellular insights, with their critical roles in enhancing the immune response against cancer, offer valuable prospects for predicting the efficacy of ICI regimens, and potentially guiding the selection of rational combinatorial therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

By integrating experiments and simulations we demonstrate that eIF4B IDR orchestrates and fine-tunes an intricate transition from monomers to a condensed phase, in which large-size dynamic oligomers form before mesoscopic phase separation. Single-molecule spectroscopy combined with molecular simulations enabled us to characterize the conformational ensembles and underlying intra- and intermolecular dynamics across the oligomerization transition. The observed sensitivity to ionic strength and molecular crowding in the self-association landscape suggests potential regulation of eIF4B nanoscopic and mesoscopic behaviors such as driven by protein modifications, binding partners or changes to the cellular environment.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

However, the molecular mechanisms that drive plant physiological responses to soil Zn deficiency are not well understood. We used an untargeted metabolomics approach to search for metabolites exuded from roots during Zn deficiency stress, which led to the discovery of a collection of secreted small defensin-like peptides in Arabidopsis thaliana (named Zinc-Deficiency Responsive Peptides (ZDRPs)). Phylogenetic analysis and untargeted metabolomics revealed ZDRPs in at least eleven accessions of A. thaliana and nine members of the Brassicaceae family. Analysis of Arabidopsis gene mutants and overexpressing lines, in combination with chemical complementation experiments, unveiled a critical role of these peptides in plant root growth. We hypothesize that Brassicaceae secreted peptides enable plants to expand their root mass to reach Zn-rich soil layers and optimize Zn uptake. These data reveal a critical relationship between plant survival, Zn status, root morphology and peptide production. Taken together, our results expand our knowledge regarding micronutrient deficiency responses in plants and could enable in engineering approaches to make plants more resilient to low Zn conditions.

SignificanceZinc deficiency is the most abundant micronutrient deficiency affecting about 50% of arable lands thus presenting a high burden for plant health and agriculture globally. In this study, we reveal a metabolic strategy by Brassicaceae to deal with low Zn concentrations. We characterize the role of peptides expressed upon zinc deficiency in a variety of important crop plants. The discovery of a cryptic class of peptides that are made by plant roots specifically suffering from Zn deficiency provides critical insight into the molecular mechanisms by which plants dynamically acclimate to nutrient-limited soils. The identification of peptides actively secreted by zinc-deprived plants has translational value for sustainable agriculture, human health, and bioengineering approaches to enable tolerance to low zinc.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693093

Differences in copy number and other sources of extrinsic noise generate variance in transgene expression and limit the performance of synthetic gene circuits. In a therapeutic context, supraphysiological expression of transgenes can compromise engineered phenotypes and lead to toxicity. To ensure a narrow range of transgene expression, we design and characterize Compact microRNA-Mediated Attenuator of Noise and Dosage (ComMAND), a single-transcript, microRNA-based incoherent feedforward loop. We tune the ComMAND output profile, and we model the system to explore additional tuning strategies. By comparing ComMAND to two-gene implementations, we highlight the precise control afforded by the single-transcript architecture, particularly at relatively low copy numbers. We show that ComMAND tightly regulates transgene expression from lentiviruses and precisely controls expression in primary human T cells, primary rat neurons, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and human induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, ComMAND effectively sets levels of the clinically relevant transgenes FMRP1 and FXN within a narrow window. Together, ComMAND is a compact tool well-suited to precisely specify expression of therapeutic cargoes.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693094

Cholesterol is a plasma membrane enriched lipid with pivotal roles in the control of membrane fluidity and maintenance of membrane microarchitecture, directly impacting on GPCR stability, dynamics and function. Cholesterol extraction from pancreatic beta cells has previously been shown to disrupt the internalisation, clustering and cAMP responses of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a class B1 GPCR with key roles in the control of blood glucose levels via the potentiation of insulin secretion in beta cells and weight reduction via the modulation of brain appetite control centres. Here, we unveil the detrimental effect of a high cholesterol diet on GLP-1R-dependent glucoregulation in vivo, and the improvement in GLP-1R function that a reduction in cholesterol synthesis using simvastatin exerts in pancreatic islets. We next identify and map sites of cholesterol high occupancy and residence time on active versus inactive GLP-1Rs using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (cgMD) simulations, followed by a screen of key residues selected from these sites and detailed analyses of the effects of mutating one of these residues, Val229, to alanine on GLP-1R interactions with cholesterol, plasma membrane behaviours, clustering, trafficking and signalling in pancreatic beta cells and primary islets, unveiling an improved insulin secretion profile for the V229A mutant receptor.

A factor critical for modulating the pool of 60S ribosomal subunits is eukaryotic translation initiation factor-6 (eIF6). Release of eIF6 from the 60S subunit is important for permitting 60S interactions with 40S to form the 80S monosome. Here, using a mutant of eIF6 (N106S) that interacts poorly with the 60S subunit, we show that the ribosomal subunit associations are deregulated in the absence of eIF6 and lead to an increase in empty 80S ribosomes that decreases global protein synthesis rates. Intriguingly, altering 80S ribosome availability markedly affects the mitotic phase and leads to chromosome segregation defects that induces delays in mitotic exit and mitotic catastrophe. Ribo-Seq analysis of the eIF6-N106S mutant shows a significant downregulation in the translation efficiencies of genes associated with mitosis and cytoskeleton, and specifically transcripts with long 3UTRs. eIF6-N106S mutation also markedly affects cancer invasion, and this role is correlated with the overexpression of eIF6 only in high-grade invasive bladder and breast cancers.

Effective antimicrobial therapy reduces complications and mortality; however, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major problem in many endemic countries. Prevention through vaccination is possible through recently-licensed Gavi-supported typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs), and national immunisation programs are currently being considered or deployed in several countries where AMR prevalence is known to be high. Pathogen whole genome sequence data are a rich source of information on Typhi variants (genotypes or lineages), AMR prevalence, and mechanisms. However, this information is currently not readily accessible to non-genomics experts, including those driving vaccine implementation or empirical therapy guidance.

ResultsWe developed TyphiNET (https://www.typhi.net), an interactive online dashboard for exploring Typhi genotype and AMR distributions derived from publicly available pathogen genome sequences. TyphiNET allows users to explore country-level summaries such as the frequency of pathogen lineages, temporal trends in resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobials, and the specific variants and mechanisms underlying emergent AMR trends. User-driven plots and session reports can be downloaded for ease of sharing. Importantly, TyphiNET is populated by high-quality genome data curated by the Global Typhoid Pathogen Genomics Consortium, analysed using the Pathogenwatch platform, and identified as coming from non-targeted sampling frames that are suitable for estimating AMR prevalence amongst Typhi infections (no personal data is included in the platform). As of February 2024, data from a total of n=11,836 genomes from 101 countries are available in TyphiNET. We outline case studies illustrating how the dashboard can be used to explore these data and gain insights of relevance to both researchers and public health policy-makers.

ConclusionsThe TyphiNET dashboard provides an interactive platform for accessing genome-derived data on pathogen variant frequencies to inform typhoid control and intervention strategies. The platform is extensible in terms of both data and features, and provides a model for making complex bacterial genome-derived data accessible to a wide audience.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693094

Despite the fundamental importance of BLTPs for cellular function, the architecture, composition, and lipid transfer mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Here, we present the subunit composition and the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the native LPD-3 BLTP complex isolated from transgenic C. elegans. LPD-3 folds into an elongated, rod-shaped tunnel whose interior is filled with ordered lipid molecules that are coordinated by a track of ionizable residues that line one side of the tunnel. LPD-3 forms a complex with two previously uncharacterized proteins, here named ""Intake"" and ""Spigot"", both of which interact with the N-terminal end of LPD-3 where lipids enter the tunnel. Intake has three transmembrane helices, one of which borders the entrance to the tunnel; Spigot has one transmembrane helix and extends 80 [A] along the cytosolic surface of LPD-3.

Here we explore possibilities for an analytical approach to characterize the antigen-specific antibody repertoire directly from the secreted proteins in convalescent serum. This approach aims to perform simultaneous antibody sequencing and epitope mapping using a combination of single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and bottom-up proteomics techniques based on mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We evaluate the performance of the deep-learning tool ModelAngelo in determining de novo antibody sequences directly from reconstructed 3D volumes of antibody-antigen complexes. We demonstrate that while map quality is a critical bottleneck, it is possible to sequence antibody variable domains from cryoEM reconstructions with accuracies of up to 80-90%. While the rate of errors exceeds the typical levels of somatic hypermutation, we show that the ModelAngelo-derived sequences can be used to assign the used V-genes. This provides a functional guide to assemble de novo peptides from LC-MS/MS data more accurately and improves the tolerance to a background of polyclonal antibody sequences. Following this proof-of-principle, we discuss the feasibility and future directions of this approach to characterize antigen-specific antibody repertoires.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693094

However, large size also poses biophysical challenges, especially regarding the transport of nutrients to all cells; these constraints are typically overcome through multicellular innovations (e.g., a circulatory system). Here we show that an emergent biophysical mechanism -- spontaneous fluid flows arising from metabolically-generated density gradients -- can alleviate constraints on nutrient transport, enabling exponential growth in nascent multicellular clusters of yeast lacking any multicellular adaptations for nutrient transport or fluid flow. Surprisingly, beyond a threshold size, the metabolic activity of experimentally-evolved snowflake yeast clusters drives large-scale fluid flows that transport nutrients throughout the cluster at speeds comparable to those generated by the cilia of extant multicellular organisms. These flows support exponential growth at macroscopic sizes that theory predicts should be diffusion limited. This work demonstrates how simple physical mechanisms can act as a  biophysical scaffold to support the evolution of multicellularity by opening up phenotypic possibilities prior to genetically-encoded innovations. More broadly, our findings highlight how cooption of conserved physical processes is a crucial but underappreciated facet of evolutionary innovation across scales.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693094

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3].

Using a live-cell imaging assay for the translation of the PINK1 precursor, we show that local translation of PINK1 requires a concerted interplay between mitochondria and the ER in neurons. For efficient translation, the Pink1 mRNA needs to relocate to ribosomes located near endolysosomes and the ER. The ER membrane-tethered chaperone DNAJB6 then shields the PINK1 precursor on transit to mitochondria following the ER-SURF pathway.

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1719439693094

Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions.

During low arousal states such as slow wave sleep, the cortex is synchronized and dominated by low frequency rhythms coordinated across multiple regions. Although recent evidence suggests that GABAergic inhibitory neurons are key players in cortical state modulation, the in vivo circuit mechanisms coordinating synchronized activity among local and distant neocortical networks are not well understood. Here, we show that somatostatin and chondrolectin co-expressing cells (Sst-Chodl cells), a sparse and unique class of neocortical inhibitory neurons, are selectively active during low arousal states and are largely silent during periods of high arousal. In contrast to other neocortical inhibitory neurons, we show these neurons have long-range axons that project across neocortical areas. Activation of Sst-Chodl cells is sufficient to promote synchronized cortical states characteristic of low arousal, with increased spike co-firing and low frequency brain rhythms, and to alter behavioral states by promoting sleep. Contrary to the prevailing belief that sleep is exclusively driven by subcortical mechanisms, our findings reveal that these long-range inhibitory neurons not only track changes in behavioral state but are sufficient to induce both sleep-like cortical states and sleep behavior, establishing a crucial circuit component in regulating behavioral states.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693094

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

Such discordance has hampered interpretation and convergence of research findings across the field. To address this problem, we have developed the Network Correspondence Toolbox (NCT) to permit researchers to examine and report spatial correspondence between their novel neuroimaging results and sixteen widely used functional brain atlases, consistent with recommended reporting standards developed by the Organization for Human Brain Mapping.

The atlases included in the toolbox show some topographical convergence for specific networks, such as those labeled as ""default"" or ""visual"". Network naming varies across atlases, particularly for networks spanning frontoparietal association cortices. For this reason, quantitative comparison with multiple atlases is recommended to benchmark novel neuroimaging findings.

We provide several exemplar demonstrations using the Human Connectome Project task fMRI results and UK Biobank independent component analysis maps to illustrate how researchers can use the NCT to report their own findings through quantitative evaluation against multiple published atlases. The NCT provides a convenient means for computing Dice coefficients with spin test permutations to determine the magnitude and statistical significance of correspondence among user-defined maps and existing atlas labels. The NCT also includes functionality to incorporate additional atlases in the future. The adoption of the NCT will make it easier for network neuroscience researchers to report their findings in a standardized manner, thus aiding reproducibility and facilitating comparisons between studies to produce interdisciplinary insights.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693094

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693094

Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693094

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693094

These ruminants were presumed not to be hosts for IAVs. Previously, IAV-positive mammalian species were hunters and scavengers, possibly getting infected while feeding on infected birds. It is now presumed that H5N1 viruses that circulate in US dairy cattle transmit through a mammary gland route, in contrast to transmission by aerosols via the respiratory tract, although the latter cannot be excluded. The receptor display in the mammary and respiratory tract in cows for IAVs is unknown. Here, we used recombinant HA proteins representing current circulating and classical H5 viruses to determine the distribution of IAV receptors in the respiratory and mammary tract tissues of cows and goats. Most of the sialome of the cow and goat respiratory tract is lined with sialic acid modifications such as N-glycolyl and O-acetyl, which are not bound by IAV. Interestingly, the H5 protein representing the cow isolates bound significantly in the mammary gland, whereas classical H5 proteins failed to do so. Furthermore, whereas the 9-O-acetyl modification is prominent in all tissues tested, the 5-N-glycolyl modification is not, resulting in the display of receptors for avian IAV hemagglutinins. This could explain the high levels of virus found in these tissues and milk, adding supporting data to this possible virus transmission route.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693094

However, to be included in national NCS inventories, governments must first quantify the kelp-derived carbon stocks and fluxes leading to carbon sequestration. Here, we present a blueprint for assessing the national carbon sequestration capacity of kelp forests in which data synthesis and Bayesian hierarchical modelling enable estimates of kelp forest carbon production, storage, and export capacity from limited data. Applying this blueprint to Canadas extensive coastline, we find kelp forests store an estimated 1.4 Tg C in short-term biomass and produce 3.1 Tg C yr-1 with modest carbon fluxes to the deep ocean. Arctic kelps had the highest carbon stocks and production capacity, while Pacific kelps had greater carbon fluxes overall due to their higher productivity and export rates. Our transparent, reproducible blueprint represents an important step towards accurate carbon accounting for kelp forests.","NA","biorxiv",1719439693094

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1719439693094

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

SummaryAmong 47561 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine was 23% effective against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1719439693094
