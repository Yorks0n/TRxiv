Most organisms have a life cycle with unicellular bottlenecks during reproduction. However, some organisms like plants, fungi, or colonial animals can grow indefinitely, changing the manner in which mutations spread throughout both the individual and the population. Furthermore, clonally reproducing organisms may also achieve exceedingly long lifespans, making somatic mutation an important mechanism of creating heritable variation for Darwinian evolution by natural selection. Yet, little is known about intra-organism mutation rates and evolutionary trajectories in long-lived species. Here, we study the Pando aspen clone, the largest known quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) clone founded by a single seedling and thought to be one of the oldest studied organisms. Aspen reproduce vegetatively via new root-borne stems forming clonal patches, sometimes spanning several hectares. To study the evolutionary history of the Pando clone, we collected and sequenced over 500 samples from Pando and neighboring clones, as well as from various tissue types within Pando, including leaves, roots, and bark. We applied a series of filters to distinguish somatic mutations from the pool of both somatic and germline mutations, incorporating a technical replicate sequencing approach to account for uncertainty in somatic mutation detection. Despite root spreading being spatially constrained, we observed only a modest positive correlation between genetic and spatial distance, suggesting the presence of a mechanism preventing the accumulation and spread of mutations across units. Phylogenetic models estimate the age of the clone to between ~16,000-80,000 years. This age is generally corroborated by the near-continuous presence of aspen pollen in a lake sediment record collected from Fish Lake near Pando. Overall, this work enhances understanding of mutation accumulation and dispersal within and between ramets of long-lived, clonally-reproducing organisms.

Significance StatementThis study enhances our understanding of evolutionary processes in long-lived clonal organisms by investigating somatic mutation accumulation and dispersal patterns within the iconic Pando aspen clone. The authors estimated the clone to be between 10,000 and 80,000 years old and uncovered a modest spatial genetic structure in the 42.6-hectare clone, suggesting localized mutation build-up rather than dispersal along tissue lineages. This work sheds light on an ancient organism and how plants may evolve to preserve genetic integrity in meristems fueling indefinite growth, with implications for our comprehension of adaptive strategies in long-lived perennials.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

Advanced spatial transcriptomics has enabled biologists to break new ground in studies of molecular dynamics and cellular patterning during embryonic development with spatiotemporal resolution. To construct a comprehensive developmental trajectory, current three-dimensional (3D) spatial transcriptomic profiling leverages mouse embryos from gastrulation (E5.5) to organogenesis (E13.5) in continuity. However, a crucial phase for early organogenesis between E9.5 and E11.5 was deficient. To unveil the mystery of this stage, we present the 3D transcriptomics of mouse embryos at E9.5 and E11.5, with a widely applicable reconstruction workflow that bypasses sophisticated bioinformatic calculations. As our 3D atlas is generated at single-cell resolution, we demonstrate how organogenetic processes can be interpreted at different levels of granularity, from local cellular interactions to whole embryonic regionalization. We release the open-access database MOSTA3D (Mouse Organogenesis Spatiotemporal Transcriptomic Atlas in Three-dimensional) and hope a broader community will contribute to extending this framework from conception to senility in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

A subset meets diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Several studies have reported persistence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins or RNA in serum or tissues of both recovered individuals and PCS patients. In this exploratory study, we investigated whether serum spike protein is associated with PCS and whether it correlates with symptom severity and laboratory biomarkers. We analyzed serum spike protein levels in 121 PCS patients following mild-to-moderate COVID 19, 72 of whom met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS (post-COVID ME/CFS, pcMECFS). Pre-pandemic seronegative healthy controls (ppHC, n = 32) and post-COVID recovered healthy controls (pcHC, n = 37) after SARS-CoV-2 infection were also included in the study. We found persistent serum SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a subset of pcHC (11 %), PCS non-ME/CFS patients (2 %), and pcMECFS patients (14 %). There was no significant association with disease severity, symptoms, or laboratory markers. The spike protein concentration was independent of the time since last spike exposure (infection or vaccination). In five spike-positive out of a total of 22 patients who underwent immunoglobulin depletion via immunoadsorption (IA), spike protein was reduced or completely removed after treatment, indicating binding to immunoglobulins. In summary, our study identified serum spike protein in a subset of patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection without evidence for a role in the pathogenesis of PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1731449359489

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty. We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1731449359489

Among a list of symptoms associated with multi-organ dysfunctions, the neurological complications are particularly intriguing, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. With the recently developed mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 stain, we are now able to model the mild COVID infection in C57BL/6 mice and study the chronic immune responses and subsequent damages in different organs long after the viruses are clearly naturally in the body. More specifically, we found adult C57BL/6J mice developed neurological impairments, including behavior changes related to sensorimotor coordination, depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, and inflammation in multiple organs including lung, liver and brain, which persisted over at least 4 weeks in mice even with mild infection. Therefore, this model can be used to further explopred the mechanisms of PASC, as well as potential intervention or therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

However, current analytical approaches often rely on linear models that cannot capture the complex, context-dependent nature of methylation regulation. Here we present MethylGPT, a transformer-based foundation model trained on 226,555 (154,063 after QC and deduplication) human methylation profiles spanning diverse tissue types from 5,281 datasets, curated 49,156 CpG sites, and 7.6 billion training tokens. MethylGPT learns biologically meaningful representations of CpG sites, capturing both local genomic context and higher-order chromosomal features without external supervision. The model demonstrates robust methylation value prediction (Pearson R=0.929) and maintains stable performance in downstream tasks with up to 70% missing data. Applied to age prediction across multiple tissue types, MethylGPT achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods. Analysis of the models attention patterns reveals distinct methylation signatures between young and old samples, with differential enrichment of developmental and aging-associated pathways. When finetuned to mortality and disease prediction across 60 major conditions using 18,859 samples from Generation Scotland, MethylGPT achieves robust predictive performance and enables systematic evaluation of intervention effects on disease risks, demonstrating potential for clinical applications. Our results demonstrate that transformer architectures can effectively model DNA methylation patterns while preserving biological interpretability, suggesting broad utility for epigenetic analysis and clinical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

Here, we construct a consensus variant-to-function (cV2F) score that assigns a single value to each common single-nucleotide variant in the genome, and helps to predict and characterize causal disease variants. The cV2F score leverages features reflecting variant-level experimentally and computationally predicted function (e.g. allelic imbalance and sequence-based deep learning models) and element-level function (e.g. predicted enhancers), and learns optimal combinations of features by training a gradient boosting model on GWAS fine-mapping results. The cV2F-annotated variants attained an AUPRC of 0.822 at identifying held-out fine-mapped variants. Variants with high cV2F scores are highly enriched for heritability (14.2x, s.e. 0.5) across 66 diseases/traits, are uniquely informative for disease heritability, and are highly predictive of variants implicated by reporter assays; cV2F substantially outperforms previous variant-to-function scores using all of these metrics. GWAS fine-mapping of 110 diseases/traits informed by cV2F identified 14.3% more confidently fine-mapped (PIP > 0.95) variants than non-functionally informed fine-mapping. We further constructed tissue/cell line-specific cV2F scores that prioritize variants based on regulatory potential in specific tissues/cell lines, attaining high heritability enrichment for tissue-related diseases/traits (15.6x, s.e. 2.3) while providing independent information (average correlation of 0.27 with the primary cV2F score).

Here, we explored genome editing to correct the most common MSMDS-causative mutation ACTA2 R179H. In a first-in-kind approach, we performed mutation-specific protein engineering to develop a bespoke CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme with enhanced on-target activity against the R179H sequence. To directly correct the R179H mutation, we screened dozens of configurations of base editors (comprised of Cas9 enzymes, deaminases, and gRNAs) to develop a highly precise corrective A-to-G edit with minimal deleterious bystander editing that is otherwise prevalent when using wild-type SpCas9 base editors. We then created a murine model of MSMDS that exhibits phenotypes consistent with human patients, including vasculopathy and premature death, to explore the in vivo therapeutic potential of this base editing strategy. Delivery of the customized base editor via an engineered SMC-tropic adeno-associated virus (AAV-PR) vector substantially prolonged survival and rescued systemic phenotypes across the lifespan of MSMDS mice, including in the vasculature, aorta, and brain. Together, our optimization of a customized base editor highlights how bespoke CRISPR-Cas enzymes can enhance on-target correction while minimizing bystander edits, culminating in a precise editing approach that may enable a long-lasting treatment for patients with MSMDS.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

Following a bloodmeal, mosquitoes experience significant physiological changes, primarily orchestrated by the midgut and fat body tissues. These changes begin with digestion and culminate in egg production. However, our understanding of those key processes at the cellular and molecular level remains limited. We have created a comprehensive cell atlas of the mosquito midgut and fat body by employing single-cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics techniques. This atlas unveils the dynamic cellular composition and metabolic adaptations that occur following a bloodmeal. Our analyses reveal highly diverse cell populations, specialized in digestion, metabolism, immunity, and reproduction. While the midgut primarily comprises enterocytes, enteroendocrine and intestinal stem cells, the fat body consists not only of trophocytes and oenocytes, but also harbors a substantial hemocyte population and a newly found fat body-yolk cell population. The fat body exhibits a complex cellular and metabolomic profile and exerts a central role in coordinating immune and metabolic processes. Additionally, an insect-specific virus, PCLV (Phasi Charoen-Like Virus) was detected in single cells, mainly in the midgut a week after the bloodmeal. These findings highlight the complexity of the mosquito abdominal tissues, and pave the way towards the development of exquisitely refined vector control strategies consisting of genetically targeting specific cell populations and metabolic pathways necessary for egg development after a bloodmeal.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

MethodsWe identified which participants with long COVID also met the Institute of Medicine (IOM) or the 2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC) for ME/CFS at approximately 6-8 months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection in two cohorts: (1) the JHU COVID Recovery cohort, which enrolled participants within 4 weeks of infection and (2) the Long-term Impact of Infection with Novel Coronavirus (LIINC) cohort, which enriched for participants with long COVID. Neither study administered ME/CFS-specific surveys, so available data elements were mapped onto each ME/CFS diagnostic criteria.

ResultsOf 97 JHU participants with long COVID, 5 met IOM criteria and 2 met CCC criteria. Of 281 LIINC participants with long COVID, 51 met the IOM criteria and 29 met the CCC criteria. In LIINC, participants with long COVID meeting ME/CFS criteria were more likely to be female and report a greater number of post-COVID symptoms (p<0.001).

ConclusionsThe co-occurrence of ME/CFS symptoms and long COVID suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is a cause of ME/CFS. ME/CFS-specific measures should be incorporated into studies of post-acute COVID-19 to advance studies of post-SARS-CoV-2 onset ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1731449359489

We show in artificial neural network models that varying the recurrence level causes these differences in coding properties to emerge. We confirmed the contribution of recurrent connectivity to functional heterogeneity by characterizing the representational geometry of neural recordings and comparing it with theoretical predictions of neural manifold dimensionality. Our results indicate that local circuit organization, particularly recurrent connectivity among excitatory neurons, plays a key role in shaping complementary spatial representations within the hippocampus.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

We discovered that bacteria can overcome this limitation by acquiring nutrients through lysing neighboring cells via contact-dependent antagonism. Using single-cell live imaging and isotopic markers, we found that during starvation the type VI secretion system, which transfers toxins into neighboring cells, increases growth by enabling the uptake of nutrients from lysing cells. In a spatially structured environment, the gradual lysis of just a few target cells allows for the growth of a new antagonist cell. Genomic adaptations in antagonists, characterized by a reduced metabolic gene repertoire, and the prevalence of the type VI secretion system in natural environments, such as global oceans and soils, suggest that bacterial antagonism has the potential to substantially contribute to nutrient transfer within microbial communities across various ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

A naturally occurring, low-frequency, gain-of-function missense variant, rs10305492 G>A (A316T), protects against T2D and cardiovascular disease. Here we employ CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate a humanised knock-in mouse model bearing the homozygous Glp1r A316T substitution.

They also exhibited alterations in islet cytoarchitecture and {beta}-cell identity under a high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet.

However, several questions on the mechanistic links between shape and function remain unanswered. Here, we developed an efficient protocol to generate pure populations of morphologically distinct human astrocytes in vitro, which we used for a systematic analysis of shape-function relationships. We performed a structural, molecular, and functional characterization of these populations and highlighted how their distinct morphologies mirror distinct functional and transcriptional patterns at the population level. We were also able to both correlate gene expression profiles of these morphologically distinct astrocyte subtypes with in vivo astrocytes in the human brain, and to validate our findings with primary isolated murine astrocytes in vitro. Moreover, we show that the observed morphological differences are correlated with changes in key cytoskeletal proteins, which offers a potential link to the observed functional differences. Finally, we demonstrated that different morphological subtypes of astrocytes have distinct reactivity responses to a common stimulus. This study offers a glimpse into the shape-function dynamics of human astrocytes, highlighting potential mechanistic links between cytoskeletal usage and astrocyte function, while also providing tools and datasets that will be useful for further studies into human glial biology in health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

However, the molecular changes leading to exaptations remain unclear. Here, we investigated the potential of bacterial transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) to evolve exaptively, examining three global transcription factors (TFs) from Escherichia coli: CRP, Fis, and IHF. Using a massively parallel reporter assay, we mapped three combinatorially complete adaptive landscapes, encompassing all intermediate sequences between three pairs of strong TFBSs for each TF. Our results revealed that these landscapes are smooth and navigable, with a monotonic relationship between mutations and their impact on gene regulation. Starting from a strong TFBS for one of our TFs, Darwinian evolution can create a strong TFBS for another TF through a small number of individually adaptive mutations. Notably, most intermediate genotypes are prone to transcriptional crosstalk - gene regulation mediated by both TFs. Because our landscapes are smooth, Darwinian evolution can also easily create TFBSs that show such crosstalk whenever it is adaptive. Our study presents the first in vivo evidence that new TFBSs can evolve exaptively through multiple small and adaptive mutational steps. It also highlights the importance of regulatory crosstalk for the diversification of bacterial gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

Genetic loss of either LUBAC or OTULIN causes autoinflammatory syndromes, which are associated with defects in glycogen and lipid metabolism. However, how LUBAC and OTULIN regulate metabolic signalling remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that LUBAC promotes, while OTULIN restricts, activation of the key metabolic regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in cells, mice, and human samples. LUBAC and OTULIN interact with AMPK, control its M1-ubiquitination, and regulate its activation in response to glucose starvation and allosteric activation. During starvation, LUBAC deficiency impairs autophagy induction and hinders the shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Strikingly, LUBAC-deficient Drosophila have a strongly reduced survival rate after starvation. Our work identifies LUBAC and OTULIN as physiological regulators of AMPK, providing the first mechanism by which M1-linked ubiquitin chains regulate metabolic signalling.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

In this study, we investigated how MP regulates PIN1 polarity and organogenesis, discovering that the downstream vascular transcription factor TMO5 regulates PIN1 polarity non-cell-autonomously and promotes organ initiation in the SAM.

Streptococci are common in animal microbiota and include opportunistic pathogens like Group A Streptococcus (GAS) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). While the conserved streptococcal S protein has been identified as a key factor in GAS virulence, its exact function is unclear. Here, we show that the pneumococcal S protein is crucial for resisting against host-derived antimicrobials by coordinating cell wall modification and repair. Specifically, we show that S proteins are septally localized through their transmembrane domain and contain an extracellular peptidoglycan (PG) binding LysM domain which is required for its function. Protein-protein and genetic interaction studies demonstrate that the pneumococcal S protein directly interacts with a PG synthase, class A penicillin binding protein PBP1a, and the PG deacetylase PgdA. Single-molecule experiments reveal that the fraction of circumferentially moving PBP1a molecules is reduced in the absence of S protein. Consistent with an impaired PBP1a function, streptococci lacking S protein exhibit increased susceptibility to cell wall targeting antibiotics and altered cell morphologies. PG analysis showed reduced N-deacetylation of glycans in the S. pneumoniae S protein mutant, indicating reduced PgdA activity. We show that pneumococci lacking the S protein cannot persist transient penicillin treatment, are more susceptible to the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 and to lysozyme, and show decreased virulence in zebrafish and mice. Our data support a model in which S proteins regulate PBP1a activity and play a key role in coordinating PG repair and modification.

This study evaluates these three tools for predicting protein-peptide complex structures using Template-Based (TB) and Template-Free (TF) methods. AlphaFold-Multimer excels in TB predictions and performs moderately in TF scenarios in the prediction pool, but TF outperforms TB in the first-ranked models. ColabFold demonstrates versatility in both TB and TF settings. AlphaFold3 generates high-quality structures for more proteins, but the medium accuracy is not as good as AlphaFold-Multimer using a large model pool. We also assessed the performance of various scoring functions in ranking predicted protein-peptide complex structures. While the scoring function built in AlphaFold demonstrates the best performance, some other scoring functions, e.g., FoldX-Stability and HADDOCK-mdscore, provide complementary values. The findings suggest the potential for enhancing scoring functions targeting AlphaFold-based predictions by combining multiple scoring functions or using a consensus approach from many prediction models.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

PE remains inadequately predicted, prevented and treated. Here, we comprehensively investigated altered transcriptomic and epigenetic changes in the PE placenta and maternal cell free RNA (cfRNA). We show that many transposable elements (TEs) in sub-families are deregulated in the gestational age-matched PE placenta. Increased expression of endogenous retrovirus (ERV) and long interspersed nuclear element 1 (L1, LINE1) subfamilies of TEs is associated with higher histone acetylation levels at their regulatory elements. A higher TE transcript level correlates with the type I interferon (IFN I) pathway, suggesting inflammation associated with PE could be due to the sensing of TE transcripts by the antiviral innate immune system. Consistent with higher TE transcript levels in the PE placentas, analysis of maternal cfRNA data revealed differential levels of TE subfamilies in PE compared to healthy controls. Machine learning-based training for TE transcripts for early prediction of PE showed a robust performance in the validation cohort, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88, 81% sensitivity, and 74% positive predictive value (PPV). Overall, we show TE deregulation in the placenta is associated with PE, and maternal cfRNA TE signature accurately predicts early diagnosis of PE, which can improve prophylaxis and obstetric outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

Here, we present evidence indicating that COPII-mediated vesicle transport is transcriptionally controlled through the phosphatidic acid-dependent Opi1-Ino2/Ino4 regulatory circuit. Our analysis indicates that YIP3, a target gene of Ino2/Ino4, exerts a negative regulatory impact on COPII-mediated vesicle transport. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Ino2/Ino4 but not Yip3 modulates Sar1 activation, the initial step in COPII vesicle formation, whereas Yip3 hinders Sec16 assembly on the ER membrane, thereby implying that Ino2/Ino4 governs COPII-mediated trafficking at multiple steps. Thus, this study provides the first evidence for an ER sensing system that transcriptionally fine-tunes multiple steps of anterograde vesicular transport in response to alterations in lipid composition of the ER membrane.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

However, the relatively low representation of admixed populations in both discovery and fine-tuning individual-level datasets limits PRS development for admixed populations. Under the assumption that the most informative PRS weight for a homogeneous sample, which can be approximated by a data point in the ancestry continuum space, varies linearly in that space, we introduce a Genetic Distance-assisted PRS Combination Pipeline for Diverse Genetic Ancestries (DiscoDivas) to interpolate a harmonized PRS for diverse, especially admixed, ancestries, leveraging multiple PRS weights fine-tuned within single-ancestry samples and the genetic ancestry continuum information. DiscoDivas treats ancestry as a continuous variable and does not require shifting between different models when calculating PRS for different ancestries. We generated PRS with DiscoDivas and the current conventional method, i.e. fine-tuning multiple GWAS PRS using the matched or similar ancestry sample, for simulated datasets and large-scale biobank datasets (UK Biobank [UKBB] N=415,402, Mass General Brigham Biobank N=53,306, All of Us N=245,394) and compared our method with the conventional method with quantitative traits and complex disease traits. DiscoDivas generated a harmonized PRS of the accuracy comparable to or higher than the conventional approach, with the greatest advantage exhibited in admixed samples: DiscoDivas PRS for admixed samples was more statistically accurate than the PRS fine-tuned in matched or similar ancestry sample in 12 out of 16 simulated scenarios and was statistically equivalent in the remaining four scenarios; when tested with quantitative trait data in UKBB, DiscoDivas increased the PRS accuracy of admixed sample by 5% on average; yet no statistical difference was observed when tested for binary traits in UKBB where ancestry-matched data was available. For the single ancestry samples, the accuracy of DiscoDivas PRS and PRS fine-tuned in match samples was similar. In summary, our method DiscoDivas yields a harmonized PRS of robust accuracy for individuals across the genetic ancestry spectrum, including where ancestry-matched training data may be incomplete.","NA","medrxiv",1731449359489

However, a trade-off between spatial resolution, speed, photodamage, and setup complexity limits its implementation. Here, we designed and built a single objective light sheet microscope, customized for in vivo imaging of adult flies and optimized for maximum resolution. Unlike multi-objective light sheet setups, the microscope uses a single objective at the fly head interface, facilitating sample mounting and inspection, and reducing invasiveness. In contrast to two-photon microscopies, the light-sheet configuration with visible excitation offers reduced phototoxicity. We demonstrate in vivo imaging of the membrane, mitochondria, and dense-core vesicles in the axonal projections of small lateral ventral neurons. The achieved resolution was between 380 to 500 nm within a field of view of 70x50x12 m3. This unique combination of easy sample mounting, high resolution, and the low-phototoxicity of light sheet illumination paves the way for new dynamic studies in the brain of living flies.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

Since its outbreak in late 2019, the virus has been estimated to have explored all possible alternatives in terms of missense mutations for all sites of its polypeptide chain. Spike protein of the virus-responsible for target recognition, cellular entry, and endosomal escape-exhibits the largest sequence variation in particular. Here, we detail the evolutionary changes in ionizable amino acids which can acquire either positive or negative charge and which have been shown to have led to a significant increase in the overall charge on the spike protein during the initial period of the pandemic. While the previously observed charge trends have recently come to a halt, we show that mutations in ionizable amino acids continue to occur with the newly emerging variants. What is more, we show that in mutations of amino acids which can acquire positive charge, there is a particular preference for lysine residues over arginine residues, a trend which has gained in prominence with BA.2.86 and its sublineages, including the recently dominant JN.1 and KP.3 variants. The high lysine-to-arginine ratio in the spike proteins of BA.2.86 and its sublineages does not appear to directly influence viral fitness, including receptor binding, and the reasons behind it remain unclear, even though similar trends having been observed in several other systems as well.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

However, the release dynamics of each transmitter in various contexts have not been fully understood in behaving animals. Here, we demonstrate that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the external lateral subdivision of the parabrachial nucleus (CGRPPBel) encode opposing valence via differential release, rather than co-release, of glutamate and neuropeptides, according to firing rate. Glutamate is released preferentially at lower firing rates with minimal release at higher firing rates, whereas neuropeptides are released at higher firing rates, resulting in frequency-dependent switching of transmitters. Aversive stimuli evoke high frequency responses with accompanying neuropeptide release to encode negative valence, whereas appetitive stimuli evoke low frequency responses with glutamate release to encode positive valence. Our study reveals a previously unknown capability of single CGRPPBel neurons to bidirectionally encode valence via frequency-dependent differential release of transmitters in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

We show that IDR function depends on two distinct but related properties: sequence- and chemical specificity. While sequence-specificity works via linear binding motifs, chemical specificity reflects the sequence-encoded chemistry of multivalent interactions through amino acids across an IDR. Unexpectedly, a binding motif that is essential in the wild-type IDR can be removed if compensatory changes to the sequence chemistry are made, highlighting the orthogonality and interoperability of both properties and providing a much deeper sequence space compatible with function. Our results provide a general framework to understand the functional constraints on IDR sequence evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

One major family of proteins catalysing this reaction are the acyl transferase family 3 (AT3) proteins, which form a pore to allow acyl-CoA to penetrate the membrane for transfer onto an extracytosolic acceptor molecule. Recent structures of the sequence-unrelated human heparan-alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT) support a similar transmembrane acyl-group transfer mechanism. Here we demonstrate that both protein families contain a conserved 10-transmembrane helical fold with high structural and detectable sequence conservation around the acyl-CoA pore, supporting the previously proposed Transmembrane Acyl Transferase (TmAT) protein superfamily. In addition, we identify TmAT proteins, including the human Golgi sialate-O-acetyltransferase (CASD1), the human/fungal PIG-W/GWT1 enzymes and the bacterial vancomycin resistance protein VanTG, where the TmAT domain's function has been largely unrecognised.

In islets from homozygous knock-in (GckKI/KI) mice, GK immunoreactivity was reduced by >85%, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion eliminated. Homozygous GckKI/KI mice were smaller than wildtype littermates and displayed frank diabetes (fasting blood glucose >18 mmol/L; HbA1c ~12%), ketosis and nephropathy. Heterozygous GckKI/+ mice were glucose intolerant (HbA1c ~5.5%). Abnormal glucose-stimulated Ca2+ dynamics and beta cell-beta cell connectivity in GckKI/+ islets were completely reversed by the recently-developed GKA, dorzagliatin, which was largely inactive in homozygous GckKI/KI mouse islets. The GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 improved glucose tolerance in male GckKI/+ mice, an action potentiated by dorzagliatin, in male but not female mice.

Extensive studies have generated molecular profiles at both bulk and single-cell levels; however, systematic integration that describes tissue-wide changes as a function of cell type coordination remains challenging. This disconnect hampers our understanding of the complex multicellular interactions driving heart failure, limiting our ability to translate molecular insights into actionable therapeutic strategies. Here, we integrated bulk and single-cell transcriptional profiles from cardiac tissues of HF and control patients across 25 studies, covering 1,524 individuals and seven cell-types, to delineate consensus multicellular transcriptional changes associated with cardiac remodeling. Our analyses revealed conserved cellular coordination events involving fibrotic, metabolic, inflammatory, and hypertrophic mechanisms, with fibroblasts playing a central role in predicting cardiomyocyte stress. Further analysis of fibroblast populations suggested that their activation in HF represents a broad phenotypic shift rather than solely accumulating distinct cell states. The integration of bulk and single-cell data within our data collection indicated that transcriptional responses to HF across cell types occur independently of tissue composition. Mapping independent data into our consensus programs demonstrated that recovery after left ventricular assist device implantation aligns with molecular recovery, highlighting the clinical relevance of the multicellular molecular state. Overall, our work synthesizes independent cardiac transcriptomics studies and makes the conserved HF associated insights available, establishing a reference for detailed exploration of HF-related multicellular molecular events.

We analysed data from five young and old adult cohorts (MRi-Share, Human Connectome Project, UK Biobank, Generation Scotland Subsample, and Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 [LBC1936]) to test the validity and utility of LBA inferred from cross-sectional MRI data, i.e., a single MRI scan per participant. LBA was simply calculated based on the relationship between total brain volume (TBV) and intracranial volume (ICV), using three computationally distinct approaches: the difference (ICV-TBV), ratio (TBV/ICV), and regression-residual method (TBV[~]ICV). LBA derived with all three methods were substantially correlated with well-validated neuroradiological atrophy rating scales (r = 0.37-0.44). Compared with the difference or ratio method, LBA computed with the residual method most strongly captured phenotypic variance associated with cognitive decline (r = 0.36), frailty (r = 0.24), age-moderated brain shrinkage (r = 0.45), and longitudinally-measured atrophic changes (r = 0.36). LBA computed using a difference score was strongly correlated with baseline (i.e., ICV; r = 0.81) and yielded GWAS signal similar to ICV (rg = 0.75). We performed the largest genetic study of LBA to date (N = 43,110), which was highly heritable (h2 SNP GCTA = 41% [95% CI = 38-43%]) and had strong polygenic signal (LDSC h2 = 26%; mean{chi} 2 = 1.23). The strongest association in our genome-wide association study (GWAS) implicated WNT16, a gene previously linked with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, and Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study is the first side-by-side evaluation of different computational approaches to estimate lifetime brain changes and their measurement characteristics. Careful assessment of methods for LBA computation had important implications for the interpretation of existing phenotypic and genetic results, and showed that relying on the residual method to estimate LBA from a single MRI scan captured brain shrinkage rather than current brain size. This makes this computationally-simple definition of LBA a strong candidate for more powerful analyses, promising accelerated genetic discoveries by maximising the use of available cross-sectional data.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

They coexist in the ocean with cyanophages, viruses that infect cyanobacteria. Cyanophages carry many auxiliary metabolic genes acquired from their hosts that are thought to redirect host metabolism for the phage's benefit 1-5. One such gene is nblA which is present in multiple cyanophage families 2, 6-9. Under nutrient deprivation the cyanobacterial NblA is responsible for inducing proteolytic degradation of the phycobilisome 10-12, the large cyanobacterial photosynthetic light harvesting complex. This increases the pool of amino acids available for essential tasks 12, serving as a survival mechanism 13. Ectopic expression of different cyanophage nblA genes results in host pigment protein degradation 9,7,6. However, the benefit of the cyanophage-encoded NblA for the cyanophage and the broader impact on the host are unknown. Here, using a recently developed genetic manipulation system for cyanophages 14, we reveal that cyanophage NblA significantly accelerates the cyanophage infection cycle, directs degradation of the host phycobilisome and other photosynthetic proteins and reduces host photosynthetic light harvesting efficiency. Furthermore, metagenomic analysis revealed that cyanophages carrying nblA are widespread in the oceans and compose 35% and 65% of oceanic T7-like cyanophages in the surface and deep photic zones, respectively. Our results show a large benefit of the nblA gene to the cyanophage while exerting a negative effect on the host photosynthetic apparatus and host photosynthesis. These findings suggest that nblA-encoding cyanophages have a global effect on the amount of light harvested by oceanic picocyanobacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

However, the late onset of diseases suggests that compensatory quality control mechanisms may be engaged to delay the deleterious effects induced by compromised autophagy. Neurons expressing common familial Parkinsons disease (PD)-associated mutations in LRRK2 kinase exhibit defective autophagy. Here, we demonstrate that both primary murine neurons and human iPSC-derived neurons harboring pathogenic LRRK2 upregulate the secretion of extracellular vesicles. We used unbiased proteomics to characterize the secretome of LRRK2G2019S neurons and found that autophagic cargos including mitochondrial proteins were enriched. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that autophagosomes are rerouted toward secretion when cell-autonomous degradation is compromised, likely to mediate clearance of undegraded cellular waste. Immunoblotting confirmed the release of autophagic cargos and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that secretory autophagy was upregulated in LRRK2G2019S neurons. We also found that LRRK2G2019S neurons upregulate the release of exosomes containing miRNAs. Live-cell imaging confirmed that this upregulation of exosomal release was dependent on hyperactive LRRK2 activity, while pharmacological experiments indicate that this release staves off apoptosis. Finally, we show that markers of both vesicle populations are upregulated in plasma from mice expressing pathogenic LRRK2. In sum, we find that neurons expressing pathogenic LRRK2 upregulate the compensatory release of secreted autophagosomes and exosomes, to mediate waste disposal and transcellular communication, respectively. We propose that this increased secretion contributes to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, delaying neurodegenerative disease progression over the short term while potentially contributing to increased neuroinflammation over the longer term.

SIGNIFICANCEA hallmark feature of many neurodegenerative diseases is autophagy dysfunction, resulting in the accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles that is detrimental to neuronal health. The late onset of neurodegenerative diseases, however, suggests alternative quality control mechanisms may delay neuronal degeneration. Here, we demonstrate that neurons expressing a Parkinsons Disease-causing mutation upregulate the release of two extracellular vesicle populations. First, we observe the increased expulsion of secreted autophagosomes to mediate cellular waste disposal. Second, we observe the increased release of exosomes, likely to facilitate transcellular communication. Thus, we propose that increases in secretory autophagy and exosome release are a homeostatic response in neurons undergoing chronic stress.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

But how does sleep balance responsiveness with the protection of key functions? The infraslow fluctuation of sigma power (ISFS)--the clustering of sleep spindles over 10-100 seconds--is thought to regulate this trade-off in rodents. However, the organization of arousal and memory reactivation markers within the human ISFS and its conservation in younger ages remain unclear. This study characterizes the ISFS from childhood to young adulthood (N = 154; ages 8-26), examining its relationship with functional markers. Results indicate that the ISFS is present across all ages, with frequency, variability, and strength increasing from early to late adolescence. Notably, markers of arousal and memory reactivation are organized within the spindle-rich ISFS peak. The consistent presence and organization of the ISFS suggest it is intrinsic to sleep, with adolescence marking a dynamic window. These insights may guide interventions to promote healthier sleep across development.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

These hyphal networks represent a carbon sink in soil, thus it has been suggested that these fungi can also boost atmospheric carbon sequestration, highlighting their potential role in managing greenhouse emissions. In this study, we aimed to determine whether certain AMF genotypes and nuclear organizations (homokaryons vs heterokaryons) are associated with higher rates of host plant yield and carbon storage. To assess this, we compared Sudan-grass (Sorghum x drummondii) AMF inoculation across 8 strains of Rhizophagus irregularis: 4 homokaryotic and 4 heterokaryotic strains. Sudan-grass was grown in a growth chamber, which included 13C-CO2 pulse labeling to track plant carbon into AMF. AMF inoculation increased total and root biomass, as well as phosphorous, magnesium and manganese uptake in the host. Heterokaryons led to greater root biomass, as well as less variable increases in shoot phosphorous. Host biomass had a significant positive effect on mycorrhizal carbon inputs to the soil. Mycorrhizal inputs to the mineral associated organic carbon - a more persistent carbon pool with slow turnover - were overall greater in heterokaryons than in homokaryons but varied significantly among strains. This indicates that the potential for carbon storage by mycorrhizal carbon inputs varies based on both fungal genomic identity and nuclear organization. Overall, inoculation improved the yield of Sudan-grass and resulted in significant inter-strain variation in persistent carbon contributions to the soil. This work highlights the importance of considering genotype and nuclear identity in assessments of AMF as bio-stimulants and drivers of carbon sequestration.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

We examined three cohorts of university students (N=584) and used non-parametric methods to assess correlations of various health and cognitive variables with SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 severity, vaccination status, time since infection, time since vaccination, and virus variants. Our results show that some health and cognitive impairments persist, with some even progressively worsening especially fatigue in women and memory in men, up to four years post-infection, with the Wuhan variant having the most significant long-term impact and the Omicron variant the least. Interestingly, the severity of the acute illness was not correlated with the variant of SARS-CoV-2. The analysis also revealed that individuals who contracted COVID-19 after vaccination had better health and cognitive outcomes compared to those infected before vaccination. The study also discusses some limitations inherent in cross-sectional studies, particularly those arising from the stronger tendency of individuals with poorer health, compared to healthier individuals, to avoid infection and prioritize vaccination.

However, the neural mechanisms that support these flexible temporal construals remain unclear. To investigate this, we asked participants to learn a fictional religious ritual of 15 events.

We found that the activation level in the posterior partial cortex correlated positively with sequential distance in the external-perspective task but negatively in the internal-perspective task. In contrast, the activation level in the anterior hippocampus positively correlated with sequential distance regardless of the observers perspectives. These results suggest that the hippocampus stores the memory of the event sequences allocentrically in a perspective-agnostic manner.

However, obtaining reproducible and accurate maps requires lengthy acquisition due to the need to massively oversample the parameter space. This means that tensor-based dw-MRI accessibility is still relatively low in daily practice, and more advanced approaches with increased sensitivity and specificity to microstructure are seldom applied in research and clinical contexts. Motivated by recent advances in simulation-based inference (SBI) methods, this work uses neural networks to model the posterior distribution of key diffusion parameters when provided experimental data, allowing accurate estimation with fewer measurements and without the need to train on real data. We find that SBI outperforms standard non-linear least squares fitting under noisy and sparse data conditions in both diffusion tensor and kurtosis imaging, reducing imaging time by 90% while maintaining high accuracy and robustness. Demonstrated on simulated and real data in healthy and pathological brains, this approach can substantially impact radiology by: i) increasing dw-MRI access to more patients, including those unable to undergo long exams; ii) promoting advanced dw-MRI protocols for greater microstructure sensitivity; and iii) rescuing older data where noise hindered analysis. Combining SBI with dw-MRI could greatly improve clinical MRI workflows by reducing patient discomfort, enhancing scan efficiency, and enabling advanced imaging approaches in a data and privacy friendly way.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

Previous research employing functional MRI (fMRI) in humans has identified cortical organizing principles that allow not only for coarse-scale distinctions such as animate versus inanimate objects but also more fine-grained distinctions at the level of individual objects. This suggests that fMRI carries rather fine-grained information about individual objects. However, most previous work investigating fine-grained category representations either additionally included coarse-scale category comparisons of objects, which confounds fine-grained and coarse-scale distinctions, or only used a single exemplar of each object, which confounds visual and semantic information. To address these challenges, here we used multisession human fMRI (female and male) paired with a broad yet homogenous stimulus class of 48 terrestrial mammals, with 2 exemplars per mammal. Multivariate decoding and representational similarity analysis (RSA) revealed high image-specific reliability in low- and high-level visual regions, indicating stable representational patterns at the image level. In contrast, analyses across exemplars of the same animal yielded only small effects in the lateral occipital complex (LOC), indicating rather subtle category effects in this region. Variance partitioning with a deep neural network and shape model showed that across exemplar effects in EVC were largely explained by low-level visual appearance, while representations in LOC appeared to also contain higher category-specific information. These results suggest that representations typically measured with fMRI are dominated by image-specific visual or coarse-grained category information but indicate that commonly employed fMRI protocols may reveal subtle yet reliable distinctions between individual objects.

Significance StatementWhile it has been suggested that functional MRI (fMRI) responses in ventral visual cortex carry fine-grained information about individual objects, much previous research has confounded fine-grained with coarse-scale category information or only used individual visual exemplars, which potentially confounds semantic and visual object information. Here we address these challenges in a multisession fMRI study where participants viewed a highly homogenous stimulus set of 48 land mammals with 2 exemplars per animal. Our results reveal a strong dominance of image-specific effects and additionally indicate subtle yet reliable category-specific effects in lateral occipital complex, underscoring the capacity of commonly employed fMRI protocols to uncover fine-grained visual information.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

We examined mucosal cells from patients with PCD and related conditions using a multi-omics approach. Methods: We recruited patients with PCD (n = 24), CD without perianal disease (NPCD, n = 10), and idiopathic perianal fistulas (IPF, n = 29). Biopsies were taken from fistula tracts, fistula opening, and rectal mucosa. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), mass cytometry (CyTOF), spatial transcriptomics (ST), immunohistochemistry, and integrated analysis were performed. Results: ScRNA-seq, CyTOF, and ST unraveled immune and non-immune cell compartments in PCD and IPF fistula tracts. PCD fistulas showed hyperactivated pathogenic pathways including interferon (IFN)G response and TNF signaling in myeloid and stromal cells. Intestinal cells from PCD patients also expressed greater levels of IFNG-responsive and EMT genes compared to NPCD patients. Furthermore, both fistula tracts and ileal mucosa from PCD patients harbored expanded IFNG+ pathogenic Th17 cells, which expressed elevated inflammatory mediators. CyTOF also identified skewed immune cell phenotypes in the fistula tracts, fistula opening, and rectum in PCD patients including expanded Th17 cells, increased pathogenic myeloid cells, and altered T cell exhaustion markers. Further analysis also revealed cellular modules associated with anti-TNF therapy in PCD patients. Conclusion: Multi-omics analysis revealed immune, stromal, and epithelial cell landscapes of PCD, which highlight the pathogenic role of hyperactivated IFNG signaling in both fistula tracts and luminal mucosa. This study identified IFNG as a potential therapeutic target for PCD.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

By streamlining the barcode design, easySHARE-seq libraries have a usable sequence of up to 300bp (+200%), making it suitable for e.g. investigation of allele-specific signals or variant discovery. Furthermore, easySHARE-seq libraries do not require a dedicated sequencing run thus saving costs. Lastly, recovery of transcripts per cell is substantially boosted (> +50%) while retaining high scalability and low cost. To showcase these changes, we generated joint profiles for 19,664 murine liver nuclei, identified cell types, exploited the multi-omic measurements to link cis-regulatory elements to their target genes and investigated liver-specific micro-scale changes. easySHARE-seq produces high-quality multiomic data sets and is applicable to a wide range of study designs.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

To better understand the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, it is essential to determine whether it is primary or secondary (or recall). The analysis of highly granular immunological variable trajectories of a homogeneous cohort of patients receiving standardised medical care should discern between primary and secondary responses.

MethodsThis is a prospective cohort study of 191 SARS-CoV-2 infection cases and 44 healthy controls from the second wave of COVID-19 in the Barcelona area. The study stratified patients by severity and analysed the trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and multiple immune variables for features associated with primary and recall immune responses.

FindingsIsotype-specific antibody trajectories to SARS-CoV-2 proteins revealed a pattern of recall response in 94{middle dot}2% of cases. In these cases, the detailed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cells, cTfh high-resolution subsets, and cytokines were consistent with a secondary response. The transcriptomic data indicated that this cohort is strictly comparable to contemporary cohorts.

ConclusionsIn most cases, the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is a recall response. This opens the possibility that most COVID-19 cases are subjected to immune imprinting by endemic coronavirus, which, in turn, can contribute to severity by interfering with the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and by antibody-dependent enhancement. Considering the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 secondary provides a better perspective to interpret COVID-19 pathology.

Here, we characterize how hunger restructures an animal's spontaneous behavior as well as its directed exploration of a novel object. We show that hunger-induced changes in exploration are accompanied by and result from modulation of dopamine signaling in the tail of the striatum (TOS). Dopamine signaling in the TOS is modulated by internal hunger state through the activity of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, putative ""hunger neurons"" in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. These AgRP neurons are poly-synaptically connected to TOS-projecting dopaminergic neurons through the lateral hypothalamus, the central amygdala, and the periaqueductal grey. We thus delineate a hypothalamic-midbrain circuit that coordinates changes in exploration behavior in the hungry state.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

They evolved extremely diverse lifestyles, playing crucial roles in the carbon cycle5,6. Heterotrophic flagellates are arguably the most diverse eukaryotes4,7-9 and often occupy basal positions in phylogenetic trees. However, many of them remain undersampled4,10 and/or incertae sedis4,11-18. Progressive improvement of phylogenomic methods and a wider protist sampling have reshaped and consolidated major clades in the eukaryotic tree13-19.

However, their deepest evolutionary relationships still remain uncertain. Here, we sequenced transcriptomes of poorly studied flagellates23,24 (fourteen apusomonads25,26, seven ancyromonads27 and one cultured Mediterranean strain of Meteora sporadica17) and conducted comprehensive phylogenomics analyses with an expanded taxon sampling of early-branching protists. Our findings support the monophyly of Opimoda, with CRuMs being sister to the Amorphea (amoebozoans, breviates, apusomonads, and opisthokonts), and ancyromonads and malawimonads forming a moderately supported clade. By mapping key complex phenotypic traits onto this phylogenetic framework, we infer an opimodan biflagellate ancestor with an excavate-like feeding groove, which ancyromonads subsequently lost. While breviates and apusomonads retained the ancestral biflagellate state, some early-diverging Amorphea lost one or both flagella, facilitating the evolution of amoeboid morphologies, novel feeding modes, and palintomic cell division resulting in multinucleated cells. These innovations likely facilitated the subsequent evolution of fungal and metazoan multicellularity.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

Consequently, the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies becomes a critical clinical imperative. Among the genetic alterations contributing to PDAC, c-MYC overexpression arises due to upstream mutations, amplifications, and copy number alterations. c-MYC serves as a key regulator in the tumor's metabolic reprogramming, playing a pivotal role in proliferation, migration, and metastasis. This study delves into the investigation of the role of the elongase ELOVL6 in c-MYC-induced cell transformation and its potential as a therapeutic target in PDAC. Here, we demonstrate that c-MYC regulates lipid elongation to promote cell transformation, offering a new avenue for therapeutic intervention. Initially, we show the direct regulation of ELOVLs expression by c-MYC in various PDAC mouse models and cell lines, elucidating its upregulation during transformation and tumor progression. Genetic or chemical inhibition of ELOVL6 results in decreased proliferation and migration, accompanied by alterations in fatty acid elongation. These changes in fatty acid composition led to modifications in membrane rigidity, permeability, and thickness, which collectively affect micropinocytosis and macropinocytosis. Importantly, we observe an increase in Abraxane uptake and a synergistic effect when combined with ELOVL6 interference in vitro. In vivo validation demonstrates that ELOVL6 inhibition significantly reduces tumor growth and enhances the response to Abraxane, thereby increasing overall survival.

Restoration efforts and effective treatment of SCTLD requires an in-depth understanding of its pathogenesis in the coral holobiont as well as mechanisms of disease resistance. Here, we present a supervised machine learning framework to describe SCTLD progression in a major reef-building coral, Montastraea cavernosa, and its dominant algal endosymbiont, Cladocopium goreaui. Utilizing support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) in conjunction with differential expression analysis, we identify a subset of biologically relevant genes that exhibit the highest classification performance across three types of coral tissues collected from a natural reef environment: apparently healthy tissue on an apparently healthy colony, apparently healthy tissue on a SCTLD-affected colony, and lesion tissue on a SCTLD-affected colony. By analyzing gene expression signatures associated with these tissue health states in both the coral host and its algal endosymbiont (family Symbiodiniaceae), we describe key processes involved in SCTLD resistance and disease progression within the coral holobiont. Our findings further support evidence that SCTLD causes dysbiosis between the coral host and its Symbiodinaiceae and additionally describes the metabolic and immune shifts that occur as the holobiont transitions from a healthy to a diseased state. This supervised machine learning framework offers a novel approach to accurately assess the health states of endangered coral species and brings us closer to developing effective solutions for disease monitoring and intervention.

AUTHOR SUMMARYCoral reefs are under increasing threat due to climate change, with rising ocean temperatures and disease outbreaks accelerating reef degradation. Stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) has been particularly destructive, leading to widespread coral mortality across Floridas Coral Reef and the wider Caribbean since its emergence in 2014. While the cause of SCTLD remains unknown, the rapid decline in coral reef health highlights the urgent need for innovative approaches to understanding threats to coral health. In this study, we applied a supervised machine learning approach, previously used in cancer research, to identify key genes associated with SCTLD progression in the coral Montastraea cavernosa and its symbiotic algae, which the coral relies on to meet its nutritional requirements. By analyzing gene expression patterns across tissues representing different health states, we find that SCTLD affects the metabolic interactions between the coral and their symbionts and causes shifts in coral immune signaling pathways, even in tissue on a SCTLD-affected colony that appears to be healthy. This study presents a novel framework for applying supervised machine learning in coral gene expression research and could lead to new methods for monitoring coral health and combatting SCTLD.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

To guarantee its propagation, the chromosome must replicate, segregate, and accommodate other biological processes like gene expression. Therefore, to understand the causal relationship between chromosome organization and biological function, it is essential to follow chromosome dynamics. Live-cell imaging of fluorescent labels allows the tracking of specific genomic locations, but the current imaging-based approaches to study bacterial chromosome organization over the cell cycle are limited in their throughput. Even with multicolor fluorescent locus labeling, the genomic resolution is insufficient to gain insights about the whole chromosome structure from a single experiment. Although sequencing-based methods like chromosome conformation capture provide high genomic coverage, they can only be done in bulk, providing an averaged static view of the chromosome structure. In this study, we address these limitations and investigate the bacterial chromosome organization by imaging fluorescently labeled loci in a library of Escherichia coli strains, following the 3D locations of 68 different loci in live cells in a single experiment. The resulting location distributions along the cells longitudinal and radial axes are used to inform a dynamic polymer model of the chromosome over the cell cycle. We show a global reorganization of the E. coli chromosome, at both the longitudinal and radial axes.

While knowledge of regulatory roles of the microenvironment on the intestine is vast, how distinct perturbations within the intestinal epithelium may influence tailored responses from the microenvironment, remains understudied. Here, we present previously unknown signaling between enteroendocrine cells (EE), vasculature-like trachea (TTCs), and neurons, which drives regional and global stem cell proliferation during adult intestinal regeneration in Drosophila.

Injury-induced ROS from midgut epithelial cells promotes the production and secretion of Dh31, the homolog of mammalian Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), from anterior midgut EE cells. Dh31 from EE cells and neurons signal to Dh31 receptor within TTCs leading to cell autonomous production of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-like Pvf1. Tracheal derived Pvf1 induces remodeling of the tracheal stem cell niche and regenerative ISC proliferation through autocrine and paracrine Pvr/MAPK signalling, respectively. Interestingly, while EE Dh31 exerts broad control of ISC proliferation throughout the midgut, functions of the neuronal source of the ligand appear restricted to the posterior midgut. Altogether, our work has led to the discovery of a novel enteroendocrine/neuronal/vascular signaling network controlling global and domain specific ISC proliferation during adult intestinal regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

While a plethora of sequence-based prediction methods for TCR-epitope binding exists, their available pre-trained models have not been comparatively evaluated on standardized datasets and evaluation settings. Furthermore, technical problems such as non-standardized input and output formats of these prediction tools hinder interoperability and broad usage in applied research. To alleviate these shortcomings, we introduce ePytope-TCR, an extension of the vaccine design and immuno-prediction framework ePytope. We integrated 18 TCR-epitope prediction methods into this common framework offering interoperable interfaces with standard TCR repertoire data formats. We showcase the applicability of ePytope-TCR by evaluating the performance of the prediction methods on two challenging datasets for annotating single-cell repertoires and predicting TCR cross-reactivity towards mutated epitopes. While novel predictors successfully predicted binding to frequently observed epitopes, all methods failed for less observed epitopes. Further, we detected a strong bias in the prediction scores between different epitope classes. We envision this benchmark to guide researchers in their choice of a predictor for a given setting. Further, we aspire to accelerate the development of novel prediction models by allowing fast benchmarking against existing approaches through common interfaces and defining standardized evaluation settings.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha propagates clonally through vegetative gemmae or via sexually generated spores, but our understanding of the genetic pathways underpinning reproductive decision-making is limited. GRAS transcriptional regulators are highly conserved proteins across land plants, with diverse functionality in stress and development. Here, we discover a central role for the SCLA-type transcription regulator MpGRAS7 in both stress signalling and reproduction in Marchantia. MpGRAS7 is highly expressed in gemma cups and gametangiophores and is activated in response to Far Red (FR) light and abscisic acid (ABA) environmental cues. Genetic dissection further suggests MpGRAS7 is required to maintain gemma dormancy, gemma cup frequency, and FR-induced gametangiophore development. The sequence conservation and expression patterns of MpGRAS7 orthologs in flowering plants hints towards the broader function of SCLA-type GRAS proteins in stress-regulated developmental transitions in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

Recently, protein phase separation has been observed at cellular membranes, suggesting it may play a role in the assembly of protein complexes. Inspired by these findings, we observed that protein condensates on one side of a planar suspended membrane spontaneously colocalized with those on the opposite side. How might this phenomenon contribute to the assembly of stable transmembrane complexes? To address this question, we examined the diffusion and growth of protein condensates on both sides of membranes. Our results reveal that transmembrane coupling of protein condensates on opposite sides of the membrane slows down condensate diffusion while accelerating condensate growth. How can the rate of condensate growth increase simultaneously with a decrease in the rate of condensate diffusion? We provide insights into these seemingly contradictory observations by distinguishing between diffusion-limited and coupling-driven growth processes. While transmembrane coupling slows down diffusion, it also locally concentrates condensates within a confined area. This confinement increases the probability of condensate coalescence and thereby enhances the overall rate of growth for coupled condensates, substantially surpassing the growth rate for uncoupled condensates. These findings suggest that transmembrane coupling could play a role in the assembly of diverse membrane-bound structures by promoting the localization and growth of protein complexes on both membrane surfaces. This phenomenon could help to explain the efficient assembly of transmembrane structures in diverse cellular contexts.

SignificanceProtein assemblies that span biological membranes are critical to cellular physiology. In the past decade, liquid-like protein condensates, which are flexible, multivalent protein assemblies, have been discovered on diverse membrane surfaces. Recently, we observed that protein condensates on opposite sides of a membrane spontaneously colocalize to form coupled, transmembrane complexes. Interestingly, while transmembrane coupling slows down the diffusion of membrane-bound condensates, it substantially accelerates their growth by strongly localizing interactions between them. These findings suggest that transmembrane coupling of protein condensates may play a role in promoting the robust assembly of membrane-bound protein complexes in crowded, complex cellular environments.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

The mechanisms imposing a different crossover landscape in female and male meiosis remain elusive. Here, we simultaneously disrupted multiple anti-crossover mechanisms in Arabidopsis and analyzed the whole genome sequence of thousands of female- and male-derived progenies. The largest crossover increase was reached in zyp1 recq4, with 12-fold in females and a 4.5-fold increase in males. Despite this unprecedented level of crossovers, fertility is marginally affected, opening new possibilities for plant breeding. Manipulating additional crossover regulators in zyp1 recq4 did not further elevate the frequency of crossovers, but modified the relative contributions of the two known crossover pathways. This suggests an upper limit was reached and the two pathways compete for a large but limited set of recombination intermediates. Remarkably, while wild-type crossover distribution differs markedly between sexes, the crossover landscapes of diverse mutants in both females and males converge to a single novel profile, which we termed Crossover Potential (COP). The COP profile, which we defined using 49,482 crossovers, can be accurately predicted using only sequence divergence and chromatin features. We propose that the COP represents the density of eligible recombination precursors, which is determined by genomic features and is thus identical in females and males. It suggests that the sexual dimorphism in the crossover landscape results exclusively from differential regulation of the likeness of precursors to mature into crossovers.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

While the immune system is known to help regulate tissue damage, immune mechanisms involved in RT-induced intestinal toxicity are not fully understood.

Following CT-guided localised intestinal irradiation, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry revealed RT-induced chemokine-dependent recruitment of innate immune cells. Deletion of C-C chemokine receptor (Ccr)1, Ccr2, Ccr3 and Ccr5, blocked recruitment and worsened radiation induced toxicities, suggesting an important role for an innate immune cell population in limiting RT-mediated bowel damage.

Furthermore, CCR2-deficient mice showed exacerbated weight loss and intestinal permeability, while the transfer of Ly6C+ monocytes alleviated symptoms. Mechanistically, IL-17 cytokine production by group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), a critical factor in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, was found to be reduced in irradiated CCR2-/-, however the transfer of Ly6C+ monocytes resulted in increased IL-17 levels. These findings demonstrate the critical importance of CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment in mitigating RT-induced toxicities.

A subset of people with LC present with symptoms resembling those of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The objective of this study was to compare cortisol concentrations in those with and without Long COVID, with a particular focus on people experiencing ME/CFS-like Long COVID.

METHODSWe measured plasma cortisol in 200 individuals 3-6 months following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Banked biospecimens collected between 8 AM-12 PM were used. Participants met the case definition for Long COVID if they had [&ge;]1 COVID-attributed symptom at least 3 months after symptom onset. People who did not report any symptoms at least 3 months after symptom onset served as recovered controls. Adapting the 2015 Institute of Medicine criteria for ME/CFS, we further defined those with LC resembling ME/CFS (LC-ME).

RESULTSWe found no difference in overall morning cortisol concentrations between people with LC (n=144) and those who fully recovered (n=56) (median 8.9 {micro}g/dL vs. 8.8 {micro}g/dL, p=0.97). Analyses of samples collected between 8-10 AM, however, revealed that, compared to those who fully recovered, cortisol concentrations were lower between 8-9 AM for those with LC-ME (median 8.2 vs. 14.8, p=0.02), but higher between 9-10 AM for those with severe LC (>=5 symptoms) (median 12.4 vs. 8.5, p=0.009) and those with LC-ME (median 13.7 vs. 8.5, p=0.02).

CONCLUSIONWe found no difference in overall morning plasma cortisol concentrations between those with and without Long COVID. Although our data could be suggestive of altered morning cortisol dynamics in a subset of people with Long COVID, longitudinal measures of cortisol in individuals with Long COVID will be critical to further inform the biology of the condition.","NA","medrxiv",1731449359489

In contrast to the extensive morphological and molecular characterization of sensory neurons, there has been little description of the cells that control ion concentrations in the zebrafish olfactory system. Here, we report the molecular and ultrastructural characterization of zebrafish olfactory ionocytes. Transcriptome analysis suggests that the zebrafish olfactory epithelium contains at least three different ionocyte types, which resemble Na+/K+-ATPase-rich (NaR), Na+/Cl- cotransporter (NCC), and H+-ATPase-rich (HR) cells, responsible for calcium, chloride, and pH regulation, respectively, in the zebrafish skin. NaR-like and HR-like ionocytes are usually adjacent to one another, whereas NCC-like cells are usually solitary. The distinct subtypes are differentially distributed: NaR-like/HR-like cell pairs are found broadly within the olfactory epithelium, whereas NCC-like cells reside within the peripheral non-sensory multiciliated cell zone. Comparison of gene expression and serial-section electron microscopy analysis indicates that the NaR-like cells wrap around the HR-like cells and are connected to them by shallow tight junctions. The development of olfactory ionocyte subtypes is also differentially regulated, as pharmacological Notch inhibition leads to a loss of NaR-like and HR-like cells, but does not affect NCC-like ionocyte number. These results provide a molecular and anatomical characterization of olfactory ionocytes in a stenohaline freshwater teleost. The paired ionocytes suggest that both transcellular and paracellular transport regulate ion concentrations in the olfactory epithelium, while the solitary ionocytes may enable independent regulation of multiciliated cells.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

As a consequence, there is a substantial difference in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the two states. The dim state has a low signal-to-noise ratio, which is problematic when precise, quantitative measurements are needed. During the engineering of a red-shifted variant of an mTurquoise-based calcium sensor, we serendipitously generated a green-emitting sensor that shows high brightness in both the calcium-bound and -unbound state, while still showing a calcium dependent lifetime change of >1 nanosecond. This sensor, named G-Ca-FLITS, is comparable in brightness to the bright state of GCaMP3 and jGCaMP7c in mammalian cells. The calcium induced loss in fluorescence intensity is only around 30% and therefore we observe little variation in the SNR when calcium levels change. G-Ca-FLITS shows negligible sensitivity to pH in the physiological range, like its turquoise parent. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), we measured the calcium concentration with G-Ca-FLITS in various organelles and observed in HeLa cells transient and spatially heterogeneous calcium elevations in mitochondria. Finally, we evaluated the use of G-Ca-FLITS and its turquoise predecessor for two-photon FLIM in Drosophila brains.

However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these highly complex conditions remains limited. To gain deeper insights into the etiology of different brain diseases, we used specimens from 1,494 unique donors to generate a population-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), comprising over 6.3 million individual nuclei. The cohort includes neurotypical controls as well as donors affected by eight common and complex brain disorders: Alzheimers disease (AD), diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), vascular dementia (Vas), Parkinsons disease (PD), tauopathy, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. We show that inter-individual variation accounts for a substantial portion of gene expression variation in the DLPFC. By comparing transcriptomic variation across diseases, we reveal universal signatures enriched in basic cellular functions such as mRNA splicing and protein localization. After discounting these cross-disease signatures, we show strong genetic and transcriptomic concordance among AD, DLBD, Vas, and PD, largely driven by alteration of synaptic signaling functions in neurons. Furthermore, we characterize transcriptomic variation among different AD phenotypes that were distinct from healthy aging. We uncover mitigating effects of interneurons and aggravating effects of immune and vascular cells in AD dementia. Further exploring the effect of the neuropsychiatric symptoms frequently accompanying AD, we identify a link to deep layer excitatory neurons. By constructing transcriptome trajectories that capture AD progression, we show cell-type specific responses implicated in early and late stages of AD.

Acute infections have shown to change decisions to engage in effortful and rewarding activities, but it is currently unclear whether fatigue and depressive symptoms similarly affect decision making during acute and persistent phases of a COVID infection. Here, we investigated whether fatigue and depressive mood are associated with altered weighting of effort and reward in decision-making during different timepoints after COVID infection.

MethodsWe conducted an online cross-sectional study between March 2021 and March 2022. 242 Participants (18-65 years) with COVID <4 weeks ago (n=62), COVID >12 weeks ago (n=81), or no prior COVID (self-reported) (n=90) performed an effort-based decision-making task, in which they decided whether they wanted to exert physical effort (ticking boxes on screen, 5 levels) for reward (money to be gained in a voucher-lottery, 5 levels). State fatigue and depressive mood was measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) prior to the task. We used multilevel binomial regression analysis to test whether fatigue and depressive mood were related to acceptance rates for effort and reward levels and whether this differed between the groups.

ResultsCompared with no COVID and COVID <4 weeks groups, the COVID >12 weeks group reported higher state fatigue scores (mean{+/-}SD: 20{+/-}7 vs. 14{+/-}7 and 12{+/-}6 POMS-score, respectively; both p<0.001) and was less sensitive to rewards (Reward*Group: OR: 0.35 (95%CI 0.20, 0.62), p<0.001 and OR: 0.38 (95%CI 0.20, 0.72), p=0.003). In the COVID >12 weeks group, fatigue was more negatively associated with reward sensitivity compared with the COVID <4 weeks group (Reward*Fatigue*Group: OR 0.47 (95%CI 0.25, 1.13), p=0.022) and the no COVID group (Reward*Fatigue*Group: OR 0.48 (95%CI 4.01, 0.92), p=0.029). No group differences were observed for the relationship between fatigue and effort sensitivity. No group differences were observed for the relationship between depressive mood and effort or reward sensitivity. Higher age, lower BMI, unhealthy lifestyle, and worrying during the acute phase of COVID each predicted decreased reward sensitivity in the >12 weeks group (Age*Reward: OR 0.30 (95%CI 0.19, 0.48), p<0.001; BMI*Reward: OR 1.43 (95%CI 1.01, 2.00), p=0.047); Lifestyle*Reward: OR 1.50 (95%CI 1.06, 2.14), p=0.022; Worrying*Reward: OR 0.59 (95%CI 0.38, 0.94), p=0.025, respectively).

ConclusionThe finding that fatigue is related to lower reward sensitivity >12 weeks after COVID, suggesting potential reward deficits in post-covid fatigue. These findings are in line with previous observations that long-term inflammation can induce dysregulations in neural reward processing, which should be further investigated in future studies.

While the genes for diguanylate cyclases and c-di-GMP hydrolases (active or mutated) can be easily identified in microbial genomes, the list of c-di-GMP receptor domains is quite limited, and only two of them, PliZ and MshEN, are found across multiple bacterial phyla. Recently, a new c-di-GMP receptor protein, named CdgR or ComFB, has been identified in cyanobacteria and shown to regulate their cell size and, more recently, natural competence. Sequence and structural analysis indicated that CdgR is part of a widespread ComFB protein family, named after the late competence development protein ComFB from Bacillus subtilis. This prompted the suggestion that ComFB and ComFB-like proteins could also be c-di-GMP receptors. Indeed, we revealed that ComFB proteins from Gram-positive B. subtilis and Thermoanaerobacter brockii were able to bind c-di-GMP with high-affinity. The ability to bind c-di-GMP was also demonstrated for the ComFB proteins from clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio cholerae and Treponema denticola. These observations indicate that the ComFB family serves as yet another widespread family of bacterial c-di-GMP receptors. Incidentally, some ComFB proteins were also capable of c-di-AMP binding, identifying them as a unique family of c-di-NMP receptor proteins. The overexpression of comFB in B. subtilis, combined with an elevated concentration of c-di-GMP, suppressed motility, attesting to the biological relevance of ComFB as a c-di-GMP binding protein.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359489

Here, we present SingleFrag, a novel deep learning tool that predicts individual fragments separately, rather than attempting to predict the entire fragmentation spectrum at once. Our results demonstrate that SingleFrag surpasses state-of-the-art in silico fragmentation tools, providing a powerful method for annotating unknown MS/MS spectra of known compounds.

Mechanistically, we directly show that strand invasion and subsequent HR defects upon BRCA2 loss primarily arises from the unrestricted removal of RAD51 from DSB sites by FIGNL1, rather than from defective RAD51 loading. Furthermore, we identify that the MMS22L-TONSL complex interacts with FIGNL1 and is critical for HR in BRCA2/FIGNL1 double-deficient cells. These findings identify a pathway for tightly regulating RAD51 activity to promote efficient HR, offering insights into mechanisms of chemoresistance in BRCA2-deficient tumors.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359490

We discovered that murine astrovirus, an enteric RNA virus, persists indefinitely when mice remain unperturbed but is cleared rapidly after cage change. Besides eliminating the external viral reservoir, cage change also induced a transcriptional defense response in the intestinal epithelium. We further identified that displacing infected animals initially caused a temporary period of immune suppression through the stress hormone corticosterone, which was followed by an immune rebound characterized by an increase in CD8 T cells responsible for the epithelial antiviral responses. Our findings show how viral persistence can be disrupted by preventing re-exposure and activating immunity upon stress recovery, indicating that external factors can be manipulated to shorten the duration of a viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359490

The potential role of age-associated dysbiosis on disease outcomes is still elusive. In the current study, we used high-resolution shotgun metagenomics and targeted metabolomics to characterize SARS-CoV-2-associated changes in the gut microbiota from young (2-month-old) and aged (22-month-old) hamsters, a valuable model of COVID-19. We show that age-related dysfunctions in the gut microbiota are linked to disease severity and long-term sequelae in older hamsters. Our data also reveal age-specific changes in the composition and metabolic activity of the gut microbiota during both the acute phase (day 7 post-infection, D7) and the recovery phase (D22) of infection. Aged hamsters exhibited the most notable shifts in gut microbiota composition and plasma metabolic profiles. Through an integrative analysis of metagenomics, metabolomics, and clinical data, we identified significant associations between bacterial taxa, metabolites and disease markers in the aged group. On D7 (high viral load and lung epithelial damage) and D22 (body weight loss and fibrosis), numerous amino acids, amino acid-related molecules, and indole derivatives were found to correlate with disease markers. In particular, a persistent decrease in phenylalanine, tryptophan, glutamic acid, and indoleacetic acid in aged animals positively correlated with poor recovery of body weight and/or lung fibrosis by D22. In younger hamsters, several bacterial taxa (Eubacterium, Oscillospiraceae, Lawsonibacter) and plasma metabolites (carnosine and cis-aconitic acid) were associated with mild disease outcomes. These findings support the need for age-specific microbiome-targeting strategies to more effectively manage acute viral pneumonia and long-term disease outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359490

This study directly probes whether the neural code of a phrase involves reactivating the syntactic property of a key subcomponent (the phrasal head). To this end, we train a part-of-speech sliding-window neural decoder (verb vs. adverb) on EEG signals recorded while participants (N = 30) read sentences in a controlled experiment. The decoder reaches above-chance performance that is spatiotemporally consistent and generalizes to unseen data across sentence positions. Appling the decoder to held-out data yields predicted activation levels for the verbal head of a verb phrase at a distant non-head word (adverb); the critical adverb appeared either at the end of a verb phrase, or at a sequentially and lexically matched position with no verb phrase boundary. There is stronger verb activation beginning at ~600 milliseconds at the critical adverb when it appears at a verb phrase boundary; this effect is not modulated by the strength of conceptual association between the two subcomponents in the verb phrase nor does it reflect word predictability. Time-locked analyses additionally reveal a negativity waveform component and increased beta-delta inter-trial phase coherence, both previously linked to linguistic composition, in a similar time window. With a novel application of neural decoding, our findings delineate the temporal dynamics by which the brain encodes phrasal representations by, in part, reactivating the representation of key subcomponents. We thus establish a link between cognitive accounts of phrase structure representations and electrophysiological dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359490

A subset of sequenced SAR11 genomes, predominantly in the brackish and freshwater SAR11 subclades, contain homologs of pha genes, which in other organisms confer the ability to store carbon and energy via polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymers. Here, we investigated the relevance of PHA production to SAR11 biology. Phylogenetics showed that Pha proteins occurred on a long branch and provided evidence for origin at the common ancestor of the brackish IIIa and freshwater LD12 subclades, followed by horizontal transfer within SAR11. Using the LD12 representative ""Candidatus Fonsibacter ubiquis"" strain LSUCC0530, we found that a large minority of LSUCC0530 cells contained a single Nile red-staining granule, confirmed that the cells produced polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), and estimated the total PHB content in the cells. We heterologously expressed the LSUCC0530 phaCAB locus in Escherichia coli, finding it to be functional and the likely origin of the PHB. We also determined that, irrespective of changes to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations, a similar fraction of LSUCC0530 cells generated PHB granules and expression of the phaCAB locus remained constant. We suggest that PHB synthesis in LSUCC0530 may be constitutively active due to the slow growth dynamics and minimal regulation that characterize SAR11 bacteria. This is the first characterization of polymer storage in SAR11, providing new insights into the likely fitness advantage for cells harboring this metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359490

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted.

Lower amounts of viruses in nasal washes and exhaled aerosols were detected in JN.1 infected wildtype hamsters than EG.5.1, and consistently, JN.1 also exhibited largely reduced airborne transmission.

COVID-19 vaccines that are more closely matched to circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages elicit more potent and relevant immune responses that translate to improved real-world vaccine effectiveness. The rise in prevalence of the Omicron JN.1 lineage, and subsequent derivative sublineages such as KP.2 and KP.3, coincided with reduced neutralizing activity and effectiveness of Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted vaccines. Here, we characterized the biophysical and immunologic attributes of BNT162b2 JN.1- and KP.2-adapted mRNA vaccine-encoded spike (S) protein immunogens. Biophysical interrogations of S revealed the structural consequences of hallmark amino acid substitutions and a potential molecular mechanism of immune escape employed by JN.1 and KP.2. The vaccine candidates were evaluated for their immunogenicity when administered as fourth or fifth doses in BNT162b2-experienced mice or as a primary series in naive mice. In both vaccine-experienced and naive settings, JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccines conferred improved neutralizing responses over the BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 vaccine against a broad panel of emerging JN.1 sublineages, including the predominant KP.3.1.1 and emerging XEC lineages. Antigenic mapping of neutralizing responses indicated greater antigenic overlap of JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccine responses with currently circulating sublineages compared to an XBB.1.5-adapted vaccine.

Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1731449359490

Downstream analyses require the ability to query, filter, and modify them simply and efficiently. Several tools are available to perform these operations from the command line, including BCFTools, vembrane, slivar, and others.

ResultsHere, we introduce vcfexpress, a new, high-performance toolset for the analysis of VCF files, written in the Rust programming language. It is nearly as fast as BCFTools, but adds functionality to execute user expressions in the lua programming language for precise filtering and reporting of variants from a VCF or BCF file. We demonstrate performance and flexibility by comparing vcfexpress to other tools using the vembrane benchmark.

However, its widespread adoption is hampered by the need for specialized expertise. We introduce the Cryo-EM Image Evaluation Foundation (Cryo-IEF) model, pre-trained on an extensive dataset of approximately 65 million cryo-EM particle images using unsupervised learning. Cryo-IEF excels in various cryo-EM data processing tasks, such as classifying particles from different structures, clustering particles by pose, and assessing the quality of particle images. Upon fine-tuning, the model effectively ranks particle images by quality at high efficiency, enabling the creation of CryoWizard--a fully automated single-particle cryo-EM data processing pipeline. This pipeline has successfully resolved high-resolution structures of diverse properties and proven adept at mitigating the prevalent preferred orientation challenge in many cryo-EM samples. The Cryo-IEF model and CryoWizard pipeline collectively represent a significant advancement in rendering cryo-EM technology more accessible, efficient, and robust, with substantial implications for life sciences research.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359490

However, our tools for deeply profiling how proteins co-occupy individual fibers, especially at the single-cell level, remain limited. We present Deaminase-Assisted single-molecule chromatin Fiber sequencing (DAF-seq), which leverages a non-specific double-stranded DNA deaminase toxin A (SsDddA) to efficiently stencil protein occupancy along DNA molecules via selective deamination of accessible cytidines, which are preserved via C-to-T transitions upon DNA amplification. We demonstrate that DAF-seq enables [~]200,000-fold enrichment of target loci for single-molecule footprinting at near single-nucleotide resolution, enabling the precise delineation of the regulatory logic guiding neighboring proteins to cooperatively occupy chromatin fibers. Furthermore, DAF-seq enables the synchronous identification of single-molecule chromatin and genetic architectures - resolving the functional impact of rare somatic variants, as well as transitional chromatin states guiding haplotype-selective promoter actuation. Finally, we demonstrate that single-cell DAF-seq enables the accurate reconstruction of the diploid genome and epigenome from a single cell, revealing that a cells accessible regulatory landscape can diverge by as much as 63% while still retaining the cells identity. Overall, DAF-seq enables the comprehensive characterization of protein occupancy and chromatin accessibility across entire chromosomes with single-nucleotide, single-molecule, single-haplotype, and single-cell precision.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359490

A key factor in their success is the ability to filter out erroneous k-mers by removing those with low abundances. However, large numbers of distinct k-mers make counting a memory-intensive step. Early tools addressed this issue by storing k-mers on disk. More recent solutions, mitigate the excessive redundancy of overlapping k-mers by partially reassembling them into super-k-mers. Nevertheless, consecutive super-k-mers still overlap by k - 1 bases, leading to some degree of inefficiency.

Here we present hyper-k-mers as an alternative, less redundant, representation of super-k-mers. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we propose hyper-k-mers, a new k-mer representation that asymptotically decreases duplication compared to super-k-mers. Second, we present a theoretical analysis comparing the space efficiency of super-k-mers, syncmers, and hyper-k-mers. Our approach offers significant advantages compared to super-k-mers, by reducing the asymptotic lower bound from 6 to 4 bits per nucleotide. Third, we present KFC, a k-mer counting algorithm leveraging hyper-k-mers. KFC offers significant practical advantages, including an order of magnitude improvement in memory usage compared to state-of-the-art tools. Notably, our experiments show that KFC is the only tool whose memory usage scales sub-linearly with k-mer size k, and is the fastest option when k is large.

Here we assess the ability of protein language models (PLMs), routinely applied to protein folding, to be retrained for PPI prediction. Existing PPI prediction models that exploit PLMs use a pre-trained PLM feature set, ignoring that the proteins are physically interacting. Our novel method, PLM-interact, goes beyond a single protein, jointly encoding protein pairs to learn their relationships, analogous to the next-sentence prediction task from natural language processing. This approach provides a significant improvement in performance: Trained on human-human PPIs, PLM-interact predicts mouse, fly, worm, E. coli and yeast PPIs, achieving between 16-28% improvements in AUPR compared with state-of-the-art PPI models. Additionally, it can detect changes that disrupt or cause PPIs and be applied to virus-host PPI prediction. Our work demonstrates that large language models can be extended to learn the intricate relationships among biomolecules from sequences alone.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359490

It is found in amphibians, reptiles, and birds, as well as monotreme and marsupial mammals but is absent in fish and eutherian mammals. To explore the potential evolutionary origins of the double cone, we analyzed single-cell and -nucleus transcriptomic atlases of photoreceptors from six vertebrate species: zebrafish, chicken, lizard, opossum, ground squirrel, and human. Computational analyses separated the principal and accessory members in chicken and lizard, identifying molecular signatures distinguishing either member from single cones and rods in the same species. Comparative transcriptomic analyses suggest that both the principal and accessory originated from ancestral red cones. Furthermore, the gene expression variation among cone subtypes mirrors their spectral order (red[-&gt;] green[-&gt;] blue[-&gt;] UV), suggesting a constraint in their order of emergence during evolution. Finally, we find that rods are equally dissimilar to all cone types, suggesting that they emerged before the spectral diversification of cones.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359490

Related taxa tend to also live in similar ecological niches - this trend is termed Niche conservatism. Both concepts are widely used to understand crucial aspects of evolu1on and specia1on and are well-established in animals and plants. The extension of these concepts to microorganisms is however challenging and thus far only assumed. Here, we hypothesize that two closely related microbial species, if indeed similar in both their morphology and their ecological niche, should be found in samples with similar community compositions. We propose ""community conservatism"" to refer to this, and leverage a database with millions of samples and hundreds of thousands of pairs of microbial taxa to assess their relatedness and the similarity of the communities they occupy.

Our findings reveal that community conservatism can be observed globally in all environments and phyla tested, to varying extents. Ecologically specialized taxa show a stronger community conservatism signal than generalists, and the signal can be discerned over nearly all taxonomic ranks. Analyzing community conservatism shows promise to advance our understanding of evolution, speciation, and the mechanisms governing community assembly in microorganisms. Furthermore, we propose it can be used to reintegrate ecological parameters into Operational Taxonomic Unit delimitation.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359490

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359490

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359490

Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear.

Generally, experienced bullying showed increased subcortical volumes in the putamen ({beta}=0.12), caudate ({beta}=0.06), accumbens ({beta}=0.06), amygdala ({beta}=0.07), hippocampus ({beta}=0.06), paired with decreased cerebellar ({beta}=-0.10), entorhinal, ({beta}=-0.12), and insula ({beta}=-0.11) volumes. Females exhibited more volumetric changes in emotional processing areas whereas males had more changes in motor and sensory regions. These findings point to widespread associations between bullying victimization and brain development, offering a potential neurobiological framework to explain the emotional and behavioral difficulties observed. Importantly, this study emphasizes the need for a sex-sensitive approach in future research and interventions related to bullying.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359490

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment. The findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359490

Animal studies have yielded rich insight into mechanisms for visual perception, but the neural mechanisms for visual imagery remain poorly understood. Here, we first determined that [~]80% of visually responsive single neurons in human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) used a distributed axis code to represent objects. We then used that code to reconstruct objects and generate maximally effective synthetic stimuli. Finally, we recorded responses from the same neural population while subjects imagined specific objects and found that [~]40% of axis-tuned VTC neurons recapitulated the visual code. Our findings reveal that visual imagery is supported by reactivation of the same neurons involved in perception, providing single neuron evidence for existence of a generative model in human VTC.

One Sentence SummarySingle neurons in human temporal cortex use feature axes to encode objects, and imagery reactivates this code.","NA","biorxiv",1731449359490
