However, it is not well understood whether personal light exposure patterns predicts and individuals risk of cardiovascular diseases.

ObjectiveTo assess whether day and night light exposure predicts incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and whether relationships of light with cardiovascular diseases differ according to genetic susceptibility, sex, and age.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

ParticipantsN=88,905, age (M{+/-}SD) = 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 56.9% female.

ExposureApproximately 13 million hours of personal light exposure data, tracked by wrist-worn light sensors (one week each).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, derived from UK National Health Service records, across a 9.5-year follow-up after light tracking.

ResultsPeople with the brightest nights (90-100th percentiles) had significantly higher risks of developing coronary artery disease (adjusted-HR range: 1.23-1.32), myocardial infarction (aHRs: 1.42-1.47), heart failure (aHRs: 1.45-1.56), atrial fibrillation (aHRs: 1.28-1.32), and stroke (aHRs: 1.28-1.30), compared to people with dark nights (0-50th percentiles). These relationships were robust after adjusting for established risk factors for cardiovascular health, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol, diet, sleep duration, socioeconomic status, and polygenic risk. Relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and coronary artery disease were stronger for women, and relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were stronger for younger individuals in this cohort.

Conclusions and RelevanceNight light exposure was a significant risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases in this cohort. In addition to current preventative measures, avoiding light at night may be a useful strategy for reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases.

Key Points

QuestionDoes personal light exposure predict incidence of cardiovascular diseases?

FindingsIn this study of [~]89,000 adults aged >40 years, exposure to brighter light at night predicted higher incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors.

MeaningAvoiding exposure to night light may lower risk for cardiovascular diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1752358220976

This study evaluates the impact of RDs on these outcomes and examines the effectiveness of vaccination and antiviral treatments among individuals with and without RDs.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using harmonized electronic health records (EHRs) from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), encompassing 21,704,702 individuals, including 4,825,605 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between Jan 1, 2020, and Jan 4, 2024. RDs were defined using 12,003 conditions curated from GARD and Orphanet, mapped to OMOP concepts, and classified into 18 RD classes based on medical specialty involvement. Primary outcomes included: (1) COVID-19 severity (hospitalization and life-threatening disease), (2) long COVID, and (3) SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. We applied multivariable logistic regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting and reported adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and associated p-values. Models were controlled for demographics, comorbidities, and exposure to vaccination and antiviral treatments.

FindingsOf 21,704,702 individuals, we identify 4,825,605 COVID-19 positive individuals, 6.36% had RDs, with markedly higher rates of rare disease (RD) patients that have life-threatening illness (16% vs. 6.1% without life-threatening illness) and that are hospitalized (13% vs. 6.0% without hospitalization). Otorhinolaryngologic diseases showed the highest risk of life-threatening outcomes (OR 4.51; 95% CI 3.81-5.33), followed by developmental defect during embryogenesis (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.72-1.98) and cardiac conditions (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.51-2.11). Hospitalization risk was highest for otorhinolaryngologic (OR 2.90; 95% CI 2.61-3.23), developmental defect during embryogenesis (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.97-2.16), and hematologic and endocrine diseases (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.75-1.87 and OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.64-1.99, respectively).

In patients with RDs, vaccination alone or antiviral treatment alone was associated with reduced odds of life-threatening COVID-19 disease compared to non-vaccinated individuals (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.66-0.77 and OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.26-0.42, respectively). The combination of both vaccination and antiviral treatment showed the greatest reduction in odds ratio (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.20-0.27). Similar results were observed in patients without RDs. In contrast, vaccination or antiviral therapy alone, compared to no intervention, did not significantly reduce long COVID risk in RD patients, although these interventions alone did result in a lower odds ratio in patients without RD. However, their combination was protective in both groups. Vaccination alone, compared to no vaccination, also reduced the risk of reinfection across RD and non-RD populations.

InterpretationRD patients face elevated risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes. While vaccination and antivirals significantly reduce the acute severity of illness, their impact on long COVID appears limited in this population. Notably, vaccination was protective against COVID-19 reinfection in both RD and non-RD populations. These findings highlight the need for targeted strategies to protect RD patients beyond current interventions, particularly in preventing long-term complications.

This primary genetic cue is often located on a single locus--referred to as sex chromosomes--and can be limited to females (in a ZZ/ZW system) or males (in an XX/XY system). One trademark of sex chromosomes is a restriction or cessation of recombination surrounding the sex-limited region (to prevent its inheritance in the homogametic sex). This may lead to--through a variety of mechanisms--higher amounts of genetic divergence within this region, i.e. between the X/Z and Y/W chromosomes, especially when compared to their autosomal counterparts. Recent advances in genome sequencing and computation have brought with them the ability to resolve haplotypes within a diploid individual, permitting assembly of previously challenging genomic regions like sex chromosomes. Leveraging these advances, we identified replicable diagnostic characteristics between typical autosomes and sex chromosomes (within a single genome assembly). Under this framework, we can use this information to identify putative sex chromosome linkage groups across divergent vertebrate taxa and simultaneously curate misassembled regions on autosomes. Here, we present this conceptual framework and associated tool for identifying candidate sex chromosome linkage groups from a single, diploid individual dubbed Sex Chromosome Identification by Negating Kmer Densities, or SCINKD.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Human genetic data and functional experimentation have demonstrated that H2AK119ub is required for cortical development, however the molecular mechanism for this remains unknown. Here, we show that mouse embryos expressing catalytically deficient RING1B exhibit intact early neurogenesis but display impaired neuroectodermal fate restriction. Using in vivo, primary, and in vitro models, we demonstrate that reduced H2AK119ub leads to ectopic activation of lineage-inappropriate transcriptional programmes, including mesodermal and endodermal gene expression during neural differentiation. This transcriptional deregulation is not solely attributable to H2AK119ub or H3K27me3 loss but instead reflects sensitisation of PRC1 target genes to inappropriate transcription factor (TF)-mediated activation. Synthetic induction of candidate TFs, including GATA6, SOX7, and SNAI1, phenocopies the fate-skewing effects of PRC1 catalytic dysfunction, confirming their causal role. Our results uncover a buffering role for PRC1-catalysed H2AK119ub in safeguarding neural progenitor identity by preventing inappropriate TF-driven transcription and provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the cellular heterogeneity and phenotypic variability observed in Polycomb-associated neurodevelopmental disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

How these cancer-specific methylation changes are established in the decades before cancer, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we use a unique collection of longitudinal blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia to sensitively track the dynamics of DNA methylation changes at high temporal resolution. We identify thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that exhibit altered patterns of methylation up to 10 years before acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) diagnosis. Most of these DMRs are strongly associated with expanding clones carrying somatic driver mutations. We identify a subset of  epigenetic driver DMRs characterised by recurrent CpG alterations that are highly shared across pre-AML cases. These are likely to reflect early epigenetic reprogramming associated with AML development. We also reveal large numbers of stochastic  passenger CpGs whose differential methylation results from hitch-hiking with clonal expansions driven by somatically acquired genetic events. These passenger CpGs can be exploited for lineage tracing to discover clonal expansions driven by missing driver mutations. Our findings show widespread changes in methylation patterns during the early stages of cancer development which could be utilised for risk prediction and therapeutic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Average reported losses since the preceding spring exceeded 60%, with substantial variation among operations. Many colonies were still actively collapsing in January, 2025, when pooled and individual samples were collected then screened for levels of known honey bee pathogens and parasites. Deformed wing virus strains A and B, along with Acute bee paralysis virus, were found at unusually high levels, either in pooled colony samples or in individual bees exhibiting shaking behaviors and morbidity.

Differences between these two analyses suggest that direct collections of morbid bees provide a superior diagnostic for causal viruses, a suggestion borne out by confirmation of symptoms and morbidity following isolation and new inoculations. Since these viruses are known to be vectored by parasitic Varroa mites, mites from collapsed colonies were in turn screened for resistance to amitraz, a critical miticide used widely by beekeepers. Miticide resistance was found in all collected Varroa, underscoring the urgent need for new control strategies for this parasite. While viruses are a likely end-stage cause of colony death, other stressors such as nutritional stress and agrochemicals may have also played significant roles.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

The reason often invoked is the dysregulation of the immune system, which is both cause and consequence of ageing. However, we do not all age in the same way, and increased susceptibility may not be solely due to immune dysregulation affecting resistance to infection. There are many possible ways to make a host less tolerant to infection by dysregulating key physiological or metabolic processes. We hypothesised that the increase in susceptibility to infection over age can be linked to both immune ageing and decreased tolerance, and importantly, that it will depend on genotype and sex of the host. We assessed susceptibility to Gram-negative bacterial challenge in both sexes in 22 Drosophila isolines at young and old ages, and leveraged variation between genotypes to investigate how frequently an increase in susceptibility to infection was more associated with a decline in resistance or disease tolerance mechanisms. To achieve this, we assessed pathogen load to report on host immune decline. Strikingly, in most cases, greater infection susceptibility at old age was driven by reduced tolerance, although we also frequently identify cases that suffered bona fide immunosenescence, e.g. impaired resistance. We screened across bacterial pathogens during systemic and oral infections and found sex-specific signatures in survival in young and old individuals, but increased susceptibility with age occurred in both sexes. Pairing infection survival with lifespan data, we find that transcending genotype variation, susceptibility at old age predicts lifespan in males only, regardless of the existence or direction of sex bias in longevity. This work highlights that increased infection susceptibility is an early-arising ageing phenotype that occurs in both sexes, but only predicts lifespan in males, paralleling burgeoning evidence in mammals for male-biased effects of age on infection and its connection with mortality. Our data support a model where infection susceptibility increases with age following the same multiplicative pattern as organismal mortality, with existing failures making new failures more consequential. We propose that the term ""immunosenescence"" be used specifically to describe proven dysregulation of immune tissue resistance mechanisms. We argue that to fully understand the drivers of age-related susceptibility to infection, it is essential to consider genotype, sex, and their interaction, as well as the dysregulation of non-immune functions that influence the ability to control pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Class 4 antibodies represent an intriguing case: they target a deeply conserved, cryptic epitope on the receptor-binding domain yet exhibit variable neutralization potency across subgroups F1 (CR3022, EY6A, COVA1-16), F2 (DH1047), and F3 (S2X259). In this study, we employed a multi-modal computational approach combining atomistic and coarse-grained simulations, mutational scanning of binding interfaces, binding free energy calculations, and allosteric modeling using dynamic network analysis to map the allosteric landscapes and binding hotspots of these antibodies. Through this approach, our data revealed that distal binding can influence ACE2 engagement and immune escape traits through the confluence of direct interfacial interactions and allosteric effects. We found that group F1 antibodies can operate via classic allostery by modulating flexibility in the receptor binding domain loop regions and indirectly interfering with ACE2 binding using long-range effects. Group F2 antibody DH1047 represents an intermediate mechanism, engaging residues T376, R408, V503, and Y508 hotspots which are both critical for ACE2 binding and under immune pressure. Mutational scanning and rigorous binding free energy calculations highlight the synergy between hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, while dynamic network modeling reveals a shift toward localized communication pathways connecting the cryptic site to the ACE2 interface. Our results demonstrate how group F3 antibody S2X259 achieves efficient synergistic mechanism through confluence of direct competition with ACE2 and localized allosteric effects leading to stabilization of the spike protein at the cost of increased escape vulnerability. Dynamic network analysis identifies a shared ""allosteric ring"" embedded in the core of the receptor binding domain and serving a conserved structural scaffold mediating long-range signal propagation with antibody-specific extensions propagating toward the ACE2 interface. The findings of this study support a modular model of antibody-induced allostery where neutralization strategies evolve via refinement of peripheral network connections, rather than complete redesign of the epitope itself. Taken together, this study establishes a robust computational framework for atomistic understanding of mechanisms underlying neutralization activity and immune escape for class 4 antibodies which harness conformational dynamics, binding energetics, and allosteric modulation to influence viral entry. The findings highlight the modular evolution of neutralization strategies, where progressive refinement of peripheral interactions enhances potency but increases susceptibility to immune pressure.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Fluorescence microscopy revealed that tonal stimuli with coherent low-frequency patterns enhanced actin polymerization and shmoo formation, both markers of polarity and mating. In contrast, broadband noise disrupted actin integrity, while consonants produced no measurable effects. These results suggest that rhythmic continuity and spectral coherence, key features of speech, can modulate cytoskeletal organization in non-auditory cells.

Among the AFD-expressed rGCs, we identify gcy-18 and gcy-23 as key regulators of the physiological response to thermal stress, acting through modulation of canonical heat shock response (HSR) genes. Our findings indicate that rGC signaling is crucial for activation of heat shock chaperones and maintenance of proteostasis under high temperatures (35{degrees}C). Supporting this, quantitative analysis of HSP-16.2 revealed that rGC activity in AFD neurons modulates the HSR magnitude in distal tissues, such as the intestine.

Immune effector proteins that disrupt the nucleotide pool allow animal and bacterial cells to broadly restrict diverse viruses, but reduced nucleotide availability induces cellular toxicity and can limit host fitness(Ahmad et al., 1998; Goldstone et al., 2011; Hsueh et al., 2022; Itsko & Schaaper, 2014; Tal et al., 2022). Here we discover a bacterial anti-phage defense system named Clover that overcomes this tradeoff by encoding a deoxynucleoside triphosphohydrolase enzyme (CloA) that dynamically responds to both an activating phage cue and an inhibitory nucleotide immune signal produced by a partnering regulatory enzyme (CloB). Analysis of Clover phage restriction in cells and reconstitution of enzymatic function in vitro demonstrate that CloA is a dGTPase that responds to viral enzymes that increase cellular levels of dTTP. To restrain CloA activation in the absence of infection, we show that CloB synthesizes a dTTP-related inhibitory nucleotide signal p3diT (5'-triphosphothymidyl-3'5'-thymidine) that binds to CloA and suppresses activation. Cryo-EM structures of CloA in activated and suppressed states reveal how dTTP and p3diT control distinct allosteric sites and regulate effector function. Our results define how nucleotide signals coordinate both activation and inhibition of antiviral immunity and explain how cells balance defense and immune-mediated toxicity.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

As a solution, we introduce Metalorian, a conditional diffusion model that generates de novo heavy metal-binding peptides, guided by MetaLATTE, a multi-label classifier fine-tuned to include underrepresented metal classes. Leveraging both continuous protein embeddings and discrete metal-binding constraints, Metalorian produces peptides with controllable lengths and user-defined binding specificity while preserving essential physicochemical properties. Crucially, our data augmentation strategy enables robust classification and generation even with sparse training data for certain metals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through peptides designed for copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), and zinc (Zn), which retain key features such as net charge and hydrophobicity, while significantly reducing sequence length and molecular weight compared to known metal-binding proteins. Metalorian-generated peptides exhibit stable conformations and favorable binding energetics, as confirmed through molecular dynamics simulations. To validate binding in vitro, we developed a streamlined SUMO-fusion expression and cleavage system coupled with ELISA-based quantification, confirming robust Cu and Zn binding by multiple Metalorian-generated peptides. Overall, our work establishes a foundational platform for engineering heavy metal-binding peptides tailored to diverse and underrepresented targets, and highlights the potential of well-trained continuous latent spaces for diffusion-based de novo peptide design.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

The Scopus database was used for publications from each country. Fractional counts were assigned for publications co-authored by authors from different countries. Full articles, reviews, conference papers, books and book chapters were included. In 2024, countries characterized as full democracies produced only 22% of the Scopus-indexed publications, versus 66% in 2006. There was no correlation between the ratio of publications indexed in 2024 versus 2006 and the absolute or relative change in Democracy Index between 2006 and 2024 (r=0.02 and r=0.00, respectively). 78% of publications in 2024 came from countries with problematic (including USA) or worse (including China) freedom of press.

However, the impact of disrupting anti-ferroptotic pathways in the broader tumor microenvironment (TME), such as in immune cells, is still undefined and may complicate treatments. Here, we show that Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1 (FSP1/Aifm2) is critically required for regulatory T cell (Treg) resistance to ferroptosis and their immunosuppressive function within the TME. Compared to other canonical ferroptosis regulators such as GPX4, GCH1, and NRF2, only FSP1 was induced upon T cell activation. Deletion of Aifm2 in all T cells, or Tregs specifically, enhanced tumor control by selectively disrupting Treg immunosuppression within tumors without inciting autoimmune pathology in mice. As opposed to deletion of Gpx4 in all T cells, T cell deletion of Aifm2 did not impair antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. These results reveal a unique opportunity for targeting a regulator of ferroptosis that can not only directly target cancer cells, but also simultaneously enhance anti-cancer immune responses without inciting autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Within allopolyploids, duplicated genes across subgenomes, called homeologs, are thought to enhance environmental robustness by shifting their expression ratios depending on environmental and developmental changes. However, existing methods for detecting such ratio shifts, including HomeoRoq and Fishers exact test, are limited to allopolyploids with two subgenome sets inherited from two progenitors, and thus cannot handle more complex cases (e.g., allohexaploid wheat). Here, we present the HOmeolog Bias Identification Test (HOBIT), a statistical method for detecting shifts in homeolog expression ratios across different conditions using RNA-Seq count data. HOBIT performs a likelihood ratio test for each homeolog, comparing a full model allowing homeolog expression ratios to vary across conditions with a reduced model assuming constant ratios. Simulation benchmarks for allotetraploids and allohexaploids demonstrated that HOBIT outperforms existing methods in both area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and F1 score. Application to real RNA-Seq datasets from allotetraploid Cardamine flexuosa, allotriploid Cardamine insueta, and Triticum aestivum (wheat) produced biologically consistent results reflecting experimental settings.

Residential CD4 T cells, regulatory T cells, B cells, and NK cells have been demonstrated to share phenotypic properties with residential CD8 T cells, but the migratory kinetics are even more poorly defined. Here we used probabilistic modelling on a large parabiosis dataset, covering multiple time-points and tissues, to calculate migration kinetics and dwell times of multiple lymphocyte subsets across a diverse set of tissues. Markov chain modelling identified distinct cell type-specific and tissue-specific residency patterns. The liver and gut were prone to prolonged residency compared to other tissue types, and a hierarchy of residency was observed with CD8 T cells and NK cells demonstrating longer residency than CD4 conventional T cells and regulatory T cells, which in turn resided in tissues longer than B cells. With few exceptions, however, average residency was at least an order of magnitude shorter than the life-span of the mouse, indicating a more dynamic form of steady-state tissue residency than usually assumed. Together these data provide a comprehensive model of a pan-tissue shared program in lymphocyte tissue residence, as well as identifying cell type- and organ-specific modification of the migratory kinetics.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Here, using confocal microscopy and genetically encoded fluorescent sensors targeted to mitochondria and cytosol, we visualized beat-to-beat ATP dynamics in ventricular myocytes from adult male and female mice. These probes showed fluctuations in mitochondrial ATP levels with each contraction, revealing two distinct, spatially localized waveforms--ATP ""gain"" and ATP ""dip""--representing transient increases or decreases in matrix ATP levels, respectively. These waveforms were tightly phase-locked to intracellular Ca2+ transients and organized into energetic microdomains. Although female myocytes exhibited larger local mitochondrial ATP transients than their male counterparts, their total mitochondrial volume was lower. Female myocytes also exhibited tighter coupling between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria and showed a higher concentration of mitofusin 2 and ATP synthase catalytic -subunit per unit volume, suggesting more efficient ATP production. Cytosolic ATP transients mirrored mitochondrial waveforms and domain structure in both male and female myocytes. During faster pacing, diastolic cytosolic ATP rose more rapidly in female myocytes, whereas the accompanying beat-locked ATP transients increased in both sexes but did so proportionally more in males than in females. These findings demonstrate that ATP is synthesized on demand--beat by beat--in a modular, microdomain-specific manner. We propose that male myocytes rely on greater mitochondrial mass for energetic scaling, whereas female cells employ architectural precision to optimize ATP delivery.

Excitation of ventricular myocytes triggers Ca2+ entry through T-tubular L-type CaV1.2 channels (red), activating type-2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) clusters in the adjoining sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Released Ca2+ traverses the 12-nm cleft and enters subsarcolemmal mitochondria via mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) tethers (magenta), accelerating oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP (red ovals). In female myocytes (left), a select subset of tightly SR-coupled mitochondria produces large, beat-locked ATP surges that create localized energetic micro-domains. In male myocytes (right), looser SR-mitochondrial spacing and a greater mitochondrial density distribute the Ca2+ load evenly, yielding smaller but spatially uniform ATP transients. Thus, sex-specific differences in SR-mitochondrial nano couplingnot the excitation-contraction sequence itselfdetermine the amplitude and heterogeneity of beat-to-beat ATP supply in the heart.

While both classical and AI-based structural approaches have recently provided crucial insights into ligand-LRR-RK binding mechanisms, our understanding of ligand perception by LRR-RPs remains limited. In contrast to LRR-RKs, many LRR-RPs typically embed one or more loopout regions in their extracellular domains that are crucial for functionality. Here, we employed an AI-based approach to reveal a novel ligand-binding mechanism shared by the Arabidopsis LRR-RPs RLP23 and RLP42 - the PRRs for the short peptide ligands nlp20 and pg13, derived from NECROSIS- AND ETHYLENE-INDUCING PEPTIDE 1-like proteins (NLPs) and fungal endopolygalacturonases (PGs), respectively. This mechanism relies on a {beta}-strand interaction with the N-terminal part of the island domain (ID) loopout, which adopts an antiparallel {beta}-sheet conformation. Additionally, we investigated the larger and more complex binding interface of RLP32 - the PRR for proteobacterial TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 1 (IF1), a folded protein ligand that requires its tertiary structure for recognition.

Alternative therapies are urgently needed to manage the growing burden of untreatable A. baumannii infections. Phage therapy is a promising avenue that has already seen some success in isolated compassionate-use cases, including the famous Patterson case. A. baumannii capsule is highly diverse both in structure and composition, and provides the first immunity barrier against phages. Here, we perform a detailed molecular characterization of three recently isolated, distinct A. baumannii phages that breach the capsule via different mechanisms. Like many previously described A. baumannii phages, a specific capsule type is necessary and sufficient for StAb1 infection. We found that StAb2 and its relatives adsorb to either a specific capsule type or the conserved outer membrane protein CarO, a porin normally occluded by the capsule. Thus, this phage has a narrow host range amongst capsulated strains, but can broadly infect A. baumannii strains lacking capsule. We also show that an unclassified siphophage, StAb3, requires a conserved and uncharacterized glycan, likely containing ManNAc, that enables StAb3 to infect a broad range of A. baumannii strains without depolymerizing the capsule. We demonstrate how rationally combining phages with distinct capsule interactions reduces the rapid emergence of phage escape mutants, with potential applications for more effective phage therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Here, we introduce a synthetic transduction platform that directly links endogenous DNA repair activity to CRISPR-Cas12a activation. By coupling base excision repair (BER) events to a programmable DNA-based transducer, our system converts the activity of DNA glycosylases, such as uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) and human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (hOGG1), into a robust fluorescence signal via Cas12a-mediated trans-cleavage.

Additionally, it also enables in 15 minutes the throughput screening of novel potential inhibitors with high sensitivity.

Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise.

Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1752358220976

DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]). Negative control outcomes did not show any indication of meaningful unobserved residual confounding.

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Chronic protein deficiency leads to stunting, height-for-age more than two standard deviations below the median, and affects 149 million children under five (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240073791). Linear growth is governed by the somatotropic axis, wherein pituitary growth hormone (GH) stimulates hepatic insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) to promote bone elongation. Although boys are consistently more stunted than girls across populations (ranging from 18% to 45%), mechanisms underlying this apparent resilience remain unclear. Rodent studies suggest that the protein-to-carbohydrate ratio modulates life-history traits such as metabolism, lifespan, and reproduction, with evidence of sex-dependent sensitivity. Whether such dimorphism reflects coordinated developmental adaptations in response to protein scarcity, particularly in females, has not been fully explored. Here, we show that juvenile dietary protein restriction causes sexually dimorphic adaptations with pronounced stunting in males and delayed reproductive maturation in females. Using liver-specific deletion, we identify fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) as a sex-specific hepatic regulator of female somatic growth and reproductive development, revealing a dimorphic endocrine adaptation to early-life protein scarcity. Our findings position FGF21 as a critical physiological checkpoint coordinating growth and reproductive timing in response to nutritional stress.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

The paradigm for appendage evolution in this phylum is that the gene regulatory network responsible for leg subdivision and patterning is broadly conserved. Recent surveys of these genes have suggested that chelicerate exemplars exhibit divergent appendage patterning dynamics, though functional data remain limited. One salient mismatch in expression occurs in homologs of the homeobox gene clawless. In insects, clawless is expressed in the distalmost leg territory, specifying the claw-bearing pretarsus. In the harvestman, Phalangium opilio, clawless occupies a broad tarsal domain early in development, localizing later to the metatarsus-tarsus boundary, suggestive of a tarsal patterning function. Here, we tested the function of harvestman clawless using RNAi. Unlike insects, we show that clawless knockdown results in disrupted tarsal growth and patterning of its proximal segmental boundary, with no effect on the claw. Truncation of the tarsus is associated with defective tarsomere formation. We additionally surveyed clawless homologs in exemplars of chelicerate diversity, which suggests that the tarsal-patterning function for clawless was likely present in the chelicerate common ancestor. These results, alongside available expression data, suggest panarthropod appendage patterning exhibits numerous cases of developmental system drift.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

This prolonged domestication has led to phenotypic adaptations that distinguish A. oryzae from its wild relative, Aspergillus flavus. While genomic and phenotypic differences between these species have been partially characterized, their comparative production of volatile compounds during food fermentation remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluated alpha-amylase activity, aflatoxin production, taste attributes (via electronic tongue), and volatile profiles (via dynamic headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of the food-grade strain A. oryzae RIB40 and two wild A. flavus strains, NPK13tox and AflaGuard. A. oryzae RIB40 exhibited significantly higher alpha-amylase activity during rice fermentation, and only A. flavus NPK13tox produced aflatoxin. Sensory analysis revealed that rice fermented by A. oryzae RIB40 exhibited more favorable taste attributes, including significantly lower astringency, aftertaste, and bitterness, as well as significantly higher richness (defined as umami aftertaste). Additionally, A. oryzae RIB40 produced a greater number and higher concentrations of volatile compounds, with 20 compounds significantly elevated compared to rice fermented by A. flavus. Many of these volatiles, including 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol, 3-octen-2-one, 2-methyl-butanal, and 3-methyl-butanal, are associated with pleasant sensory attributes and have previously been linked to A. oryzae-fermented foods. These findings suggest that the volatilome of A. oryzae RIB40 has been shaped by domestication to produce a more desirable sensory profile, enriched in alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and heterocyclic compounds contributing fruity, umami, and malty notes.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Among these compounds, HP-29 demonstrates potent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus by inducing rapid iron starvation. As maintenance of trace metals homeostasis is critical for the survival of Streptococcus mutans, this study investigated the antimicrobial efficacy of HP-29 and the impact of metal supplementation on this major oral and occasional systemic pathogen. As anticipated, HP-29 inhibited S. mutans growth in a dose-dependent manner, with iron supplementation alleviating the antimicrobial effect. Cobalt, manganese, or nickel supplementation also mitigated the inhibitory activity of HP-29 but, unexpectedly, the addition of zinc greatly enhanced HP-29 antimicrobial activity. This zinc-driven potentiation of HP-29 extended to other Gram-positive pathogens, including Enterococcus faecalis and S. aureus. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis revealed that intracellular iron content decreased significantly following exposure to HP-29. At the same time, exposure to HP-29 led to a slight increase in intracellular zinc, mirroring the increase observed in cells exposed to excess zinc. When combined with zinc, HP-29 triggered a 5-fold increase in intracellular zinc and reduced manganese levels by [~]50%. Transcriptome analysis showed that HP-29, with or without zinc, altered expression of genes linked to iron and manganese uptake as well as zinc efflux, suggesting broad disruption of metal ion regulation. These findings highlight HP-29 as a potent antimicrobial that broadly impairs metal homeostasis. The unexpected synergy of HP-29 with zinc points toward a promising dual-agent therapeutic strategy against Gram-positive pathogens.

IMPORTANCEWidespread development of antibiotic resistance has created a constantly moving target when combating infectious microbes. Here, we further explore an antimicrobial halogenated phenazine, HP-29, which is effective against Gram-positive bacteria through disruption of intracellular trace metal equilibrium. We showed that HP-29 inhibits growth of the oral and systemic pathogen Streptococcus mutans and that its antimicrobial effect is greatly potentiated by the addition of zinc. The zinc-mediated enhancement of HP-29s efficacy was also observed in other Gram-positive pathogens, including Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Intracellular trace metal quantifications and transcriptome analysis confirmed that HP-29 treatment impairs trace metal homeostasis, an outcome that is exacerbated when S. mutans is treated with both HP-29 and zinc. The observed synergy of HP-29 with zinc supports the development of a dual-agent therapeutic strategy against Gram-positive pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

We previously reported that AAV2-derived capsids developed using the BRAVE (Barcoded Rational AAV Vector Evolution) approach have enhanced retrograde transport properties in the rodent brain, compared to parental AAV2. Retrograde transport enables broader coverage of connected brain regions after a single focal intraparenchymal brain injection and is therefore a powerful tool for delivery of vectors to distant sites with potentially higher specificity, transduction efficacy and safety. Because transport properties can vary among species, we further characterized a barcoded library of 25 BRAVE-derived AAV2 capsid variants, along with the parental AAV2 serotype and benchmark AAV capsids, in brains of adult cynomolgus monkeys after intraputaminal dosing. Based on RNA and DNA amplicon sequencing, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and histological assessment, we report here capsid variants with enhanced retrograde transport and expression compared to the parental AAV2 capsid. These properties make them potentially useful for disease indications in which broader brain coverage is desirable beyond the injection site.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

While we have a good understanding of the Pseudomonas species typically responsible for spoilage, we know very little about how these bacteria interact with food surfaces during spoilage. Here we assessed the spoilage capabilities of a large panel (n=124) of Pseudomonas species food-derived isolates on meat (chicken) and leafy greens (spinach). Most isolates (71/124) were capable of spoiling both foods, but some were only capable of spoiling only chicken (21/124) or spinach (23/124), or neither (9/124). Our data also demonstrated that the type of fresh food the strain was isolated from influenced spoilage capabilities: strains isolated from meat were likely to spoil both chicken and spinach, while those isolated from leafy greens were more likely to spoil only spinach. We used fluorescence microscopy to visualise how Pseudomonas spoilage species interacted with the meat or leaf tissue and observed significant tissue destruction associated with biofilm formation. For chicken, this was associated with the formation of dense biofilm pillars that penetrated deep into the tissue. For spinach we observed biofilms on the leaf in areas of tissue degradation. Finally, we explored the correlation between potentially relevant phenotypes (in vitro biofilm, motility and secreted enzyme production) and spoilage capabilities. There was no significant correlation between any of these phenotypes and spoilage, except for secreted protease activity and chicken spoilage. Overall, this study increases our understanding of processes involved in food spoilage by Pseudomonas species.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Their genes are organized in long transcriptional units that give rise to polycistronic transcripts which maturate into mRNA by a process known as trans-splicing. Among those genes, an important subset is composed of multicopy genes, which play crucial roles in host invasion and immune evasion. Here, we predicted the most likely trans-splicing acceptor sites (TASs) for TriTryps and found that the average chromatin organization is very similar among them with a mild nucleosome depletion at the TASs, and the same layout is observed in most of the genome. A detailed examination of the nucleosome landscapes resulting from different levels of chromatin digestion in T. brucei shows that an MNase-sensitive complex is protecting the TASs, and it is at least partly composed of histones.

We achieved successfully seeding of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in flexible patterns and examine their neural induction in circular geometries of varying diameters. Size-dependent and cell-autonomous neural structures are formed on this substrate when hiPSCs differentiate into neural lineages in circles of different diameters. This self-organized pattern results from the mitotic orientation and localization of differentiating cells. Furthermore, teratogenic substances can modulate these patterns.

Although there have been many successful uses of these tools for improved stability, solubility, and ligand binding, there have been fewer uses of these tools for designing proteins that have intrinsic allosteric mechanisms. In this regard, allosteric transcription factors (aTFs) are a class of regulatory proteins that includes repressors and activators that respond to environmental signals by allosteric communication to regulate their binding with DNA elements. The data exist for evaluating design algorithms for their ability to take allostery into account, as many aTFs have previously been engineered to respond to new ligands, enabling their use as biosensors. In particular, previous work from our lab used directed evolution to change the effector specificity of the transcriptional repressor, RamR, from cholic acids to each of five benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs). We wanted to see to what extent we could recapitulate these results by instead using LigandMPNN to design the ligand binding pocket. The wild-type RamR structure was predicted in complex with the five BIAs, and the binding pocket was then targeted for computational redesign. However, there was little overlap between the results of directed evolution and computational redesign, and in fact the nine redesigned protein variants tested proved not to be functional in Escherichia coli. Overall, these and other results suggest that different protein design methods may be needed to advance the computational design of allosteric or conformationally flexible proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

To elucidate the evolutionary dynamics underlying {beta}-lactam resistance, we constructed a comprehensive combinatorial mutant library comprising all 55,296 possible TEM-1 {beta}-lactamase variants integrating 18 clinically observed mutations across 13 key residues. Over eight million empirical fitness measurements were obtained under selection pressure with both a native antibiotic substrate (ampicillin) and a novel antibiotic (aztreonam), establishing the largest experimentally determined fitness landscape for antibiotic resistance to date. Through graph-theoretic and epistatic analyses, we discovered that selection with ampicillin resulted in weak epistasis, with mutants rarely surpassing the fitness of the wild-type enzyme. Conversely, aztreonam selection elicited extensive higher-order epistasis, generating a rugged fitness landscape characterized by increased phenotypic unpredictability. Interpretable machine-learning analyses identified context-dependent epistatic interactions necessary for achieving high-level aztreonam resistance. Further evolutionary statistical analyses, including direct coupling analysis and latent generative landscapes, showed that top-performing TEM-1 variants consistently adhered to conserved epistatic patterns found in naturally occurring {beta}-lactamases. Our findings demonstrate that higher-order epistasis critically shapes fitness landscape ruggedness when enzymes adapt to novel substrates, whereas adaptations to native substrates exhibit predictably smoother landscapes. This integrated experimental and computational framework provides a foundation for predictive evolutionary pharmacology, enabling assessments of newly developed {beta}-lactams or emerging {beta}-lactamase variants for their potential contribution to ESBL evolution. Importantly, incorporating graph-theoretically informed evolutionary constraints can strategically disrupt evolutionary pathways, presenting a viable approach to mitigate the rise of antibiotic resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

While the neurophysiology literature offers detailed insights into the neural underpinnings of sustained attention, there remains considerable uncertainty on how attention switching takes place. In this study, using EEG recordings from normal-hearing adults in an immersive multi-talker environment, we measured the neural encoding of two competing speech streams amid background babble. Participants were cued to switch attention between streams every 15-30 seconds. Neural tracking was assessed via Temporal Response Functions (TRF), confirming reliable decoding of attentional focus. Our results indicate asymmetric disengagement and engagement processes during attention switches, where the neural tracking of the new target stream emerges before disengaging from the previous target, revealing a transient simultaneous encoding of two speech streams. That transition was closely mirrored by a reduction in EEG alpha power, informing on the cognitive effort during different phases of the attention switch. We then isolated cortical activity reflecting lexical prediction mechanisms to determine how lexical context is updated after an attention switch, comparing four numerical hypotheses that were constructed using Large Language Models. Our findings elucidate both the temporal and contextual mechanisms underlying auditory attention shifts, pointing to the possibility that listeners carry out a reset in lexical context after switching attention. By focusing on dynamic attentional reallocation, this study offers insights into the brains capacity for flexible speech processing in complex listening environments.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

The viral S protein evolved towards highly efficient antibody evasion and replicative capacity in the upper respiratory tract resulting in high transmissibility. At the same time, the mutations acquired in the S protein diminish infection of the lung epithelium and pathogenic potential. The changing entry requirements for Omicron sub-lineages that lead to this shift in tropism remain poorly understood. We resolve the changing replication requirements of SARS-CoV-2 to be related to two distinct pools of ACE2. The first pool relates to ACE2s role in the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and this pool can complex with TMPRSS2 (RAS-ACE2). The second pool relates to ACE2s role as a protein solute carrier chaperone than cannot complex with TMPRSS2 (Chaperone ACE2). Here, we demonstrate that pre-Omicron lineages replicate in a TMPRSS2 dependent manner across both ACE2 pools, whilst Omicron lineages can only spread and replicate using chaperone ACE2. This provides a mechanistic basis for the evolving infectivity requirements of SARS-CoV-2 and furthermore provides approaches to track and monitor ACE2 utilizing coronaviruses.

Graphical AbstractMechanistic basis for shift in SARS-CoV-2 tropism with the arrival of Omicron. A. Chaperone ACE2 is defined structurally as a heterodimer of dimers with a solute carrier protein-SLC6A19 or SLC6A20. Here this ACE2 structure can exist uncomplexed from TMPRSS2 and enables TMPRSS2 use by both pre-Omicron and Omicron lineages. B. Renin Angiotensin ACE2 is defined by ACE2 with an exposed collectrin-like domain (CLD), which enables binding of TMPRSS2 or ADAM-17. Here ACE2 can form a complex with TMPRSS2 in a manner that allows pre-Omicron but not Omicron lineages to utilize TMPRSS2 to facilitate infection. Here Omicron lineages are heavily attenuated as they cannot use TMPRSS2 to spread. C. to E. Based on single cell profiles, ACE2 can exist as a chaperone with SLC6A20 in C. the Nasal Cavity or D. primarily as RAS-ACE2 in the lung to respond to acute lung injury. E. The largest pool of ACE2 in our body resides within the small intestine on enterocytes and this further facilitates replication in this tissue by pre-Omicron and Omicron lineages.

Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures. Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods. We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","medrxiv",1752358220976

In this work, we solved the crystal structure of the RXLR-LWY effector AVRcap1b in complex with the ENTH domain of NbTOL9a. The structure revealed that unlike other RXLR-LWY effectors, AVRcap1b has a novel L-shaped fold that defines a new structural family of effectors in the Phytophthora genus. Moreover, we defined the AVRcap1b/NbTOL9a binding interface and designed effector mutants that dont bind NbTOL9a, impairing immune suppression. This indicates that ENTH binding is required for full virulence activity of this effector. Lastly, we show that AVRcap1b associates specifically with activated NbNRC2 independently of NbTOL9a binding. This suggests that the effector functions as a bridge that interconnects NbNRC2 with the NbTOL9a pathway.

However, recent studies have uncovered their role in antigen surveillance and immune signalling initiation. To investigate how membrane protrusions initiate and contribute to signalling, from the first cell-cell contact to immunological synapse formation, we performed dynamic imaging experiments of endogenously tagged signalling proteins in T cells. To quantitatively capture the early dynamics of cell-cell interactions, we employed HER2-CAR-expressing T cells targeting HER2+breast cancer cells. By harnessing live-cell imaging and super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy we were able to capture topological membrane changes and their correlation with mesoscale protein rearrangements over time. Our findings indicate that, prior to activation, key molecular players in T cell activation, including the kinase Lck, the phosphatase CD45 and the adaptor LAT, as well as the exogenously expressed CAR, lack any enrichment in actin-rich protrusions. However, upon initial contact of the T cell with the target cell, a dynamic and fast rearrangement of the surface receptors, phosphatases, and kinases occurs within the protrusions, ensuring a rapid and effective initiation of the immune signalling cascade. The rapid clustering of the HER2-CAR occurs preferentially within protrusions rather than flat membrane regions and is accompanied by enhanced recruitment of the kinase ZAP-70 and LAT. While the localisation of the kinase Lck remained unchanged, protrusion-cell contacts trigger a pronounced exclusion of the phosphatase CD45, an effect observed both with and without the cytosolic signalling domain of the CAR. Overall, the signalling machinery rearranged more rapidly and efficiently at contacts mediated by protrusive structures compared to non-protrusive regions. Together, our data provide a quantitative framework illustrating how signalling proteins are dynamically reorganised to facilitate CAR-mediated activation within these specialised structures.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Whether computational prediction tools can identify amyloid-forming potential in thrombus proteomes remains unclear.

MethodsAmyloGram is a computational tool that estimates amyloid-forming potential based on n-gram sequence encoding and random forest classification. Using AmyloGram, we analyzed 204 proteins tagged by humans as amyloidogenic in UniProt. We then applied the same approach to proteins identified in thrombi retrieved using mechanical thrombectomy from patients with cardioembolic and atherothrombotic stroke. In addition we used AmyloGram to analyse the amyloidogenicity of 83,567 canonical human protein sequences.

ResultsAmong the UniProt-annotated  amyloid set, nearly all proteins received AmyloGram scores above 0.7, including 23 of the 24 human proteins. Even the lowest-scoring human protein, lysozyme (scoring 0.675), is known to form amyloid under certain conditions. In thrombi from both stroke subtypes, all detected proteins had AmyloGram scores above 0.7, suggesting a high likelihood of amyloid content. A majority of unannotated proteins also achieve AmyloGram scores exceeding 0.7.

ConclusionsAmyloGram reliably identifies known amyloid-forming proteins and reveals that stroke thrombi are enriched for proteins with high amyloidogenic potential. These findings support the hypothesis that thrombus formation in stroke involves amyloid-related mechanisms and warrant further investigation using histological and functional validation.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Understanding how the Healthy Eating Index-2020 (HEI-2020) can be used as a measure of diet quality to create benchmarks for national nutrition monitoring can assist in surveillance and improve the design of nutrition programs and policies.

ObjectiveTo examine the utility of the HEI-2020 to create benchmarks for national diet quality monitoring.

MethodsThis serial cross-sectional study used data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Nationally representative data for 22,168 US adults ([&ge;]20 years) who completed two 24-hour recalls were analyzed. We derived HEI-2020 scores (0-100) from participants two 24-hour dietary recalls. Diet quality categories were established: high diet quality (>70-100), marginal (>60-70), low (>50-60), and very low (0-50).

ResultsOnly 13% of US adults had high diet quality while nearly two-thirds had low or very low diet quality. Diet quality was higher for older adults, female, ""Other"" race or ethnicity, born outside of the US, have higher education attainment, higher income, and food security. Compared to adults with high diet quality, adults with very low diet quality had lower intakes of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and seafood and the highest intakes of ultra-processed foods, refined grains, and red and processed meats (all P-trends <0.01). Adults with very low diet quality were more likely to have elevated adiposity, lower HDL cholesterol, and higher triglycerides, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c (all P-trends [&le;]0.01).

Although transcriptomic profiles serve as accessible proxies, they remain incomplete surrogates for the proteomic landscape that ultimately defines cellular phenotypes. Current single-cell foundation models, however, are trained exclusively on transcriptomes, resulting in biased and partial characterizations of cellular states. To address this limitation, we introduce CAPTAIN, a multimodal foundational model pretrained on over four million single cells with concurrently measured transcriptomes and a curated repertoire of 382 surface proteins across diverse human and mouse tissues. Our results show that CAPTAIN learns unified multimodal representations by modeling cross-modality dependencies and capturing the diversity of cellular states across complex biological contexts. CAPTAIN generalizes robustly across both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings, excelling in core downstream tasks such as protein imputation and expansion, cell type annotation, and batch harmonization. Beyond improved accuracy in multi-omics integration, CAPTAIN uncovers previously inaccessible mechanisms of protein-driven intercellular dynamics, including immune interaction patterns linked to COVID-19 severity. CAPTAIN establishes a new paradigm for multimodal single-cell modeling, laying the foundation for comprehensive cellular understanding and virtual cell construction.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Participants in an fMRI study viewed either the original film (with repeated musical themes) or a no-music version. By comparing neural activity patterns between these groups, we found that music-evoked reactivation of neural patterns linked to earlier scenes in the default mode network was associated with improved subsequent recall. This relationship was specific to the music condition and persisted when we controlled for a proxy measure of initial encoding strength (spatial intersubject correlation), suggesting that music-evoked reactivation may play a role in making event memories stick that is distinct from what happens at initial encoding.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

In this work, we sequenced the complete genome of the new species Embleya australiensis MST-11070 and validated the assembly using optical mapping. The genome of E. australiensis MST-11070 consists of a 7.1 Mb linear chromosome and three additional replicons, including a 4.2 Mb linear replicon, EEC1, significantly larger than all previously described secondary replicons from bacteria. EEC1 is typified by its similar composition to the chromosome in terms of GC-content, codon usage and gene functions. It also carries terminal inverted repeats identical to the chromosome. EEC1 is enriched in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), including the only copy of the BGCs for the spore pigment and the surfactant peptide SapB, metabolites essential for the organisms lifecycle. EEC1 contains an origin of replication with at least some chromosomal properties, and its replication is likely to depend on functions provided by chromosomally located genes. Further comparison of Embleya spp. genomes suggests that EEC1-like replicons are conserved across the genus, in contrast to other known large linear extrachromosomal replicons (megaplasmids) in the order. EEC1 is thus a hallmark of the Embleya genus and is central to its evolution within the Streptomycetaceae family. We propose EEC1 as a secondary chromosome, distinct from previously described secondary chromosomes that utilise plasmid-like replication mechanisms (chromids) and the largest secondary replicon reported in bacteria, to date.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Trained on over one million active protein-ligand pairs from BindingDB, ProtoBind-Diff generates chemically valid, novel, and target-specific ligands without requiring structural supervision. In extensive benchmarking against structure-based models, ProtoBind-Diff performs competitively in docking and Boltz-1 evaluations and generalizes well to challenging targets, including those with limited training data. Despite never observing 3D information during training, its attention maps align with predicted binding residues, suggesting the model learns spatially meaningful interaction priors from sequence alone.

As early-branching metazoans, cnidarians can offer insights into the early evolution of cell type-specific genome regulation. Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility in 60,000 cells from whole adults and gastrula-stage embryos of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We identified 112,728 CREs and quantified their activity across cell types, revealing pervasive combinatorial enhancer usage and distinct promoter architectures.

Our account of harm-mitigating, neurobehavioural responses furnishes a mechanistic understanding of maladaptive behaviour and impaired belief-updating, which are often underspecified in conceptual analyses.

Genomic exploration continually reveals novel microbial lineages, often exhibiting extreme genome reduction, particularly within symbiotic relationships. Here, we report the discovery of Candidatus Sukunaarchaeum mirabile, a novel archaeon with an unprecedentedly small genome of only 238 kbp --less than half the size of the smallest previously known archaeal genome-- from a dinoflagellate-associated microbial community. Phylogenetic analyses place Sukunaarchaeum as a deeply branching lineage within the tree of Archaea, representing a novel major branch distinct from established phyla. Environmental sequence data indicate that sequences closely related to Sukunaarchaeum form a diverse and previously overlooked clade in microbial surveys. Its genome is profoundly stripped-down, lacking virtually all recognizable metabolic pathways, and primarily encoding the machinery for its replicative core: DNA replication, transcription, and translation. This suggests an unprecedented level of metabolic dependence on a host, a condition that challenges the functional distinctions between minimal cellular life and viruses. The discovery of Sukunaarchaeum pushes the conventional boundaries of cellular life and highlights the vast unexplored biological novelty within microbial interactions, suggesting that further exploration of symbiotic systems may reveal even more extraordinary life forms, reshaping our understanding of cellular evolution.

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription. Together, these findings redefine H3K4me3 as a post-transcriptional histone mark, revealing an unexpected layer of epigenetic regulation with broad implications for gene expression control.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Relatedly, we discover species-specific biases of chemokine expression networks, factors which drive TMEs assembly. Further, assessing coarse cellular networks, we find conserved correlations between some immune cell frequencies, while other relationships only appear conserved in the huTMEs matching muTME profiles. Despite this variable alignment, we define robust cell type-specific gene expression programs conserved in TMEs across species and cohorts and identify ones that are coordinated between cell populations in both species.

The majority of described species are arthropods, which tend to be small and require taxonomic expertise to identify to species level. Therefore, the ability to collect and preserve specimens in a suitable way for long read and Hi-C data generation using very simple approaches with minimal infrastructure is certain to be important in scaling up reference genome generation. Using Anopheles mosquitoes as an insect representative we evaluate how well different preservation liquids protect high molecular weight DNA, RNA, and nuclei for Hi-C when mosquitoes are held intact versus slightly squished. We find that squished samples stored in 100% ethanol and Allprotect held at room temperature for one week result in excellent preservation of both high molecular weight DNA and nuclei for Hi-C. Other tested buffers, including RNAlater, EDTA at several pHs, and DMSO Salt Solution (DESS) performed satisfactorily for long read data generation and RNA retrieval, but less ideally for Hi-C, which may have bigger negative impacts when aiming to generate data for organisms with larger genomes. Field collections requiring dry ice or dry shippers can be logistically challenging to arrange, are notoriously expensive, and DNA degrades rapidly if ultra-cold temperature is not maintained, which is devastating given how expensive and time consuming field work can be.

Most current methods fall at one of two extremes: either opaque deep learning models that obscure biological meaning, or simplified frameworks that treat genes as isolated units. As such, these approaches overlook a crucial insight: gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cellular states can be harnessed to model perturbation responses. Here we present CIPHER (Covariance Inference for Perturbation and High-dimensional Expression Response), a conceptual framework leveraging linear response theory from statistical physics to predict transcriptome-wide perturbation outcomes using gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cells. We validated CIPHER on synthetic regulatory networks before applying it to 11 large-scale single-cell perturbation datasets covering 4,234 perturbations and over 1.36M cells. CIPHER robustly recapitulated genome-wide responses to single and double perturbations by exploiting baseline gene covariance structure. Importantly, eliminating gene-gene covariances, while retaining gene-intrinsic variances, reduced model performance by 11-fold, demonstrating the rich information stored within baseline fluctuation structures. Moreover, gene-gene correlations transferred successfully across independent experiments of the same cell type, revealing stereotypic fluctuation structures. Furthermore, CIPHER outperformed conventional differential expression metrics in identifying true perturbations while providing uncertainty-aware effect size estimates through Bayesian inference. Finally, most genome-wide responses propagated through the covariance matrix along approximately three independent and global gene modules. CIPHER underscores the importance of theoretically-grounded models in capturing complex biological responses, highlighting fundamental design principles encoded in cellular fluctuation patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2. These structural predictions were based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database, together with corresponding protein sequences obtained from UniProt. We then assessed the predicted interaction structures through various confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we performed a limited evaluation against experimentally determined human protein complex structures not included in the Boltz-2 training regimen, which indicated prediction accuracy consistent with AlphaFold3. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, while highlighting both strengths and limitations. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Using Staphylococcus aureus as a model, we found that gene transfer via various mechanisms is significantly restricted between strains from different clonal complexes (CCs), with the notable exception of lateral transduction, which occurs at high frequency. Interestingly, some strains exhibited a ""promiscuous"" ability to accept diverse mobile genetic elements. These strains were defective in the key immune defences of S. aureus, specifically the Type I restriction-modification systems that normally protect against foreign DNA. A broader analysis revealed that such immune-deficient mutants are widespread within S. aureus populations. Our study uncovered a trade-off that explains their persistence in nature: although these mutants are more susceptible to phage attack, they gain an evolutionary advantage by acquiring beneficial genes - such as those conferring antibiotic resistance - which enhance survival under selective pressure. These immune-deficient cells act as gateways for foreign DNA, which, once integrated and advantageous, can spread within the same CC.

These studies may suffer from design, quality and reporting issues. The quality and reporting of preclinical studies have not yet been studied systematically in anti-aging research. Here we analyzed the DrugAge database, assessing reporting study quality, bias and effect sizes across 667 anti-aging preclinical studies. We found significant shortcomings in reporting of crucial design features such as randomization and blinding, as well as large variation in reporting quality and effects across species. Non-mammal findings typically did not translate to mammals. Although anti-aging interventions may have different effects depending on when they are started, most studies began giving the intervention under investigation very early in the organisms lifespan. Our findings suggest there is substantial room for improvement in preclinical anti-aging research.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

By merging data from 58 such nanocrystals, we obtained diffraction to 0.85 [A] resolution with an overall correlation coefficient of over 99% and solved the structure ab initio using a five-residue helical fragment to initiate density modification.

Studies supporting these views, however, measured neural activity as a bulk quantity, and related it to blood supply following disparate events in different regions. Here we measure fluctuations in neuronal activity and blood volume associated with the same events across the mouse brain, and find that their relationship is consistent across brain regions but differs in two opposing brainwide neural populations. Functional Ultrasound Imaging (fUSI) revealed that whisking, a marker of arousal, is associated with brainwide fluctuations in blood volume. Simultaneous fUSI and Neuropixels recordings in cortex and hippocampus showed that neurons that increase vs. decrease activity with whisking have distinct hemodynamic response functions. Brainwide Neuropixels recordings revealed that these two opposing populations are present in the entire brain. When summed, their contributions predicted blood volume across brain regions better than predictions from bulk neural activity. The mouse brain thus contains two neural populations with opposite relation to brain state and distinct relationships to blood supply, which together account for brainwide fluctuations in blood volume.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

We combined chemically imposed immune activation with single-cell transcriptomics to profile ETI responses across all leaf cell types in Arabidopsis. Despite uniform ETI perception, we find striking divergence between transcriptional outputs: a core set of defense genes is broadly induced, while distinct cell types activate specialized immune modules. We infer that downstream immune execution is shaped not only by immune receptor activation, but also by cell identity and its associated transcriptional regulatory context, including local transcription factor availability and chromatin accessibility. We further demonstrate that transcriptional regulators preferentially induced in epidermal cells are required to restrict invasion by non-adapted pathogens. Their absence permits pathogen entry into deeper tissues despite intact recognition, revealing a spatial division of immune functions. Our findings uncover a layered immune architecture in plants, challenges the assumption of uniform immune execution, and provides a framework for exploring cell-type-specific resistance logic in multicellular hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1752358220976

In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the initiation of actin assembly has remained a mystery. Here we show that S. cerevisiae Ldb17, the homolog of Dip1, functions as an on-switch for endocytic actin assembly. Unexpectedly, the regulation of Ldb17 is more complicated than that of constitutively active Dip1. Ldb17 is controlled by a coat protein, Sla1, via separate recruitment and activation steps. This regulation was likely lost in the S. pombe lineage and this simplification may be related to other changes in actin assembly between these species. Our findings add a key missing piece in the understanding of endocytosis in S. cerevisiae and reveal an intriguing evolutionary tinkering of the actin on-switch.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

In Caenorhabditis elegans, favorable conditions promote dispersal, while stressors like food scarcity or overcrowding trigger aggregation. Here, we describe a distinct behavior termed as swarming, where C. elegans move and feed in aggregates despite abundant food availability. While environmental factors have been implicated in this behavior, the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We identify a novel role for the conserved calsyntenin protein CASY-1 in regulating swarming. Through genetic, behavioral, and optogenetic approaches, we show that CASY-1 functions in sensory neurons to modulate the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) signaling. Mutants in casy-1 show impaired PDF-1 signaling and reduced inhibition of the serotonin pathway, a known regulator of social behaviors. This dysregulation, along with its associated mechanosensory and foraging defects, likely contributes to the swarming phenotype. Our findings reveal a putative neuromodulatory pathway critical for swarming behavior in C. elegans.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

The success of motor augmentation devices, such as supernumerary robotic limbs, hinges on users capacity for generalised motor performance.

We trained participants over seven days to use an extra robotic thumb (Third Thumb, Dani Clode Design), worn on the right hand and controlled via the toes. We tested whether motor learning was confined to the specific tasks and body parts involved in controlling and interacting with the Third Thumb, or whether it could generalise beyond them.

Participants showed broad skill generalisation across tasks, body postures, and even when either the Third Thumb or the controller was reassigned to a different body part, suggesting the development of abstract, body-independent motor representations.

Training also reduced cognitive demands and increased the sense of agency over the device. However, participants still preferred using their biological hand over the Third Thumb when given the option, suggesting that factors beyond motor skill generalisation, cognitive effort, and embodiment must be addressed to support the real-world adoption of such technologies.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Its detoxification by superoxide dismutase (SOD) is essential for redox homeostasis. We report the structure of the PSI-SOD supercomplex from Chromera velia (C. velia), revealing a direct coupling between energy conversion and oxidative stress protection. The heterodimeric SOD comprises a catalytic SOD2 and a non-catalytic SOD1 anchoring it to the conserved stromal PSI surface near the ferredoxin-binding site with four contact areas. Structural comparison with plants and algae shows that SOD could occupy a similar position via interactions with PsaD. C. velia PSI displays several distinct features, including a split subunit PsaA linked by PsaV, a unique iso-fucoxanthin bound to PsaB, and an extended PsaF coordinating an extra chlorophyll in the membrane. The antenna includes five fucoxanthin-chlorophyll family proteins (FCPs) stabilized by adaptations unique to each antenna protein.

Despite transient expressions prevalence in disciplines such as synthetic biology, little work has been done to describe and address the variability inherent in this system, a concern for experiments that rely on highly quantitative readouts. In a comprehensive analysis of N. benthamiana agroinfiltration experiments, we model sources of variability that affect transient expression. Our findings emphasize the need to validate normalization methods under the specific conditions of each study, as distinct normalization schemes do not always reduce variation either within or between experiments. Using a dataset of 1,813 plants collected over three years, we develop a comprehensive model of variation in N. benthamiana transient expression, using power analysis to determine the number of individual plants required for a given effect size. Drawing on our longitudinal data, these findings inform practical guidelines for minimizing variability through strategic experimental design and power analysis, providing a foundation for more robust and reproducible use of N. benthamiana in quantitative plant biology and synthetic biology applications.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

The viral non-structural protein NS3 is a membrane-bound AAA+ ATPase of superfamily 3 (SF3) with multiple proposed roles in the norovirus replication cycle. However, the structure of NS3, and the mechanisms by which it contributes to genome replication and membrane remodeling, have remained unknown. We engineered a soluble, hexameric, and catalytically active form of NS3 and determined its cryo-EM structure in the presence of a nucleotide analogue at 2.9 [A] resolution. The structure adopts a split lock-washer architecture characteristic of AAA+ motors that operate via a hand-over-hand translocation mechanism2. Modeling of the nucleotide-binding site reveals conserved features governing ATP binding and hydrolysis. Using integrative modeling with AlphaFold3, we generated a full-length, membrane-associated model of NS3, in which an N-terminal transmembrane domain, central helical bundle, and AAA+ motor form a continuous conduit. This model supports a role for NS3 as a candidate membrane-spanning RNA translocase that couples ATP hydrolysis to genome movement. This structural framework helps address long-standing gaps in our understanding of norovirus replication and establishes a basis for mechanistic studies and structure-guided antiviral design.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

As part of a broader long-term study on African leopard (Panthera pardus) population ecology in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, we deployed camera traps on animal trails and at Python Cave, a known roost site of Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and a confirmed Marburg and virus reservoir. This serendipitous deployment yielded the first visual documentation of a multi-trophic predator and scavenger guild interacting at a filovirus reservoir site. Over a five month period (February 16th - June 5th 2025) across 304 trap nights, we recorded at least 14 different vertebrate species, including leopards, primates, raptors, and small carnivores, engaging in bat predation, scavenging on bat remains, guano foraging, or cave exploration across 261 temporally and spatially independent events (>1 hour apart). These instances were structured, repeated and the species continuously made contact with the bats or entered their roosting space. Camera traps also recorded an estimated 400 human individuals visiting the cave -- including school groups, tourists, and local trainees -- the majority with no personal protective equipment. The shallow, accessible structure of Python Cave appears to collapse the typical spatial buffers between reservoir species and both predators and humans. These observations constitute the first ecological confirmation of a dynamic, multispecies exposure network at a known Marburg virus site, and may represent a Rosetta Stone for interpreting the real-time mechanics of zoonotic spillover.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

While these have the potential to significantly accelerate scientific discoveries by creating AI-driven virtual cell models, their progress has been greatly limited by the lack of large-scale high-quality perturbation data, which remains constrained due to scalability bottlenecks and assay variability. Here, we introduce ""Fix-Cryopreserve-ScRNAseq"" (FiCS) Perturb-seq, an industrialized platform for scalable Perturb-seq data generation. We demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq exhibits high sensitivity and low batch effects, effectively capturing perturbation-induced transcriptomic changes and recapitulating known biological pathways and protein complexes. In addition, we release X-Atlas: Orion edition (X-Atlas/Orion), the largest publicly available Perturb-seq atlas. This atlas, generated from two genome-wide FiCS Perturb-seq experiments targeting all human protein-coding genes, comprises eight million cells deeply sequenced to over 16,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell. Furthermore, we show that single guide RNA (sgRNA) abundance can serve as a proxy for gene knockdown (KD) efficacy. Leveraging the deep sequencing and substantial cell numbers per perturbation, we also show that stratification by sgRNA expression can reveal dose-dependent genetic effects. Taken together, we demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq is an efficient and scalable platform for high-throughput Perturb-seq screens. Through the release of X-Atlas/Orion, we highlight the potential of FiCS Perturb-seq to address current scalability and variability challenges in data generation, advance foundation model development that incorporates gene-dosage effects, and accelerate biological discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Can these divergent perspectives on cortical organization be reconciled within a unifying framework? Using data-driven decomposition of fMRI responses in face-, body-, and scene-selective areas, we identified overlapping activity patterns shared across individuals. Each area encoded multiple interpretable dimensions tuned to both finer subcategory features and coarser cross-category distinctions beyond its preferred category, even in the most category-selective voxels. These dimensions formed distinct clusters within category-selective areas but were also sparsely distributed across the broader visual cortex, supporting both locally selective, category-specific, and globally distributed, feature-based coding. Together, these findings suggest multidimensional tuning as a fundamental organizing principle that integrates feature-selective clusters, category-selective areas, and large-scale tuning maps, providing a more comprehensive understanding of category representations in human visual cortex.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

The protein C2CD3 is critical for distal appendage assembly, with mutations linked to orofaciodigital syndrome and other ciliopathies. However, its precise molecular role in appendage recruitment remains unclear. Using Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM), iterative U-ExM, and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), we reveal that C2CD3 adopts a radially symmetric 9-fold organization within the centrioles distal lumen. We show that the C-terminal region of C2CD3 localizes close to a [~]100 nm luminal ring structure consisting of [~]27 nodes, while its N-terminal region localizes close to a hook-like structure that attaches to the A-microtubule as it extends from the centriole interior to exterior. This hook structure is adjacent to the DISCO complex (MNR/CEP90/OFD1), which marks future appendage sites. C2CD3 depletion disrupts not only the recruitment of the DISCO complex via direct interaction with MNR but also destabilizes the luminal ring network composed of C2CD3/SFI1/centrin-2/CEP135/NA14, as well as the distal microtubule tip protein CEP162. This reveals an intricate ""in-to-out"" molecular hub connecting the centriolar lumen, distal microtubule cap, and appendages. Although C2CD3 loss results in shorter centrioles and appendage defects, key structural elements remain intact, permitting continued centriole duplication. We propose that C2CD3 forms the luminal ring structure and extends radially to the space between triplet microtubules, functioning as an architectural hub that scaffolds the distal end of the centriole, orchestrating its assembly and directing appendage formation.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

However, a unifying set of physical principles underlying these varied interactions and their implications for chromatin organization remains elusive. Here, we develop and experimentally validate a mesoscopic model that bridges the physics of phase separation and chromatin mechanics. Specifically, by integrating computational modeling with experiments using two canonical condensate proteins, the heterochromatin protein HP1, and the euchromatin protein BRD4, we demonstrate that wetting properties and chromatin stiffness shape condensate morphology, while condensates remodel chromatin mechanics and organization. This two-way interplay is governed by elastocapillarity--the deformation of chromatin by condensate interfacial tension -- and resolves discrepancies in nuclear condensate behavior, with emergent behaviors that deviate from the simplest liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) models5-8.

The mechanism by which ectopic gene activation occurs through these gain-of-function enhancer mutations remains poorly understood. Using the ZRS, a benchmark disease-associated enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), as a model, we demonstrate that poised (i.e., accessible but inactive) chromatin sensitizes Shh to aberrant activation in anterior limb bud, leading to polydactyly. In the anterior limb cells of wild-type mice, Shh is inactive, but the ZRS is accessible and marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. We demonstrate that this poising signature explains how over 20 independent rare variants within the ZRS cause Shh misexpression in the same anterior limb bud cell population, resulting in similar limb malformations, despite affecting binding sites for different activators and repressors. Disabling pioneer transcription factor binding to the ZRS suppresses its poised state in anterior cells, prevents aberrant activation of the ZRS by rare variants, and fully rescues limb malformations in variant knock-in mice. A thorough examination of other disease-associated enhancers with pathogenic gain-of-function variants revealed that they are all poised in tissues with ectopic activity. We use this poising signature to predict and validate in vivo ectopic forebrain activity of previously uncharacterized autism-associated non-coding variants. Our findings suggest that spatial enhancer poising, likely a byproduct of development, creates a susceptibility to non-coding mutations and offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the burden of disease-associated non-coding variants.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

However, these methods are inherently specialized, relying on predefined assumptions and/or limited scalability. Recent advances in simulation and deep learning provide an alternative approach: learning directly to generalize from synthetic genetic data to infer specific hidden evolutionary processes. Here we reframe the inference of coalescence times as a problem of translation between two biological languages: the sparse, observable patterns of mutation along the genome and the unobservable ancestral recombination graph (ARG) that gave rise to them. Inspired by large language models, we develop cxt, a decoder-only transformer that autoregressively predicts coalescent events conditioned on local mutational context. We show that cxt performs on par with state-of-the-art MCMC-based likelihood models across a broad range of demographic scenarios, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Trained on simulations spanning the stdpopsim catalog, the model generalizes robustly and enables efficient inference at scale, producing over a million coalescence predictions in minutes. In addition cxt produces a well calibrated approximate posterior distribution of its predictions, enabling principled uncertainty quantification.

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1752358220976

While the virus itself contributes to pathogenesis, disease severity is primarily influenced by the hosts response to infection. One factor observed to impact the host response is sex, as epidemiological data indicates that male persons have a higher case fatality rate than females infected with MERS-CoV. However, the mechanism underlying this sex bias is unknown and disease course remains difficult to predict. This study investigates how male and female transgenic mice expressing humanized dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (hDPP4) respond to MERS-CoV infection following exposure to either a tolerance-inducing low dose or lethal high dose. We observed that female hDPP4 mice display dose-dependent tolerance to infection and males experienced uniformly lethal disease in both dosing groups. Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis revealed that males suppress innate and inflammatory responses early after infection, causing delayed induction of the host antiviral response. In contrast, high dose females mount an immediate and sustained interferon and inflammatory response, activating antiviral effectors and interferon-stimulated genes. Tolerant females displayed the greatest transcriptional control, showing no pathway enrichment and minimal changes in weight throughout infection. Our results suggest that the magnitude of the response is driven by dose while the nature of the response in shaped by sex. Females mount a more robust response to MERS-CoV infection, allowing females to tolerate low-dose infection but causing uncontrolled inflammation after high dose infection. In contrast, males experienced lethal outcomes regardless of dose. By examining the dynamics of sex-biased host transcriptional responses in determining disease severity, this study highlights the importance of sex as a biological variable in coronavirus pathogenesis research.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Here we report evolutionary analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data of male and female human, marmoset (New World monkey), and mouse gonadal cells spanning key prenatal stages. We find that the two primates and mouse share similar X chromosome expression dynamics, including X chromosome reactivation (XCR), and that in Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) testes, germ cells undergo female-like XCR and escape of X inactivation. New male-specific regulatory regions have emerged progressively during mammalian evolution, especially on the X following sex chromosome origination. Further analyses revealed that male-specific regulatory regions evolved faster than female-specific ones in both supporting and pre-meiotic germ cells. However, female meiotic germ cells show even higher rates of molecular evolution and exhibit a permissive chromatin state that facilitates the birth of new genes, thus resembling their adult spermatogenic counterparts. Finally, we traced both conserved and species-specific gene expression trajectories across the three mammals, uncovering candidate genes for disorders of sex development that are typically central to cell-type-specific regulatory networks. Together, our study unveils both ancestral mammalian and recently evolved gene regulatory programs that control human- and primate-specific aspects of gonadal development in both sexes.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Transcription factors such as BABY BOOM can induce somatic embryogenesis when ectopically expressed and are widely used for aiding regeneration in tissue culture for transformation and gene editing of crops. Nevertheless, regeneration remains a bottleneck and alternative morphogenic genes are highly desired. Here, we co-expressed BABY BOOM and WUSCHEL2 in zygotic maize (Zea mays L.) embryos and studied gene regulatory networks in induced somatic embryos at the single-cell level. By inferring cell-type-specific regulons, we prioritized candidate regulators and confirmed functionality of four transcription factors, bHLH48, EREB152, GRF4, and HB77, for enhanced maize transformation frequency, leading to fertile, transgenic plants. Interestingly, the basic helix-loop-helix and homeodomain-leucine zipper families had previously not been associated with induced somatic embryogenesis. Our work will contribute to more efficient transformation, much needed to deliver on the promise of gene editing for agriculture.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

Correspondingly, current theories describe muscle activity as a function of cortical dynamics. Tasks like speech and locomotion, however, require the integration of voluntary commands with ongoing movements orchestrated by largely independent subcortical centers. In such cases, motor cortex must receive inputs representing the state of the environment and the state of subcortical networks, then transform these inputs into commands that modulate the rhythmic motor pattern. Here, we study this transformation in mice performing an obstacle traversal task, which combines a spinal locomotor pattern with voluntary cortical adjustments. Cortical dynamics contain a prominent representation of motor preparation that is linked to obstacle proximity and robust to removal of somatosensory or visual input, and also maintain a representation of the state of the spinal pattern generator. Readout signals resembling commands for obstacle traversal are consistent across trials, but small in amplitude. Using computational modeling, we identify a simple algorithm that generates the appropriate commands through phase-dependent gating. Together, these results reveal a regime in which motor cortex does not fully specify muscle activity, but must sculpt an ongoing, spinally-generated program to flexibly control behavior in a complex and changing environment.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976

During reorientation, differential load on the balancer cilia leads to altered beating of the ciliated comb rows to elicit turns. To study the neural bases of gravity sensing, we imaged by volume electron microscopy (vEM) the aboral organ of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi. We reconstructed 972 cells, including syncytial neurons that form a nerve net. The syncytial neurons synapse on the balancer cells and also form reciprocal connection with the bridge cells that span the statocyst. High-speed imaging revealed that balancer cilia beat and arrest in a coordinated manner but with differences between the sagittal and tentacular planes of the animal, reflecting nerve-net organisation. Our results suggest a coordinating rather than sensory-motor function for the nerve net and inform our understanding of the diversity of nervous-system organisation across animals.","NA","biorxiv",1752358220976
