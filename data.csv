Generally, experienced bullying showed increased subcortical volumes in the putamen ({beta}=0.12), caudate ({beta}=0.06), accumbens ({beta}=0.06), amygdala ({beta}=0.07), hippocampus ({beta}=0.06), paired with decreased cerebellar ({beta}=-0.10), entorhinal, ({beta}=-0.12), and insula ({beta}=-0.11) volumes. Females exhibited more volumetric changes in emotional processing areas whereas males had more changes in motor and sensory regions. These findings point to widespread associations between bullying victimization and brain development, offering a potential neurobiological framework to explain the emotional and behavioral difficulties observed. Importantly, this study emphasizes the need for a sex-sensitive approach in future research and interventions related to bullying.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

This study conducts a systematic review with meta-analysis of secondary fungal infections (SFIs) associated with COVID-19 considering various significant parameters, such as the frequency of SFIs across the globe, species shift, gender-specific infection rates, the significance of medical history, efficacy of steroid and antifungal, treatment outcomes (mortality rate), and fungal- polymicrobial mortality analysis.

MethodsA literature search was conducted on COVID-19-related fungal infection studies (2020-2024) from SCOPUS and PUBMED databases, excluding preprints. The systematic data extraction captured the PMCID, country, patient demographics (age and gender), clinical outcomes, associated pathogens, medical history, and treatment details.

FindingsThe global meta-analysis of COVID-19-associated SFIs yielded 10,700 cases across 58 countries, exhibiting a significant male predominance (65.6% vs. 34.3% female). Aspergillus spp., Candida spp., and Mucorales spp. emerged as the primary fungal pathogens. The predominant six countries marking 80 % of global cases include India (46.8 %), Italy (10 %), Iran (9.4 %), France (5.1 %), Spain (4.3 %), and Egypt (4.1 %). Complication rates revealed CAM as the most prevalent (59.2%), with a 28% mortality rate. CAC (21.6%) and CAPA (19.1%) had substantially higher mortality rates, at 54% and 58%, respectively. Specific populations were highly affected, including individuals with diabetes were prone to CAM, those undergone catheterization were at increased risk of CAC, and individuals with respiratory diseases or without prior medical history were susceptible to CAPA. In both CAC and CAPA, the species shift towards the non-albicans spp. and non- fumigatus spp., associated with higher mortality. In addition, polymicrobial infection with fungal pathogens (Aspergillus spp., Candida spp., Mucorales spp.) and Multi-bacteria ( K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus) also increased the mortality rate. Effective treatments were identified, including combining caspofungin with corticosteroids for CAC, voriconazole with dexamethasone for CAPA, and AmBisome monotherapy for CAM.

InterpretationIn SFIs populations, CAM prevailed in high-density areas with relatively lower mortality rates, whereas CAC and CAPA exhibited higher mortality rates. Notably, polymicrobial infections significantly increased mortality across all SFIs. Underlying medical conditions primarily influenced the type of fungal pathogen, but treatment outcomes varied. Azole drugs and Amphotericin-B were ineffective against Candidiasis, except for caspofungins limited susceptibility. Voriconazole and AmBisome demonstrated efficacy against Aspergillosis and Mucormycosis, respectively. Additionally, steroid administration proved life-saving in CAPA and CAC cases, yet remained ineffective in CAM.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSFive years after the COVID-19 pandemic, a plethora of research has investigated SFIs associated with COVID-19, with a major focus on pathogenicity, immunomodulation, and the impact of steroids and tocilizumab. However, a critical knowledge gap persists that addresses meta-analysis on the frequency of SFIs by country, gender-specific infection rates, the significance of medical history, species shift within the fungal kingdom, its virulence expression, polymicrobial infection dynamics, synergistic effects of steroids and antifungals in this context remains understudied. To address these gaps, the meta-analysis comprehensively examines these critical aspects, shedding light on various aspects of SFIs.

Added value of this studyThe systematic meta-analysis of COVID-19-associated SFIs revealed the emergence of non-candida spp. and non-fumigatus spp. Polymicrobial infection has been linked to alarming outcomes resulting in a 100% mortality rate.Similarly, the co- infection of C. albicans with non-albicans spp. A. fumigatus with non-fumigatus spp. increased the mortality rate to 100%. For other species-related, effective therapies such as the combination of caspofungin and corticosteroids against Candidiasis (CAC), voriconazole and dexamethasone (CAPA), and AmBisome monotherapy (CAM) to combat SFIs.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe geographic distribution of fungal pathogens varies globally, with differing mortality rates. Deciphering their genomic characteristics will unveil insights into behaviour, transmission, and virulence, enabling targeted diagnostics, treatments, and prevention strategies.

MethodologyO_ST_ABSData collectionC_ST_ABSThe peer-reviewed published case studies, multicentric studies, retrospective studies, single-center studies and cohort studies represented with individuals case files were collected using search keywords ""COVID-19 and Aspergillus"", COVID-19 and Candida"", COVID-19 and Mucorales"", ""COVID Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis"", ""COVID Associated Mucormycosis"", COVID Associated Candidiasis"", in SCOPUS and PUBMED databases. Based on the search results, the articles from Aug 2020 to May 2024 were filtered excluding the preprint articles. A total of 1981 articles that included duplicates, articles unrelated to the study as well without abstracts were eliminated. A systematic review yielded 663 eligible publications, which were subjected to independent individual case meta- analysis. The distribution included 154 studies on CAC, 240 on CAPA, and 269 on CAM (Figure 1). From each article, the details of PMCID, country, age, gender, treatment outcome (live/dead), pathogens, medical history, and usage of steroids, antibacterial & antifungal were systematically collected. For the global surveillance of COVID-19-associated SFIs, the information from review, cohort, and retrospective studies was included.

The meta-analysis surveillance was conducted considering various significant parameters, such as frequency of SFIs across the globe, species shift, gender-specific infection rates, the significance of medical history, efficacy of steroid and antifungal, treatment outcomes (mortality rate), and fungal- polymicrobial mortality analysis. For the statistical analysis, Jamovi v2.6.2 tool and other tools were used as given below.

The proportional meta-analysis was studied using a random effects model to quantify the distribution of SFIs attributed to Mucorales spp., Candida spp., and Aspergillus spp., across the countries. The analysis was considered with a 95% confidence interval (Cl). The analysis also evaluated the overall effect size and sample heterogeneity as indicated by the I{superscript 2} statistic. To investigate the frequency distribution of individual species within SFI, a ClinicoPath table one was employed. This statistical approach enabled the examination of the frequency range of specific species in respective SFIs. To estimate the mortality rates, a two-outcome proportion test was conducted, providing proportion values accompanied by 95 % CI. This study calculated the overall respective SFIs ( CAM , CAPA, and CAM) as well as for specific species. For instance, the mortality rate of A. fumigatus in CAPA was determined providing insight into species-specific outcomes, which enabled a detailed understanding of mortality rates across the various SFIs and their respective causative pathogens. A survival analysis was conducted to explore the interplay between gender, age, and species-specific conditions. The Long-rank, Gehan, and Tarone-Ware tests assessed differences in survival patterns. The analysis also estimated median age at risk for each species-specific condition, by gender, using cumulative hazard functions and 95% CI. A binomial logistic regression model was employed to assess the risk of treatment outcomes with species-specific pathogens. The model calculated the probability of successful treatment outcome, accompanied by standard errors (SE) and Z-scores. These metrics enabled the evaluation of the likelihood of treatment success or failure in correlation with specific pathogens. To provide the optimal treatment strategy, a Crosstable for dependent outcome analysis was performed to predict mortality rates for the treatment outcome. This final step enabled the identification of the most effective treatment approach by examining the intersection of treatment options and mortality rates, providing actionable insights for clinicians to make data-driven decisions for the management of SFIs.","NA","medrxiv",1730326128440

Why MHC-I is susceptible to capture via autophagy remains unclear. By synchronizing exit of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we show that PDAC cells display prolonged retention of MHC-I in the ER and fail to efficiently route it to the plasma membrane. A capture-complex composed of NBR1 and the ER-phagy receptor TEX264 facilitates targeting of MHC-I for autophagic degradation, and suppression of either receptor is sufficient to increase total levels and re-route MHC-I to the plasma membrane. Binding of MHC-I to the capture complex is linked to antigen presentation efficiency, as inhibiting antigen loading via knockdown of TAP1 or beta 2-Microglobulin led to increased binding between MHC-I and the TEX264-NBR1 capture complex. Conversely, expression of ER directed high affinity antigenic peptides led to increased MHC-I at the cell surface and reduced lysosomal degradation. A genome-wide CRISPRi screen identified NFXL1, as an ER-resident E3 ligase that binds to MHC-I and mediates its autophagic capture. High levels of NFXL1 are negatively correlated with MHC-I protein expression and predicts poor patient prognosis. These data highlight an ER resident capture complex tasked with sequestration and degradation of non-conformational MHC-I in PDAC cells, and targeting this complex has the potential to increase PDAC immunogenicity.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

Notably, both variants carry mutations, S31del of KP.3.1.1 and T22N of XEC, that could introduce new N-linked glycans on the Spike N-terminal domain (NTD), emphasizing the urgent need to assess their potential changes in viral characteristics. Here, we found that both KP.3.1.1 and XEC maintained the high ACE2-Spike binding affinity and pseudovirus infectivity of KP.3. Importantly, compared to KP.3, KP.3.1.1, and especially XEC, could further evade the neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma, even those elicited by KP.2-like breakthrough infections. Interestingly, both variants demonstrated increased resistance against monoclonal neutralizing antibodies targeting various epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD). These suggest that the additional NTD glycosylation of KP.3.1.1 and XEC could enhance immune evasion via allosteric effects, and supports the future prevalence of XEC.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

Here, we propose TaxVAMB, a metagenome binning tool based on semi-supervised bi-modal variational autoencoders, combining tetranucleotide frequencies and contig co-abundances with contig annotations returned by any taxonomic classifier on any taxonomic rank. TaxVAMB outperforms all other binners on CAMI2 human microbiome datasets, returning on average 40% more near-complete assemblies than the next best binner. On real long-read datasets TaxVAMB recovers on average 13% more near-complete bins and 14% more species. When used in a single-sample setup, TaxVAMB on average returns 83% more high quality bins than VAMB. TaxVAMB bins incomplete genomes drastically better than any other tool, returning 255% more high quality bins of incomplete genomes than the next best binner.

Ontogeny has therefore become a problematic confounding variable in vertebrate paleontology, especially in study systems distant from extant crown clades, rendering taxonomic hypothesis testing (a fundamental process in evolutionary biology) rife with difficulty. Paleontologists have adopted quantitative methods to compensate for the perception that juvenile specimens lack diagnostic apomorphies seen in their adult conspecifics. Here, I critically evaluate these methods and the assumptions that guide their interpretation using a {micro}CT dataset comprising growth series of American and Chinese alligator. I find that several widespread assumptions are scientifically unjustifiable, and that two popular methods - geometric morphometrics and cladistic analysis of ontogeny - have unacceptably high rates of type II error and present numerous procedural difficulties. However, I also identify a suite of ontogenetically invariant characters that differentiate the living species of Alligator throughout ontogeny. These characters overwhelmingly correspond to anatomical systems that develop prior to (and play a signaling role in) the development of the cranial skeleton itself, suggesting that their ontogenetic invariance is a consequence of the widely conserved vertebrate developmental program. These observations suggest that the architecture of the cranium is fixed early in embryonic development, and that ontogenetic remodeling does not alter the topological relationships of the cranial bones or the soft tissue structures they house. I propose a general model for future taxonomic hypothesis tests in the fossil record, in which the hypothesis that two specimens different ontogenetic stages of a single species can be falsified by the discovery of character differences that cannot be attributed plausibly to ontogenetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

Therefore, approaches targeting food preferences should be integral in counteracting the current epidemic. However, food preferences are affected by a multitude of factors and are usually resistant to changes later in life. Hence, we tested whether the food choices of preschool children can be changed by a child-appropriate interactive fairytale. We used two interactive stories: the first (experimental) story was about how two protagonists of similar age as the participants saved their hometown from being drained of color with the help of magic fruits or vegetables, while the second (control) story consisted of a similar plot that did not mention food. In Experiment 1, we used a crossover design with a one-week baseline measurement. After the experimental stories, healthy food choices (i.e., pieces of fruit vs. cookies, sweets, or cake) increased significantly relative to the one-week baseline, whereas no change was observed after the control story. In preregistered Experiment 2, we replicated these results with vegetables as healthy options using a random control design and investigated the longevity of the effects. The food-story effect on vegetable choices was similar to fruits (Exp. 1) and lasted for two weeks. These findings demonstrate that appropriate narratives about food can have a strong and lasting effect on the healthy food choices of preschool children and might promote healthy food consumption if incorporated into nutrition education.","NA","medrxiv",1730326128440

IME has been noted across diverse genes and organisms, but remains mysterious in many respects. For example, how does intron sequence affect the magnitude of IME? In this study, we performed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to assess the effect of varying intron sequence on gene expression in a high-throughput manner, in human cells, using tens of thousands of synthetic introns with natural splice sites and randomized internal sequence. We observe that most random introns splice efficiently and enhance gene expression as well as or better than fully natural introns. Nearly all introns stimulate gene expression ~eight-fold above an intronless control, at both mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that the primary mechanism acts to increase mRNA levels. IME strength is positively associated with splicing efficiency and with the intronic content of poly-uridine stretches, which we confirm using reporter experiments. Together, this work elucidates sequence determinants of IME from tens of thousands of random introns, and confirms that enhancement of gene expression is a general property of splicing.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

In vivo chemistry experiments revealed that an electron leak from site IIIQo at ETC Complex III is responsible for O2- production. Importantly, depleting mitochondrial O2- fully mimics anoxic conditions and, like anoxia, induces suspended animation prior to morphogenesis, but not after. Specifically, H2O2, and not ONOO-, NO, or HO{middle dot}, can single-handedly account for this mtROS-based response. We demonstrate that depleting mitochondrial O2- similarly prevents the onset of morphogenetic events in vertebrate embryos and ichthyosporea, close relatives of animals. We postulate that such redox-based metabolic licensing of morphogenesis is an ancient trait of holozoans that couples the availability of oxygen to development, conserved from early-diverging animal relatives to vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

Here, we investigated the involvement of those neuropeptide systems in maternal aggression within the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh), a central region of the reward and maternal circuits. Infusion of CRF or Urocortin3 (CRF- receptor 2 agonist), as well as an OXT receptor antagonist, reduced maternal aggression, suggesting a role in pup defence. Furthermore, the effects of CRF infusion in the NAcSh continued beyond the maternal defence test (MDT), reducing nursing and increasing self- grooming. Corroborating the involvement of the stress system in maternal aggression, colocalization of CRF and cFos immunoreactive cells were increased in response to the MDT, regardless of pup presence. In addition, MDT exposure increased intra-NAc OXT release in lactating rats, which could be also triggered by local retrodialysis of CRF, but not Urocortin3. However, both ligands of the CRF system elicited dopamine (DA) release in different dynamics. Crh-r1 were predominantly expressed in the medial NAc on medium-sized spiny neurons (MSN), but also in the rostral part on GABAergic interneurons. Crh-r2 were mainly expressed in the rostral NAc and its expression on GABAergic interneurons increased towards the caudal pole. Lastly, we identified CRF-enriched projections to the NAcSh descending from the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the paraventricular thalamus, among others. In conclusion, intra-NAcSh dampened CRF system activity and enhanced OXT system transmission are indispensable for successful pup defence. Any perturbations like increased CRF system signalling might activate compensatory mechanisms to ensure adequate maternal behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

Mitoribosomes are specific ribosomes found in mitochondria, which have been shown to be remarkably diverse across eukaryotic lineages. In plants, they possess unique features, including additional rRNA domains stabilized by numerous pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms of translation by plant mitoribosomes remain largely unknown. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to provide a high-resolution structural characterization of the flowering plant mitoribosome, in translating and maturation states. The structure reveals the mitoribosome bound to tRNA in the peptidyl site, along with a segment of mRNA and a nascent polypeptide. Moreover, we identify an extensive set of ribosomal RNA modifications that we confirmed by nanopore sequencing. Additionally, we observe a late assembly intermediate of the small ribosomal subunit, in complex with the RsgA assembly factor. This reveals how a plant-specific extension of RsgA blocks the mRNA channel to prevent premature mRNA association before complete small subunit maturation. Our findings elucidate key aspects of translation in flowering plant mitochondria, revealing its distinct features compared to other eukaryotic lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

Natural Killer (NK) cells play a role in mediating air pollutant effects and regulating vaccine immunity. Objective: This real-world study, conducted on participants in the Pfizer BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine trial, studied the effects of wildfire smoke exposure on long-term vaccine effects. Methods: We collected blood samples from 52 healthy, non-smoking participants (ages 26-83) before and 1 month after placebo or vaccine injections during heavy wildfire smoke events in Sacramento. The study included 28 vaccinated (Group 1) and 24 placebo-injected (Group 2) individuals, the latter vaccinated several months later, outside wildfire season. Blood samples from both Group 1 and 2 were also investigated 6 months after the second dose of vaccine. We analyzed intracellular cytokines, B and NK cell markers by flow cytometry, and serum immunoglobulin levels against common coronaviruses using multiplex assays. Results: A robust S-RBD-specific IgG response observed 1 month post booster, declined variably 6 months later. Wildfire smoke acutely increased IL-13 expression by CD56bright NK cells. IL-13+CD56bright NK cells at the time of vaccination negatively correlated with anti-S-RBD IgG (r=-0.41, p<0.05) one month later. Total IgG levels on the other hand, positively correlated with the air quality index (AQI) measured during vaccination (r=0.96, p<0.01). Similarly to age (but not sex, BMI or race/ethnicity), the two-week AQI averages during vaccination showed a significant negative correlation with anti-S-RBD IgG levels 6 months later (r=-0.41, p<0.05). Conclusion: Wildfire smoke may lead to inappropriate immunoglobulin production and diminished vaccine immunity. Our novel findings highlight a previously unrecognized pathway involving NK-cell derived IL-13 and non-specific B-cell activation and underscore the significance of environmental exposures in shaping immunity.","NA","medrxiv",1730326128440

However, the use of managed bees to supplement the contribution of wild pollinators still faces challenges, such as over-reliance on pesticides in intensively managed agroecosystems. Here, we placed managed bee colonies on conventional farms to assess their impact on arabica coffee yield, quality and market value, while also to evaluate colony health in coffee fields treated with field rates of thiamethoxam-based products. We show that supplementing farms with managed bees increased farmer income by enhancing coffee yield and beverage quality, which is rewarded by specialty coffee markets. Moreover, our field-based study reveals that, even when exposed to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, managed bee colonies exhibited no significant adverse effects on their health within coffee fields. Our results underline that pollination is a key input on intensively managed coffee farms, and that agricultural production and environmental conservation interact synergically to maximize profitability, which is fundamental to encourage farmers to be good stewards of their croplands by adopting nature-positive practices.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

This process is thought to be mediated by neurons organized as attractor networks1,2. However, whether attractor dynamics underlie decision behavior and the complex neuronal responses remains unclear. Here we use an unsupervised, deep learning-based method to discover decision-related dynamics from the simultaneous activity of neurons in frontal cortex and striatum of rats while they accumulate pulsatile auditory evidence. We found that trajectories evolved along two sequential regimes, the first dominated by sensory inputs, and the second dominated by the autonomous dynamics, with flow in a direction (i.e., ""neural mode"") largely orthogonal to that in the first regime. We propose that the second regime corresponds to decision commitment. We developed a simplified model that approximates the coupled transition in dynamics and neural mode and allows precise inference, from each trials neural activity, of a putative internal decision commitment time in that trial. The simplified model captures diverse and complex single-neuron temporal profiles, such as ramping and stepping3-5. It also captures trial-averaged curved trajectories6-8, and reveals distinctions between brain regions. The putative neurally-inferred commitment times (""nTc"") occurred at times broadly distributed across trials, and not time-locked to stimulus onset, offset, or response onset. Nevertheless, when trials were aligned to nTc, behavioral analysis showed that, as predicted by a decision commitment time, sensory evidence before nTc affected the subjects decision, but evidence after nTc did not. Our results show that the formation of a perceptual choice involves a rapid, coordinated transition in both the dynamical regime and the neural mode of the decision process, and suggest the moment of commitment to be a useful entry point for dissecting mechanisms underlying rapid changes in internal state.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

The studies on insomnia disorder consistently showed overlapping (salience network: insula and anterior cingulate cortex) and differential MRI correlation patterns between depressive (thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex and its associated functional connectivity) and anxiety (functional connectivity associated with default mode network) symptoms. The insula was also consistently identified as indicating the severity of insomnia symptoms in depressive disorder. In contrast, findings for other regions related to insomnia symptoms in both depressive and anxiety disorders were generally inconsistent across studies, partly due to variations in methods and patient cohorts. In the general population, brain regions in the default mode network provided a functional link between insomnia and depressive symptoms. These findings underscore both the shared and distinct neural correlates among depression, anxiety, and insomnia, providing potential avenues for the clinical management of these conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1730326128440

Obesity and overweight have furthermore been shown to relate to structural brain alterations. Post-COVID condition (PCC) has in turn been associated with structural brain alterations and lingering immunological changes. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess whether obesity contributes to structural brain alterations and differences in immunological markers in PCC patients.

MethodsWe investigated a previously established cohort of PCC patients (n = 61). Whole-brain comparison of gray matter volume (GMV) was conducted by voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Obesity, as measured by body mass index (BMI), as well as age, gender and total intracranial volume (TIV) were included as regressors in a linear regression model.

ResultsA significant negative association was found between higher BMI and lower GMV in the right thalamus (p(FWE) = 0.039, k = 209, TFCE = 1037.97, x = 18, y = -21, z = 8). Moreover, BMI, GMV and immunological markers were linked in PCC. Specifically, BMI was primarily positively associated with Interleukin-6 and negatively with Interleukin-7, while GMV showed strong positive associations with Interleukin-8.

LimitationsA small cohort size and no available data on BMI changes before and after SARS-CoV2 infection limit the interpretation of our findings.

ConclusionThe results suggest that BMI contributes to GMV alterations in PCC patients, with both BMI and GMV being associated with peripheral immunological markers. These findings indicate that converging mechanisms, such as inflammation and structural brain alterations, may play a role in obesity and PCC.","NA","medrxiv",1730326128440

Our structural analysis reveals a characteristic genome scaling minimum at 6-8 Mbp in mitosis. Combined with data-driven modeling and molecular perturbations, we can show that very large and strongly overlapping loops formed by Condensins are the fundamental structuring principle of mitotic chromosomes. These loops compact chromosomes locally and globally to the limit set by chromatin self-repulsion.

Senolytic interventions have been successful in reducing multi-morbidity, frailty, and cognitive decline in animal models and are seen as promising anti-ageing interventions in mammals. We compared the effects of a 12-ingredient nutraceutical on mice lifespan and healthspan markers with that of a high efficacy senolytic intervention consisting of a low dose of Navitoclax combined with the specific mitochondrial uncoupler BAM15. Both interventions were started at old age (20 months). The supplement was given daily until the end of the experiment (30 months of age), but the senolytic intervention consisted of two short (5 days each) rounds of treatment at 20 and 23 months of age. Despite late onset, both interventions increased median lifespan similarly by around 20% over controls. The senolytic intervention significantly reduced frailty progression and improved cognitive function after the second round of treatment, but without subsequent treatment, these effects appeared to wane at later ages. The multi-ingredient supplement tended to reduce frailty progression steadily with time, albeit not significant, and maintained cognitive function. Mechanistically, in vitro, there was no evidence of senolytic activity of the multi-ingredient nutraceutical as a whole nor of its individual ingredients. Continuous multi-ingredient dietary supplementation shows promise in achieving comparable anti-ageing efficacy as a senolytic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

Whereas this effect has been mostly explained in terms of weakening cognitive control, cognitive effort may also bias behavioral choices by amplifying the hedonic and emotional impact of rewards. We report parallel findings with animals and humans supporting this hypothesis. In rats, exerting cognitive effort immediately before access to cocaine self-administration significantly increased drug intake. In addition, exerting cognitive effort increased the psychostimulant effect of cocaine. The effects of cognitive effort on addiction-related behaviors were eliminated and even reversed when animals could rest in their home-cage for 2-4h before access to cocaine self-administration. Among humans, we found that expending cognitive effort increased consumption of tasty (but unhealthy) food by increasing the hedonic enjoyment of consuming the food. In addition, the effects were specific for emotionally relevant stimuli (i.e., food rewards) and did not generalize to judgment about neutral objects. Altogether these data suggest that intense cognitive effort can increase the perceived intensity of rewards and lead to their overconsumption. This effect may contribute to bad decision making induced by excessive cognitive effort and make people more vulnerable to indulge in unhealthy behaviors such as use of addictive drugs.

Significance StatementPeople dieting or recovering from addiction frequently report that relapses occur during periods of stress and mental fatigue. Multiple processes may contribute to this, including beliefs about the stress-reducing effects of drugs, beliefs about ones inability to continue resisting, and lack of energy needed to sustain resistance. Here, we suggest an additional possible process: during a state of mental fatigue, rewards become all the more satisfying, thereby also increasing subsequent desire for them. We report two lines of experiments, one with rats and one with human participants, to show that intense cognitive effort leads to increased enjoyment of rewards and hence increased consumption.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

There is a consensus among quantitative geneticists that the G-matrix can evolve through ""deep"" time. Yet, quantitative genetic models for the evolution of the G-matrix are conspicuously lacking. In contrast, the field of macroevolution has several stochastic models for univariate traits evolving on phylogenies. However, despite much research into multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods, analytical models of how multivariate trait matrices might evolve on phylogenies have not been considered. Here we show how three analytical models for the evolution of matrices and multivariate traits on phylogenies, based on Lie group theory, Riemannian geometry and stochastic differential (diffusion) equations, can be combined to unify quantitative genetics and macroevolutionary theory in a coherent mathematical framework. The models provide a basis for understanding how G-matrices might evolve on phylogenies, and we show how to fit models to data via simulation using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Such models can be used to generate and test hypotheses about the evolution of genetic variances and covariances, together with the evolution of the traits themselves, and how these might vary across a phylogeny. This unification of macroevolutionary theory and quantitative genetics is an important advance in the study of phenotypes, allowing for the construction of a synthetic quantitative theory of the evolution of species and multivariate traits over ""deep"" time.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

Our pipeline introduces a method, PHARAOH (Phasing Reads in Areas Of Homozygosity), which uses ultra-long ONT data to ensure alignments are accurately phased and to correctly introduce heterozygous edits in falsely homozygous regions. We demonstrate that the DeepPolisher pipeline can reduce assembly errors by half, with a greater than 70% reduction in indel errors. We have applied our DeepPolisher-based pipeline to 180 assemblies from the next Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) data release, producing an average predicted Quality Value (QV) improvement of 3.4 (54% error reduction) for the majority of the genome.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

This pathogen can survive at least nine months in its tick vector in an apparent dormant state between blood meals, without losing cell proliferative capability when re-exposed to nutrients. Cultivated B. burgdorferi cells grown to stationary phase or resuspended in nutrient-limited media are often used to study the effects of nutrient deprivation. However, a thorough assessment of the spirochetes ability to recover from nutrient depletion has been lacking. Our study shows that starved B. burgdorferi cultures rapidly lose cell proliferative. Loss of genetic elements essential for cell proliferation contributes to the observed proliferative defect in stationary phase. The gradual decline in copies of genetic elements is not perfectly synchronized between chromosomes and plasmids, generating cells that harbor one or more copies of the essential chromosome but lack all copies of one or more non-essential plasmids. This phenomenon likely contributes to the well-documented issue of plasmid loss during in vitro cultivation of B. burgdorferi. In contrast, B. burgdorferi cells from ticks starved for 14 months showed no evidence of reduced cell proliferative ability or plasmid loss. Beyond their practical implications for studying B. burgdorferi, these findings suggest that the midgut of the tick vector offers a unique environment that supports the maintenance of B. burgdorferi's segmented genome and cell proliferative potential during periods of tick fasting.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

Using a high-resolution ribosome profiling approach, we analyzed the transcriptome, as well as monosome- and polysome-bound RNAs of mouse oocytes and embryos, defining an unprecedented extent of spatiotemporal translational landscapes during this rapid developmental phase. We observed previously unknown mechanisms of translational selectivity, i.e., stage-wise deferral of loading monosome-bound mRNAs to polysome for active translation, continuous translation of both monosome and polysome-bound mRNAs at the same developmental stage, and priming to monosomes after initial activation. We showed that a eukaryotic initiation factor Eif1ad3, which is exclusively translated in the 2-Cell embryo, is required for ribosome biogenesis post embryonic genome activation. Our study thus provides genome-wide datasets and analyses of spatiotemporal translational dynamics accompanying mammalian germ cell and embryonic development and reveals the contribution of a novel translation initiation factor to mammalian pre-implantation development.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

Counterintuitively, during starvation, multiple mRNAs that are upregulated are also increasingly bound and prematurely terminated and degraded via NNS. Here we demonstrate that this NNS-mediated attenuation is important for controlling the expression and protein concentration of an evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial transporter, Pic2. Strikingly, we find that even a modest increase in Pic2 protein levels caused by defective NNS regulation has major phenotypical consequences, increasing cell volume and intracellular stress, prolonging cell cycle and decreasing growth rate. Disrupting Nab3 binding to PIC2 globally redistributed Nrd1 binding, changing the levels of other NNS-regulated transcripts. We propose that imbalances in the availability of the subunits constituting the NNS complex underlie the cell volume and cycle anomalies. Collectively our results illustrate that even subtle changes in how RNA-binding proteins interact with a single RNA substrate can cause global defects and they emphasise the crucial role of the NNS complex in preserving microbial fitness during stress.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

This division is conserved across highly divergent, early-branching animals including flatworms and cnidarians. While specific interactions between motifs delineate cell type relationships within families, surprisingly, these interactions are not conserved between species. Consistently, while deep learning models trained on one species can predict accessibility of other species sequences, their predictions frequently rely on distinct, but synonymous, motif combinations.

Antibiotics based on programmable antisense oligomers (asobiotics) offer an attractive solution to the ""arms-race"", as their specificity can be quickly updated and tailored to target resistant bacteria. In order to understand the genetic architecture of resistance to asobiotics, we employed laboratory evolution assays to identify mutations that decrease susceptibility to antisense peptide nucleic acid (PNA) against four major gram-negative pathogens: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We observed that the reduction in susceptibility upon asobiotics treatment was dependent on the specific cell penetrating peptide (CPP) being conjugated to the PNAs, suggesting that reduced uptake is a common adaptation strategy only against the (KFF)3-K CPP. We in fact observed that sbmA was frequently mutated in all tested species when treated with (KFF)3-K conjugated PNAs. We further identified mutations related to translation, peptide transport and cell envelope, which provide new hypotheses on cellular response to CPP-PNAs conjugates. Furthermore, for (RXR)4XB-acpP we observed a modest increase in resistance only when mutations in the PNA binding site were induced, which could easily be bypassed by changing the PNA sequence. These findings indicate that the specific identity of the CPP used plays a key role in determining its robustness against the evolution of resistance, and that laboratory evolution can illuminate the remaining gaps in our knowledge on the mechanisms of action of asobiotics.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

Here, we show that T cell cross-reactivity can be controlled by the co-signalling molecules CD5, CD8, and CD4, without modifying the TCR. We find the largest reduction in cytotoxic T cell cross-reactivity by knocking out CD8 and expressing CD4. Cytotoxic T cells engineered with a CD8- to-CD4 co-receptor switch show reduced cross-reactivity to random and positional scanning peptide libraries, as well as to self-peptides, while maintaining their on-target potency. Therefore, co-receptor switching generates super selective T cells that reduce the risk of lethal off-target cross-reactivity, and offers a universal method to enhance the safety of T cell immunotherapies for any TCR.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128440

However, current bioinformatics tools are limited in their ability to integrate and analyze the vast and diverse single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets available, hindering the comprehensive capture of cellular heterogeneity and the identification of subtle genetic changes across immune states, differentiation pathways, and tissue contexts. To overcome these challenges, we introduce genular, an open-source platform that unifies gene expression data analysis across diverse cell types by integrating scRNA-seq data with extensive genomic and proteomic information from 16 databases, including NCBI Gene, Human Protein Atlas, STRING, and UniProt. genular aggregates data from more than 2,893 scRNA-seq experiments, encompassing over 74.5 million unique cells across various tissues and conditions. A key feature of genular is calculating a cell marker score for each gene, enabling the quantification of gene expression across cells to derive unique profiles specific to cell types, states, and lineages. Using genular, we differentiate T cell memory states, map differentiation profiles by tracking gene expression changes as monocytes mature into macrophages and lymphoid progenitor cells develop into T cells, and capture tissue-specific reprogramming of macrophages, revealing distinct gene expression profiles that enable specialized functions in different tissues. By integrating scRNA-seq data with multi-domain biological information and employing advanced statistical methodologies, genular provides a scalable platform that accurately defines cellular identities, functional states, and differentiation pathways. This comprehensive approach facilitates breakthroughs in immunology, gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and disease research, enabling a deeper understanding of immune cell functions and their roles in health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128441

Agricultural crops typically contain limited R gene diversity so resistance is often short-lived as pathogens evolve rapidly to evade recognition. The mildew resistance locus A (Mla) R gene family of barley and wheat represents a rich source of natural genetic variation that is ideal for mining disease resistance specificities. Mla R genes encode immune receptor proteins of the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) class that recognise unrelated plant pathogens by binding secreted virulence proteins termed effectors. The barley NLRs MLA13 and MLA7 confer resistance to different strains of the barley powdery mildew pathogen through direct interaction with the pathogen effectors AVRA13 and AVRA7 respectively. Using DNA shuffling, we generated a variant library by recombining the Mla7 and Mla13 genes in vitro. The variant library was cloned into yeast generating ~4,000 independent clones and was screened for interaction with AVRA13 and AVRA7 using a yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) assay. This yielded a number of clones that encode NLR proteins that interacted with AVRA13. Sequence analysis showed that the interacting MLA proteins can be clustered into three groups, all of which contain a critical residue from MLA13. While MLA13 and MLA7 differ by 30 residues across the LRR domain, the replacement of leucine to serine at this position in MLA7 facilitated interaction with AVRA13 in yeast and AVRA13-dependent immune signalling in planta. We have established a pipeline that evolves MLAs to recognise distinct pathogen effectors without the requirement for protein structural knowledge and the use of rationale design. We suggest these findings represent a step towards evolving novel recognition capabilities rapidly in vitro.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128441

Here, we sought to determine whether reproductive costs were primarily due to male/male competition, female/female competition, or male/female interactions in the bluefin killifish. In this species, males guard small spawning territories where females visit them daily to spawn. To manipulate the potential for male and female competition and male/female interactions, we altered the sex ratio and density of each sex across four treatments (1 male: 1 female, 1 male : 3 females, 3 males: 1 female, 3 males: 3 females). Female mortality was higher than male mortality. Surprisingly, female mortality and male aggressive behaviors towards females (i.e., chases) were highest in treatments with a single male. Male-male aggression was present, but males often resolved these disputes via signaling by flaring their fins. There was little evidence for overt aggression among females. When males lack rivals, they turn their territorial defense towards females. These costs help explain why, in nature, females promptly leave male territories following spawning and join loose shoals with conspecific females and minnows.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128441

The advent of the AI folding era has unleashed millions of high-quality predicted structures, motivating the development and assessment of scalable multiple structure alignment (MStA) methods.

Behavioral control is the decision about which process guides behavior. Despite the importance of behavioral control for adaptive decision-making, its neural mechanisms remain unclear. Critically, it is unknown if there are mechanisms for behavioral control that are distinct from those supporting the formation of goal-relevant knowledge. We performed deep phenotyping of individual dopamine system function by combining multiple PET scans, fMRI, and dopaminergic drug administration in a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Subjects performed a rule-based response time task, with goal-directed and automatic decision-making operationalized as model-based and model-free influences on behavior. We found a double dissociation between two aspects of ventral striatal dopamine physiology: D2/3 receptor availability and dopamine synthesis capacity. Convergent and causal evidence indicated that D2/3 receptors regulate behavioral control by enhancing model-based and blunting model-free influences on behavior but do not affect model-based knowledge formation. In contrast, dopamine synthesis capacity was linked to the formation of model-based knowledge but not behavioral control.

Yet, despite a wealth of studies tracking visual verification behavior among the external contents of perception, complementary processes associated with visual verification among internal contents of memory remain elusive. Building on a recently established gaze marker of internal visual focusing in working memory, we tracked the internal-inspection process associated with confirming or dismissing potential targets during search. We show how we look back into memory when faced with external stimuli that are perceived as potential targets and link such internal inspection to the time required for visual verification. A direct comparison between visual verification among the contents of working memory or perception further revealed how verification in both domains engages frontal theta activity in scalp EEG, but also how mnemonic verification is slower to deploy than perceptual verification. This establishes internal verification behavior as an integral component of visual search, and provides new ways to look into this underexplored component of human search behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128441

It typically emerges in late adolescence and is associated with dopamine abnormalities and aberrant salience. Most genes associated with schizophrenia risk involve ubiquitous targets that may not explain delayed emergence of dopaminergic disruptions. This includes GRIN2A, the gene encoding the GluN2A subunit of the NMDA receptor. Both common and rare variants of GRIN2A are considered genetic risk factors for schizophrenia diagnosis. We find that Grin2a knockout in dopamine neurons during adolescence is sufficient to produce a behavioral phenotype that mirrors aspects of psychosis. These include disruptions in effort optimization, salience attribution, and ability to utilize feedback to guide behavior. We also find a selective effect of this manipulation on dopamine release during prediction error signaling. These data provide mechanistic insight into how variants of GRIN2A may lead to the latent presentation of aberrant salience and abnormalities in dopamine dynamics.

We demonstrate that oral supplementation of ILA impacts key MS disease processes in two preclinical models. ILA reduces neuroinflammation by dampening immune cell activation/ infiltration; and promotes remyelination and in vitro oligodendrocyte differentiation through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Supplementation of ILA, a reductive indole metabolite, restores the gut microbiomes oxidative/reductive metabolic balance by lowering circulating indole acetate (IAA), an oxidative indole metabolite, that blocks remyelination and oligodendrocyte maturation. The ILA-induced reduction in circulating IAA is linked to changes in IAA-producing gut microbiota taxa and pathways that are also dysregulated in MS. Notably, a lower ILA:IAA ratio correlates with worse MS outcomes.

Although increased nuclear Syn localization induces neurotoxicity, its definitive physiological role remains elusive. Previous studies on nuclear Syn are limited to its interactions with individual histones and dsDNA, leaving a significant gap in understanding its interactions with assembled histone H2a-H2b dimer and (H3-H4)2 tetramer, as well as its role in chromatin regulation. Here, we demonstrated that Syn binds specifically to both H2a-H2b and (H3-H4)2 with high affinity. Truncation studies revealed that Syn(1-103) region interacts with (H3-H4)2, while the acidic (121-140) C-terminal end is crucial for H2a-H2b binding. Sequence analysis suggests Syn-dimer binding region contains a conserved DEF/YxP motif present in other dimer-binding histone chaperones. High-resolution structure of Syn-dimer binding region with H2a-H2b complex reveals that Syn adopts two binding modes (BM1 and BM2). In BM-1, Syn utilizes nucleosomal DNA-binding surface, while in BM-2, it engages with both DNA- and the H3-interaction interface. Additionally, dimer recognition by Syn overlaps with other dimer-binding histone chaperones, suggesting Syn's potential role in the nucleosome assembly/disassembly process.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128441

Theoretical models of PC often rely on high-level approaches, and therefore implementations detailing which neurons or pathways are used to compute prediction errors or adapt the internal representations, as well as their level of agreement with biological circuitry, are currently missing. Here we propose a computational model of PC, which integrates a neuroanatomically informed hierarchy of cortical areas with a precise laminar organization and cell-type-specific connectivity between pyramidal, PV, SST and VIP cells. Our model efficiently performs PC, even in the presence of external and internal noise, by forming latent representations of naturalistic visual input (MNIST, fashion-MNIST and grayscale CIFAR-10) via Hebbian learning and using them to predict sensory input by minimizing prediction errors. The model assumes that both positive and negative prediction errors are computed by stereotypical pyramidal-PV-SST-VIP circuits with the same structure but different incoming input. During sensory inference, neural oscillatory activity emerges in the system due to interactions between representation and prediction error microcircuits, with optogenetics-inspired inactivation protocols revealing a differentiated role of PV, SST and VIP cell types in such dynamics. Finally, our model shows anomalous responses to deviant stimuli within series of same-image presentations, in agreement with experimental results on mismatch negativity and oddball paradigms. We argue that our model constitutes an important step to better understand the circuits mediating PC in real cortical networks.

Author summaryPredictive coding (PC) suggests that the brain constantly generates expectations about the world and updates these expectations based on incoming sensory input. While this theory is widely accepted, we still lack detailed models that show how specific neurons and brain circuits might carry out these processes. Here, we present a computational model which addresses this gap by including biologically plausible brain circuitry with specific types of neurons (pyramidal, PV, SST, and VIP cells) and their connections. It efficiently learns to form internal representations of visual information and uses them to predict sensory input, adjusting its predictions when errors occur. We found that particular types of neurons play different roles in these processes, and that neural oscillations emerge during the training and inference processes. Our model also replicates neural patterns observed in experiments where unexpected stimuli appear. By integrating anatomical and functional details, our work brings us closer to understanding how the brain uses predictive coding at the circuit level.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128441

Traditional gene-centric methods, which focus on a few hallmark genes like for capsids, miss much of the viral genome, leaving key viral proteins and functions undiscovered. Here, we introduce two powerful annotation-free metrics, V-score and VL-score, designed to quantify the virus-likeness of protein families and genomes and create an open-access searchable database, V-Score-Search. By applying V- and VL-scores to public databases (KEGG, Pfam, and eggNOG), we link 38-77% of protein families with viruses, a 9-16x increase over current estimates. These metrics outperform existing approaches, enabling precise detection of viral genomes, prophages, and host-derived auxiliary viral genes (AVGs) from fragmented sequences, and significantly improving genome binning. Remarkably, we identify up to 17x more AVGs, dominated by non-metabolic proteins of unknown function.

Here, we demonstrate that reactivations in the lateral visual cortex are vital for the consolidation of visual association learning. By employing longitudinal two-photon Ca2+ imaging alongside paired LFP recordings in the hippocampus and cortex, we show that targeted manipulation of PV+ inhibitory neurons in the lateral visual cortex after daily training selectively attenuated cue-specific reactivations and learning, with no apparent effect on normal network function during training.

While data-driven statistical and machine learning methods can identify patterns from omics data across multiple samples, they typically require a large number of samples and they often lack interpretability and alignment with existing biological knowledge. In contrast, knowledge-based network methods integrate molecular data with prior knowledge to provide results that are biologically interpretable, but they lack both a unified mathematical framework, leading to ad-hoc solutions specific to particular data types or prior knowledge, limiting their generalisability, and a common modelling interface for programmatic manipulation, restricting method extensions. Furthermore, existing methods generally cannot perform joint network inference across multiple samples or conditions, which restricts their capacity to capture shared mechanisms, making these methods more sensitive to noise and prone to overfitting. To address these limitations, we introduce CORNETO (Constrained Optimisation for the Recovery of NETworks from Omics), a unified framework for knowledge-driven network inference. CORNETO redefines the joint inference task as a constrained optimisation problem with a penalty that induces structured sparsity, allowing for simultaneous network inference across multiple samples. The framework is highly flexible and supports a wide variety of prior knowledge networks - undirected, directed and signed graphs, as well as hypergraphs - enabling the generalisation and improvement of many network inference methods, despite their seemingly different assumptions. We demonstrate its utility by presenting novel extensions of methods for signalling, metabolism and protein-protein interactions. We show how these new methods improve the performance of traditional techniques on a diverse set of biological tasks using simulated and real data.

We performed chronic electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in mice in which a subset of L6b neurons was conditionally ""silenced"", during undisturbed conditions, after sleep deprivation (SD), and after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of orexin. While the total amount of waking and sleep or the response to SD were not altered, L6b-silenced mice showed a slowing of theta-frequency (6-9 Hz) during wake and REM sleep, and a marked reduction of total EEG power, especially in NREM sleep. The infusion of orexin A increased wakefulness in both genotypes, but the effect was more pronounced in L6b-silenced mice, while the increase in theta-activity by orexin B was attenuated in L6b silenced animals.

Generating training data requires intense human effort to annotate each instance of an object across serial section images. Our focus is on the especially complicated brain neuropil, comprising an extensive interdigitation of dendritic, axonal, and glial processes visualized through serial section electron microscopy. We developed a novel deep learning-based method to generate dense 3D segmentations rapidly from sparse 2D annotations of a few objects on single sections. Models trained on the rapidly generated segmentations achieved similar accuracy as those trained on expert dense ground-truth annotations. Human time to generate annotations was reduced by three orders of magnitude and could be produced by non-expert annotators. This capability will democratize generation of training data for large image volumes needed to achieve brain circuits and measures of circuit strengths.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128441

Predicting the effect of up or down gene regulation or drug treatment on the gene expression profile of a cell can open avenues in understanding biological mechanisms and potentially treating disease. Most foundation models for single-cell biology learn from scRNA-seq counts, using experimental data as a modality to generate gene representations. Similarly, the scientific literature holds a plethora of information that can be used in generating gene representations using a different modality - language - as the basis. In this work, we study the effect of using both language and experimental data in modeling genes for perturbation prediction. We show that textual representations of genes provide additive and complementary value to gene representations learned from experimental data alone in predicting perturbation outcomes for single-cell data. We find that textual representations alone are not as powerful as biologically learned gene representations, but can serve as useful prior information. We show that different types of scientific knowledge represented as language induce different types of prior knowledge. For example, in the datasets we study, subcellular location helps the most for predicting the effect of single-gene perturbations, and protein information helps the most for modeling perturbation effects of interactions of combinations of genes. We validate our findings by extending the popular scGPT model, a foundation model trained on scRNA-seq counts, to incorporate language embeddings at the gene level. We start with NCBI gene card and UniProt protein summaries from the genePT approach and add gene function annotations from the Gene Ontology (GO). We name our model ""scGenePT"", representing the combination of ideas from these two models. Our work sheds light on the value of integrating multiple sources of knowledge in modeling single-cell data, highlighting the effect of language in enhancing biological representations learned from experimental data.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128441

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Here, we develop an experimentally-constrained biophysical network model of neocortical circuit motifs, focusing on layers 2-3 of the primary visual cortex (V1). We investigate the role of four major cortical interneuron classes in a competitive-cooperative computational primitive and validate these circuit motifs implemented soft winner-take-all (sWTA) computation for gain modulation, signal restoration, and context-dependent multistability. Using a novel parameter mapping technique, we configured IBMs TrueNorth (TN) chip to implement sWTA computations, mirroring biological neural dynamics. Retrospectively, we observed a strong correspondence between the biophysical model and the TN hardware parameters, particularly in the roles of four key inhibitory neuron classes: Parvalbumin (feedforward inhibition), Somatostatin (feedback inhibition), VIP (disinhibition), and LAMP5 (gain normalization). Moreover, the sparse coupling of this sWTA motif was also able to simulate a two-state neural state machine on the TN chip, replicating working memory dynamics essential for cognitive tasks. Additionally, integrating the sWTA computation as a preprocessing layer in the Vision Transformer (ViT) enhanced its performance on the MNIST digit classification task, demonstrating improved generalization to previously unseen data and suggesting a mechanism akin to zero-shot learning. Our approach provides a framework for translating brain-inspired computations to neuromorphic hardware, with potential applications on platforms like Intels Loihi2 and IBMs Northpole. By integrating biophysically accurate models with neuromorphic hardware and advanced machine learning techniques, we offer a comprehensive roadmap for embedding neural computation into NeuroAI systems.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128441

Alongside these introductions, inhabited and agricultural areas are spreading, and correspondingly most animal introductions occur in populated areas. Commensal species which can live alongside humans by making use of specific conditions, structures, or prey, have a significant advantage. Introduced mammal species often use anthropogenic features in their environment and demonstrate a higher tolerance of human disturbance, but their importance remains understudied in ectotherms. The Aesculapian snake (Zamenis longissimus) is an ectotherm which has been introduced beyond the northern extremities of its natural range. To understand their persistence, we radio-tracked snakes daily over two active seasons, including high-frequency tracking of a subset of males. We investigated snake home range size using Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimators (AKDE). Using AKDE-weighted Habitat Selection Functions we identified preferences for habitat features in a mosaic of habitats, and we used Integrated Step Selection Functions to further explore how these features influence movement. We revealed a particular preference for buildings in male snakes, while females preferred woodland. We demonstrate that the success of this ectothermic predator is likely tied to a willingness to use human features of the landscape.","NA","biorxiv",1730326128441

Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to verify the association between SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of Stroke, based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, in order to assess the inclusion of the virus as a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases.

MethodsA metaumbrella was conducted, which included 34 systematic reviews, of which 4 were selected for the final analysis based on methodological quality and consistency. The analysis aggregated the results of 70 primary studies, considering different stroke subtypes and outcomes associated with COVID-19. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} index, and significance bias was verified using Eggers test.

ResultsThe analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 is significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 1.55 - 3.95), particularly for ischemic stroke (eOR = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.80) and hemorrhagic stroke (eOR = 3.86; 95%CI: 1.79 - 8.33). Additionally, patients with cerebrovascular comorbidities had higher mortality (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 2.48 - 19.63), as did those who had previously suffered a stroke (eOR = 6.08; 95%CI: 3.73 - 9.91).

ConclusionThe association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke was consistent and significant, suggesting that COVID-19 should be considered a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. However, the high heterogeneity among the studies analyzed reinforces the need for further research to consolidate this relationship.","NA","medrxiv",1730326128441

We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark.

MethodsA cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza.

ResultsAmong 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80).

ConclusionCOVID-19 represented a greater disease burden than influenza, with more hospitalisations and deaths, and more severe disease primarily among non-vaccinated and comorbid patients.
