Objective: This study aimed to verify the association between SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of Stroke, based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, in order to assess the inclusion of the virus as a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. Methods: A metaumbrella was conducted, which included 34 systematic reviews, of which 4 were selected for the final analysis based on methodological quality and consistency. The analysis aggregated the results of 70 primary studies, considering different stroke subtypes and outcomes associated with COVID-19. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 index, and significance bias was verified using Egger's test. Results: The analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 is significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 1.55 - 3.95), particularly for ischemic stroke (eOR = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.80) and hemorrhagic stroke (eOR = 3.86; 95%CI: 1.79 - 8.33). Additionally, patients with cerebrovascular comorbidities had higher mortality (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 2.48 - 19.63), as did those who had previously suffered a stroke (eOR = 6.08; 95%CI: 3.73 - 9.91). Conclusion: The association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke was consistent and significant, suggesting that COVID-19 should be considered a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. However, the high heterogeneity among the studies analyzed reinforces the need for further research to consolidate this relationship.","NA","medrxiv",1728166176236

However, in such experiments high-fat diet is typically provided freely to animals, so it remains unclear how increasing dietary fat would impact body weight if the high-fat diet required more effort to obtain. Here, we hypothesized that unrestricted access is necessary for mice to overeat high fat diets, and the corollary that requiring mice to perform small amounts of work to obtain high-fat diets would reduce food intake and weight gain in a high-fat diet model of obesity. To test this hypothesis, we utilized home-cage-based feeding devices that either provided food freely or required mice to briefly poke their noses into a port - a simple action that is easy for them to do - to receive food. With both low-fat and high fat diets, requiring mice to nose-poke just one time to access food strongly reduced food intake, and in the case of high-fat diet, prevented the development of obesity. We conclude that unrestricted access to food promotes overeating in mice, and that making mice perform a simple action such as a nose-poke to access food reduces over eating and weight gain. We posit that ubiquitous access to low-cost food is a critical contributor to the human obesity epidemic, and that changes in the availability of unhealthy food may be part of the solution for addressing the obesity epidemic.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176236

Leveraging transcriptomics and proteomics imaging platforms, STAMP eliminates sequencing costs, to enable single-cell genomics from hundreds to millions of cells at an unprecedented low cost. Stamping cells in suspension onto imaging slides, STAMP supports single-modal (RNA or protein) and multimodal (RNA and protein) profiling and flexible, ultra-high-throughput formats. STAMP allows the analysis of a single or multiple samples within the same experiment, enhancing experimental flexibility, throughput and scale. We tested STAMP with diverse sample types, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), dissociated cancer cells and differentiated embryonic stem cell cultures, as well as whole cells and nuclei. Combining RNA and protein profiling, we applied immuno-phenotyping of millions of blood cells simultaneously. We also used STAMP to identify ultra-rare cell populations, simulating clinical applications to identify circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Performing in vitro differentiation studies, we further showed its potential for large-scale perturbation studies. Together, STAMP establishes a new standard for cost-effective, scalable single-cell analysis. Without the need for sequencing, STAMP makes high-resolution profiling more affordable and accessible. Designed to meet the needs of research labs, diagnostic cores and pharmaceutical companies, STAMP holds the promise to transform our capacity to map human biology, diagnose diseases and drug discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176236

Epidemiological investigations consistently demonstrate an overrepresentation of the elderly in COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities. Despite this, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms explaining how old age constitutes a critical risk factor remains elusive. To unravel this, we designed an animal study, juxtaposing the course of COVID-19 in young adults (2 months) and geriatric (15-22 months) mice. Both groups of K18(hACE2) mice were intranasally exposed to 500 TCID50 of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with a variety of outcomes assessed on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infections (DPI). Analyses included pulmonary cytokines, RNA, viral loads, lipidomic profiles, and histological assessments, with a concurrent evaluation of the percentage of mice reaching humane endpoints. The findings unveiled notable distinctions between the two groups, with aged mice exhibiting impaired viral clearance at 7 DPI, correlating with diminished survival rates together with an absence of weight loss recovery at 6-7 DPI. Additionally, elderly-infected mice exhibited a deficient Th1 response characterized by diminished productions of IFNg, CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL9 relative to younger mice. Furthermore, mass-spectrometry analysis of the lung lipidome indicated altered expression of several lipids with immunomodulatory and pro-resolution effects in aged mice such as Resolvin, HOTrEs, and NeuroP, but also DiHOMEs-related ARDS. Collectively, disease severity implies a dysregulation of the antiviral response in elderly-infected mice relative to younger mice, resulting in compromised viral clearance and a more unfavorable prognosis. This underscores the potential efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments for elderly subjects experiencing symptoms of severe COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176236

Here, we engineered pluripotent stem cells in which cohesin loop extrusion can be inducibly disrupted without causing confounding cell cycle defects. While evident, transcriptional dysregulation was cell-type specific, and not all loci with distal enhancers depend equally on cohesin extrusion. Using comparative genome editing, we demonstrate that enhancer-promoter communication across as little as 20 kilobases can rely on cohesin. However, promoter-proximal regulatory elements can support long-range, cohesin-independent enhancer action - either upon disabling extrusion or across strong CTCF insulators. Finally, transcriptional dynamics and the emergence of new embryonic cell types in response to differentiation cues remained largely robust to disrupting cohesin extrusion. Beyond establishing novel experimental strategies to study cohesin functions in enhancer biology, our work provides mechanistic insight accounting for both cell type- and genomic context-specificity.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176236

Plasmids are as diverse as their hosts and exhibit a broad range of replication and mobility strategies, genetic repertoires, host ranges, sizes, and copies per cell. While most of these features have been extensively characterized, the determinants of plasmid copy number (PCN) remain poorly understood. Here, we leveraged extensive DNA sequencing data to comprehensively analyze the copy number of thousands of diverse bacterial plasmids. We found that the copy number of natural plasmids is highly variable, spanning nearly three orders of magnitude, and that it is intrinsically robust against changes in genomic context. We further show that PCN variability is tightly associated with plasmid lifestyles and develop the concept of replicon dominance to explain interactions in widespread multi-replicon plasmids. Finally, we uncover a universal scaling law that links copy number and plasmid size across phylogenetic boundaries, indicating that pervasive constraints orchestrate the PCN-size trade-off. Altogether, our work pioneers large-scale analyses of PCN while uncovering the fundamental rules that govern plasmid biology.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176236

Conversely, conservation of gene neighborhood indicates functional association. Spacedust is a tool for systematic, de novo discovery of conserved gene clusters. To find homologous protein matches it uses fast and sensitive structure comparison with Foldseek. Partially conserved clusters are detected using novel clustering and order conservation P-values. We demonstrate Spacedust's sensitivity with an all-vs-all analysis of 1308 bacterial genomes, identifying 72843 conserved gene clusters containing 58% of the 4.2 million genes. It recovered recover 95% of antiviral defense system clusters annotated by a specialized tool.

A variety of threats to the well-being of plants are found below ground; yet how plant roots activate inter-plant communication is largely unclear. Here we demonstrate that a wounded root rapidly releases protons (H+), that travel faster than any other ""known"" soluble biochemical signal due to a specialised diffusion mechanism. Within seconds after damage, cells in neighbouring unwounded roots sense the acidification and activate tissue-specific Ca2+ damage signalling. In turn, this triggers a differential growth response allowing the unwounded root to avoid the site of a potential threat.

Compared to chemical inducers, light-dependent control of gene expression by optogenetics achieves a higher spatial and temporal resolution. This could also prove decisive beyond basic research for manufacturing difficult-to-express proteins in pharmaceutical bioproduction. However, current optogenetic gene-expression systems limit this application in mammalian cells as expression levels and fold induction upon light stimulation are not sufficient. To overcome this limitation, we designed a photoswitch by fusing the blue light-activated light-oxygen-voltage receptor EL222 from Erythrobacter litoralis to the three tandem transcriptional activator domains VP64, p65, and Rta. The resultant photoswitch, dubbed DEL-VPR, allows an up to 400-fold induction of target gene expression by blue light, achieving expression levels that surpass those for strong constitutive promoters. Here, we utilized DEL-VPR to enable light-induced expression of complex monoclonal and bispecific antibodies with reduced byproduct expression, increasing the yield of functional protein complexes. Our approach offers temporally controlled yet strong gene expression and applies to both academic and industrial settings.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176236

We report a case of a novel, idiosyncratic gesture in a Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus) at  La Foret des Singes, Rocamadour, France. One adult male, Jomanix, was observed hand-clapping. To our knowledge, hand-clapping has never been described before in this species. To hand-clap, the male briefly shifted his weight onto his legs, lifted his upper body, and clapped both hands together. We recorded 30 instances of hand-clapping. Twenty-five of these hand-claps occurred in combination with other agonistic signals, such as lunges and open mouth threats. Recipients either responded with counter-aggression (N = 9) or a submissive response (N = 16). In five of the 30 events, the context was unclear. These observations suggest that the gesture constitutes an agonistic signal. According to the staff at  La Foret des Singes, the hand-clapping may have been copied from staff members who occasionally hand-clap to shoo the animals away from areas where they were not supposed to be, but that notion remains speculative. In the meantime, another subject from the same group reportedly started to hand-clap, but the subject had passed away before we could document the behaviour. The observations show that Jomanix can flexibly combine a novel gesture with other established communicative signals. The hand-clap is goal-directed and fulfils the criteria for first-order intentional communication. This case, as well as anecdotal reports from a Tonkean macaque (Macaca tonkeana) hand-clapping to get attention, reveals greater flexibility in the gestural communication of this genus than previously assumed but also underscores that social learning of the production of communicative gestures occurs rarely in this taxon.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176236

This response leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells required for viral clearance. Some of these recruited cells remain within the lung following infection and contribute to enhanced viral control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells can also display long-term changes following infection or insults. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection and find that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes associated with communication with T cells. Lung epithelial cells from IAV-infected mice display functional changes by more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naive animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells could be effective targets for vaccines to boost durable protective immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176236

In particular, the relationship between neuronal cell types, networks and function has been difficult to establish. Here, we propose principles by which functions arise primarily from spatial features of the cord. First, we suggest that distinct cell types with dissimilar length of projection constitute an asymmetrical ""Mexican hat"" topology, i.e. local excitation and surrounding inhibition, along the rostro-caudal axis. Second, the transversal segregation of cell types conveniently allows synapses to form with appropriate targets. We demonstrate these principles in a model of the mouse spinal cord, where networks are constructed by probabilistic sampling of synaptic connections from cell-specific projection patterns, which are gleaned from literature. The cell-type distributions are derived from single-cell RNA sequencing combined with spatial transcriptomics. We find that essential aspects of locomotion are recapitulated and easily controlled, and several experimental observations can now be explained mechanistically.

Besides linking cell types, structure and function, our approach provides a unifying framework for understanding motor activity across limbed and undulatory species.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

Our analyses reveal multiple rRNA sites that are differentially modified in a tissue- and/or developmental stage-specific manner, including previously unannotated modified sites. We demonstrate that rRNA modification patterns can be used for tissue and cell type identification, which we hereby term 'epitranscriptomic fingerprinting'.

PC states that the brain computes internal models of expected events and responds robustly to unexpected stimuli with prediction errors that feed forward. This can be studied using oddball tasks. A repetitive sequence interrupted by a novel stimulus is a ""local"" oddball. ""Global"" oddballs defy expectations while repeating the local context. This dissociates expectation-driven neuronal prediction error responses vs. merely stimulus-history-driven release from adaptation. We recorded neuron spiking activity across the visual hierarchy in mice and monkeys viewing these oddballs. Local oddball responses largely followed PC hypotheses. They were robust, emerged early in layers 2/3, and fed forward. Global oddball responses challenged PC. They were weak, absent in most visual areas, more robust in prefrontal cortex, and emerged in non-granular layers. Contrary to the most popular PC models that emphasize prediction error computations occurring in early sensory areas and feeding forward, this implies that genuine predictive coding computations take place in more cognitive, higher-order areas.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

How these GTPases are appropriately positioned at the opposite poles of a migrating cell is unknown. Here we leverage optogenetics, manipulation of cell mechanics, and mathematical modeling to reveal a surprising long-range mutual activation of the front and back polarity programs that complements their well-known local mutual inhibition. This long-range activation is rooted in two distinct modes of mechanochemical crosstalk. Local Rac-based protrusion stimulates Rho activation at the opposite side of the cell via membrane tension-based activation of mTORC2. Conversely, local Rho-based contraction induces cortical-flow-based remodeling of membrane-to-cortex interactions leading to PIP2 release, PIP3 generation, and Rac activation at the opposite side of the cell. We develop a minimal unifying mechanochemical model of the cell to explain how this long-range mechanical facilitation complements local biochemical inhibition to enable robust global Rho and Rac partitioning. Finally, we validate the importance of this long-range facilitation in the context of chemoattractant-based cell polarization and migration in primary human lymphocytes. Our findings demonstrate that the actin cortex and plasma membrane function as an integrated mechanochemical system for long-range partitioning of Rac and Rho during cell migration and likely other cellular contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

These diseases, if left untreated, can be lethal within hours. Hyperinvasive N. meningitidis strains often express a genomically encoded filamentous bacteriophage called MDA{Phi}, which promotes colonisation of mucosal host surfaces to facilitate invasion. How this phage is organised and how it promotes biofilm formation and infection at the molecular level is unclear. Here, we present an electron cryomicroscopy structure of the MDA phage, showing that MDA{Phi} is a class I filamentous inovirus, with the major capsid protein arranged within the phage as a highly curved and densely packed -helix. Comparison with other filamentous bacteriophages offers clues about inoviral genome encapsidation mechanisms, providing a framework for understanding the evolutionary diversity of inoviruses. A disordered, N-terminal segment in the major capsid protein presents hydrophobic patches on the surface of assembled phage particles, which, together with electron cryotomography data of phage bundles, furnishes a structural rationale for phage-phage interactions that were seen previously in an epithelium adhesion infection model of N. meningitidis. Taken together, our results shed light on the structure, organisation, and higher order assembly of a biomedically relevant phage encoded in the genome of a human pathogen. Molecular insights gleaned from this study increase our understanding of phage evolution, phage-mediated bacterial adhesion and pathogenicity.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

However, current transcriptomic profiling technologies result in destruction of the biological sample, preventing direct analysis of transcriptional dynamics in the same living cells over time. Here, we developed a synthetic RNA export system called cellular 'self-reporting' to address this fundamental technological limitation. We repurposed the murine leukemia virus retroviral protein Gag to enable diverse types of immortalized and primary mammalian cells to package cellular RNA molecules in virus-like particles (VLPs) for export into the extracellular environment. We applied self-reporting to interrogate the transcriptome-wide dynamics that occur during neuronal differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells and detected gene expression profiles from individual live cells. Leveraging this genetically encodable approach, we expanded the capabilities of self-reporting through molecular engineering of VLP components. Pseudotyping VLPs with epitope-tagged envelope proteins enabled multiplexed selective live-cell readout of transcriptional states from heterogeneous co-cultures. Furthermore, structure-guided protein engineering of Gag fusions with human RNA binding domains improved the mRNA representation in self-reporting readouts and enabled the directed export of libraries of synthetic barcode transcripts. Taken together, this work establishes self-reporting as a facile and broadly enabling technology for live-cell, transcriptome-scale profiling of dynamic processes across diverse cell types and biological applications.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

However, rationally creating enzymes with high activity comparable to most naturally occurring enzymes remains challenging. Here, we attempted to design an ATPase de novo, through the exploration of an optimal backbone blueprint to incorporate a conserved phosphate binding motif, the P-loop, into designed structures. The designed protein, based on the identified blueprint, was found to be a monomer with high thermal stability, and exhibited the ATPase ability. The crystal structure was closely matched to the design model, both at the overall structure level and within the P-loop motif. Interestingly, AlphaFold was not able to predict the designed structure accurately, indicating the difficulties of predicting folded structures for novel protein sequences. Remarkably, the designed protein exhibited ATPase ability even at temperatures around 100 {degrees}C, with significantly increased activity. However, the ATPase activity was still not comparable to those of naturally occurring enzymes. This suggests that the P-loop motif alone is insufficient to achieve the high ATPase activity seen in naturally occurring enzymes, indicating that other structural components are necessary to reach such activity levels.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

These phenotypes are heterogeneous, dependent on the cell type arrested and the insult inciting arrest. Because a universal biomarker for CS has yet to be identified, combinations of senescence-associated biomarkers linked to various biological stress responses including lysosomal activity ({beta}-galactosidase staining), inflammation (senescence-associated secretory phenotypes, SASPs), and apoptosis (senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways) are used to identify senescent cells. Using in vitro human bulk RNA-seq datasets, we find that senescent states enrich for various stress responses in a cell-type, temporal, and insult-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that various gene signatures used to identify senescent cells in the literature also enrich for stress responses, and are inadequate for universally and exclusively identifying senescent samples. Genes regulating stress responses - including transcription factors and genes controlling chromatin accessibility - are contextually differentially expressed, along with key enzymes involved in metabolism across arrest phenotypes. Additionally, significant numbers of SASP proteins can be predicted from senescent cell transcriptomes and also heterogeneously enrich for various stress responses in a context-dependent manner. We propose that 'senescence' cannot be meaningfully defined due to the lack of underlying preserved biology across senescent states, and CS is instead a mosaic of stress-induced phenotypes regulated by various factors, including metabolism, TFs, and chromatin accessibility. We introduce the concept of Stress Response Modules, clusters of genes modulating stress responses, and present a new model of CS and CQ induction conceptualised as the differential activation of these clusters.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

Here, we utilized acute depletion of NIPBL to characterize the role of cohesin-mediated loop extrusion in vivo. Using this approach, we found that many chromatin loops are rapidly diminished upon loss of NIBPL, consistent with recent single locus imaging studies showing that chromatin loops are transient. However, we also identified cohesin-dependent chromatin loops that are associated with distinct chromatin states and may be long-lived, given that they require NIPBL for their establishment upon mitotic exit, but are persistent when NIPBL is depleted from interphase cells. In addition to the reformation of 3D genome structures, mitotic exit coincides with widespread transcriptional activation. We found that NIPBL is essential for establishing the expression of lineage-defining genes during the M-G1 transition but has diminished impact on the steady-state maintenance of their expression. At genes sensitive to its depletion, NIPBL supports a unique local genome organization defined by greater spatial proximity to nearby super-enhancers and weaker transcription start site insulation of genomic contacts. Overall, we show that NIPBL-mediated loop extrusion is critical to genome organization and transcription regulation in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

Despite the essential nature of proprioceptive signaling in daily life, the mechanisms governing proprioceptor activity are poorly understood. Here, we have identified distinct and nonredundant roles for two voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs), NaV1.1 and NaV1.6, in mammalian proprioception. Deletion of NaV1.6 in somatosensory neurons (NaV1.6cKO mice) causes severe motor deficits accompanied by complete loss of proprioceptive transmission, which contrasts with our previous findings using similar mouse models to target NaV1.1 (NaV1.1cKO). In NaV1.6cKO animals, loss of proprioceptive feedback caused non-cell- autonomous impairments in proprioceptor end-organs and skeletal muscle that were absent in NaV1.1cKO mice. We attribute the differential contribution of NaV1.1 and NaV1.6 in proprioceptor function to distinct cellular localization patterns. Collectively, these data provide the first evidence that NaV subtypes uniquely shape neurotransmission within a somatosensory modality.

Despite inherent thermal instability of individual proteins at body temperature, collagen manages to assemble into higher-order structures that provide mechanical support to tissues. Sequence features that enhance collagen stability have been deduced largely from studies of collagen-mimetic peptides, as the large sizes of collagens have precluded high-resolution studies of their structure. Thus, there is a need for new methods to analyze the structure and mechanics of native collagen proteins. In this study, we used AFM imaging to investigate the temperature response of collagen types I, III and particularly IV. We observed a time-dependent loss of folded structures upon exposure to body temperature, with structural destabilization along the collagenous domain reflected by a shorter overall contour length. We characterized the sequence-dependent bending stiffness profile of collagen IV as a function of temperature and identified a putative initiation site for thermally induced unfolding. Interchain disulfide bonds in collagen IV were shown to enhance thermal stability and serve as the primary nucleation sites for in vitro refolding. In contrast to the canonical C-to-N terminal folding direction, we found an interchain cystine knot to enable folding in the opposite direction. Multiple sequence alignments revealed that this cystine knot is evolutionarily conserved across metazoan phyla, highlighting its significance in the stabilization of early collagen IV structures. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the unfolding and refolding pathway of collagen IV, providing valuable insight into how its heterogeneous sequence influences stability and mechanics.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

The most well-characterized electrophysiological signal elicited by a balance disturbance is the perturbation-evoked N1 potential that peaks 100-200 msec post-perturbation and is thought to reflect error processing. We previously found associations between the N1 and individual differences in balance ability, suggesting it may be a potential biomarker of balance health. However, a potential biomarker of balance function will be limited by its reliability and clinical feasibility, which has yet to be established. Here, we characterized the reliability of the N1 elicited by standing balance perturbations within and between sessions over a one-week interval in 10 younger and 14 older adults. A subset of older adults (n=12) completed a session approximately one year prior to the main experiment. We extracted N1 amplitude and latency from the Cz electrode using an advanced, computationally-intensive approach that relies on large amounts of data (e.g., 64 channels, many trials), Test-retest reliability was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Internal consistency was quantified by split-half reliability using the Spearman correlation coefficient. N1s varied across individuals (amplitude:12-82V, latency: 142-282ms), yet within individuals, the N1 showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC>0.9) across a one-week and one-year time span. N1 amplitude reached excellent internal reliability for each session and group (r>0.9), that generally plateaued within 6 trials, while more trials were needed to reliably measure N1 latency. Similar results were obtained when quantifying N1s using a minimal approach performed with only three electrodes and simple preprocessing. Overall, the N1 is stable within and across sessions, and is largely independent of approach suggesting it could be a clinically-feasible biomarker of balance function. Characterizing reliability in populations with neurologic dysfunction and in different environmental contexts will be necessary to enhance our understanding of the N1, optimize experimental design, and determine its predictive validity of clinical outcomes (e.g., falls risk).","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

However, selection of host communities across ecological gradients and co-evolutionary processes may influence both the distribution of phages and the susceptibility of individual hosts through virus interactions and local adaptation within distinct ecological niches. Metagenomic-based analyses have revealed that soil pH selects for distinct populations and community structures for both phage and hosts at local and global scales. However, whether contrasting soil pH represents a selective barrier for phages capable of infecting an individual host is unknown. To examine the influence of pH on individual host-virus interactions, two closely related Bacillus strains were isolated and characterized from pH 7.5 soil associated with a long-term contiguous pH gradient (pH 4.5 to 7.5). Phages infecting each strain were subsequently enriched from soils across the pH gradient (pH 4.5, 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5), enumerated using a plaque assay, and characterized via metagenomic analysis. Phages infecting each strain were cultivated from all soils but their community composition and abundance varied with pH. Phage populations infecting each of the two strains were distinct despite the close relatedness of the two hosts, indicating relatively narrow host ranges for each virus. These results suggest that while phage community structures vary substantially across an ecological gradient, soil pH alone does not represent a barrier for the distribution of phages capable of infecting an individual host.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

We provide compelling evidence that visual and non visual opsins coevolve in ray finned fishes, both in terms of copy numbers and selective pressures acting on their coding sequences, probably in response to the different photic environments they inhabit. Species that live in dim light or all in the dark (such as in caves or the deep sea) convergently reduced their visual and non visual opsin gene repertoires, while polar species feature accelerated evolution in both. Fishes that rely on electroreception show a reduction in the number of visual and non visual opsin genes and accelerated evolution of the remaining genes. We further found that genes of the phototransduction cascade coevolve with opsins. Finally, that non visual opsins are mainly expressed in testes and ovaries (next to the eyes) supports a function in gamete biology.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

Automated segmentation of brainstem arousal nuclei is an essential step toward elucidating the physiology of arousal in human consciousness and the pathophysiology of disorders of consciousness. We created a probabilistic atlas of brainstem arousal nuclei built on diffusion MRI scans of five ex vivo human brain specimens scanned at 750 m isotropic resolution. Labels of arousal nuclei used to generate the probabilistic atlas were manually annotated with reference to nucleus-specific immunostaining in two of the five brain specimens. We then developed a Bayesian segmentation algorithm that utilizes the probabilistic atlas as a generative model and automatically identifies brainstem arousal nuclei in a resolution- and contrast-agnostic manner. The segmentation method displayed high accuracy in both healthy and lesioned in vivo T1 MRI scans and high test-retest reliability across both T1 and T2 MRI contrasts. Finally, we show that the segmentation algorithm can detect volumetric changes and differences in magnetic susceptibility within brainstem arousal nuclei in Alzheimers disease and traumatic coma, respectively. We release the probabilistic atlas and Bayesian segmentation tool to advance the study of human consciousness and its disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1728166176237

Here, we report a simple, one-step method for rapid fabrication of molds using digital light processing (DLP)-based 3D printing that support the formation of EHTs by human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) with high reproducibility (>95% efficiency) and varied designs (e.g., length, aspect ratio). Compared to 2D iPSC-CMs, 3D EHTs display enhanced maturity, including increased expression of B-oxidation genes, higher concentrations of sarcomeric myosins, improved sarcomere density and alignment, and enrichment of cardiac pathways (e.g., upregulation of sodium channels, action potentials, contraction). The technology is applied to model pathological cardiac hypertrophy in vitro, using either (i) acute adrenergic agonism or (ii) chronic culture within stiff hydrogel molds. Treated EHTs exhibit increased levels of pathology-associated gene expression and activation of signaling cascades involved in pathological remodeling compared to untreated controls or treated 2D iPSC-CMs. Thus, our method results in robust yet simpler, cheaper, and faster EHTs to study cardiac disease.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

To interrogate this diversity, we micro-dissected developing human lungs along the proximal-distal axis during the late pseudoglandular stage and generated an integrated analysis of single-nucleus sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, creating a cellularly-resolved atlas of the lung. These rich datasets revealed positional niches and cellular heterogeneity along the proximal-distal axis, including the identification of a unique population of TP63+ basal cells, the primary stem cell of the airway, marked by expression of LGR5 and LGR6. Analysis of the LGR5+ basal cell niche and functional experiments with primary organoid models suggest a tonic level of WNT pathway activity in LGR5+ basal cells that is potentiated by mesenchyme-derived R-SPONDIN. We found that basal cell self-renewal is enhanced by WNT activity, suggesting that the WNT pathway plays a previously unappreciated but critical role in airway stem cell maintenance during human development. These results enhance our fundamental understanding of the positional and cellular heterogeneity in the developing human lungs and begin to reveal unique niches that maintain homeostasis throughout the lung.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

The capacity of a plasmid to express genes is constrained by two parameters: length and copy number. However, the interplay between these parameters and their constraints on plasmid evolution have remained elusive due to the absence of comprehensive quantitative analyses. To address this gap, we developed Probabilistic Iterative Read Assignment (PIRA), a new computational method that overcomes previous computational bottlenecks, enabling rapid and accurate determination of plasmid copy numbers at an unprecedented scale. Applying PIRA to all microbial genomes in the NCBI RefSeq database with linked short-read sequencing data in the Sequencing Read Archive (SRA), we analyzed 4,317 bacterial and archaeal genomes encompassing 11,338 plasmids, spanning the microbial tree of life. Our analysis reveals three scaling laws of plasmids: first, an inverse power-law correlation between plasmid copy number and plasmid length; second, a positive linear correlation between protein-coding genes and plasmid length; and third, a positive correlation between metabolic genes per plasmid and plasmid length, particularly for large plasmids. These scaling laws imply fundamental constraints on plasmid evolution and functional organization, indicating that as plasmids increase in length, they converge toward chromosomal characteristics in copy number and functional content. Our findings not only advance the understanding of plasmid dynamics but also have implications for microbial evolution, biotechnology, and the design of synthetic plasmids.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

We identify H3K27me3, deposited by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), as the modification with the strongest cell type-specific enrichment. Inhibition of PRC2 in human cortical organoids resulted in a shift of neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation towards differentiation. Cell type- specific profiling of H3K27me3 not only identified neuronal differentiation genes in the human neocortex, but also extra-cellular matrix (ECM) genes.

Forecasting epidemics requires a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving spore dispersal. Many studies have either employed field data for purely correlative approaches without incorporating established knowledge on physical mechanisms or, conversely, relied on specific physical approaches in controlled environments focusing on only a few mechanisms or factors. Little emphasis has been placed on holistic field-based studies, where wind and rain play crucial roles. This study fills that gap by attempting to unravel the processes by which rainfall affects airborne spore concentrations over a wheat canopy during active rust epidemics. Over more than two months, bi-hourly spore counts from Burkard traps were integrated with detailed meteorological data, revealing both seasonal and diurnal trends. Diurnal peaks in airborne spore concentrations, typically driven by cyclic changes in wind and humidity, were dramatically altered by rain. Rain events either amplified spore concentrations by up to 25-fold through 'rain-puff' and/or depletes them via 'wash-out' and 'wash-off'. Rains events from the dataset were classified into categories with distinct impacts: 'precursor' rains often trigger spore release, while 'follower' (and prolonged rains) reduce airborne spore concentrations. Moreover, differences in the dispersal dynamics of Pst and Pt were observed, and some were linked to how humidity and wind influence spore clustering. These results provide valuable insights for a more integrated understanding of the effect of rain and in order to enhance forecasting models.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

Objective: This SLR summarizes the evidence across studies among predominately adults that report an adjusted measure of association for the relationship between vaccination and PCC, by timing of vaccination relative to infection or PCC onset and across different study characteristics. Evidence review: A comprehensive search strategy was developed within the OVID platform across EMBASE, MEDLINE and Evidence Based Medicine reviews, and supplemented with WHO COVID library and Google Scholar searches, to collate evidence on vaccination and PCC published or posted as pre prints between January 1st, 2020 and July 18th, 2023. JBI Critical Appraisal Checklists were used to assess each study's risk of bias. Findings: This review included 97 studies and synthesized results from 56 studies with low risk of bias that reported adjusted measures for the association between vaccination and PCC. Overall, 77% of pre infection adjusted VE (aVE) estimates (vs. unvaccinated) were statistically significant (range: 7% to 95%), 80% of estimates reflecting a mix of those vaccinated before and after infection were statistically significant (range: 62% to 73%), one of five estimates reflecting vaccination after PCC onset was statistically significant (aVE=41%), 43% of post infection vaccination estimates were statistically significant (two were protective [range: 28% to 40%] and one was not [aVE= minus 47%]), and 46% of estimates not specifying vaccination timing were statistically significant (23 were protective [range: 29% to 75%] and one was not [aVE= minus 132%]). Statistically significant pre-infection aVE estimates were slightly higher for mRNA (range: 14% to 84%) than non mRNA vaccines (range: 16% to 38%) and aVE ranges during (4 studies; range: 10% to 70%) and before Omicron predominance (10 studies; range: 7% to 50%) overlapped. Pre-infection vaccination was protective regardless of vaccine type, number of doses received, PCC definition, predominant variant, and severity of acute infections included. Conclusions and Relevance: Collectively our findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination received prior to SARS CoV 2 infection reduces the subsequent risk of developing PCC regardless of the predominant variant circulating.","NA","medrxiv",1728166176237

We use computationally tractable, yet biologically realistic phenotypes in the form of RNA secondary structures, and model plasticity by considering the Boltzmann distribution of secondary structures for a given genotype. Using evolutionary simulations we show that phenotypes of high plasticity emerge in rapidly changing environments. These phenotypes have near-equal Boltzmann probabilities of two different target structures, which are the fittest structures in the two environments between which we alternate during the evolutionary process. Plasticity therefore provides an optimal evolutionary response to fluctuating environmental conditions. Additionally, we find that solutions of high plasticity are more likely to be found for target pairs of higher structural similarity and phenotypic frequency.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

With growing knowledge of the genetic basis for PAD and related risk factors, this study sought to construct a new polygenic score for PAD (GPSPAD). Methods: GPSPAD was constructed by integrating multi-ancestry summary statistics for PAD and related traits. GPSPAD was trained in a UK Biobank dataset of 96,239 individuals and validated in a holdout UK Biobank dataset (N=304,294) and All of Us (AoU; N=237,173) and Mass General Brigham Biobank (MGBB, N=37,017). Results: GPSPAD was associated with an OR-per SD increase of 1.64 in the UK Biobank dataset (95% CI 1.60-1.68). Compared to previously published PAD polygenic scores, GPSPAD was more strongly associated with PAD in AoU and MGBB, including enhanced transferability to non-European subgroups. GPSPAD improved discrimination of incident PAD ({Delta}C-statistic 0.030) that was nearly equivalent to the additive performances of diabetes ({Delta}C-statistic 0.029) and smoking ({Delta}C-statistic 0.034). GPSPAD was associated with reduced ankle-brachial index in the MGBB with the top 8% of individuals having a mean ABI <0.90 when assessed. Among individuals with prevalent PAD, GPSPAD consistently identified individuals at high MALE-risk in the UK Biobank (HR 1.48; 95% CI 1.24-1.77), MGBB, (HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.12-1.60), and AoU (HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.12-1.58). Conclusions: An integrated, multi-ancestry polygenic score for PAD predicts disease and adverse limb outcomes in three diverse cohorts. Incorporating polygenic risk into PAD care has the potential to guide screening and tailor management to prevent MALE.","NA","medrxiv",1728166176237

After these improvements, we succeeded in the sustainable regeneration of all 20 aaRSs for up to 20 cycles of 2.5-fold serial dilutions.

Existing clinical testing for BV is primarily based upon physical and microscopic examination of vaginal secretions, while more modern PCR-based clinical tests target panels of BV-associated microbes, such as the Labcorp NuSwab(R) test.

Remnant clinician-collected NuSwab(R) vaginal swabs underwent DNA extraction and 16S V3-V4 rRNA gene sequencing to profile microbes in addition to those included in the Labcorp NuSwab(R) test. Community State Types (CSTs) were determined using the most abundant taxon detected in each sample. PCR results for NuSwab(R) panel microbial targets were compared against the corresponding microbiome profiles. Metabolic pathway abundances were characterized via metagenomic prediction from amplicon sequence variants (ASVs).

Sequencing of 75 remnant vaginal swabs yielded 492 unique 16S V3-V4 ASVs, identifying 83 unique genera. NuSwab(R) assay microbe quantification was strongly concordant with quantification by sequencing (p << 0.01). Samples in CST-I (18 of 18, 100%), CST-II (3 of 3, 100%), CST-III (15 of 17, 88%), and CST-V (1 of 1, 100%) were largely categorized as BV-negative via the NuSwab(R) panel, while most CST-IV samples (28 of 36, 78%) were BV-positive or BV-indeterminate. BV-associated microbial and predicted metabolic signatures were shared across multiple CSTs.

These findings show that 16S V3-V4 rRNA gene sequencing robustly reproduces PCR-based BV diagnostic testing results, accurately discriminates vaginal microbiome CSTs dominated by distinct Lactobacilli, and further elucidates BV-associated bacterial and metabolic signatures.

ImportanceBacterial vaginosis (BV) poses a significant health burden for women during reproductive years and onward. Current BV diagnostics rely on either physical and microscopic evaluations by technicians or panels of select microbes. Here, we sequenced the microbiome profiles of samples previously diagnosed by the Labcorp NuSwab(R) test to better understand disruptions to the vaginal microbiome during BV. We show that microbial sequencing can reproduce targeted panel diagnostic results, while also broadly characterizing healthy and BV-associated microbial and metabolic biomarkers. This work highlights a robust, agnostic BV classification scheme with potential for future development of sequencing-based BV diagnostic tools.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

To improve accuracy, we integrate phylogenetic signals, leveraging the evolutionary relationships among species to refine trait predictions. We present Phydon, which combines codon statistics and phylogenetic information to enhance the precision of maximum growth rate estimates, especially when a close relative with a known growth rate is available. We construct the largest and most taxonomically broad database of temperature-corrected growth rate estimates for 111,349 microbial species. The results reveal a bimodal distribution of maximum growth rates, resolving distinct groups of fast and slow growers. Our hybrid approach advances the accuracy of genome-based growth rate predictions and presents a new framework for accurate genome-based trait prediction.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

However, the methylation state of a genomic region can also be characterized by a mixture of patterns (epialleles) with variable frequencies, and the relative proportions of such patterns can provide insights into its mechanisms of formation. Traditional methods based on bisulfite conversion and NGS, due to the read size (150 bp), allow epiallele frequency analysis only in high-CpG-density regions, limiting differential methylation studies to just 50% of the human methylome. Nanopore sequencing, with its long reads, enables the analysis of epiallele frequency across both high- and low-CpG-density regions. We introduce a novel computational approach, PoreMeth2, an R library that integrates epiallelic diversity and methylation frequency changes from Nanopore data to identify DMRs, assess their formation mechanisms, and annotate them to genic and regulatory elements. We applied PoreMeth2 to cancer and glial cell datasets, demonstrating its ability to distinguish epigenomic changes with a strong effect on gene expression from those with a weaker impact on transcriptional activity.

However, it has so far often proven difficult to accurately measure phase diagrams. Here, we report a method that is based on mass and volume conservation and defined reaction volumes, which we call inPhase.

To address this gap, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study using a think-aloud paradigm, where participants verbalize their uninterrupted stream of thoughts during rest. We found that transitions between thoughts, particularly those involving significant shifts in semantic content, activate the brain's default and control networks. These neural responses to internally generated thought boundaries produce activation patterns resembling those triggered by external event boundaries. Moreover, interactions within and between these networks shape the overall semantic structure of thought trajectories: stronger functional connectivity within the medial temporal subsystem of the default network predicts greater variability in thoughts, while stronger connectivity between the control and core default networks is associated with reduced variability. Together, our findings highlight how the default and control networks guide the dynamic transitions and structure of naturally arising memory and future thinking.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

We aim to predict the circumstances in which pLMs can successfully perform zero-shot fitness estimation. Our work studies trends observed over hundreds of deep mutational scans across multiple different fitness objectives. We find that the likelihood, or abstractly, implicit preference of a certain protein sequence imbued during pretraining is predictive of fitness prediction capabilities. Both over-preferred and under-preferred wild type sequences harm performance. Using influence functions to causally understand how individual data points increase protein likelihoods, we find that there exists a power law tail due to sequence homology. Lastly, under-performance on low likelihood wild type proteins can be remedied by unsupervised finetuning. These findings that pLM zero-shot fitness estimation can be predicted by the likelihood of the engineered sequence can motivate and improve pLMs' deployment in protein maturation campaigns.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

Among many severe symptoms, refractory epileptic events are a common neurological presentation of MD. However, the neuronal substrates and circuits for MD-induced epilepsy remain unclear. Here, using mouse models of mitochondrial epilepsy that lack mitochondrial complex I subunit NDUFS4 in a constitutive or conditional manner, we demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction leads to a reduction in the number of GABAergic neurons in the rostral external globus pallidus (GPe) and identify a specific affectation of pallidal Lhx6-expressing inhibitory neurons. Our findings further reveal that viral vector-mediated Ndufs4 re-expression in the GPe effectively prevents seizures and improves the survival in the models. Additionally, we highlight the subthalamic nucleus (STN) as a critical structure in the neural circuit involved in mitochondrial epilepsy, as its inhibition effectively reduces epileptic events. Thus, we have identified a novel role for pallido-subthalamic projections in the development of epilepsy in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results suggest STN inhibition as a potential therapeutic intervention for refractory epilepsy in patients with MD providing new leads in the quest to identify novel and effective treatments.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

Canopy architecture is determined by several component traits, including leaf length, width, number, angle, and phyllotaxy. Phyllotaxy may be among the most difficult of the leaf canopy traits to measure accurately across large numbers of individual plants. As a result, in simulations of the leaf canopies of grain crops such as maize and sorghum, this trait is frequently approximated as alternating 180{degrees} angles between sequential leaves. We explore the feasibility of extracting direct measurements of the phyllotaxy of sequential leaves from 3D reconstructions of individual sorghum plants generated from 2D calibrated images and test the assumption of consistently alternating phyllotaxy across a diverse set of sorghum genotypes. Using a voxel-carving-based approach, we generate 3D reconstructions from multiple calibrated 2D images of 366 sorghum plants representing 236 sorghum genotypes from the sorghum association panel. The correlation between automated and manual measurements of phyllotaxy is only modestly lower than the correlation between manual measurements of phyllotaxy generated by two different individuals. Automated phyllotaxy measurements exhibited a repeatability of R2 = 0.41 across imaging timepoints separated by a period of two days. A resampling based genome wide association study (GWAS) identified several putative genetic associations with lower-canopy phyllotaxy in sorghum. This study demonstrates the potential of 3D reconstruction to enable both quantitative genetic investigation and breeding for phyllotaxy in sorghum and other grain crops with similar plant architectures.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

The latter component works by reducing the number of bits used to encode signal data.

Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (NRF2) is a critical redox rheostat that regulates oxidative stress responses, and its deletion is known to accelerate muscle atrophy and weakness during aging (sarcopenia) or denervation. Conversely, pharmacologic activation of NRF2 extends mouse lifespan and attenuates sarcopenia. Similarly, deletion of Kelch-like ECH-associated Protein 1 (Keap1), negative regulator of NRF2, enhances exercise capacity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether muscle-specific Keap1 deletion is sufficient to prevent muscle atrophy and weakness in mice following 7-days of hindlimb unloading (HU). To test this hypothesis, control (Ctrl) and tamoxifen inducible, muscle-specific Keap1 knockout (mKO) mice were subjected to either normal housing (Sham) or HU for 7 days. Activation of NRF2 in muscle was confirmed by increased mRNA of NRF2 targets thioredoxin 1 (Txn1) and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) in mKO mice. Keap1 deletion had an effect to increase force-generating capacity at baseline. However, muscle masses, cross sectional area, and ex vivo force were not different between mKO and Ctrl HU mice. In addition, muscle 4-hydroxynonenal-modified proteins and protein carbonyls were unaffected by Keap1 deletion. These data suggest NRF2 activation improves muscle force production during ambulatory conditions but is not sufficient prevent muscle atrophy or weakness following 7-days of HU.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

The TAC is crucial for mitochondrial genome segregation during cytokinesis.

Although contact sites between mitochondrial membranes are common and serve various functions, their molecular architecture remains largely unknown. This study elucidates the interaction interface of the TAC60-p166 contact site. Using in silico, in vitro, and mutational in vivo analyses, we identified minimal binding segments between TAC60 and p166. The p166 binding site in TAC60 consists of a short kinked -helix that interacts with the C-terminal -helix of p166. Despite the presence of conserved charged residues in either protein, electrostatic interactions are not necessary for contact site formation. Instead, the TAC60-p166 interaction is driven by the hydrophobic effect, as converting conserved hydrophobic residues in either protein to hydrophilic amino acids disrupts the contact site.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

Methods: The haemagglutination test (HAT) was carried out to determine the presence of antibodies against the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants XBB.1.5 and BA.2.75 and the RBD of the Sabecoviruses RaTG13, WIV1, Khosta-2 and SARS-CoV-1, in individuals aged 5 to 80 years of age in years 2020 (n=381), 2022 (n=432) and 2023 (n=382). Results: The highest positivity rates for BA.2.75, RaTG13, WIV1, Khosta-2 and SARS-CoV-1 were seen in 2022, with positivity rates significantly declining to many of the viruses except XBB.1.5 and Khosta-2 by 2023.

Prolonged periods of low oxygen and high organic matter input have been put forward to cause an imbalanced microbial methane cycle, as methane oxidation cannot keep up with methane production. However, it is still unclear what factors affect each process and which microorganisms are responsible. Here we show that methanogenic processes dominate microbial methane cycling in the anoxic sediments of marine Lake Grevelingen (NL) after summer stratification with bottom water anoxia. We observed a shallow and narrow sulfate-methane transition zone between 5 and 15 cm depth, with high methane concentrations (> 5 mM) below this zone. Methanogenesis was dominant over methanotrophy in all investigated layers as active methanogenesis potential was detected down to 60 cm below sea floor, but methane oxidation was only observed in a narrow section of the sulfate-methane transition zone. Based on amplicon sequencing and sediment incubations, we uncovered a metabolically and phylogenetically diverse methanogenic community with distinct niche separation in different sediment layers. ANME archaea and their putative syntrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria were restricted to a narrow zone and were co-occurring with the detected methane oxidation activity. Our results suggest that eutrophication and deoxygenation will further contribute to rising methane emissions in coastal areas, as the microbial methane cycle will be tilted towards increased methanogenesis while the efficiency of the microbial methane filter is expected to decline.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

The medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) gives rise to two major cortical interneuron (cIN) populations, marked by Somatostatin (Sst) and Parvalbumin (Pvalb), which develop on different timelines. The extent to which external signals influence these identities remains poorly understood. Pvalb-positive cINs are particularly important for regulating cortical circuits through strong perisomatic inhibition, yet they have been difficult to model in vitro. Here we investigated the role of the environment in shaping and maintaining Pvalb cINs. We grafted mouse MGE progenitors into a variety of 2D and 3D co-culture models, including mouse and human cortical, MGE, and thalamic systems with dissociated cells, organoids, organotypic cultures, and conditioned media. Across models, we observed distinct proportions of Sst- and Pvalb-positive cIN descendants. Strikingly, grafting MGE progenitors into 3D human, but not mouse, corticogenesis models led to efficient, non-autonomous differentiation of Pvalb-positive cINs. This differentiation was characterized by upregulation of Pvalb maturation markers, downregulation of Sst-specific markers, and the formation of perineuronal nets.

Here, we used proteomics to confirm the prediction that certain Archaea consistently incorporate pyrrolysine at TAG codons, supporting a new archaeal genetic code which we designate Genetic Code 34. This genetic code has 62 sense codons encoding 21 amino acids, and only two stop codons. In contrast with monophyletic genetic code distributions in bacteria, Code 34 occurs sporadically. This, combined with evidence for lateral gene transfer of the code change machinery and anticipated barriers to code reversal, suggests Code 34 arose independently in multiple lineages. TAG codon distribution patterns in Code 34 genomes imply a wide range in time since code switch. We identified many new enzymes containing Pyl residues, raising questions about potential roles of this amino acid in protein structure and function.

However, the phylogenetic resolution of its sister lineage remains unclear, obscuring whether contrasts in histories of diversification provide insights into the factors that gave rise to this clade's diversity. Using 887 ultraconserved element loci and Sanger-sequenced nuclear genes, we resolve the phylogenetic relationships of the three closest relatives of Percomorpha-the roughies, flashlightfishes, porcupinefishes and fangtooths (Trachichthyiformes), the squirrelfishes and soldierfishes (Holocentridae), and the whalefishes, bigscales, and alfonsinos (Berycoidei)-and the placement of percomorphs among them.

Our findings show that multiple clades in Trachichthyiformes and Berycoidei independently colonized deep ocean habitats during the climatically unstable Eocene and Oligocene and shallow-water reefs during the extensive hotspot migration and faunal turnover of the Early Miocene.

We utilise a systematic chimaera approach to define the differential functionality of two closely related Medicago truncatula SCAR proteins in plant development.

Despite being observed for the first time twenty years ago, their structure and how they are assembled remains unknown. Here, we reconstituted in vitro the ESCRT-0 clathrin assembly onto various types of membranes. The ESCRT-0 protein HRS, a known clathrin adaptor on endosomes, was found to form protein condensates. These condensates spread into a thin layer on PI(3)P-rich membranes. Platinum replica electron microscopy revealed that, surprisingly, the assembly of clathrin was different depending on the HRS phase. Protein droplets recruited clathrin as a dense, curved lattice, with many cage-like structures. On two-dimensional condensates, HRS recruited clathrin as a dense flat assembly. Two-dimensional HRS-clathrin condensates promoted the clustering of cholesterol in the underlying membrane, while cholesterol enhanced PI(3)P- dependent HRS recruitment on the membrane. On free-standing membranes, two-dimensional HRS-clathrin condensates promoted membrane flattening. Overall, these results show that a two- dimensional HRS condensate creates a unique membrane structure for sorting cargo molecules, defining a new mechanism in membrane trafficking processes.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

To successfully infect, colonize and complete their life cycle, plant pathogens are under constant selective pressures imposed by hosts, leading to genetic adaptation and possibly lineage radiation or speciation. Population and comparative genomics approaches are powerful tools to identify signatures of selection associated with host specialization in pathogen genomes and further allow recapturing population histories. Implementing such approaches, we identified evolutionary signatures of divergent host specialisation in distinct lineages of the fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici, a major disease causing-agent of wheat. Unique collections of Z. tritici were isolated from wild (Aegilops spp.) and domesticated (Triticum aestivum) host grasses in the Middle East and whole-genome sequencing was performed in a selected subset of isolates from each collection. We observed distinct population structure between the two host-diverging pathogens and identified particular genomic features in the Aegilops-infecting isolates that may have shaped their evolutionary history. Phylogenomic analyses revealed that A. cylindrica and A. tauchii -infecting populations of Z. tritici form separate clusters, possibly reflecting incipient speciation driven by divergent host specialization. Using infection experiments, we confirm that Z. tritici isolates collected from Aegilops spp. only infect their respective host species and not T. aestivum. Population genomics analyses and demographic inference furthermore allowed us to detect signatures of recent selection and show that divergence of the wheat-infecting lineage likely coincided with wheat domestication. At last, we confirm a virulence-related role for one candidate effector located in a selective sweep region of the A. cylindrica-infecting pathogen. Taken together, our findings highlight the interplay between agricultural and wild hosts on the evolution of fungal plant pathogens and illustrate host specialization as a possible route of rapid pathogen emergence.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

Both rhythmic and broadband processes contribute to the neural power spectrum, which decomposes the variance of a neural recording across frequencies. Although an extensive body of literature has successfully studied rhythms in various diseases and brain states, researchers only recently have systematically studied the characteristics of broadband effects in the power spectrum. Broadband effects can generally be categorized as 1) shifts in power across all frequencies, which correlate with changes in local firing rates and 2) changes in the overall shape of the power spectrum, such as the spectral slope or power law exponent. Shape changes are evident in various conditions and brain states, influenced by factors such as excitation to inhibition balance, age, and various diseases. It is increasingly recognized that broadband and rhythmic effects can interact on a sub-second timescale. For example, broadband power is time-locked to the phase of <1 Hz rhythms in propofol induced unconsciousness. Modeling tools that explicitly deal with both rhythmic and broadband contributors to the power spectrum and that capture their interactions are essential to help improve the interpretability of power spectral effects. Here, we introduce a tractable stochastic forward modeling framework designed to capture both narrowband and broadband spectral effects when prior knowledge or theory about the primary biophysical processes involved is available. Population-level neural recordings are modeled as the sum of filtered point processes (FPPs), each representing the contribution of a different biophysical process such as action potentials or postsynaptic potentials of different types. Our approach builds on prior neuroscience FPP work by allowing multiple interacting processes and time-varying firing rates and by deriving theoretical power spectra and cross-spectra. We demonstrate several properties of the models, including that they divide the power spectrum into frequency ranges dominated by rhythmic and broadband effects, and that they can capture spectral effects across multiple timescales, including sub-second cross-frequency coupling. The framework can be used to interpret empirically observed power spectra and cross-frequency coupling effects in biophysical terms, which bridges the gap between theoretical models and experimental results.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

These findings reveal a fundamental trade-off between broad PAM recognition and genome editing effectiveness.

We discovered lysosomes clogged with both Tau and phosphorylated Tau, stalled lysosome motility, disrupted molecular motors, enhanced autophagic flux, and slowed cargo degradation in mutant Tau neurons. Treatment of mutant Tau neurons with a small molecule autophagy enhancer drug increases autophagic flux and cargo degradation, reduces phospho-Tau levels, and reduces Tau accumulation in lysosomes without restoring defects in lysosomal motility.

However, they are threatened by climate change and even face the risk of local or global extinction. The responses of these species to climate change have received little attention. In this study, we examine the effects of climate change on state flowers and insects in the United States by employing correlative species distribution models (SDMs). We select a variety of commonly used SDM algorithms to construct an ensemble forecasting framework aimed at predicting the potential habitats for each species under both historical and future climate scenarios, and how these changes might influence the distributions of state flower and insect species. Our results show that more than half of the state flowers ([~] 66%) and insects ([~] 51%) are predicted to experience a substantial decrease in regions with favorable climates within the states they represent. Conversely, only a small number (Flowers: [~] 2%; Insects: [~] 10%) are projected to see an increase in habitat suitability in the future. Certain states may no longer possess suitable habitats for their state-designated species. Our findings indicate that cultural heritage might be at risk due to reduced habitat suitability and local extinctions driven by climate change. These findings can provide guidance regarding the protection or replacement of state species to preserve cultural heritage.

Significance StatementWe have known for decades that climate change may lead to species local or global extinction. However, the vast majority of such research has focused on species of ecological or economic importance. Only recently have researchers begun to seriously consider the impacts of climate change on our cultural heritage, and that research has mainly focused on tangible cultural assests such as buildings and anthropological sites. Here, we consider the impacts of climate change on species of cultural significance, namely U.S. state flowers and insects. We find that the majority of these species are threatened with local extinction from climate change, and the loss of these species will take with them important aspects of our history and culture.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

In 2021, Jesse Bloom reported on the recovery of a dataset of raw sequencing reads that had been removed from the NCBI SRA database at the request of the data generators, a scientific team at Wuhan University (Wang et al., 2020b). Bloom concluded that the data deletion had obfuscated the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and suggested that deletion may have been requested to comply with a government order; further, he questioned reported sample collection dates on and after January 30, 2020. Here, we show that sample collection dates were published in 2020 by Wang et al. together with the sequencing reads, and match the dates given by the authors in 2021. Collection dates of January 30, 2020 were manually removed by Bloom during his analysis of the data. We examine mutations in these sequences and confirm that they are entirely consistent with the previously known genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 of late January 2020. Finally, we explain how an apparent phylogenetic rooting paradox described by Bloom was resolved by subsequent analysis. Our reanalysis demonstrates that there was no basis to question the sample collection dates published by Wang et al..

While epigenetic aging clocks have shown accuracy in predicting biological age, they typically provide single estimates for the samples and lack mechanistic insights. In this study, we challenge the paradigm that aging can be sufficiently described with a single biological age estimate. We describe Ageome, a computational framework for measuring the epigenetic age of thousands of molecular pathways simultaneously in mice and humans. Ageome is based on the premise that an organisms overall biological age can be approximated by the collective ages of its functional modules, which may age at different rates and have different biological ages. We show that, unlike conventional clocks, Ageome provides a high-dimensional representation of biological aging across cellular functions, enabling comprehensive assessment of aging dynamics within an individual, in a population, and across species. Application of Ageome to longevity intervention models revealed distinct patterns of pathway-specific age deceleration. Notably, cell reprogramming, while rejuvenating cells, also accelerated aging of some functional modules. When applied to human cohorts, Ageome demonstrated heterogeneity in predictive power for mortality risk, and some modules showed better performance in predicting the onset of age-related diseases, especially cancer, compared to existing clocks. Together, the Ageome framework offers a comprehensive and interpretable approach for assessing aging, providing insights into mechanisms and targets for intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar.

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis.

In the first six months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9% (95% CI: 94.0-97.1) and 34.1% (95% CI: -46.4-76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

ConclusionA strong healthy vaccinee effect was observed in the first six months following vaccination. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations.","NA","medrxiv",1728166176237

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

To explore it, we analyzed deep proteomic and transcriptomic data from over 1,000 human samples, including 6 cancer types and 26 healthy human tissues. This global analysis identified 60,024 high confidence substitutions corresponding to 8,801 unique sites in proteins derived from 1,990 genes. Some substitutions are shared across samples, while others exhibit strong tissue-type and cancer specificity. Surprisingly, products of alternate translation are more abundant than their canonical counterparts for hundreds of proteins, suggesting sense codon recoding. Recoded proteins include transcription factors, proteases, signaling proteins, and proteins associated with neurodegeneration. Mechanisms contributing to substitution abundance include protein stability, codon frequency, codon-anticodon mismatches, and RNA modifications. We characterize sequence motifs around alternatively translated amino acids and how substitution ratios vary across protein domains, tissue types and cancers. The substitution ratios are positively associated with intrinsically disordered regions and genetic polymorphisms in gnomAD, though the polymorphisms cannot account for the substitutions. Both the sequence and the tissue-specificity of alternatively translated proteins are conserved between human and mouse. These results demonstrate the contribution of alternate translation to diversifying mammalian proteomes, and its association with protein stability, tissue-specific proteomes, and diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states.

Attention can also be seen as a solution to the binding problem: concurrent attention to all parts of an entity allows separating it from the rest. However, the rich models of attention in computational neuroscience are generally not scaled to real-world problems and there are thus many behavioral and neural phenomena that current models cannot explain. Here, we propose a bidirectional recurrent model of attention that is inspired by modern neural networks for image segmentation. It conceptualizes recurrent connections as a multi-stage internal gating process where bottom-up connections transmit features, while top-down and lateral connections transmit attentional gating signals. Our model can recognize and segment simple stimuli such as digits as well as objects in natural images and is able to be prompted with object labels, attributes or locations. It can learn to perform a range of behavioral findings, such as object binding, selective attention, inhibition of return, and visual search. It also replicates a variety of neural findings, including increased activity for attended objects, features, and locations, attention-invariant tuning, and relatively late onset attention. Most importantly, our proposed model unifies decades of cognitive and neurophysiological findings of visual attention into a single principled architecture. Our results highlight that the ability to selectively and dynamically focus on specific parts of stimulus streams can help artificial neural networks to better generalize and align with human brains.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

While several software tools are available for this task, ranging from Python and R libraries to standalone graphical user interfaces, there is lack of a tool that offers fast, automated usage and the production of publication-ready vector images.

Here we present LoVis4u, a command-line tool and Python API designed for highly customizable and fast visualisation of multiple genomic loci. LoVis4u generates vector images in PDF format based on annotation data from GenBank or GFF files. It is capable of visualising entire genomes of bacteriophages as well as plasmids and user-defined regions of longer prokaryotic genomes. Additionally, LoVis4u offers optional data processing steps to identify and highlight accessory and core genes in input sequences.

Availability and ImplementationLoVis4u is implemented in Python3 and runs on Linux and MacOS. The command-line interface covers most practical use cases, while the provided Python API allows usage within a Python program, integration into external tools, and additional customisation.

Active modifications to the spatial environment could thus be a potent tool to mitigate epidemic risk. We tested whether Lasius niger ants modify their nest architecture in response to pathogens by introducing controlor pathogen-treated individuals into nest-digging groups, and monitoring three-dimensional nest morphogenesis over time. Pathogen exposure led to an array of architectural changes including faster nest growth, increased spacing between entrances, transmission-inhibitory changes in overall nest network topology, and reduced chamber centrality. Simulations confirmed that these changes reduced disease spread. These results provide evidence for architectural immunity in a social animal and offer insights into how spatial organisation can be leveraged to decrease epidemic susceptibility.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

However, these dances have attracted little scientific attention and their structure and meaning remain largely obscure. Here we analyse close-range video recordings of captive crested gibbons, extracting descriptions of dance in four Nomascus species (N. annamensis, N. gabriellae, N. leucogenys, and N. siki). Additionally, we report results from a survey amongst relevant professionals clarifying behavioural contexts of dance in captive and wild crested gibbons. Our results demonstrate that dances in Nomascus represent a common and intentional form of visual communication restricted to sexually mature females. While primarily used as a proceptive signal to solicit copulation, dances occur in a wide range of contexts related to arousal and/or frustration in captivity. A linguistically informed view of this sequential behaviour demonstrates that dances follow a grouping organisation and isochronous rhythm - patterns not described for visual displays in other non-human primates. We argue that applying the concept of dance to gibbons allows us to expand our understanding of the communicative behaviours of non-human apes and develop hypotheses on the rules and regularities characterizing this behaviour. We propose that gibbons dances likely evolved from less elaborate rhythmic proceptive signals, similar to those found in siamangs. Although dance displays in humans and crested gibbons share a number of key characteristics, they cannot be assumed to be homologous. Nevertheless, gibbon dances represent a model behaviour whose investigation could be extended to the study of complex gestural signals in hominoid primates.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

This degeneracy impacts the efficiency of heterologous protein production due to the codon usage preferences of each organism. The process of tailoring organism-specific synonymous codons, known as codon optimization, must respect local sequence patterns that go beyond global codon preferences. As a result, the search space faces a combinatorial explosion that makes exhaustive exploration impossible. Nevertheless, throughout the diverse life on Earth, natural selection has already optimized the sequences, thereby providing a rich source of data allowing machine learning algorithms to explore the underlying rules. Here, we introduce CodonTransformer, a multispecies deep learning model trained on over 1 million DNA-protein pairs from 164 organisms spanning all kingdoms of life. The model demonstrates context-awareness thanks to the attention mechanism and bidirectionality of the Transformers we used, and to a novel sequence representation that combines organism, amino acid, and codon encodings. CodonTransformer generates host-specific DNA sequences with natural-like codon distribution profiles and with negative cis-regulatory elements. This work introduces a novel strategy of Shared Token Representation and Encoding with Aligned Multi-masking (STREAM) and provides a state-of-the-art codon optimization framework with a customizable open-access model and a user-friendly interface.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1728166176237

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

Yet, no efficient mechanisms for their removal have been identified. Here we report bioaccumulation of PFAS by several gut bacterial species over a wide range of concentrations from nanomolar up to 500 M. For bioaccumulating Bacteroides uniformis, a highly prevalent species, we estimate intracellular PFAS concentration in the mM range - above that of most native metabolites. Despite this high bioaccumulation, B. uniformis cells could grow appreciably up to 250 M perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure. Escherichia coli, which accumulated PFAS to a much lesser extent, substantially increased PFAS bioaccumulation when lacking TolC efflux pump indicating trans-membrane transport in PFAS bioaccumulation. Electron microscopy and cryogenic Focused Ion Beam-Secondary Ion Mass-spectrometry revealed distinct morphological changes and intracellular localisation of PFNA aggregates. Bioaccumulation of PFAS and transmembrane transport is also evident in proteomics, metabolomics, thermal proteome profiling, and mutations following adaptive laboratory evolution. In an in vivo context, mice colonized with human gut bacteria showed, compared to germ-free controls or those colonized with low-bioaccumulating bacteria, higher PFNA levels in excreted feces.

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

Mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction is associated with lack of physical activity and considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs) aflicting our societies such as T2D, CVD, metabolic syndrome, and even AD.

To our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies on the metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular characteristics of ""healthy sedentary"" individuals living without clinical symptoms. Hence, the main aim of our study herein was to characterize multiple metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular bioenergetic signatures in ""healthy sedentary"" individuals which could already be downregulated compared to moderately active individuals.

Nineteen subjects, 9 sedentary (SED) and 10 moderately active (AC) volunteered for multiple assessments including muscle biopsies, in order to assess muscle metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics both at rest and during exercise.

For our exercise studies, we performed graded exercise testing (GXT) to assess carbohydrate and fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity according to our previously developed methodology.

Resting studies showed decreased mitochondrial respiration including decreases in complex I (-36%) and II (-28%) as well as total electron system capacity (-34%) and electron system capacity coupled to ATP production via ATP synthase (-30%). Regarding muscle carbohydrate metabolism, SED individuals showed a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation (-37%) as well as reduced expression (-49%) of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Regarding fatty acid metabolism, SED showed decreased activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1)(-51%) and CPT2 (-44%) as well as decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (-35%). Metabolomics analysis also confirmed downregulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) identified distinct metabolic phenotypes through intermediates of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Further, we found significant differences in cardiolipin (CL) species expression between SED and AC groups, which, due to the important role of CL in mitochondrial structure, function, biogenesis and bioenergetics, deserves further attention.

Exercise studies also showed significant differences in substrate utilization between groups where SED possessed a significantly lower fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity. The correlation of different bioenergetic parameters between resting and exercise conditions were robust, suggesting the possibility of performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as a non-invasive methodology to indirectly assess metabolic function in multiple populations. In summary, in our study herein, we show that ""healthy sedentary"" individuals already possess a significant decrease in cellular metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics compared to moderately active individuals both during resting and exercising conditions.

Since large numbers of sedentary individuals evolve to develop cardiometabolic disease, a better understanding of decreased cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial function is needed in order to improve both diagnosis and treatment of multiple metabolic diseases.

- Despite similar GLUT-4 concentrations, sedentary individuals show significant decreased pyruvate oxidation as well as expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC).
- During exercise studies, sedentary individuals show significantly decreased levels of fat oxidation and lactate clearance capacity which correlate with mitochondrial and bioenergetics parameters from resting muscle biopsies. Hence, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) accompanied by measuring blood lactate levels could be a practical manner to assess muscle mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in a non-invasive and ambulatory manner.
- Identifying early signatures of decreased mitochondrial function and bioenergetics capacity could be an important approach to prevent or improve different metabolic diseases through lifestyle changes mainly from exercise and nutrition.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237

We investigated whether a diverse refugee committee could utilize participatory methods to identify health priorities and a research agenda to address them.

MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study with focus groups of current and former refugees, asylum claimants and evacuees from a specialized refugee clinic over a year. We collected sociodemographic data using standardized instruments, then utilized a four-step nominal group technique process (idea generation, recording, discussion, and voting) to identify and rank participants health and research priorities. Participants ranked their top five priorities across three time periods: Pre-migration/early arrival (0-3 months), post-migration (3 months-2 years), and long-term health (>2 years). Participants created overarching priorities and corroborated findings via a member checking step.

FindingsTwenty-three participants (median age 35 years) attended one or more of five focus groups. Twenty-one completed sociodemographic surveys: 16/21 (76%) were women, representing 8 countries of origin. Participants identified ""more family physicians"" and ""improving health system navigation"" (11/60 votes each) as top health and research priorities respectively across all resettlement periods. Participants also prioritized pre-departure healthcare system orientation and improved post-arrival and long-term mental health services. Twelve participants completed the member checking process, affirming the results with minor clarifications.

InterpretationThis proof-of-concept study illustrates how refugees can use a rigorous consensus process without external influence to prioritize their healthcare needs, direct a health research agenda to address those needs, and co-produce research. These low-cost participatory methods should be replicated elsewhere.

This process is orchestrated by selective autophagy receptors (SARs) that direct specific cargo for degradation. While significant strides have been made in understanding the molecular framework of selective autophagy, the diversity of SAR repertoires across species remain largely unexplored. Through a comparative interactome analysis across five model organisms, we identified a suite of conserved and lineage-specific SAR candidates. Among these, we validated CESAR as a conserved SAR critical for proteostasis under heat stress. CESAR specifically facilitates the degradation of hydrophobic, ubiquitinated protein aggregates and is indispensable for heat stress tolerance. Our study offers a rich resource for SAR discovery and positions CESAR as a pivotal regulator of proteostasis, with broad implications for improving stress resilience in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1728166176237
