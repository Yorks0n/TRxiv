We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1718143602572

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1) and KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We have recently reported the virological features of KP.2. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. We then performed virological and immunological experiments with pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

However, the specific contributions of the gastric-brain coupling to affective symptoms remain poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between this novel interoceptive axis and mental health symptoms in 243 participants, using a cross validated machine learning approach. We find that frontal parietal brain coupling to the gastric rhythm indexes a dimensional signature of mental health spanning anxiety, depression, stress, and well-being. Control analyses confirm the specificity of these interactions to the gastric-brain axis. Our study establishes coupling between the stomach and brain as a factor in the pathology of mental health, and offers new targets for interventions remediating aberrant brain-body coupling.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

The nature of this contextual information is difficult to study, as responses to feedforward and top-down inputs overlap in time and are difficult to disentangle experimentally. To address this issue, we measured responses to natural images and partially occluded versions of these images in the visual cortex of mice. Assessing neuronal responses before and after familiarizing mice with the non-occluded images allowed us to study experience-dependent and stimulus-specific contextual responses in pyramidal cells (PyCs) in cortical layers 2/3 and 5 in the absence of feedforward input. Surprisingly, in the same retinotopic region of cortex, we found that separate populations of PyCs in layer 2/3 responded to occluded and non-occluded images. Responses of PyCs selective for occluded images were strengthened upon familiarization and decoding analysis revealed they contained image-specific information, suggesting that they signaled the absence of predicted visual stimuli. Responses of PyCs selective for non-occluded scenes were weaker for familiarized images but stronger for unfamiliar images, suggesting that these neurons signaled the presence of unpredicted visual stimuli. Layer 5 also contained PyCs preferring either feedforward or contextual inputs, but their responses were more complex and strengthening of responses to occluded images required task engagement. The results show that visual experience decreases the activity of neurons responding to known feedforward inputs but increases the activity of neurons responding to contextual inputs tied to expected stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Despite the need for speed, animals appear to only slowly learn to associate rewarded actions with predictive cues. This slow learning is thought to be supported by a gradual expansion of predictive cue representation in the sensory cortex. However, evidence is growing that animals learn more rapidly than classical performance measures suggest, challenging the prevailing model of sensory cortical plasticity. Here, we investigated the relationship between learning and sensory cortical representations. We trained mice on an auditory go/no-go task that dissociated the rapid acquisition of task contingencies (learning) from its slower expression (performance). Optogenetic silencing demonstrated that the auditory cortex (AC) drives both rapid learning and slower performance gains but becomes dispensable at expert. Rather than enhancement or expansion of cue representations, two-photon calcium imaging of AC excitatory neurons throughout learning revealed two higher-order signals that were causal to learning and performance. First, a reward prediction (RP) signal emerged rapidly within tens of trials, was present after action-related errors only early in training, and faded at expert levels. Strikingly, silencing at the time of the RP signal impaired rapid learning, suggesting it serves an associative and teaching role. Second, a distinct cell ensemble encoded and controlled licking suppression that drove the slower performance improvements. These two ensembles were spatially clustered but uncoupled from underlying sensory representations, indicating a higher-order functional segregation within AC. Our results reveal that the sensory cortex manifests higher-order computations that separably drive rapid learning and slower performance improvements, reshaping our understanding of the fundamental role of the sensory cortex.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

This technique confirmed known long-range dynein and kinesin transport of peripheral VIFs and uncovered extensive bidirectional VIF motion within the perinuclear vimentin network, a region we had thought too densely bundled to permit such motility. To examine the nanoscale organization of perinuclear vimentin, we acquired high-resolution electron microscopy volumes of a vitreously frozen cell and reconstructed VIFs and microtubules within a ~50 um3 window. Of 583 VIFs identified, most were integrated into long, semi-coherent bundles that fluctuated in width and filament packing density. Unexpectedly, VIFs displayed minimal local co-alignment with microtubules, save for sporadic cross-over sites that we predict facilitate cytoskeletal crosstalk.

The system features a 256-element, helmet-shaped transducer array operating at 555 kHz, coupled with a stereotactic positioning system, individualised treatment planning, and real-time monitoring using functional MRI. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate the system's ability to selectively modulate the activity of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and its functionally connected regions in the visual cortex. Participants exhibited significantly increased visual cortex activity during concurrent TUS and visual stimulation, with high reproducibility across individuals. Moreover, a theta-burst TUS protocol induced robust neuromodulatory effects, with decreased visual cortex activity observed for at least 40 minutes post-stimulation. These neuromodulatory effects were specific to the targeted LGN, as confirmed by control experiments. Our findings highlight the potential of this advanced TUS system to non-invasively modulate deep brain circuits with high precision and specificity, offering new avenues for studying brain function and developing targeted therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders. The unprecedented spatial resolution and prolonged neuromodulatory effects demonstrate the transformative potential of this technology for both research and clinical applications, paving the way for a new era of non-invasive deep brain neuromodulation.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the channeling of hepatocyte neutral lipids towards cytosolic LDs or secreted lipoproteins remains incomplete. Here, we performed a series of CRISPR-Cas9 screens under different metabolic states to uncover mechanisms of hepatic neutral lipid flux. Clustering of chemical-genetic interactions identified CLIC-like chloride channel 1 (CLCC1) as a critical regulator of neutral lipid storage and secretion. Loss of CLCC1 resulted in the buildup of large LDs in hepatoma cells and knockout in mice caused liver steatosis. Remarkably, the LDs are in the lumen of the ER and exhibit properties of lipoproteins, indicating a profound shift in neutral lipid flux. Finally, remote homology searches identified a domain in CLCC1 that is homologous to yeast Brl1p and Brr6p, factors that promote the fusion of the inner and outer nuclear envelopes during nuclear pore complex assembly. Loss of CLCC1 lead to extensive nuclear membrane herniations, consistent with impaired nuclear pore complex assembly. Thus, we identify CLCC1 as the human Brl1p/Brr6p homolog and propose that CLCC1-mediated membrane remodeling promotes hepatic neutral lipid flux and nuclear pore complex assembly.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Growing evidence supports a likely causal association between cardiovascular diseases and the presence of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), a cellular transdifferentiation process in which endothelial cells (ECs) partially lose their identity and acquire additional mesenchymal phenotypes. EC reprogramming represents an innovative strategy in regenerative medicine to prevent deleterious effects induced by cardiovascular diseases.

MethodsUsing a partial reprogramming of ECs, via overexpression of Oct-3/4, Sox-2, and Klf-4 (OSK) transcription factors, we aimed to bring ECs back to a youthful phenotype in hypertensive mice. Primary ECs were infected with lentiviral vectors (LV) containing the specific EC marker cadherin 5 (Cdh5) and the fluorescent reporter enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) with empty vector (LVCO) or with OSK (LV-OSK). Confocal microscopy and western blotting analysis were used to confirm the OSK overexpression. Cellular migration, senescence, and apoptosis were evaluated. Human aortic ECs (HAoECs) from male and female normotensive and hypertensive patients were analyzed after OSK or control treatments for their endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) levels, nitric oxide (NO), and genetic profile. Male and female normotensive (BPN/3J) and hypertensive (BPH/2J) mice were treated with an intravenous (i.v.) injection of LVCO or LV-OSK and evaluated 10 days post-infection. The blood pressure, cardiac function, vascular reactivity of small arteries, in vivo EGFP signal and EndMT inhibition were analyzed.

ResultsOSK overexpression induced partial EC reprogramming in vitro, and these cells showed endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-like features with lower migratory capability. OSK treatment of hypertensive BPH/2J mice normalized blood pressure and resistance arteries hypercontractility, via the attenuation of EndMT and elastin breaks. EGFP signal was detected in vivo in the prefrontal cortex of both BPN/3J and BPH/2J-treated mice, but OSK induced angiogenesis only in male BPN/3J mice. OSK-treated human ECs from hypertensive patients showed high eNOS activation and NO production, with low ROS formation. Single-cell RNA analysis showed that OSK alleviated EC senescence and EndMT, restoring their phenotypes in human ECs from hypertensive patients.

ConclusionOverall, these data indicate that OSK treatment and EC reprogramming can decrease blood pressure and reverse hypertension-induced vascular damage.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Reproductive aging is associated with decreased ovarian reserve, decreased quality of the remaining oocytes, and decreased production of the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone. With aging, both mouse and human ovaries become pro-fibrotic and stiff. However, whether stiffness directly impairs ovarian function, folliculogenesis, and oocyte quality is unknown. To answer this question, we cultured mouse follicles in alginate gels that mimicked the stiffness of reproductively young and old ovaries. Follicles cultured in stiff hydrogels exhibited decreased survival and growth, decreased granulosa cell viability and estradiol synthesis, and decreased oocyte quality. We also observed a reduction in the number of granulosa cell-oocyte transzonal projections. RNA sequencing revealed early changes in the follicle transcriptome in response to stiffness. Follicles cultured in a stiff environment had lower expression of genes related to follicle development and greater expression of genes related to inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling than follicles cultured in a soft environment. Altogether, our findings suggest that ovarian stiffness directly modulates folliculogenesis and contributes to the progressive decline in oocyte quantity and quality observed in women of advanced maternal age.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

This cross-sectional study aims to investigate the potential mediating role of sleep quality in this association.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study using data from elderly individuals aged 50 and above in Weitang Town in 2023. Detailed information on tea consumption, duration of COVID-19-related symptoms, and sleep quality was collected using pre-designed questionnaires. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Spearman correlation analysis was employed to examine the relationships between variables. Mediation effect analysis utilized a mediation model with multi-category independent variables.

ResultsThe correlation analysis revealed negative associations between tea drinking frequency, type, years, concentration, and sleep quality. Additionally, sleep quality was significantly and positively associated with the duration of COVID-19-related symptoms, whereas various tea consumption variables were significantly and negatively associated with the duration of COVID-19-related symptoms. The mediation analysis confirmed that sleep quality partially mediated the relationship between daily tea drinking and the duration of COVID-19-related symptoms. Moreover, sleep quality fully mediated the associations between drinking green tea, consuming tea for less than 15 years or more than 30 years, the concentration of tea consumption, and the duration of COVID-19-related symptoms.

ConclusionsTea consumption indirectly influences the duration of COVID-19-related symptoms through its impact on sleep quality. These findings highlight the importance of considering the effects of tea consumption on COVID-19 infection, as well as the potential to reduce the duration of COVID-19-related symptoms by improving sleep quality.","NA","medrxiv",1718143602572

For the myriad of marine species, the ocean represents a complex sensory environment, which acts as a crucible of evolution for polymodal sensory perception. The cellular and molecular bases of polymodal sensory perception in a marine environment remain enigmatic. Here we use Ca2+ imaging and quantitative behavioral analysis to show that in the tunicate Ciona intestinalis two members of the evolutionarily conserved Anoctamin family1-4 (Tmem16E/Ano5 and Tmem16F/Ano6), are required for sensing chemosensory and mechanosensory metamorphic cues. We find that they act by modulating neuronal excitability and Ca2+ response kinetics in the primary sensory neurons and axial columnar cells of the papillae, a widely conserved sensory-adhesive organ across ascidians5-9. Finally, we use electrophysiological recordings and a scramblase assay in tissue culture to demonstrate that Tmem16E/Ano5 acts as a channel, while Tmem16F/Ano6 is a bifunctional ion channel and phospholipid scramblase. Our results establish Ano5 and Ano6 as novel players in the zooplanktonic, pre-vertebrate molecular toolkit that controls polymodal sensory perception in aquatic environments.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Most cases of PD are believed to arise from gene-environment interactions. Microbiome composition is altered in PD, and gut bacteria are causal to symptoms and pathology in animal models. To explore how the microbiome may impact PD-associated genetic risks, we quantitatively profiled nearly 630 metabolites from 26 biochemical classes in the gut, plasma, and brain of -synuclein-overexpressing (ASO) mice with or without microbiota. We observe tissue-specific changes driven by genotype, microbiome, and their interaction. Many differentially expressed metabolites in ASO mice are also dysregulated in human PD patients, including amine oxides, bile acids and indoles. Notably, levels of the microbial metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) strongly correlate from the gut to the plasma to the brain, identifying a product of gene-environment interactions that may influence PD-like outcomes in mice. TMAO is elevated in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid of PD patients.

Kinetochores, megadalton chromosome attachment sites to spindle microtubules, contribute to SAC signaling. However, it is unclear whether kinetochores are mere docking sites for SAC proteins, or further contribute to co-orientation of SAC catalysts, including MAD1:MAD2 and BUB1:BUB3, to facilitate SAC signaling. Here, we combined biochemical reconstitutions of kinetochores and the SAC to address this question in vitro. We engineered recombinant kinetochore particles that recruit most SAC components and activate SAC signaling after induction with Rapamycin, and challenged them with a battery of impairing mutants. At approximately physiological concentrations of SAC catalysts, kinetochores were crucially required for rapid assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), the SAC effector. Our observations depict kinetochores as a cradle that catalyzes rapid MCC assembly by concentrating and co-orienting distinct SAC catalysts.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Given the exciting perspectives this finding offered, we have now developed the required tools to investigate and functionally asses that CMA function in a powerful fish genetic model: the zebrafish (Danio rerio). After adapting and validating a fluorescent reporter (KFERQ-Dendra2; previously used to track CMA in mammalian cells) in zebrafish primary embryonic cells, we first demonstrated CMA functionality in this fish species. Then, we developed a transgenic zebrafish line expressing the KFERQ-Dendra2 CMA reporter, enabling the real-time tracking of CMA activity in vivo. This model revealed heterogeneous CMA responses within tissues, highlighting the zebrafish as a valuable model for investigating tissue-specific and cell-scale variations in CMA. Moreover, a novel role for CMA has been uncovered, acting as a gatekeeper of sperm cell proteostasis, thereby playing a crucial role in the production of active and high-quality spermatozoa.

A series of studies have therefore used willingness to wait for delayed rewards as a proxy for decision confidence. However, interpretation of waiting behavior is limited because it is unclear how environmental statistics influence optimal waiting, and how sources of internal variability influence subjects' behavior. We trained rats to perform a confidence-guided waiting task, and derived expressions for optimal waiting that make relevant environmental statistics explicit, including travel time incurred traveling from one reward opportunity to another. We found that rats waited longer than fully optimal agents, but that their behavior was closely matched by optimal agents with travel times constrained to match their own. We developed a process model describing the decision to stop waiting as an accumulation to bound process, which allowed us to compare the effects of multiple sources of internal variability on waiting. Surprisingly, although mean wait times grew with confidence, variability did not, inconsistent with scalar invariant timing, and best explained by variability in the stopping bound. Our results describe a tractable process model that can capture the influence of environmental statistics and internal sources of variability on subjects' decision process during confidence-guided waiting.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Natural transformation is widespread amongst bacteria yet determining how different factors universally contribute to or limit this process across species has remained challenging. Here we show that Acinetobacter baylyi, the most naturally transformable species, is highly transformable due to its ability to robustly bind nonspecific DNA via a dedicated orphan minor pilin, FimT. We show that, compared to its homologues, A. baylyi FimT contains multiple positively charged residues that additively promote DNA binding efficiency. Expression of A. baylyi FimT in a closely related Acinetobacter pathogen is sufficient to substantially improve its capacity for natural transformation, demonstrating that T4P-DNA binding is a rate-limiting step in this process. These results demonstrate the importance of T4P-DNA binding efficiency in driving natural transformation, establishing a key factor limiting horizontal gene transfer.

ImportanceNatural transformation is a multi-step, broadly conserved mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in which bacteria take up exogenous DNA from the environment and integrate it into their genome by homologous recombination. A complete picture of the factors that limit this behavior remain unclear due to variability between bacterial systems. In this manuscript, we provide clear and direct evidence that DNA binding by type IV pili prior to DNA uptake is a rate-limiting step of natural transformation. We show that increasing DNA binding in antibiotic resistant Acinetobacter pathogens can boost their transformation rates by 100-fold. In addition to expanding our understanding of the factors that limit transformation in the environment, these results will also contribute to a deeper understanding of the spread of antibiotic resistance genes in relevant human pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

However, little is known about how the microbial community in the rumen responds to Asparagopsis supplementation, and how changes in the rumen microbiome may contribute to shifts in rumen function and ultimately the hosts phenotype. In this study, we generated and analyzed metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from the microbiome associated with rumen fluid collected from two cohorts of lactating dairy cows, one fed a diet supplemented with Asparagopsis armata (treatment) and another fed the same diet without A. armata supplementation (control). The reduction of CH4 emission from animals that received A. armata was coupled to a qualitative decrease in relative archaeal abundance and a significant reduction in the transcription of methanogenesis pathways. Additionally, a significant decrease in the transcription of genes for complex carbon catabolism and a re-organization of the expression profile of carbon catabolic genes at the species level was observed in treated animals. Increased H2 production, a consequence of methanogenesis suppression, was coupled to a significant increase in the transcription of hydrogenases that mediate hydrogenotrophic metabolism in the treatment group. Analysis of metatranscriptome data identified a single uncultured hydrogenotrophic bacterial species (a Duodenibacillus sp.) as the dominant driver of this transcriptional change. Comparative genomic analysis between the Duodenibacillus sp. and other hydrogenotrophic rumen organisms revealed metabolic traits in the Duodenibacillus that may provide a competitive advantage in H2 scavenging. These findings provide an initial understanding of how rumen microbiota respond to a promising CH4 reducing feed additive, and may serve as a model to understand alternative stable rumen microbiome states that produce less methane and increase animal productivity.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

To address this question, we performed large-scale recordings from neurons in both somatosensory cortices (S1) while mice shared information between their hemispheres and discriminated between two categories of bilateral stimuli. When expert mice touched stimuli associated with reward, they moved their whiskers with greater bilateral symmetry. During this period, synchronous spiking and enhanced spike-field coupling emerged between the hemispheres. This coordinated activity was absent in stimulus-matched naive animals, indicating that interhemispheric (IH) binding was controlled by a goal-directed, internal process. In S1 neurons, the addition of ipsilateral touch primarily facilitated the contralateral, principal whisker response. This facilitation primarily emerged for reward-associated stimuli and was lost on trials where expert mice failed to respond. Taken together, these results reveal a novel state-dependent logic underlying bilateral integration in S1, where stimulus binding and facilitation are controlled by behavioral relevance.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

We trained artificial intelligence (AI) models to predict the codons given their amino acid sequence in the eukaryotes Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, to study the extent to which we can learn patterns in naturally occurring codons to improve predictions. We trained our models on a subset of the proteins, and evaluated their predictions on large, separate sets of proteins of varying lengths and expression levels. Our models significantly outperformed naive frequency-based approaches, demonstrating that there are dependencies between codons that can be learned to better predict evolutionary-selected codon usage. The prediction accuracy advantage of our models is greater for highly expressed genes and it is greater in bacteria than eukaryotes, supporting the hypothesis that there is a monotonic relationship between selective pressure for complex codon patterns and effective population size. Also, in S. cerevisiae and bacteria, our models were more accurate for longer proteins, suggesting that the AI system may have learned patterns related to co-translational folding. Gene functionality and conservation were also important determinants that affect the performance of our models. Finally, we showed that using information encoded in homologous proteins has only a minor effect on prediction accuracy, perhaps due to complex codon-usage codes in genes undergoing rapid evolution. In summary, our study employing contemporary AI methods offers a new perspective on codon usage patterns and a novel tool to optimize codon usage in endogenous and heterologous proteins.

Significance statementCan one predict codon sequences used by an organism to encode a given amino acid sequence? This is difficult, because there are exponentially many codon sequences that can encode the same amino acid sequence and evolution is stochastic. Indeed, codons frequencies vary, a phenomenon known as codon-bias, yet we improve upon frequency-based predictions using contemporary AI tools that learn complex patterns and capture interactions between codons. Because our predictions are tested fairly, on cases not seen during the training process, accurate predictions suggest that these learned patterns are not random, and may be related to the evolutionary process. Thus, studying where our predictions are more accurate, is expected to reveal novel insights related to the way evolution shapes coding regions.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Mechanistically, TP53mut AML resistance to standard AML chemotherapy, cytarabine (AraC), correlates with increased mevalonate pathway activity and a mitochondria stress response with increased mitochondria mass and oxidative phosphorylation. Pretreatment with a statin reverses these effects and chemosensitizes TP53mut AML cell lines and primary samples in vitro and in vivo.

Joint dimensionality reduction methods can be applied to multi-omics datasets to derive a global sample embedding analogous to single-omic techniques such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA) is a method for joint dimensionality reduction that maximizes the covariance between block- and global-level embeddings. Current implementations for MCIA are not optimized for large datasets such such as those arising from single cell studies, and lack capabilities with respect to embedding new data. Results: We introduce nipalsMCIA, an MCIA implementation that solves the objective function using an extension to Non-linear Iterative Partial Least Squares (NIPALS), and shows significant speed-up over earlier implementations that rely on eigendecompositions for single cell multi-omics data. It also removes the dependence on an eigendecomposition for calculating the variance explained, and allows users to perform out-of-sample embedding for new data. nipalsMCIA provides users with a variety of pre-processing and parameter options, as well as ease of functionality for down-stream analysis of single-omic and global-embedding factors.

However, there has been no direct investigation into how this relationship is reflected in population receptive field (pRF) sizes despite the common application of pRF mapping in visual neuroscience. We hypothesised that adaptation to high/low SF would decrease the sensitivity of neurons with respectively small/large receptive field sizes, resulting in a change in pRF sizes as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To test this hypothesis, we first quantified the SF aftereffect using a psychophysical paradigm where observers made SF judgments following adaptation to high/low SF noise patterns. We then incorporated the same adaptation technique into a standard pRF mapping procedure, to investigate the spatial tuning of the early visual cortex following SF adaptation. Results showed that adaptation to a low/high SF resulted in smaller/larger pRFs respectively, as hypothesised. Our results provide the most direct evidence to date that the spatial tuning of the visual cortex, as measured by pRF mapping, is related to the SF selectivity of visual neural populations. This has implications for various domains of visual processing, including size perception and visual acuity.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Key to lipid catabolism in the lysosome is bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a major lipid constituent of intralysosomal vesicles (ILVs) and a stimulator of lipid-degrading enzymes. BMP levels are altered in a broad spectrum of human conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. Although BMP synthase was recently discovered, it has long been thought that the unique stereochemistry of BMP confers resistance to acid phospholipases, a requirement for its role in the lysosome. Here, we demonstrate that PLA2G15, a major lysosomal phospholipase, efficiently hydrolyzes BMP with primary esters regardless of stereochemistry. Interestingly, we discover that the unique esterification position of BMP is what confers resistance to hydrolysis. Purified PLA2G15 catabolizes most BMP species derived from cell and tissue lysosomes under acidic conditions. Furthermore, PLA2G15 catalytic activity against synthesized BMP stereoisomers with primary esters was comparable to its canonical substrates. Conversely, BMP with secondary esters is intrinsically stable in vitro and requires acyl migration for hydrolysis in lysosomes. Consistent with our biochemical data, PLA2G15-deficient tissues and cells accumulate multiple BMP species, a phenotype reversible by supplementing wildtype PLA2G15 but not its catalytically dead mutant. Increasing BMP levels by targeting PLA2G15 reverses the cholesterol accumulation phenotype in Niemann Pick Disease Type C (NPC1) patient fibroblasts and significantly ameliorate disease pathologies in NPC1-deficient mice leading to extended lifespan. Our findings establish the rules that govern the stability of BMP in the lysosome and identify PLA2G15 as a lysosomal BMP hydrolase and as a potential target for modulating BMP levels for therapeutic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

In line with the pre-registered hypotheses, conflict and conflict adaptation effects were preserved during both altered arousal states. Overall task performance was markedly poorer during low arousal, but not for high arousal. Modelling behavioural dynamics with drift-diffusion analysis revealed evidence accumulation and non-decision time decelerated, and decisional boundaries became wider during low arousal, whereas high arousal was unexpectedly associated with a decrease in the interference of task-irrelevant information processing. These findings show how arousal differentially modulates cognitive control at both sides of normal alertness, and further validates drowsiness and physical exercise as key experimental models to disentangle the interaction between physiological fluctuations on cognitive dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Increasing evidence also indicates that dopamine regulates critical functions in peripheral organs and is an important immunoregulatory factor. We have previously shown that dopamine increases NF-{kappa}B activity, inflammasome activation, and the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1{beta} in human macrophages. As myeloid lineage cells are central to the initiation and resolution of acute inflammatory responses, dopamine-mediated dysregulation of these functions could both impair the innate immune response and exacerbate chronic inflammation. However, the exact pathways by which dopamine drives myeloid inflammation are not well defined, and studies in both rodent and human systems indicate that dopamine can impact the production of inflammatory mediators through both D1-like dopamine receptors (DRD1, DRD5) and D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4). Therefore, we hypothesized that dopamine-mediated production of IL-1{beta} in myeloid cells is regulated by the ratio of different dopamine receptors that are activated. Our data in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) indicate that DRD1 expression is necessary for dopamine-mediated increases in IL-1{beta}, and that changes in the expression of DRD2 and other dopamine receptors can alter the magnitude of the dopamine-mediated increase in IL-1{beta}. Mature hMDM have a high D1-like to D2-like receptor ratio, which is different relative to monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We further confirm in human microglia cell lines that a high ratio of D1-like to D2-like receptors promotes dopamine-induced increases in IL-1{beta} gene and protein expression using pharmacological inhibition or overexpression of dopamine receptors. RNA-sequencing of dopamine-treated microglia shows that genes encoding functions in IL-1{beta} signaling pathways, microglia activation, and neurotransmission increased with dopamine treatment. Finally, using HIV as an example of a chronic inflammatory disease that is substantively worsened by comorbid substance use disorders (SUDs) that impact dopaminergic signaling, we show increased effects of dopamine on inflammasome activation and IL-1{beta} in the presence of HIV in both human macrophages and microglia. These data suggest that use of addictive substances and dopamine-modulating therapeutics could dysregulate the innate inflammatory response and exacerbate chronic neuroimmunological conditions like HIV. Thus, a detailed understanding of dopamine-mediated changes in inflammation, in particular pathways regulating IL-1{beta}, will be critical to effectively tailor medication regimens.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Most importantly, there are more differences in DNA methylation patterns between different light pattern regimes than between different light intensities. These differences in DNA methylation were accompanied by significant changes in gene expression, some of which correlated with altered DNA methylation.

The study of duplication is central to understanding protein evolution, but the detection of repetitive sequence patterns is often challenging due to decreasing similarity between internal repeats resulting from long-term divergence. The most sensitive sequence-based repeat detection method, HHrepID, relies on the construction of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to enhance homology signals and thus facilitate the detection of very ancient duplications. However, such an alignment-based approach is slow and limits the ability to perform large-scale scans. Recent advances in protein representation learning have introduced sequence embeddings extracted from protein language models as a powerful and much faster alternative to MSAs. Protein sequence representations have been shown to be effective in homology detection, as exemplified by software such as our recently developed pLM-BLAST. In this study, we implement pLM-Repeat, a pipeline built upon pLM-BLAST, to identify repeats encoded in sequence embeddings. pLM-Repeat achieves comparable sensitivity to HHrepID in detecting the presence of repeats, while predicting many more repeat units and providing significantly better run times. We further trained a neural network DeepRepeat for the detection of domains that have patterns similar to well-characterized repeat folds to support fast filtering.

Nevertheless, little is known about how Abetao affect OL differentiation and myelination in vivo, and the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we explored the effects of a brain intraventricular injection of Abetao on OLs and myelin in the developing spinal cord of zebrafish larvae. Using quantitative fluorescent in situ RNA hybridization assays, we demonstrated that Abetao altered myrf and mbp mRNA levels and the regional distribution of mbp during larval development, suggesting an early differentiation of OLs. Through live imaging of Tg(myrf:mScarlet) and Tg(mbp:tagRFP) zebrafish lines, both crossed with Tg(olig2:EGFP), we found that Abetao increased the number of myrf+ and mbp+ OLs in the dorsal spinal cord at 72 hpf and 5 dpf, respectively, without affecting total cell numbers. Furthermore, Abetao also increased the number of myelin sheaths per OL and the number of myelinated axons in the dorsal spinal cord compared to vehicle-injected control animals. Interestingly, the treatment of Abetao-injected zebrafish with the pan-PKC inhibitor Go6983 restored the aforementioned alterations in OLs and myelin to control levels.

Leveraging Biolearn, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of various aging biomarkers across multiple datasets. Our systematic approach involved three key steps: (1) harmonizing existing and novel aging biomarkers in standardized formats; (2) unifying public datasets to ensure coherent structuring and formatting; and (3) applying computational methodologies to assess the harmonized biomarkers against the unified datasets. This evaluation yielded valuable insights into the performance, robustness, and generalizability of aging biomarkers across different populations and datasets.

The mechanisms of Vcor coral colonization, coral microbiome interactions, and virulence factor production are understudied. In other model Vibrio species, virulence factors like biofilm formation, toxin secretion, and protease production are controlled through a density-dependent communication system called quorum sensing (QS). Comparative genomics indicated that V. coralliilyticus genomes share high sequence identity for most of the QS signaling and regulatory components identified in other Vibrio species. Here, we identify an active QS signaling pathway in two V. coralliilyticus strains with distinct infection etiologies: type strain BAA-450 and coral isolate OCN008. The inter-species AI-2 autoinducer signaling pathway in both strains controls expression of the master QS transcription factor VcpR to regulate >300 genes, including protease production, biofilm formation, and two conserved type VI secretion systems (T6SSs). Activation of T6SS1 by QS results in secretion of effectors and enables interbacterial competition and killing of prey bacteria. We conclude that the QS system in V. coralliilyticus is functional and controls expression of genes involved in relevant bacterial behaviors that may influence coral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Here we use a probabilistic switching task that requires an animal to maintain flexible relationships between action selection and evaluation to examine when and how GABA/glutamate cotransmitting neurons contribute to behavior. We find that EPSst+ neurons are strongly engaged during this task and show bidirectional changes in activity during the choice and outcome periods of a trial. We then tested the effects of either permanently blocking cotransmission or modifying the GABA/glutamate ratio on behavior in well-trained animals. Neither manipulation produced detectable changes in behavior despite significant changes in synaptic transmission in the LHb, demonstrating that the outputs of these neurons are not required for on-going action-outcome updating in a probabilistic switching task.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

However, the emergence of various variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents challenges for current mAb treatments, emphasizing the need for more potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies. In this study, we employed an unbiased screening approach to discover broadly neutralizing antibodies and successfully isolated two mAbs from individuals with only exposure to ancestral SARS-CoV-2. One of these antibodies, CYFN1006-1, exhibited robust cross-neutralization against a spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the latest JN.1 and KP.2 variants, with consistent IC50 values ranging from [~]1 to 5 ng/mL. Notably, it also displayed broad neutralization activity against SARS-CoV and related sarbecoviruses, such as WIV1, SHC014, RaTG13, and GD-Pangolin. Structural analysis revealed that these mAbs target shared hotspot but mutation-resistant epitopes, with their Fabs locking the RBD in the ""down"" conformation through interactions with adjacent Fabs and RBDs, and cross-linking Spike trimers into di-trimers to block viral infection. In vivo studies conducted in a JN.1-infected hamster model validated the protective efficacy of CYFN1006-1, emphasizing its therapeutic potential. These findings suggest that, through meticulous approaches, rare antibodies with cross-neutralization activities against SARS-CoV-2 and related sarbecoviruses can be identified from individuals with exclusively ancestral virus exposure.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Although rare worldwide, LFS is prevalent in Southern Brazil due to a founder pathogenic variant, c.1010G>A, p.Arg337His (R337H), discovered through its association with risk of childhood adrenal cortical carcinoma.

MethodsHere, we have analyzed tumor patterns, cancer risk, sex differences and temporal tumor trends in a cohort of 303 adult R337H carriers and we have compared them with those of 405 adult carriers of other TP53 variants typical of LFS.

FindingsCompared to the latter, R337H carriers had a lower cumulative risk of developing cancer (54% for R337H vs 78% for other TP53 variants at age 50 years). Female R337H carriers were at a higher risk than males (65% vs 30% at age 50 years) and had a higher risk of developing a second primary cancer, underscoring a strong sex bias not observed in carriers of other variants. The most common cancers were breast (75%), soft tissue sarcoma (9%) and lung cancer (8%) in females, and soft tissue sarcoma (30%), prostate (13%) and lung cancer (12%) in males. Common second malignancies were breast cancer in females and lung cancer in males.

InterpretationsOverall, this study confirms that R337H is associated with a lifetime risk of multiple cancers of the LFS spectrum but with incomplete penetrance, particularly in males. Our findings suggest that R337H carriers would benefit from adapted lifetime and surveillance strategies for risk reduction.

Beyond environmental factors, intragenomic conflict between genes inherited from the mother (matrigenes) versus the father (patrigenes) is also hypothesized to generate this plasticity. In honey bees, the Kinship Theory of Intragenomic Conflict predicts selection on patrigenes to enhance traits that result in fitness gained through reproduction, and thus patrigenes should favor the queen caste fate. Here, we conducted allele-specific transcriptome analyses on queen-destined larvae (QL) and worker-destined larvae (WL) at 192 hours post-fertilization (hpf), a critical stage for caste determination. Our findings reveal hundreds of genes with parent-of-origin effects (POEs), with significant patrigene-biased transcription in QL. Genes with POEs in honey bees resemble imprinted genes in other taxa in terms of genomic clustering, recombination rate, intron length and CpG density, and a subset are maintained from 24hpf eggs. Previous studies demonstrated that DNA methylation, the canonical regulatory mechanism underlying transcriptional POEs in placental mammals, angiosperms, and some insects, is not operating in honey bees or other social insects. We use allele-specific ChIP-seq analyses to demonstrate that POEs on caste-specific histone post-translational modification (HPTM) profiles of H3K27me3, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac are associated with POEs on transcription. Together, these findings suggest that parent-of-origin intragenomic conflicts may contribute broadly to phenotypic plasticity and may be associated with HPTMs, suggesting a ""non-canonical"" genomic imprinting-like system in social insects.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

The structure and diversity of virus populations affects disease progression and treatment outcomes. Next-generation sequencing allows detailed viral population analysis, but inferring diversity from error-prone reads is challenging. Here, we present VILOCA, a method for mutation calling and reconstruction of local haplotypes from short- and long-read viral sequencing data. Local haplotypes refer to genomic regions that have approximately the length of the input reads. VILOCA recovers local haplotypes by using a Dirichlet process mixture model to cluster reads around their unobserved haplotypes and leveraging quality scores of the sequencing reads. We assessed the performance of VILOCA in terms of mutation calling and haplotype reconstruction accuracy on simulated and experimental Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore data. On simulated and experimental Illumina data, VILOCA performed better or similar to existing methods. On the simulated long-read data, VILOCA is able to recover on average 82% of the ground truth mutations with perfect precision compared to only 64% recall and 90% precision of the second-best method. In summary, VILOCA provides significantly improved accuracy in mutation and haplotype calling, especially for long-read sequencing data, and therefore facilitates the comprehensive characterization of heterogeneous within-host viral populations.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Poor outcomes for osteosarcoma patients are intricately linked with the development of lung metastasis. While lung metastasis is responsible for nearly all deaths caused by osteosarcoma, identification of biologically defined, metastasis-targeting therapies remains elusive because the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern metastatic colonization of circulating tumor cells to the lung remains poorly understood. While thousands of tumor cells are released into circulation each day, very few can colonize the lung. Herein, using a combination of a novel organotypic metastasis in vitro model, single-cell RNA sequencing, human xenograft, and murine immunocompetent osteosarcoma models, we find that metastasis is initiated by a subpopulation of hypo-proliferative cells with the unique capacity to sustain production of metastasis promoting cytokines such as IL6 and CXCL8 in response to lung-epithelial derived IL1alpha. Critically, genomic and pharmacologic disruption of IL1 signaling in osteosarcoma cells significantly reduces metastatic progression. Collectively, our study supports that tumor-stromal interactions are important for metastasis, and suggests that metastatic competency is driven, in part, by the tumor cell ability to respond to the metastatic niche. Our findings support that disruption of tumor-stromal signaling is a promising therapeutic approach to disrupt metastasis progression.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

In response, naked mole-rats have evolved a suite of molecular and physiological adaptations to survive extreme hypoxia. Yet, how naked mole-rats rewire their metabolism to protect the heart has not been comprehensively addressed. Here, we performed comparative analyses of naked mole-rat and mouse organs exposed to ischaemic conditions. We show that naked mole-rats have retained features of foetal cardiac metabolism replacing fatty acid utilisation for a unique type of carbohydrate metabolism largely dependent on glycogen. We found that naked mole-rats have co-opted specialised liver-like glycogen handling mechanisms in the heart. Amongst these is the expression of liver-specific enzyme isoforms and amylase, a digestive enzyme known for starch breakdown in saliva and intestine but whose biological role in glycogen processing has not been fully recognised. We show that amylase is rapidly activated in ischaemia and hydrolyses internal glycosidic bonds for more efficient downstream processing. This biochemical adaptation occurred in both mouse and naked mole-rat livers but exclusively in the naked mole-rat heart, which retained higher ATP levels by maintaining an increased glycolytic flux in an amylase-dependent mechanism. Overall, we discovered a previously unknown type of glycogen metabolism in the naked mole-rat that holds relevance to pathologies where glycogen plays a role. Furthermore, we describe a novel type of metabolic plasticity in the heart which may be harnessed for cardiac disease.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Lag3 and PD-L1 co-blockade (CB) drove additive and synergistic changes in T cell activation, resulting in a transcriptional profile dominated by a NFAT-biased/ T follicular helper cell signature. Mechanistically, CB led to an enhanced duration of TCR signalling, which drove a transcriptional motif of TCR signal duration-sensitive genes. In addition, CB synergistically upregulated CCR6, leading to enhanced CCL20-dependent migration. Analysis of datasets from humans on anti-PD-1 and anti-Lag3 immunotherapy revealed upregulation of CCR6 and ICOS in blood effector memory CD4+ T cells, underscoring the translational relevance of our findings.

Because species traits can plastically respond to competition, the competitive effect of one individual on another involves not only reductions in performance, but also changes in morphology, behavior, phenology or physiology that affect interactions with other individuals. In this context, plasticity is often argued to favor species coexistence by increasing the niche differentiation between species, though experimental support that explicitly considers competitive outcomes is largely lacking. Here, we transiently subjected four annual plant species to early-season intraspecific or interspecific competition to explicitly induce plastic responses, and then examined the response of these individuals to other competitors. By measuring the interactions between the species with and without early-season competitors, we isolated the impact of plasticity on species interactions and coexistence. Growing with nearby competitors early in life impacted plant traits including height and morphology. These plastic responses tended to amplify the sensitivity of individuals to competition, and particularly so for interspecific competition. This increase in inter- relative to intraspecific competition caused plasticity to decrease the predicted likelihood of pairwise coexistence. By combining recent theory with a new experimental approach, we provide a pathway towards integrating phenotypic plasticity into our quantitative understanding of coexistence.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the last exon of amyloid precursor protein (App), relevant for Alzheimer disease (AD). Our strategy effectively eliminates an endocytic (YENPTY) motif at APP C-terminus, while preserving the N-terminus and compensatory APP-homologues. This manipulation favorably alters events along the amyloid-pathway; inhibiting toxic APP-beta-cleavage fragments (including amyloid-beta; and upregulating neuroprotective APP-alpha-cleavage products.

Pathologic alterations in the glial-transcriptome of App-KI mice, as seen by single nuclei RNA-sequencing (sNuc-Seq), are also normalized by App C-terminus editing. Our strategy takes advantage of innate transcriptional rules that render terminal exons insensitive to nonsense-decay, and the upstream manipulation is expected to be effective for all forms of AD.

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention.

In the context of disease, aggregates have been isolated from both chronic and acute infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) aggregates contribute significantly to chronic infections, particularly in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Unlike the large biofilm structures observed in vitro, Pa in CF sputum forms smaller aggregates (~10-1000 cells), and the mechanisms behind their formation remain underexplored. This study aims to identify genes essential and unique to Pa aggregate formation in a synthetic CF sputum media (SCFM2). We cultured Pa strain PAO1 in SCFM2 and LB, both with and without mucin, and used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify differentially expressed genes. The presence of mucin revealed 13 significantly differentially expressed (DE) genes, predominantly downregulated, with 40% encoding hypothetical proteins unique to aggregates. Using high-resolution microscopy, we assessed the ability of mutants to form aggregates. Notably, no mutant exhibited a completely planktonic phenotype. Instead, we identified multiple spatial phenotypes described as 'normal,' 'entropic,' or 'impaired.' Entropic mutants displayed tightly packed, raft-like structures, while impaired mutants had loosely packed cells. Predictive modeling linked the prioritized genes to metabolic shifts, iron acquisition, surface modification, and quorum sensing. Co-culture experiments with wild-type PAO1 revealed further spatial heterogeneity and the ability to 'rescue' some mutant phenotypes, suggesting cooperative interactions during growth. This study enhances our understanding of Pa aggregate biology, specifically the genes and pathways unique to aggregation in CF-like environments. Importantly, it provides insights for developing therapeutic strategies targeting aggregate-specific pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

We identify inhibitors of RAS-MAPK signaling, especially MEK inhibitors, strongly synergizing with radiation response. Mechanistically, MEK inhibitors suppressed radiation-induced activation of RAS-MAPK signaling, and selectively downregulated the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway component RAD51, thereby achieving radio-enhancement. Through testing drug-drug-radiation combinations in organoids and cell lines, we identified synergism between PARP and MEK inhibitors to further enhance the effect of radiation.

Central to this, are the computational approaches of de novo assembly and genome binning that enable large-scale reference-independent recovery of microbial genomes from the metagenomic sequencing data. Despite the advancements in bioinformatics approaches to address the computational challenges inherent to these tasks, the limitation of computational resources continues to be a significant barrier to harvesting the full potential of these techniques. Consequently, there is a stressed need to devise strategies involving the fine-tuning of the employed parameters for the effective utilization of the available metagenomic tools. As most of the available metagenome assembly tools are based on the de Bruijn graph framework that relies on a parameter k, selecting an appropriate subset of k-mers has become a common approach in bioinformatics for efficient computations. In this study, we propose a reduced set of k-mers, optimized to strike a balance between computational efficiency and the quality of the high- and low-complexity metagenome assemblies. Utilizing this set of k-mers with MEGAHIT reduces the metagenome assembly time by half compared to the default set, thus greatly reducing the associated computational cost. In addition, it also brings the promise to improve large-scale genome binning studies that adopt this set in the future as we observed an increase in the total number of the recovered genomes as well as obtained higher proportions of high- and medium-quality genomes recovered from the reduced k-mers-based metagenome assemblies.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial, several potential treatments for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were assessed in separate comparisons in RECOVERY, both of which are reported here. Eligible and consenting adults could join the molnupiravir comparison, the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, or both. For each comparison, participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the relevant antiviral (five days of molnupiravir 800mg twice daily or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 300mg/100mg twice daily) or to usual care without the relevant antiviral drug, using web-based unstratified randomisation with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were time to discharge alive from hospital, and among those not on invasive ventilation at baseline, progression to invasive ventilation or death. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Both comparisons were stopped by the investigators because of low recruitment. ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsFrom 24 January 2022 to 24 May 2023, 923 patients were recruited to the molnupiravir comparison (445 allocated molnupiravir and 478 allocated usual care), and from 31 March 2022 to 24 May 2023, 137 patients were recruited to the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison (68 allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 69 allocated usual care). More than three-quarters of the patients in both comparisons were vaccinated and had anti-spike antibodies at randomisation, and more than two-thirds were receiving other SARS-CoV-2 antivirals (including remdesivir or sotrovimab). In the molnupiravir comparison, 74 (17%) patients allocated to molnupiravir and 79 (17%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.28; p=0.66). In the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, 13 (19%) patients allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 13 (19%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.47-2.23; p=0.96). In neither comparison was there evidence of a significant difference in the duration of hospitalisation or the proportion of patients progressing to invasive ventilation or death.

InterpretationIn adults hospitalised with COVID-19, neither molnupiravir nor nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were associated with reductions in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death although these comparisons had limited statistical power due to low recruitment.

A core feature of the consolidation process is offline replay of neuronal firing patterns that occur during experience7,8. This replay is thought to originate in the hippocampus and trigger the reactivation of ensembles of cortical and subcortical neurons1,3,9-18. However, non-declarative memories do not require the hippocampus for learning or for sleep-dependent consolidation19-26 meaning what drives their consolidation is unknown. Here we show, using an unsupervised method, that replay occurs in the dorsal striatum of mice during offline consolidation of a non-declarative, procedural, memory and that this replay is generated independently of the hippocampus. Replay occurred at both real-world and time-compressed speeds and was also prioritised both at the level of the individual neurons and the type of neural sequence. Complete bilateral lesions of the hippocampus had no effect on any feature of this replay. Our results demonstrate that procedural replay during consolidation of a non-declarative memory is independent of the hippocampus. These results support the view that replay drives active consolidation of all types of memory during sleep but challenges the idea that the hippocampus is the source of this replay.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

As a testbed for this approach, we used the mouse locus coeruleus due to the combination of its widespread, modular efferent neural circuitry and its wide variety of endogenously expressed GPCRs. Using machine learning-based action potential deconvolution and retrograde tracing, we identified an agonist cocktail that selectively inhibits medial prefrontal cortex-projecting locus coeruleus neurons. In vivo, this cocktail produces synergistic antinociception, consistent with selective pharmacological blunting of this neural circuit. This framework has broad utility for selective targeting of other neural circuits under different physiological and pathological states, facilitating non-genetic translational applications arising from cell type-selective discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

The oscillation period of the human segmentation clock, as measured in induced presomitic mesoderm (iPSM) cells, is two times longer than that of mouse. While the core clock gene HES7 is known to show slower protein degradation in human iPSM compared with mouse iPSM, it remains unclear whether the concept of species-specific protein stability is generalizable to other genes. Here we systematically compared the protein degradation rates of approximately 5000 genes between human and mouse iPSM by using dynamic SILAC-based proteomics, demonstrating a pervasive trend of slower protein degradation in human cells. The inter-species difference was observed not only for proteasome-mediated but also for lysosome-mediated degradation. We further investigated the effect of metabolism on the protein stability profile. Treating mouse iPSM cells with a glycolysis inhibitor extended the segmentation clock period, aligning the protein stability profile more closely with that of human cells, though with less effect on lysosome-mediated degradation. These results highlight the universality of slower protein degradation in human development compared with mouse, and suggest metabolism as one of the modulators.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

Here we show that VPS13C, a bridge-like lipid transport protein and a PD gene, is a sensor of lysosome stress/damage. Upon lysosome membrane perturbation, VPS13C rapidly relocates from the cytosol to the surface of lysosomes where it tethers their membranes to the ER. This recruitment depends on Rab7 and requires release of a brake, most likely an intramolecular interaction within VPS13C, which hinders access of its VAB domain to lysosome-bound Rab7. While another PD protein, LRRK2, is also recruited to stressed/damaged lysosomes, its recruitment occurs at much later stages and by different mechanisms. Given the putative role of VPS13 proteins in bulk lipid transport, these findings suggest lipid delivery to lysosomes by VPS13C is part of an early response to lysosome damage.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602572

However, the neural mechanisms are poorly understood, partly due to challenges replicating their metabolic effects in rodents. Here, we report a new mouse model that recapitulates overeating induced by clozapine, a widely prescribed APD. Our study shows that clozapine boosts food intake by inhibiting melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Interestingly, neither clozapine nor risperidone, another commonly used APD, affects receptor-ligand binding or the canonical Gs signaling of MC4R. Instead, they inhibit neuronal activity by enhancing the coupling between MC4R and Kir7.1, leading to the open state of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel. Deletion of Kir7.1 in Mc4r-Cre neurons prevents clozapine-induced weight gain, while treatment with a selective Kir7.1 blocker mitigates overeating in clozapine-fed mice.

When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

One major cell state change is senescence, which is associated with dramatic changes in cell metabolism, including increases in lipid metabolism, but how cells accommodate such alterations is poorly understood. Here, we show that the transcription factor p53 enables recycling of the lipid headgroups required to meet the increased demand for membrane phospholipids during senescence. p53 activation increases supply of phosphoethanolamine (PEtn), an intermediate in the Kennedy pathway for de novo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), by transactivating genes involved in autophagy and lysosomal catabolism that enable membrane turnover. Disruption of PEtn conversion to PE is well-tolerated in the absence of p53 but results in dramatic organelle remodeling and perturbs growth and gene expression following p53 activation. Consistently, CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screens reveal that p53-activated cells preferentially depend on genes involved in lipid metabolism. Together, these results reveal lipid headgroup recycling to be a homeostatic function of p53 that confers a cell-state specific metabolic vulnerability.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602573

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1718143602573

This is because it is challenging to distinguish between adverse effects arising from the properties of the expressed excess protein (cytotoxicity) and those caused solely by protein overexpression. In this study, we attempted to identify the model protein with the lowest cytotoxicity in yeast cells by introducing a new neutrality index. We found that a non-fluorescent fluorescent protein (mox-YG) and an inactive glycolytic enzyme (Gpm1-CCmut) showed the lowest cytotoxicity. These proteins can be expressed at levels exceeding 40% of total protein while maintaining yeast growth. The transcriptome of cells expressing mox-YG to the limit indicated that the cells were in a nitrogen source requirement state. Proteome analysis revealed increased mitochondrial function and decreased ribosome abundance, like the inactivated state of the TORC1 pathway. The decrease in ribosome abundance was presumably due to defective nucleolus formation, partially rescued by a mutation in the nuclear exosome. These findings suggest that massive overexpression of excess protein, termed protein burden, causes nitrogen source starvation, a metabolic shift toward more energy-efficient respiration, and a ribosomal biosynthesis defect due to an imbalance between ribosomal protein and rRNA synthesis in the nucleolus.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602573

It has been isolated as part of the gut microbiome of animals and insects, as well as from stool samples of patients with diarrhea. Specific P. alcalifaciens strains encode gene homologs of virulence factors found in other pathogenic members of the same Enterobacterales order, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Shigella flexneri. Whether these genes are also pathogenic determinants in P. alcalifaciens is not known. Here we have used P. alcalifaciens 205/92, a clinical isolate, with in vitro and in vivo infection models to investigate P. alcalifaciens-host interactions at the cellular level. Our particular focus was the role of two type III secretion systems (T3SS) belonging to the Inv-Mxi/Spa family. T3SS1b is widespread in Providencia spp. and encoded on the chromosome. T3SS1a is encoded on a large plasmid that is present in a subset of P. alcalifaciens strains, which are primarily isolates from diarrheal patients. Using a combination of electron and fluorescence microscopy and gentamicin protection assays we show that P. alcalifaciens 205/92 is internalized into eukaryotic cells, rapidly lyses its internalization vacuole and proliferates in the cytosol. This triggers caspase-4 dependent inflammasome responses in gut epithelial cells. The requirement for the T3SS1a in entry, vacuole lysis and cytosolic proliferation is host-cell type specific, playing a more prominent role in human intestinal epithelial cells as compared to macrophages. In a bovine ligated intestinal loop model, P. alcalifaciens colonizes the intestinal mucosa, inducing mild epithelial damage with negligible fluid accumulation. No overt role for T3SS1a or T3SS1b was seen in the calf infection model. However, T3SS1b was required for the rapid killing of Drosophila melanogaster. We propose that the acquisition of two T3SS by horizontal gene transfer has allowed P. alcalifaciens to diversify its host range, from a highly virulent pathogen of insects to an opportunistic gastrointestinal pathogen of animals.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602573

Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state.

Yet, studies rarely, if ever, consider the possibility that systematic differences in inner experience (i.e., what subjects think and feel during the scan) may directly affect FC measures. Here we demonstrate that is the case using a rs-fMRI dataset comprising 471 scans annotated with experiential data. Wide-spread significant differences in FC are observed between scans that systematically differ in terms of reported in-scanner experience. Additionally, we show that FC can successfully predict specific aspects of in-scanner experience in a manner similar to how it predicts demographics, cognitive abilities, clinical outcomes and labels. Together, these results highlight the key role of in-scanner experience in shaping rs-fMRI estimates of FC.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602573

However, only a minority of infected cells undergo innate immune activation. By examining these ''first responder'' cells during West Nile virus infection, we found that specific accumulation of anti-genomic negative-sense viral RNA (-vRNA) underlies innate immune activation and that RIG-I preferentially interacts with -vRNA. However, flaviviruses sequester -vRNA into membrane-bound replication compartments away from cytosolic sensors. We found that single-stranded -vRNA accumulates outside of replication compartments in ''first responder'' cells, rendering it accessible to RLRs. Exposure of this -vRNA occurs at late timepoints of infection, is linked to viral assembly, and depends on the expression of viral structural proteins. These findings reveal that while most infected cells replicate high levels of vRNA, release of -vRNA from replication compartments during assembly occurs at low frequency and is critical for initiation of innate immunity during flavivirus infection.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602573

SpotSweeper evaluates the quality of individual spots relative to their local neighborhood, thus minimizing bias due to biological heterogeneity, and uses multiscale methods to detect regional artifacts.

High-quality evidence syntheses (ES) are essential for policy-making. Search filters - validated combinations of search terms - play an important role in implementing robust search methods for ES. The identification of climate-health evidence presents challenges, such as the volume and multidisciplinary nature of the evidence and the fact that relevant studies do not consistently state their link to CC. Thus, our aim was to develop search filters for two search interfaces of the MEDLINE database. Methods: CC impacts human health via several exposure pathways: extreme weather events, heat stress, air quality, water quality and quantity, food supply and safety, vector distribution and ecology, and social factors. We established a gold standard by comprehensively identifying health-related ES mentioning CC in five literature databases in February 2021. After screening 8,614 search results, we identified 110 ES for inclusion, extracted their included studies, and classified them according to exposure pathways. From this gold standard we empirically derived search terms per pathway and tested their performance with an independent set of studies. Results: We extracted 2,324 studies from the first 79 ES. Based on a gold standard with 1,572 relevant studies indexed in PubMed, it was possible to develop and validate search filters with a sensitivity of 95%, 97% and 99% for six of the seven major climate-health exposure pathways. Filter development was not possible for one pathway due to the lack of coverage in MEDLINE. Conclusion: We designed ready-to-use PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE search filters with a graded sensitivity for most exposure pathways linking CC with human health. These can be deployed by public and global health researchers conducting ES or primary research on climate-health to ensure robust identification of relevant evidence.

Inhibition of G3BP1 by expression of its acidic or B-domain accelerates axon regeneration after nerve injury bringing a potential therapeutic intervention to promote neural repair in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we asked if G3BP1 inhibition is a viable strategy to promote regeneration in the injured mammalian central nervous system where axons do not regenerate spontaneously. G3BP1 B-domain expression was found to promote axon regeneration in both the mammalian spinal cord and optic nerve. Moreover, a cell permeable peptide to a subregion of G3BP1 B-domain (rodent G3BP1 amino acids 190-208) accelerated axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injury and promoted the regrowth of reticulospinal axons into the distal transected spinal cord through a bridging peripheral nerve graft. The rodent and human G3BP1 peptides promoted axon growth from rodent and human neurons cultured on permissive substrates, and this function required alternating Glu/Asp-Pro repeats that impart a unique predicted tertiary structure. These studies point to G3BP1 granules as a critical impediment to CNS axon regeneration and indicate that G3BP1 granule disassembly represents a novel therapeutic strategy for promoting neural repair after CNS injury.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602573

Here we combine rapid SRCAP depletion, a SRCAP mutant lacking H2A.Z deposition activity, and quantitative genome-wide approaches to dissect how SRCAP and H2A.Z regulate transcription in pluripotent stem cells. We find that SRCAP exhibits essential H2A.Z-independent functions in preventing DNA binding of lineage-specific transcription factors at enhancers and stimulating transcription factor binding at promoters. In contrast, H2A.Z acts mainly as a transcriptional repressor that requires dynamic reloading by SRCAP throughout the cell cycle.

In the present study, fUS was leveraged to monitor the functions of developing mice from embryonic days E8.5 to E18.5, revealing its ability to capture whole-embryo activity with exceptional spatial and temporal resolutions. The data revealed a high correlation between cardiac function and body size, underscoring the pivotal role of cardiac function in embryonic growth. Moreover, brain activity across the gestational period was successfully captured, providing valuable information about brain activity during embryonic/fetal development. Thus, our study offers novel insights into embryonic functional development, laying the foundation for embryonic fUS imaging in both scientific research and clinical contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602573

This is a case of sound-symbolism, known as the Bouba-Kiki effect. Studies on four-months infants suggest that this effect might constitute a predisposed perceptual mechanism. However, these studies suffered from the impossibility of ruling out a fast experience-driven origin of the effect resulting from infants speed of learning, their sensitivity to environmental regularities, and the large number of sound-symbolic associations to which they are precociously exposed when interacting with adults. To better describe its ontogeny and fill in this gap, we tested the Bouba-Kiki effect in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). Being a precocial species, chicks can be tested on the very early days of life, allowing for a virtually total control of their experience before test. Three-day-old chicks (n=42) first learned to circumnavigate a panel to obtain a food reward. Then, they were presented with two identical panels, one depicting a spiky shape, and one depicting a round shape, while hearing either the sound  Bouba or  Kiki. We recorded which panel chicks chose with either sound, in a total of 24 trials. Chicks preferred the panel with the spiky shape when hearing the  Kiki sound, and that with the round shape when hearing the  Bouba sound. Results from naive baby chicks hint at a predisposed mechanism for matching the two dimensions of shape and sound that may be widespread across species.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602573

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded.

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602573

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505.

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1718143602573

Recently, H5 viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b have caused large outbreaks in avian and multiple non-human mammalian species1,2. Previous studies have identified molecular phenotypes of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein that contribute to pandemic potential in humans, including cell entry, receptor preference, HA stability, and reduced neutralization by polyclonal sera3-6. However, prior experimental work has only measured how these phenotypes are affected by a handful of the >10,000 different possible amino-acid mutations to HA. Here we use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning7 to measure how all mutations to a 2.3.4.4b H5 HA affect each phenotype. We identify mutations that allow HA to better bind 2-6-linked sialic acids, and show that some viruses already carry mutations that stabilize HA. We also measure how all HA mutations affect neutralization by sera from mice and ferrets vaccinated against or infected with 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses. These antigenic maps enable rapid assessment of when new viral strains have acquired mutations that may create mismatches with candidate vaccine strains. Overall, the systematic nature of deep mutational scanning combined with the safety of pseudoviruses enables comprehensive measurements of the phenotypic effects of mutations that can inform real-time interpretation of viral variation observed during surveillance of H5 influenza.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602573

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1718143602573
