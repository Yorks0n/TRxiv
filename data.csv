The central biological question about HD pathogenesis has been how the disease-causing DNA repeat expansion (CAGn) in the huntingtin (HTT) gene leads to neurodegeneration after decades of apparent latency. Inherited HTT alleles with a longer CAG repeat hasten disease onset; the length of this repeat also changes over time, generating somatic mosaicism, and genes that regulate DNA-repeat stability can influence HD age-at-onset. To understand the relationship between a cell's CAG-repeat length and its biological state, we developed a single-cell method for measuring CAG-repeat length together with genome-wide RNA expression. We found that the HTT CAG repeat expands from 40-45 CAGs to 100-500+ CAGs in HD-vulnerable SPNs but not in other striatal cell types, with these long DNA-repeat expansions acquired at different times by individual SPNs. Surprisingly, somatic expansion from 40 to 150 CAGs had no apparent effect upon gene expression - but neurons with 150-500+ CAGs shared profound gene-expression changes. These expression changes involved hundreds of genes, escalated alongside further CAG-repeat expansion, eroded positive and then negative features of neuronal identity, and culminated in expression of senescence/apoptosis genes. Rates of striatal neuron loss across HD stages reflected the rates at which neurons entered this biologically distorted state. Our results suggest that HTT CAG repeats in striatal neurons undergo decades of biologically quiet expansion, then, as they asynchronously cross a high threshold, cause SPNs to degenerate quickly and asynchronously. We conclude that, at any moment in the course of HD, most neurons have an innocuous (but unstable) huntingtin gene, and that HD pathogenesis is a DNA process for almost all of a neuron's life.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161783

Mutations identified in virus sequences obtained from persistently infected patients bear signatures of immune evasion and have some overlap with sequences present in variants of concern. We characterized virus isolates from two COVID-19 patients undergoing immunosuppressive cancer therapy, with all isolates obtained greater than 100 days after the initial COVID-19 diagnoses and compared to an isolate from the start of the infection. Isolates from an individual who never mounted an antibody response specific to SARS-CoV-2 despite the administration of convalescent plasma showed slight reductions in plaque size and some showed temperature-dependent replication attenuation on human nasal epithelial cell culture compared to the virus that initiated infection. An isolate from another patient who did mount a SARS-CoV-2 IgM response showed temperature dependent changes in plaque size as well as increased syncytia formation and escape from serum neutralizing antibody. Our results indicate that not all virus isolates from immunocompromised COVID-19 patients display clear signs of phenotypic change, but increased attention should be paid to monitoring virus evolution in this patient population.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161783

Here, we restored and reconstructed the distorted Yunxian 2 cranium using new technology. The results show that this cranium displays mosaic features of plesiomorphy and apomorphy. Phylogenetic analyses and Bayesian tip-dating including the reconstructed Yunxian 2 suggest that it is an early member of the Asian 'Dragon Man' lineage, which probably includes the Denisovans, and is the sister group of the H. sapiens lineage. Both the H. sapiens and Dragon Man lineages had deep roots extending beyond the Middle Pleistocene, and the basal position of the Yunxian fossil cranium suggests it represents a population lying close to the last common ancestor of the two lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161783

The unique insights from a genome-level perspective have revealed a striking pattern of conserved macrosynteny across huge evolutionary distances in animals, yet progress in many lineages has been hampered by the absence of genome-level data. Here, we show that the origin of Clitellata, a clade composed of most freshwater and all terrestrial species of the phylum Annelida, coincided with an unprecedented genome-wide scrambling event that resulted in massive loss of macrosynteny between marine annelids and clitellates. This complete breakdown of chromosome-level relationships on just one short branch is unlike any other known pattern of evolutionary genome rearrangement, and instead resembles chromosome shattering and reassembly seen in chromoanagenesis. These massive punctuated rearrangements included the formation of neocentromeres with newly-acquired transposable elements, and preceded a further period of genome-wide reshaping events including whole genome duplications and massive macrosyntenic reshuffling between clitellate lineages, potentially triggered by the loss of genes involved in genome stability or homeostasis of cell division. Notably, while these rearrangements broke short-range interactions observed between genes in marine annelids (including Hox), they were reformed as long-range interactions in clitellates. Our study provides evidence of punctuated genomic change via chromoanagenesis leading not only to the origin of a new animal lineage - a hopeful monster - but also to adaptive genomic changes facilitating the colonisation of new habitats.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161783

A striking example of somatic evolution is the VEXAS (Vacuoles E1 enzyme X-linked Autoinflammatory Somatic) syndrome, caused by somatic UBA1 mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), inducing treatment-refractory, systemic inflammation. However, the mechanisms that lead to survival and expansion of mutant HSCs are unknown, limiting the development of effective therapies. The lack of animal or cellular models of UBA1-mutant HSCs has hindered such mechanistic understanding, mandating analysis of primary human VEXAS samples, which harbor admixtures of wild-type and UBA1-mutant HSCs. To address these challenges, we applied single-cell multi-omics to comprehensively define mutant UBA1-induced transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and signaling pathway alterations in VEXAS patients, allowing for the direct comparison of mutant versus wild-type cells within the same environment. We confirmed the expected enrichment of UBA1M41V/T mutations in myeloid cells, and additionally discovered that these mutations were also prevalent in Natural Killer (NK) cells in VEXAS patients, providing new insights into disease phenotypes. Through mapping genotypes to molecular phenotypes, including transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, cell surface protein or intracellular protein profiles, in HSCs, we found that UBA1M41V/T-mutant cells showed an increased inflammation signature (interferon alpha and gamma response pathways), as well as activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) via pro-survival, but not pro-apoptotic, mediators of the PERK pathway, compared to UBA1 wild-type HSCs. Ex vivo validation experiments showed that inhibiting UBA1 in normal CD34+ or using UBA1-mutant HSCs led to PERK pathway up-regulation, increased myeloid differentiation and cell survival, which was reversed by PERK inhibition. Thus, we demonstrated that human VEXAS HSCs show cell-intrinsic inflammatory phenotypes and survive the proteomic stress caused by compromised ubiquitination through PERK-mediated activation of the UPR. Together, these analyses nominate PERK pathway inhibition as a potential new therapeutic strategy for eradicating the VEXAS-inducing clone, demonstrating the power of single-cell multi-omics profiling of primary patient sample to enable genotype-to-phenotype somatic mapping for the discovery of novel candidates for clinical intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

However, whether education causes longterm structural changes in the brain remains unclear. A pressing challenge is that individuals self-select into continued education, thereby introducing a wide variety of environmental and genetic confounders. Fortunately, natural experiments allow us to isolate the causal impact of increased education from individual (and societal) characteristics. Here, we exploit a policy change in the UK (the 1972 ROSLA act) that increased the amount of mandatory schooling from 15 to 16 years of age to study the impact of education on long-term structural brain outcomes in a large (n~30.000, UK Biobank) sample. Using regression discontinuity, a causal inference method, we find no effect from an additional year of education on any structural neuroimaging outcomes. This null result is robust across modalities, regions, and analysis strategies. An additional year of education is a substantial cognitive intervention, yet we find no evidence for sustained experience-dependent plasticity. Our results provide a challenge for prominent accounts of cognitive or brain reserve theories which identify education as a major protective factor to lessen adverse aging effects. Our preregistered findings are one of the first implementations of regression discontinuity on neural data; opening the door for causal inference in population-based neuroimaging.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

Using two different technologies increases the cost and the required amount of genomic DNA. Here, we show that comparable results are possible using error correction of nanopore Simplex ultra-long reads and then assembling them using existing state-of-the-art de novo assembly methods. We have developed the HERRO model based on deep learning, which corrects Simplex nanopore reads longer than 10kbp and with a quality value higher than 10. Taking into account informative positions that vary between haplotypes or segments in duplications, HERRO achieves an increase of accuracy of up to 100-fold. Combing HERRO with Verkko assembler, we achieve high contiguity on human genomes by reconstructing many chromosomes telomere-to-telomere, including chromosomes X and Y. We show that HERRO generalises well to other species and it supports both R9.4.1. and R10.4.1 nanopore Simplex reads.

Here, as proof of concept, we searched for viral remnants in sequencing reads of Neanderthal genome data by mapping to adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus, which are double stranded DNA viruses that may establish lifelong latency and can, produce persistent infections. The reconstructed ancient viral genomes of adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus revealed conserved segments, with nucleotide similarity to extant viral genomes, and variable regions in coding regions with substantial divergence to extant close relatives. Sequencing reads mapped to extant viral genomes showed deamination patterns of ancient DNA and that these ancient viral genomes showed divergence consistent with the age of these samples ({approx}50,000 years) and viral evolutionary rates (10-5 to 10-8 substitutions/site/year). Analysis of random effects shows that the Neanderthal mapping to genomes of extant persistent viruses is above the expected by random similarities of short reads. Also, negative control with a nonpersistent DNA virus does not yield statistically significant assemblies. This work demonstrates the feasibility of identifying viral genome remnants in archaeological samples with signal-to-noise assessment.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

However, there is usually no reliable method for estimating the prevalence of non-microbial reads in a metagenome, forcing many analysis techniques to make the often-faulty assumption that all reads are microbial. For instance, the success of metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) recovery efforts is assessed by the number of reads mapped to recovered MAGs, a procedure which will underestimate the true fidelity if eukaryotic reads are present. Here we present ""SingleM microbial_fraction"" (SMF), a scalable algorithm that robustly estimates the number of bacterial and archaeal reads in a metagenome, and the average microbial genome size. SMF does not use eukaryotic reference genome data and can be applied to any Illumina metagenome. Based on SMF, we propose the ""Domain-Adjusted Mapping Rate"" (DAMR) as an improved metric to assess microbial genome recovery from metagenomes. We benchmark SMF on simulated and real data, and demonstrate how DAMRs can guide genome recovery. Applying SMF to 136,284 publicly available metagenomes, we report substantial variation in microbial fractions and biome-specific patterns of microbial abundance, providing insights into how microorganisms and eukaryotes are distributed across Earth. Finally, we show that substantial amounts of human host DNA sequence data have been deposited in public metagenome repositories, possibly counter to ethical directives that mandate screening of these reads prior to release. As the adoption of metagenomic sequencing continues to grow, we foresee SMF being a valuable tool for the appraisal of genome recovery efforts, and the recovery of global patterns of microorganism distribution.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

However, the evolutionary forces driving these differences and the processes by which they emerge have remained largely uncharacterized. Here we analyze genome organization across the phylum Annelida using 23 chromosome-level annelid genomes. We find that while most annelids have maintained the conserved bilaterian genome structure, a group containing leeches and earthworms possesses completely scrambled genomes. We develop a rearrangement index to quantify the extent of genome structure evolution and show leeches and earthworms to have the most highly rearranged genomes of any currently sampled bilaterian. We further show that bilaterian genomes can be classified into two distinct categories--high and low rearrangement--largely influenced by the presence or absence, respectively, of chromosome fission events. Our findings demonstrate that animal genome structure can be highly variable within a phylum and reveal that genome rearrangement can occur both in a gradual, stepwise fashion or as rapid, all-encompassing changes over short evolutionary timescales.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

To understand the origin and evolution of these new structures, it is essential to investigate which are the genes and gene regulatory networks participating during the embryonic development of insects. Great efforts have been made to fully understand, from a gene expression and gene regulation point of view, the development of holometabolous insects, in particular Drosophila melanogaster, with the generation of numerous functional genomics resources and databases. Conversely, how hemimetabolous insects develop, and which are the dynamics of gene expression and gene regulation that control their embryogenesis, are still poorly characterized. Therefore, to provide a new platform to study gene regulation in insects, we generated ATAC-seq (Assay for transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) for the first time during the development of the mayfly Cloeon dipterum. This new available resource will allow to better understand the dynamics of gene regulation during hemimetabolan embryogenesis, since C. dipterum belongs to the paleopteran order of Ephemeroptera, the sister group to all other winged insects. These new datasets include six different time points of its embryonic development and identify accessible chromatin regions corresponding to both general and stage-specific promoters and enhancers. With these comprehensive datasets, we characterised pronounced changes in accessible chromatin between stages 8 and 10 of embryonic development, which correspond to the transition from the last stages of segmentation to organogenesis and appendage differentiation. The application of ATAC-seq in mayflies has contributed to identify the epigenetic mechanisms responsible for embryonic development in hemimetabolous insects and it will provide a fundamental resource to understand the evolution of gene regulation in winged insects.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

While EBV-IM is mostly self-limiting, symptoms like fatigue may persist over several months or even result in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). This large clinical observational study aimed at identifying risk factors for protracted courses of EBV-IM in young people.

MethodsA cohort of N=200 children, adolescents, and young adults with acute primary EBV infection was recruited from hospitals and private practices. Data on the patients medical history as well as clinical and laboratory parameters were collected at a baseline visit (V1) within four weeks after symptom onset (Tonset) and at two follow-up visits (V2 and V3) one and six months after Tonset. Risk factors for protracted symptoms at V3 were modeled using multivariable logistic regressions.

ResultsProtracted symptoms were observed in 55/183 (30.1%) and protracted fatigue in 34/181 (18.8%) patients at V3. A medical history indicating an increased susceptibility to infectious diseases as well as distinct severe IM symptoms, e.g. severe gastrointestinal symptoms, were significantly associated with protracted disease [OR: 2.31; P=0.011 and OR: 3.42; P=0.027] and with chronic fatigue [OR: 2.98; P=0.006 and OR: 3.54; P=0.034], respectively. Occurrence of twelve or more clinical and laboratory parameters until and including V1 discriminated between fatigue and no fatigue at V3 [OR 2.43, P=0.033].

ConclusionA clinical history of immune dysregulation as well as distinct severe IM symptoms might predict protracted post-viral disease and thus help in the identification of young patients at risk.

X-linked gene expression in XX females is normalized to that of XY males by X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI). However, B cells from female SLE patients and mouse models of SLE exhibit mislocalization of Xist RNA, a critical regulator of XCI, and aberrant expression of X-linked genes, suggesting that impairment of XCI may contribute to disease. Here, we find that a subset of female mice harboring a conditional deletion of Xist in B cells ('Xist cKO') spontaneously develop SLE phenotypes, including expanded activated B cell subsets, disease-specific autoantibodies, and glomerulonephritis. Moreover, pristane-induced SLE-like disease is more severe in Xist cKO mice. Activated B cells from Xist cKO mice with SLE phenotypes have increased expression of proinflammatory X-linked genes implicated in SLE. Together, this work indicates that impaired XCI maintenance in B cells directly contributes to the female-bias of SLE.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

Here, we demonstrate that the macaque is capable of synchronizing taps to a subjective beat in real music, and even spontaneously chooses to do so over alternative strategies. This contradicts the influential ""vocal learning hypothesis"" that musical beat synchronization is only possible in species with complex vocalizations such as humans and some songbirds.

Leveraging the remarkable scale and efficiency of modern sequencing, significant advancements are made across various fields, spanning from genome analysis to the intricate dynamics of protein-nucleic acid interactions. Recognizing that NGS data harbors rich biological information, the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) was established nearly 40 years ago to collect and disseminate public nucleotide sequence data and associated metadata. The National Genomics Data Center (NGDC) has also provided open access to vast amounts of raw sequence data. These databases have greatly enhanced the capacity for reanalyzing NGS data. In recent years, amid the rise of large language models, biological sequences and data have emerged as inputs for training models to address biological challenges. However, methods for programmatically accessing this public sequencing data remain limited. To address this gap, we have developed iSeq, an integrated tool that allows for quick and straightforward retrieval of metadata and NGS data via the command-line interface. iSeq is currently the only tool that supports simultaneous retrieval from multiple databases (GSA, SRA, ENA, DDBJ, and GEO). Additionally, iSeq supports a wide range of accession formats as input and features parallel downloads, multi-threaded processes, and FASTQ file merging.

The hippocampus is widely hypothesized to bind together otherwise abstract combinations of stimuli to represent such latent contexts, and to allow their use to support the process of hidden state inference. Yet, direct evidence for this remains limited. Here we show that the CA1 area of the ventral hippocampus is necessary for mice to perform hidden state inference during a 2-armed bandit task. vCA1 neurons robustly differentiate between the two abstract contexts required for this strategy in a manner similar to the differentiation of spatial locations, despite the contexts being formed only from past probabilistic outcomes.

Most eukaryotic protein secretion is encoded by an N-terminal signal peptide; however, the strong impact of signal peptide sequence variation on the secretion efficiency of a given protein is not well defined. Despite high natural signal peptide sequence diversity, most recombinant protein secretion systems employ only a few well characterised signal peptides. Additionally, the selection of promoters and terminators can significantly affect secretion efficiency, yet screening numerous genetic constructs for optimal sequences remains inefficient. Here, we have adapted a yeast G-protein coupled receptor biosensor, to measure the concentration of a peptide tag that is co-secreted with any protein of interest. Protein secretion efficiency can thus be quantified via the induction of a fluorescent reporter that is upregulated downstream of receptor activation. This enables high-throughput screening of over 6000 combinations of promoters, signal peptides and terminators, assembled using one-pot Combinatorial Golden Gate cloning. We demonstrate this biosensor can quickly identify best combinations for secretion and quantify secretion levels.

We investigated this question here using mice. First, application of the endotoxin and neuroinflammatory mimetic Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to primary hippocampal neurons alone did not alter their activity but triggered neuronal excitation in mixed neuronal/glial co- or tri-cultures, providing initial indications of the potential mechanism causing neuroinflammation and the associated behavioural change. We next demonstrated this directly, because intra-hippocampal administration of LPS disrupted both instrumental responding and Pavlovian approach in a sex-specific manner, whereas it enhanced goal-directed action control and locomotor activity consistently across sexes. Finally, we showed that although LPS elicited a similar neuroinflammatory response in male and female mice, it increased neuronal activation in females and decreased it in males, providing evidence of a sexually dimorphic effect.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

The most prominent consequence is the modification of guanine into 8-hydroxyguanine (8-oxo-dG), which has important mutagenic potential and plays a role in methylation-mediated gene regulation. Methods to simultaneously detect and quantify 8-oxo-dG within its genomic context have been lacking; mainly because these methods rely on indirect detection or are based on hydrolysis of the DNA. Nanopore sequencing has been deployed for the direct detection of base-modifications like cytosine methylation during sequencing. However, currently there is no model to detect 8-oxo-dG by nanopore sequencing due to the lack of training data. Here, we developed a strategy based on synthetic oligos to create long DNA molecules with context variability for effective deep learning and nanopore sequencing. Moreover, we showcase a training approach suitable to deal with the extreme scarceness of 8-oxo-dG compared to canonical G to enable specific 8-oxo-dG detection. Applied to an inducible tissue culture system for oxidative DNA damage, our approach reveals variable 8-oxo-dG distribution across the genome, a dissimilar context pattern to C>A mutations, and concurrent 5-mC depletion within a 2-kilobase window surrounding 8-oxo-dG sites. These findings not only underscore the potential of nanopore sequencing in epigenetic research, but also shed light on 8-oxo-dG's role in genomic regulation. By simultaneously measuring 5-mC and 8-oxo-dG at single molecule resolution, our study provides insights into the functional interplay between these DNA modifications. Moreover, our approach using synthetic oligos to generate a ground truth from machine learning modification calling could be applied to any other DNA modification. Overall, our work contributes to advancing the field of epigenetics and highlights nanopore sequencing as a powerful tool for studying DNA modifications.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

KRAS mutations were 3.8-fold more common in adenocarcinomas of never smokers from North America and Europe, while a 1.6-fold higher prevalence of EGFR and TP53 mutations was observed in adenocarcinomas from East Asia. Signature SBS40a, with unknown cause, was found in most samples and accounted for the largest proportion of single base substitutions in adenocarcinomas, being enriched in EGFR-mutated cases. Conversely, the aristolochic acid signature SBS22a was almost exclusively observed in patients from Taipei. Even though LCINS exposed to secondhand smoke had an 8.3% higher mutational burden and 5.4% shorter telomeres, passive smoking was not associated with driver mutations in cancer driver genes or the activities of individual mutational signatures. In contrast, patients from regions with high levels of air pollution were more likely to have TP53 mutations while exhibiting shorter telomeres and an increase in most types of somatic mutations, including a 3.9-fold elevation of signature SBS4 (q-value=3.1 x 10-5), previously linked mainly to tobacco smoking, and a 76% increase of clock-like signature SBS5 (q-value=5.0 x 10-5). A positive dose-response effect was observed with air pollution levels, which correlated with both a decrease in telomere length and an elevation in somatic mutations, notably attributed to signatures SBS4 and SBS5.

This sensory transmission necessitates rapid and sustained neurotransmitter release, which relies on a large pool of synaptic vesicles at the hair-cell presynapse. Work in neurons has shown that kinesin motor proteins traffic synaptic material along microtubules to the presynapse, but how new synaptic material reaches the presynapse in hair cells is not known. We show that the kinesin motor protein Kif1a and an intact microtubule network are necessary to enrich synaptic vesicles at the presynapse in hair cells. We use genetics and pharmacology to disrupt Kif1a function and impair microtubule networks in hair cells of the zebrafish lateral-line system. We find that these manipulations decrease synaptic-vesicle populations at the presynapse in hair cells. Using electron microscopy, along with in vivo calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we show that a diminished supply of synaptic vesicles adversely affects ribbon-synapse function. Kif1a mutants exhibit dramatic reductions in spontaneous vesicle release and evoked postsynaptic calcium responses. Additionally, we find that kif1a mutants exhibit impaired rheotaxis, a behavior reliant on the ability of hair cells in the lateral line to respond to sustained flow stimuli. Overall, our results demonstrate that Kif1a-based microtubule transport is critical to enrich synaptic vesicles at the active zone in hair cells, a process that is vital for proper ribbon-synapse function.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

We demonstrated that the nucleoside-modified mRNA drives the production of type I interferons that act on DCs to induce their maturation and the induction of Th1-biased Tfh responses.

Here, we present a refined approach detailing a protocol for modeling such interactions at a CG level using the Martini 3 force field. Using this approach, we studied Mincle and identified critical parameters governing ligand recognition, such as loop flexibility and the regulation of hydrophobic groove formation by calcium ions.

A key prediction of this expectation is that the level of genetic diversity in a population should scale with population size. However, as was noted by Richard Lewontin in 1974 and reaffirmed by later studies, the relationship between population size and diversity in nature is much weaker than expected. We hypothesize that one contributor to this apparent paradox is that current methods relying on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) called from aligning short reads to a reference genome underestimate levels of genetic diversity in many species. To test this idea, we calculated nucleotide diversity ({pi}) and k-mer-based metrics of genetic diversity across 112 plant species, amounting to over 205 terabases of DNA sequencing data from 27,488 individual plants. We then compared how these different metrics correlated with proxies of population size that account for both range size and population density variation across species. We found that our population size proxies scaled anywhere from about 3 to over 20 times faster with k-mer diversity than nucleotide diversity after adjusting for evolutionary history, mating system, life cycle habit, cultivation status, and invasiveness. The relationship between k-mer diversity and population size proxies also remains significant after correcting for genome size, whereas the analogous relationship for nucleotide diversity does not. These results suggest that variation not captured by common SNP-based analyses explains part of Lewontin's paradox in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

In this manuscript we introduce PSAURON (Protein Sequence Assessment Using a Reference ORF Network), a novel software tool developed to assess the quality of protein-coding gene annotations. Utilizing a machine learning model trained on a diverse dataset from over 1000 plant and animal genomes, PSAURON assigns a score to coding DNA or protein sequence that reflects the likelihood that the sequence is a genuine protein coding region. PSAURON scores can be used for genome-wide protein annotation assessment as well as the rapid identification of potentially spurious annotated proteins. Validation against established benchmarks demonstrates PSAURON's effectiveness and correlation with recognized measures of protein quality, highlighting its potential use as a general-purpose method to evaluate gene annotation.

Here, we performed longitudinal in vivo imaging of cortical astrocytes after focal astrocyte ablation in mice. We discovered that perilesional astrocytes develop a remarkable plasticity for efficient lesion repopulation. A subset of mature astrocytes transforms into reactive progenitor-like (REPL) astrocytes that not only undergo multiple asymmetric divisions but also remain in a multinucleated interstage. This regenerative response facilitates efficient migration of newly formed daughter cell nuclei towards unoccupied astrocyte territories. Our findings define the cellular principles of astrocyte plasticity upon focal lesion, unravelling the REPL phenotype as a fundamental regenerative strategy of mature astrocytes to restore astrocytic networks in the adult mammalian brain. Promoting this regenerative phenotype bears therapeutic potential for neurological conditions involving glial dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

However, the lipid membranes in which nanopores reside can be unstable in the presence of biological fluids. Here, membranes formed with the amphiphilic polymers PMOXA-PDMS-PMOXA and PBD-PEO are tested as potential alternatives for nanopore sensing. We demonstrate that polymer membranes can possess increased stability towards applied potentials and high concentrations of human serum, but that the stable insertion of a wide range of biological nanopores is most often compromised. Alternatively, hybrid polymer-lipid membranes comprising a 1:1 w/w mixture of PBD11PEO8 and DPhPC showed high electrical and biochemical stability while creating a suitable environment for all tested nanopores. Analytes such as proteins, DNA and sugars were efficiently sampled, indicating that in hybrid membranes nanopores showed native-like properties. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that lipids form ~12 nm domains interspersed by a polymer matrix. Nanopores partitioned into these lipid nanodomains and sequestered lipids possibly offering the same binding strength as in a native bilayer.

The recurrent evolution of this adaptation is achieved through changes in the expression and localisation of several enzymes and transporters that are conventionally used in non-photosynthetic metabolism. These alterations result in the establishment of a biochemical CO2 pump that increases the concentration of CO2 around rubisco in a cellular environment where rubisco is protected from oxygen thus preventing the occurrence of photorespiration. A key step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis is the change in subcellular localisation of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity from the mesophyll cell chloroplast to the cytosol, where it catalyzes the first biochemical step of the C4 pathway. Here, we achieve this key step in C4 evolution in the C3 plant Oryza sativa (rice) using genome editing. We show that editing the chloroplast transit peptide of the primary CA isoform in the leaf results in relocalisation of leaf CA activity from the chloroplast to the cytosol. Through analysis of fluorescence induction kinetics in these CA relocalisation lines we uncover a role a new role for chloroplast CA in photosynthetic induction. We also reveal that relocalisation of CA activity to the cytosol causes no detectable perturbation to plant growth or leaf-level CO2 assimilation. Collectively, this work uncovers a novel role for chloroplast CA in C3 plants, and demonstrates that it is possible to achieve a key step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis by genome editing.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

However, whether SARS-CoV-2 proteins can be directly targeted for ISGylation remains elusive. In this study, we identified the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 as a major substrate of ISGylation catalyzed by the host E3 ligase HERC5; however, N ISGylation is readily removed through de-ISGylation by the papain-like protease (PLpro) activity of NSP3. Mass spectrometry analysis identified that the N protein undergoes ISGylation at four lysine residues (K266, K355, K387 and K388), and mutational analysis of these sites in the context of a SARS-CoV-2 replicon (N-4KR) abolished N ISGylation and alleviated ISGylation-mediated inhibition of viral RNA synthesis. Furthermore, our results indicated that HERC5 targets preferentially phosphorylated N protein for ISGylation to regulate its oligomeric assembly. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which the host ISGylation machinery directly targets SARS-CoV-2 proteins to restrict viral replication and illuminate how an intricate interplay of host (HERC5) and viral (PLpro) enzymes coordinates viral protein ISGylation and thereby regulates virus replication.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

Among them, channelrhodopsins are light-induced ion channels making them popular tools for modulating neuronal activity in optogenetics. Cation channelrhodopsins (CCRs), first recognized as the main photoreceptors in the model chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, have since been identified in diverse species of green algae, as well in other unicellular eukaryotes. The CCRs from non-chlorophyte species are commonly referred to as the bacteriorhodopsin-like channelrhodopsins, or BCCRs, as most of them feature the three characteristic amino acid residues of the DTD motif in the third transmembrane helix (TM3 or helix C) matching the canonical DTD motif of the well-studied archaeal light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin. Here, we report characterization of HulaCCR, a novel BCCR identified through metatranscriptomic analysis of a unicellular eukaryotic community in Lake Hula, Israel. Interestingly, HulaCCR has an ETD motif in TM3 in which the first residue of the canonical motif is substituted for glutamate. Electrophysiological measurements of the wild-type and a mutant with a DTD motif of HulaCCR suggest the critical role of the first glutamate in spectral tuning and gating. Additionally, HulaCCR exhibits long extensions at the N- and C-termini. Photocurrents recorded from a truncated variant without the signal peptide predicted at the N-terminus were diminished, and membrane localization of the truncated variant significantly decreased, which indicates that the signal peptide is important for membrane trafficking of HulaCCR. These characteristics of HulaCCR would be related to a new biological significance in the original unidentified species, distinct from those known for other BCCRs.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

To understand why these cycles occur, much work has been done to model the genomic consequences and evolutionary significance of WGD. Since the machinations of diploidization are strongly influenced by the mode of speciation (whether a lineage was derived from ancient allo or autopolyploid), methods which can classify ancient whole genome duplication events as allo or auto are of great importance. Here we present a forward-time polyploid genome evolution simulator called SpecKS. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate that allo and autopolyploid-derived species exhibit differently shaped Ks histograms. We also demonstrate sensitivity of the Ks histogram to the effective population size (Ne) of the ancestral species. Our findings indicate that error in the common method of estimating WGD time from the Ks histogram peak scales with the degree of allopolyploidy, and we present an alternative, accurate estimation method that is independent of the degree of allopolyploidy. Lastly, we use SpecKS results to derive tests that reveal whether a genome is descended from allo or autopolyploidy, and whether the ancestral species had a high or low Ne. We apply this test to transcriptomic data for over 200 species across the plant kingdom, validating the theory that the majority of angiosperm lineages are derived from allopolyploidization events.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

Four taxa were found across all samples, establishing that there are multiple endosymbionts that consistently inhabit the Azolla leaf pocket. We found varying degrees of co-diversification across these taxa as well as varying degrees of isolation by distance and of pseudogenation, which implies that the endosymbiotic community is transmitted by a mix of horizontal and vertical mechanisms, and that some members of the microbiome are more facultative symbionts than others.

In contrast to conventional database searching methods, deep learning models excel in de novo sequencing peptides absent from existing databases, thereby facilitating the identification and analysis of novel peptide sequences. Current deep learning models for peptide sequencing predominantly use an autoregressive generation approach, where early errors can cascade, largely affecting overall sequence accuracy. And the usage of sequential decoding algorithms such as beam search suffers from the low inference speed. To address this, we introduce pi-PrimeNovo, a non-autoregressive Transformer-based deep learning model designed to perform accurate and efficient de novo peptide sequencing. With the proposed novel architecture, pi-PrimeNovo achieves significantly higher accuracy and up to 69x faster sequencing compared to the state-of-the-art methods. This remarkable speed makes it highly suitable for computation-extensive peptide sequencing tasks such as metaproteomic research, where pi-PrimeNovo efficiently identifies the microbial species-specific peptides. Moreover, pi-PrimeNovo has been demonstrated to have a powerful capability in accurately mining phosphopeptides in a non-enriched phosphoproteomic dataset, showing an alternative solution to detect low-abundance post-translational modifications (PTMs).

Here, to advance in this direction, we developed ControLD (Controlled Trapping of Lipid Droplets), a novel approach designed to manipulate LDs and influence their dynamics and life cycle. By orchestrating the assembly/disassembly of engineered condensates, ControLD allows precise sequestration and release of LDs in cells. This technique effectively isolates LDs from the intracellular environment, drastically reducing interactions with other organelles. Notably, our experiments demonstrate that physically isolating LDs impairs their dynamics and remobilization during metabolic needs. ControLD represents a versatile tool for reversible LD trapping, with potential applications in controlling various cellular organelles.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

However, it remains challenging to integrate and interpret multi-omics data. Graph neural network (GNN) AI models have been widely used to analyze graph-structure datasets and are ideal for integrative multi-omics data analysis because they can naturally integrate and represent multi-omics data as a biologically meaningful multi-level signaling graph and interpret multi-omics data by node and edge ranking analysis for signaling flow/cascade inference. However, it is non-trivial for graph-AI model developers to pre-analyze multi-omics data and convert them into graph-structure data for individual samples, which can be directly fed into graph-AI models. To resolve this challenge, we developed mosGraphGen (multi-omics signaling graph generator), a novel computational tool that generates multi-omics signaling graphs of individual samples by mapping the multi-omics data onto a biologically meaningful multi-level background signaling network. With mosGraphGen, AI model developers can directly apply and evaluate their models using these mos-graphs.

Here, we report the development of the tagless LysoIP method to enable rapid enrichment of lysosomes, via immunoprecipitation, using the endogenous integral lysosomal membrane protein TMEM192, directly from clinical samples and human cell lines (e.g. induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSCs) derived neurons).

To validate our approach, we employed the tagless LysoIP to enrich lysosomes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from fresh blood of patients with CLN3 disease, a neurodegenerative LSD. Metabolic profiling of isolated lysosomes showed massive accumulation of glycerophosphodiesters (GPDs) in patients' lysosomes. Interestingly, a patient with a milder phenotype and genotype displayed lower accumulation of lysosomal GPDs, consistent with their potential role as disease biomarkers.

Within spatial biology, spatial transcriptomics platforms are among the most advanced, allowing researchers to characterize the expression of thousands of genes across space. These new technologies are transforming our understanding of how cells are organized in space and communicate with each other to determine emergent phenotypes with unprecedented granularity. This is particularly important in cancer research, as it is becoming evident that tumor evolution is shaped not only by the genetic properties of cancer cells but also by how they interact with the tumor microenvironment and their spatial organization. While many platforms can generate spatial transcriptomics profiles, it is still unclear in which context each platform better suits the needs of its users. Here we compare the results obtained using 4 different spatial transcriptomics (VISIUM, VISIUM CytAssist, Xenium and CosMx) and one spatial proteomics (VISIUM CytAssist) platforms across serial sections of 6 FFPE samples from primary human tumors covering some of the most common forms of the disease (lung, breast, colorectal, bladder, lymphoma and ovary). We observed that the VISIUM platform with CytAssist chemistry yielded superior data quality. Xenium consistently produced more reliable results for in situ platforms, with better gene clustering and fewer false positives than CosMx. Interestingly, these platform-based variations didn't significantly affect cell type identification. Finally, by comparing VISIUM protein profiles with the spatial transcriptomics data from all four platforms on each sample, we identified several genes with mismatched RNA and protein expression patterns, highlighting the importance of multi-omics profiling for a more comprehensive understanding.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

Here we report that a nitrogenase-like enzyme (NFL) and a radical SAM enzyme (RSE) are involved in the novel anaerobic assimilation pathway of a sulfonate, isethionate, in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus. The nflHDK genes for NFL are localized at a locus containing genes for known sulfonate metabolism in the genome. A gene nflB encoding an RSE is present just upstream of nflH, forming a small gene cluster nflBHDK. Mutants lacking any nflBHDK genes lost the ability to grow with isethionate as the sole sulfur source under anaerobic photosynthetic conditions, indicating that all four NflBHDK proteins are essential for the isethionate assimilation pathway. Heterologous expression of the islAB genes encoding a known isethionate lyase that degrades isethionate to sulfite and acetaldehyde restored the isethionate-dependent growth of a mutant lacking nflDK, indicating that the enzyme encoding nflBHDK is involved in an isethionate assimilation reaction to release sulfite. Furthermore, heterologous expression of nflBHDK and ssuCAB encoding an isethionate transporter in the closely related species R. sphaeroides, which does not have nflBHDK and cannot grow with isethionate as the sole sulfur source, conferred isethionate-dependent growth ability to this species. We propose to rename nflBHDK as isrBHDK (isethionate reductase). The isrBHDK genes are widely distributed among various prokaryote phyla. Discovery of the isethionate assimilation pathway by IsrBHDK provides a missing piece for the anaerobic sulfur cycle and for understanding the evolution of ancient sulfur metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

In zebrafish, this reprogramming step is achieved by the pioneer factors Nanog, Pou5f3, and Sox19b (NPS). Yet, it remains unclear whether cells lacking this reprogramming step are directed towards wild type states or towards novel developmental canals in the Waddington landscape of embryonic development. Here we investigate the developmental fate of embryonic cells mutant for NPS by analyzing their single-cell gene expression profiles. We find that cells lacking the first developmental reprogramming steps can acquire distinct cell states. These states are manifested by gene expression modules that result from a failure of nuclear reprogramming, the persistence of the maternal program, and the activation of somatic compensatory programs. As a result, most mutant cells follow new developmental canals and acquire new mixed cell states in development. In contrast, a group of mutant cells acquire primordial germ cell-like states, suggesting that NPS-dependent reprogramming is dispensable for these cell states. Together, these results demonstrate that developmental reprogramming after fertilization is required to differentiate most canonical developmental programs, and loss of the transient totipotent state canalizes embryonic cells into new developmental states in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

This has led the World Health Organization and the CDC to categorize MDR A. baumannii as a top priority for the research and development of new antibiotics. Colistin is the last-resort antibiotic to treat carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. Not surprisingly, reintroduction of colistin has resulted in the emergence of colistin-resistant strains. Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used to treat pain and inflammation associated with arthritis. In this work, we show that diclofenac sensitizes colistin-resistant A. baumannii clinical strains to colistin, in vitro and in a murine model of pneumonia. Diclofenac also reduced the colistin MIC of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed an upregulation of oxidative stress-related genes and downregulation of type IV pili induced by the combination treatment. Notably, the concentrations of colistin and diclofenac effective in the murine model were substantially lower than those determined in vitro, implying a stronger synergistic effect in vivo compared to in vitro. A pilA mutant strain, lacking the primary component of the type IV pili, became sensitive to colistin in the absence of diclofenac. This suggest that the downregulation of type IV pili is key for the synergistic activity of these drugs in vivo and indicates that colistin and diclofenac exert an anti-virulence effect. Together, these results suggest that the diclofenac can be repurposed with colistin to treat MDR A. baumannii.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

A phylogenetically diverse subset of extant cyanobacteria can perform photosynthesis with far-red light through a process called far-red light photoacclimation, or FaRLiP. This phenotype is enabled by a cluster of ~20 genes, and involves the synthesis of red-shifted chlorophylls f and d, together with paralogues of the ubiquitous photosynthetic machinery used in visible light. The FaRLiP gene cluster is present in diverse, environmentally important cyanobacterial groups but its origin, evolutionary history, and connection to early biotic environments have remained unclear. This study takes advantage of the recent increase in (meta)genomic data to clarify this issue; sequence data mining, metagenomic assembly, and phylogenetic tree networks were used to recover more than 600 new FaRLiP gene sequences, corresponding to 52 new gene clusters. These data enable high-resolution phylogenetics and - by relying on multiple gene trees, together with gene arrangement conservation - support FaRLiP appearing early in cyanobacterial evolution. Sampling information shows that considerable FaRLiP diversity can be observed in microbialites to the present day, and the process may have been associated with microbial mats and stromatolite formation in the early Paleoproterozoic. The ancestral FaRLiP cluster was reconstructed, revealing a conserved intergenic regulatory sequence that has been maintained for billions of years. Taken together, our results indicate that oxygenic photosynthesis using far-red light may have played a significant role in Earth's early history.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

Loss of L2hgdh activity in humans induces ectopic L-2HG accumulation, resulting in neurodevelopmental defects, altered immune cell function, and enhanced growth of clear cell renal cell carcinomas. To better understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie these disease pathologies, we used the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the endogenous functions of L2hgdh. Our studies revealed that while L2hgdh is not essential for growth or viability under standard culture conditions, L2hgdh mutants are hypersensitive to hypoxia and expire during the reoxygenation phase with severe disruptions of mitochondrial metabolism. Moreover, we find that the fly renal system (Malpighian tubules; MTs) is a key site of L2hgdh activity, as L2hgdh mutants that express a rescuing transgene within the MTs survive hypoxia treatment and exhibit normal levels of mitochondrial metabolites. We also demonstrate that even under normoxic conditions, L2hgdh mutant MTs experience significant metabolic stress and are sensitized to aberrant growth upon Egfr activation. Overall, our findings present a model in which renal L2hgdh activity limits systemic L-2HG accumulation, thus indirectly regulating the balance between glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, enabling successful recovery from hypoxia exposure, and ensuring renal tissue integrity.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

Its protein binding is unpredictable, particularly among critically ill patients who may experience unexpectedly elevated free concentrations. We sought to identify the clinical consequences and determinants of occult free valproate toxicity in critically ill adults. Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) who were receiving valproate and had concurrent total and free valproate concentrations measured. We examined whether valproate concentrations were independently associated with adverse drug effects (ADEs) including thrombocytopenia, hepatotoxicity, hyperammonemia, and pancreatic injury. Determinants of occult toxicity were also identified using logistic mixed-effects models, adjusting for age, weight, albumin, propofol and aspirin use, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Occult toxicity was defined as a free valproate concentration that was discordant with total concentration (e.g., supratherapeutic free concentration associated with therapeutic total concentration). Results: 311 unique patients (mean age 58 [{+/-}17] years, 36% female, 31% non-white, and 29% on valproate prior to admission) with 550 concurrent free and total valproate concentration pairs met inclusion criteria. The median (IQR) total valproate concentration was 46 mcg/mL (34-63) and the median free valproate concentration was 17 mcg/ml (11-23); median free fraction was 35% (25-63%). Eighty-four percent of total valproate concentrations represented occult free toxicity; a therapeutic total with a supratherapeutic free valproate concentration was the most common pattern (32% of concentration pairs). Each 2.5 mcg/mL increase in free valproate concentration was associated with thrombocytopenia (adjusted unit odds 1.15, 95% CI 1.05-1.26) and hepatotoxicity (adjusted unit odds 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1.18). Albumin concentration (adjusted odds; aOR 0.17, 95% CI 0.08-0.36), BUN (aOR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09-1.70), and propofol exposure (aOR 3.06, 95% CI 1.38-6.79) were associated with occult toxicity. Conclusion: Free valproate concentrations should be measured in critically ill patients because it is associated with ADEs and is often underrepresented by total concentrations. Most critically ill patients are at risk, especially those with hypoalbuminemia, uremia, and lipid exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1716329161784

To benefit navigation, this representation must be dynamically related to surrounding locations2. A candidate mechanism for linking places along an animals path has been described in place cells, where the sequence of spikes within each cycle of the hippocampal theta oscillation encodes a trajectory from the animals current location towards upcoming locations6-8. In mazes that bifurcate, such trajectories alternately traverse the two upcoming arms as the animal approaches the choice point9,10, raising the possibility that the trajectories express available forward paths encoded on previous trials10. However, to bridge the animals path with the wider environment, beyond places previously or subsequently visited, an experience-independent spatial sampling mechanism might be required. Here we show in freely moving rats, that within individual theta cycles, ensembles of grid cells and place cells encode a position signal that sweeps linearly outwards from the animals location into the ambient environment, with sweep direction alternating stereotypically between left and right across successive theta cycles. These sweeps were accompanied by, and aligned with, a similarly alternating directional signal in a discrete population of parasubiculum cells with putative connections to grid cells via conjunctive gridxdirection cells. Sweeps extended into never-visited locations that were inaccessible to the animal and persisted during REM sleep. Sweep directions could be explained by an algorithm that maximizes cumulative coverage of surrounding space. The sustained and unconditional expression of theta-patterned left-right-alternating sweeps in the entorhinal-hippocampal positioning system provides an efficient  look-around mechanism for sampling locations beyond the travelled path.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

However, analyzing and integrating scRNA-seq data poses unique computational challenges due to sparsity, high variability, and technical batch effects. Here, we propose a novel framework called scDecorr for robust representation learning and data integration for scRNA-seq analysis. Our approach leverages the idea of feature decorrelation-based self-supervised learning (SSL) to obtain efficient low-dimensional representations of individual cells without relying on negative samples. By maximizing similarity among distorted embeddings while decorrelating their components, scDecorr captures the biological signature while eliminating technical noise. Furthermore, scDecorr incorporates unsupervised domain adaptation to bridge the gap between batches with different probability distributions, enabling effective integration of scRNA-seq data from diverse sources. Our framework achieves domain-invariant representations by learning cell embeddings independently across domains and employing domain-specific batch normalization. We evaluate scDecorr on a variety of single cell datasets and demonstrate its ability to integrate batches without losing the inherent biological variance, thereby facilitating optimal clustering.

In this study, we analyzed the extracellular vesicle (EV) proteome using cell culture supernatants. Unexpectedly, many plasmodesmata proteins were identified. The comparison between the cell culture EV proteome and the plasmodesmata proteome revealed that EV and plasmodesmata proteins were indistinguishable. Highly sensitive imaging analyses showed that PDLP3, a representative plasmodesmata marker, was localized to plasmodesmata, but it was also present as small granules in apoplast regions. The small PDLP3 granules were similar in size to the EVs, implying that the PDLPs identified during the proteomic analysis may be small PDLP granules secreted into apoplast regions, rather than proteins derived from the plasmodesmata itself. Next, we attempted to distinguish EV proteins from plasmodesmata proteins. The step-wise density gradient ultracentrifugation and clustering analysis separated EV protein clusters (represented by tetraspanins and membrane trafficking proteins) from plasmodesmata clusters (represented by PDLPs and PDCBs). These results provide the basis for future explorations of plant plasmodesmata and EVs.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

However, unintended bystander editing beyond the target nucleotide poses a challenge to their translation into effective therapies. While many efforts have been made in the design of a universal enzyme with minimal bystander editing, the context dependent activity represents a major challenge for base editing-based therapies. In this work, we designed a sequence-specific guide RNA library with 3-extensions and detected guides that were able to reduce bystander and increase editing efficiency in a context dependent manner. The best candidate was later used for phage assisted non-continuous evolution to find a new generation of precise base editors. Simultaneously, we use protein language models trained on massive protein sequence datasets to find the evolutionarily plausible mutational patterns that can improve deaminase activity and precision. Both strategies provide a collection of precise TadA variants that not only drastically reduced bystander edits, but also was not in detriment of on-target activity. Our findings introduce a guide/enzyme parallel engineering pipeline, which lays the foundation for the development of new personalized genome editing strategies, ultimately enhancing the safety and precision of this groundbreaking technology.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

Critical next steps are to infer which and how many cell types are truly causal for a disease (after accounting for co-regulation across cell types), and to understand how individual variants impact disease risk through single or multiple causal cell types. Here, we propose CT-FM and CT-FM-SNP, two methods that leverage cell-type-specific cREs to fine-map causal cell types for a trait and for its candidate causal variants, respectively. We applied CT-FM to 63 GWAS summary statistics (average N = 417K) using nearly one thousand cRE annotations, primarily coming from ENCODE4. CT-FM inferred 81 causal cell types with corresponding SNP-annotations explaining a high fraction of trait SNP-heritability (~2/3 of the SNP-heritability explained by existing cREs), identified 16 traits with multiple causal cell types, highlighted cell-disease relationships consistent with known biology, and uncovered previously unexplored cellular mechanisms in psychiatric and immune-related diseases. Finally, we applied CT-FM-SNP to 39 UK Biobank traits and predicted high confidence causal cell types for 2,798 candidate causal non-coding SNPs. Our results suggest that most SNPs impact a phenotype through a single cell type, and that pleiotropic SNPs target different cell types depending on the phenotype context. Altogether, CT-FM and CT-FM-SNP shed light on how genetic variants act collectively and individually at the cellular level to impact disease risk.","NA","medrxiv",1716329161784

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the 2023-2024 formulation of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine protects against COVID-19 caused by the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2. Methods. Employees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses. Results. Among 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001). Conclusions. The 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1716329161784

Although such host-induced gene silencing is well-documented, the molecular mechanisms by which RNAs can move from the cytoplasm of plant cells across the plasma membrane of both the host cell and fungal cell are poorly understood. Indirect evidence suggests that this RNA transfer may occur at a very early stage of the infection process, prior to breach of the host cell wall, suggesting that silencing RNAs might be secreted onto leaf surfaces. To assess whether Arabidopsis plants possess a mechanism for secreting RNA onto leaf surfaces, we developed a protocol for isolating leaf surface RNA separately from intercellular (apoplastic) RNA. This protocol yielded abundant leaf surface RNA that displayed an RNA banding pattern distinct from apoplastic RNA, suggesting that it may be secreted directly from the leaf surface rather than exuded through stomata or hydathodes. Notably, this RNA was not associated with either extracellular vesicles or protein complexes; however, RNA species longer than 100 nucleotides could be pelleted by ultracentrifugation. Pelleting was inhibited by the divalent cation chelator EGTA, suggesting that these RNAs may form condensates on the leaf surface. These leaf surface RNAs are derived almost exclusively from Arabidopsis, but come from diverse genomic sources, including rRNA, tRNA, mRNA, intergenic RNA, microRNAs, and small interfering RNAs, with tRNAs especially enriched. We speculate that endogenous leaf surface RNA plays an important role in the assembly of distinct microbial communities on leaf surfaces.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

In particular, the contribution of the stromal microenvironment to pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis requires further exploration. Here, we report the stromal roles of the synaptic protein Netrin G1 Ligand (NGL-1) in pancreatic cancer, uncovering its pro-tumor functions in cancer-associated fibroblasts and in immune cells. We observed that the stromal expression of NGL-1 inversely correlated with patient overall survival. Moreover, germline knockout (KO) mice for NGL-1 presented decreased tumor burden, with a microenvironment that is less supportive of tumor growth. Of note, tumors from NGL-1 KO mice produced less immunosuppressive cytokines and displayed an increased percentage of CD8+ T cells than those from control mice, while preserving the physical structure of the tumor microenvironment. These effects were shown to be mediated by NGL-1 in both immune cells and in the local stroma, in a TGF-{beta}-dependent manner. While myeloid cells lacking NGL-1 decreased the production of immunosuppressive cytokines, NGL-1 KO T cells showed increased proliferation rates and overall polyfunctionality compared to control T cells. CAFs lacking NGL-1 were less immunosuppressive than controls, with overall decreased production of pro-tumor cytokines and compromised ability to inhibit CD8+ T cells activation. Mechanistically, these CAFs downregulated components of the TGF-{beta} pathway, AP-1 and NFAT transcription factor families, resulting in a less tumor-supportive phenotype. Finally, targeting NGL-1 genetically or using a functionally antagonistic small peptide phenocopied the effects of chemotherapy, while modulating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), rather than eliminating it. We propose NGL-1 as a new local stroma and immunomodulatory molecule, with pro-tumor roles in pancreatic cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

In Gabon, Anopheles coluzzii, a major African malaria mosquito is found along an ecological gradient, including a sylvatic population, away of any human presence. This study delves into the genomic signatures of local adaptation of populations adapted to distinct environments including the urban area of Libreville, and two proximate sites 10km apart in the La Lope National Park (LLP), a village and its sylvatic neighborhood. Whole genome re-sequencing of 96 mosquitoes unveiled 8764;5.7millions high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms. Coalescent-based demographic analyses suggest an 8764;8,000-year-old divergence between Libreville and La Lope populations, followed by a secondary contact (8764;4,000 ybp) resulting in asymmetric effective gene flow. The urban population displayed reduced effective size, evidence of inbreeding, and strong selection pressures to the adaptation to urban settings, as suggested by the hard selective sweeps associated with genes involved in detoxification and insecticide resistance. In contrast, the two geographically proximate LLP populations showed larger effective size, and distinctive genomic differences in selective signals, notably soft-selective sweeps on the standing genetic variation. Although neutral loci and chromosomal inversions failed to discriminate between LLP populations, our findings support that microgeographic adaptation can swiftly emerge through selection on standing genetic variation despite high gene flow. This study contributes to the growing understanding of evolution of populations in heterogeneous environments amid ongoing gene flow and how major malaria mosquitoes adapt to human.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

However, most cis regulatory elements (CREs) are highly divergent, which makes orthology tracing based on sequence similarity difficult, especially at larger evolutionary distances. Some evidence suggests functional conservation of CREs despite sequence divergence. However, it remains unclear how widespread such functional conservation might be.

Here, we address this question by profiling the regulatory genome in the embryonic hearts of chicken and mouse at equivalent developmental stages. Gene expression and 3D chromatin structure show remarkable similiarity, while the majority of CREs are non-alignable between the two species. To identify orthologous CREs independent of sequence alignability, we introduce a synteny-based strategy called Interspecies Point Projection (IPP). Compared to alignment-based approaches, IPP identifies up to 5-fold more putative orthologs in chicken, and up to 9-fold across distantly related vertebrates. We term these sequence-diverged orthologs indirectly conserved and characterize their functional conservation compared to sequence-alignable, directly conserved CREs. Indirectly and directly conserved elements show similar enrichment of functional chromatin signatures and cell-type specific enhancer sequence composition. Yet, shared transcription factor binding sites between orthologs are more heavily rearranged in indirectly conserved elements. Finally, we validate functional conservation of indirectly conserved chicken enhancers in mouse using in vivo reporter assays. Taken together, by overcoming the limitations of alignment-based methods our results reveal functional conservation of CREs across large evolutionary distances is more widespread than previously recognized.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

An explanation for this discrepancy has been lacking. In this study, we developed an assay to track the fate of elongating RNAPII at sites of UV-induced DNA lesions. Employing this method on an isogenic collection of TCR knockout cells reveals a selective RNAPII clearance defect in cells defective in CSA or CSB, in contrast to knockouts of other TCR genes.

The emergence of single-cell lineage tracing technologies now enables the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees for thousands of individual cells within a multicellular organism, opening avenues for employing PI methodologies at the cellular level. However, the intricate process of cell differentiation poses challenges for directly applying current PI frameworks in somatic tissues. Here, we introduce a novel computational approach called single-cell phylodynamic explorer (scPhyloX), designed to model structured cell populations in various cell states, by leveraging single-cell phylogenetic trees to infer dynamics of tissue development and tumor evolution. Our comprehensive simulations demonstrate the high accuracy of scPhyloX across various biological scenarios. Application of scPhyloX to three real datasets of single-cell lineage tracing unveils novel insights into somatic dynamics, such as the overshoot of cycling stem cell populations in fly organ development, clonal expansion of multipotent progenitors of hematopoiesis during human aging, and pronounced subclonal selection in early colorectal tumorigenesis. Thus, scPhyloX is an innovative computational method for investigating the development and evolution of somatic tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

In retrospective docking screens against the {sigma}2 and the 5-HT2A receptors, the AF2 structures struggled to recapitulate ligands that we had previously found docking against the receptors experimental structures, consistent with published results. Prospective large library docking against the AF2 models, however, yielded similar hit rates for both receptors versus docking against experimentally-derived structures; hundreds of molecules were prioritized and tested against each model and each structure of each receptor. The success of the AF2 models was achieved despite differences in orthosteric pocket residue conformations for both targets versus the experimental structures. Intriguingly, against the 5-HT2A receptor the most potent, subtype-selective agonists were discovered via docking against the AF2 model, not the experimental structure. To understand this from a molecular perspective, a cryoEM structure was determined for one of the more potent and selective ligands to emerge from docking against the AF2 model of the 5-HT2A receptor. Our findings suggest that AF2 models may sample conformations that are relevant for ligand discovery, much extending the domain of applicability of structure-based ligand discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

In this study, we compared the humoral immunogenicity of XBB and JN.1 lineage infections in human subjects with diverse immune histories to understand the antigenic and immunogenic distinctions between these variants. Similar to observations in naive mice, priming with XBB and JN.1 in humans without prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure results in distinct NAb responses, exhibiting minimal cross-reactivity. Importantly, breakthrough infections (BTI) with the JN.1 lineage induce 5.9-fold higher neutralization titers against JN.1 compared to those induced by XBB BTI. We also observed notable immune evasion of recently emerged JN.1 sublineages, including JN.1+R346T+F456L, with KP.3 showing the most pronounced decrease in neutralization titers by both XBB and JN.1 BTI sera.

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

FundingNational Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2701800 and 2022YFC2304700), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82202567 and 32270003), Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2022278), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (23QA1410500), and Shanghai municipal three-year action plan for strengthening the construction of the public health system (2023-2025) GWVI-2.1.2.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1716329161784

ObjectiveTo evaluate febrile seizure risk following monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination among children aged 2-5 years.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThe primary analysis evaluated children who had a febrile seizure outcome in the 0-1 days following COVID-19 vaccination. A self-controlled case series analysis was performed in three commercial insurance databases to compare the risk of seizure in the risk interval (0-1 days) to a control interval (8-63 days).

ExposureReceipt of dose 1 and/or dose 2 of monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was febrile seizure (0-1 day risk interval).

AnalysisA conditional Poisson regression model was used to compare outcome rates in risk and control intervals and estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analyses were used to pool results across databases.

ResultsThe primary meta-analysis found a statistically significant increased incidence of febrile seizure, in the 0-1 days following mRNA-1273 vaccination compared to the control interval (IRR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.35 to 4.69, risk difference (RD)/100,000 doses = 3.22 (95%CI -0.31 to 6.75)). For the BNT162b2 vaccination, the IRR was elevated but not statistically significant (IRR: 1.41, 95%CI: 0.48 to 4.11, RD/100,000 doses = -0.25 (95%CI -2.75 to 2.24).

Conclusions and RelevanceAmong children aged 2-5 years, the analysis showed a small elevated incidence rate ratio of febrile seizures in the 0-1 days following the mRNA-1273 vaccination. Based on the current body of scientific evidence, the safety profile of the monovalent mRNA vaccines remains favorable for use in young children.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAmong children aged 2-5 years, is the risk of febrile seizure elevated immediately following monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination compared with a later period after vaccination?

FindingsIn this self-controlled case series that included participants aged 2-5 years from three commercial insurance databases, the incidence rate ratio of febrile seizures was significantly elevated in the 0-1 days following mRNA-1273 administration. Absolute risk was small.

MeaningThe incidence of febrile seizures was elevated immediately following vaccination with the monovalent mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 2-5 years.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

While RdRp is the target of several viral inhibitors, the active site has several pitfalls when translating in vitro inhibitors to the clinic. The highly polar residues within the active site often necessitate the use of highly polar or charged compounds, especially when designing nucleoside analog inhibitors, posing significant challenges in optimizing drug-likeness and membrane permeability for clinical efficacy. Here, we investigated the broad-spectrum potential of the allosteric Thumb-1 cryptic site of the RdRp, which to date has only been adequately studied in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). To explore this potential antiviral target, we used a suite of bioinformatics techniques, including homology modeling and multiple sequence alignments, to reveal the conserved landscape of the Thumb-1 site across +ssRNA viruses. We then used ChemPrint, our Mol-GDL (Molecular-Geometric Deep Learning) machine learning model to predict drug inhibition of the Thumb-1 site in RdRp across +ssRNA viruses. Here, we identify MDL-001 as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate with favorable properties that enable oral and once-a-day dosing. We also show how the cryptic nature of the Thumb-1 site masks itself to conventional virtual screening techniques, like docking, where activity prediction is heavily based on solving or predicting an accurate structure of the open pocket. This study demonstrates the utility of this approach in drug discovery for broad-spectrum antivirals that target the Thumb-1 site.

Lay SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThis paper addresses the challenge of developing broad-spectrum antivirals against +ssRNA viruses, which include pathogens like HCV and SARS-CoV-2. The highly conserved RdRp Thumb-1 site across these viruses is identified as a potential target for broad spectrum antiviral drugs, which would be vital tools in prophylactic and therapeutic responses to future viral threats.

MethodologyUtilizing bioinformatics and deep learning (through our proprietary AI platform called GALILEO), the study maps the conserved landscape of the RdRp Thumb-1 site across a range of human pathogenic +ssRNA viruses and screens for potential inhibitory compounds.

Key DiscoveriesMDL-001 emerges as a potential broad-spectrum non-nucleoside antiviral drug candidate and the RdRp Thumb-1 site exists as a family of targets, many of which may be targetable by a single drug.

Impact and ImplicationsThe discovery that the Thumb-1 site of RdRp can be targeted by small molecules for antiviral activity against a range of +ssRNA viruses.

ExposureReceipt of RSVPreF vaccine among pregnant individuals in the U.S.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresDescriptive statistics assessed all AE reports with RSVPreF, including frequency, gestational age at vaccination, time to AE onset, and serious report proportions. The Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) was utilized, estimating the information component (IC) to identify disproportionate reporting of RSVPreF-event pairs.

ResultsVAERS received 77 reports pertained to RSVPreF vaccination in pregnant individuals, with 42 (54.55%) classified as serious. The most reported non-pregnancy-specific AEs were headache, injection site erythema, and injection site pain. Preterm birth was the most frequently reported pregnancy-specific AE, followed by preterm premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, cervical dilatation, and hemorrhage during pregnancy. The median time from immunization to reported preterm birth was 3 days, with two-thirds of cases within a week. Disproportionality analysis indicated a significant signal for various AEs, particularly highlighting preterm birth with an IC of 2.18 (95%CI, 1.54-2.63), suggesting that reports of preterm birth associated with RSVPreF vaccination occurred more frequently than statistically expected.

ConclusionsWhile reported AEs were generally consistent with the safety profile observed in prelicensure studies, this study highlights ongoing concern about preterm birth among pregnant individuals following RSVPreF vaccination. Comprehensive longitudinal follow-up, including prospective pregnancy registries and infant follow-up studies is urgently required.","NA","medrxiv",1716329161784

Here, we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), a genome editing system that combines the programmability and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 with the RNA-mediated gene insertion capabilities of the human LINE1 (L1) element. CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1716329161784

Recent research has highlighted the therapeutic potential of psychoactive substances and especially 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), in alleviating trauma symptoms in chronic patients. However, little is known regarding the consequences of trauma that is acutely experienced under the influence of psychoactive substances. Here we investigated the acute experiences and peritraumatic processing of 657 survivors from the high-casualty terror attack at the Supernova music festival in Israel on October 7th, 2023. Data were collected four to twelve weeks following the TE. Approximately two-thirds of survivors were under the influence of psychoactive substances at the time of the TE, offering a tragic and unique natural experiment on the impact of psychoactive compounds on TE processing. Our findings reveal that individuals who experienced the trauma while under the influence of MDMA demonstrated significantly improved intermediate outcomes compared to those who were under the influence of other substances or no substances at all. Specifically, the MDMA group reported increased feelings of social support, more social interactions and enhanced quality of sleep during the peritraumatic period, yielding reduced levels of mental distress and reduced PTSD symptom severity. These novel findings suggest that the influence of MDMA during the TE may carry protective effects into the peritraumatic period, possibly mediated through the known effects of MDMA in reducing negative emotions and elevating prosociality. These protective effects in turn may mitigate the development of early psychopathology-related symptoms. Current preliminary results underscore the need for further understanding of the cognitive and physiological processes by which psychedelic substances intersect with trauma recovery processes.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

These viruses have spread across the Americas causing morbidity and mortality in both wild and domestic birds as well as some mammalian species, including cattle. Many surveillance programs in wildlife as well as commercial poultry operations have detected these viruses. Here we conducted surveillance of avian species in the urban environment in New York City. We detected highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in six samples from four different bird species and performed full genome sequencing. Sequence analysis showed the presence of multiple different genotypes. Our work highlights that the interface between animals and humans that may give rise to zoonotic infections or even pandemics is not limited to rural environments and commercial poultry operations but extends into the heart of our urban centers.

ImportanceWhile surveillance for avian influenza viruses is often focused on migratory routes and their associated stop-over locations, or commercial poultry operations, many bird species - including migratory birds - frequent or live in urban green spaces and wetlands. This brings them into contact with a highly dense population of humans and pets providing an extensive urban animal-human interface in which the general public may have little awareness of circulating infectious diseases. This study focuses on virus surveillance at this interface, combined with culturally responsive science education and community outreach.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

To localize the ancestral and geographical origins of the Yamnaya among the diverse Eneolithic people that preceded them, we studied ancient DNA data from 428 individuals of which 299 are reported for the first time, demonstrating three previously unknown Eneolithic genetic clines. First, a ""Caucasus-Lower Volga"" (CLV) Cline suffused with Caucasus hunter-gatherer (CHG) ancestry extended between a Caucasus Neolithic southern end in Neolithic Armenia, and a steppe northern end in Berezhnovka in the Lower Volga. Bidirectional gene flow across the CLV cline created admixed intermediate populations in both the north Caucasus, such as the Maikop people, and on the steppe, such as those at the site of Remontnoye north of the Manych depression. CLV people also helped form two major riverine clines by admixing with distinct groups of European hunter-gatherers. A ""Volga Cline"" was formed as Lower Volga people mixed with upriver populations that had more Eastern hunter-gatherer (EHG) ancestry, creating genetically hyper-variable populations as at Khvalynsk in the Middle Volga. A ""Dnipro Cline"" was formed as CLV people bearing both Caucasus Neolithic and Lower Volga ancestry moved west and acquired Ukraine Neolithic hunter-gatherer (UNHG) ancestry to establish the population of the Serednii Stih culture from which the direct ancestors of the Yamnaya themselves were formed around 4000BCE. This population grew rapidly after 3750-3350BCE, precipitating the expansion of people of the Yamnaya culture who totally displaced previous groups on the Volga and further east, while admixing with more sedentary groups in the west. CLV cline people with Lower Volga ancestry contributed four fifths of the ancestry of the Yamnaya, but also, entering Anatolia from the east, contributed at least a tenth of the ancestry of Bronze Age Central Anatolians, where the Hittite language, related to the Indo-European languages spread by the Yamnaya, was spoken. We thus propose that the final unity of the speakers of the ""Proto-Indo-Anatolian"" ancestral language of both Anatolian and Indo-European languages can be traced to CLV cline people sometime between 4400-4000 BCE.

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024.

Stress-induced exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following translational shutoff is thought to cause condensation by allowing new multivalent RNA-dependent interactions, with RNA length and associated interaction capacity driving increased condensation. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNA species condense in response to multiple unrelated stresses in budding yeast, length plays a minor role, and instead, stress-induced transcripts are preferentially excluded from condensates, enabling their selective translation. Using both endogenous genes and reporter constructs, we show that translation initiation blockade, rather than resulting ribosome-free RNA, causes condensation. These translation initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are biochemically detectable even when stress granules, defined as microscopically visible foci, are absent or blocked. TIICs occur in unstressed yeast cells, and, during stress, grow before the appearance of visible stress granules. Stress-induced transcripts are excluded from TIICs primarily due to the timing of their expression, rather than their sequence features. Together, our results reveal a simple system by which cells redirect translational activity to newly synthesized transcripts during stress, with broad implications for cellular regulation in changing conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784

However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.","NA","biorxiv",1716329161784
