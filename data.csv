Since therapeutic research is ongoing, long COVID prevention is a pragmatic public health strategy. While prior analyses have shown the benefit of primary vaccination, the effect of booster vaccination on preventing long COVID caused by an Omicron infection has not been fully investigated. This systematic review identified 31 observational studies, among which 11 were deemed suitable for pairwise meta-analyses. Herein, the pooled risk of long COVID was 22-29% (P<0.0001 and P<0.0001, respectively) lower for vaccinated (any vaccination) populations versus unvaccinated (10 studies); 19% (P<0.0001) lower for primary course vaccination versus no vaccination (3 studies); 26% (P<0.0001) lower for booster vaccination versus no vaccination (4 studies) and 23% (P=0.0044) lower for booster vaccination versus primary course vaccination (3 studies). These findings indicate that booster vaccination can provide additional protection against long COVID; thereby, highlighting the importance of seasonal vaccination against new SARS-CoV-2 variants.","NA","medrxiv",1732486163469

We have previously demonstrated that the virus enters the human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons via an endosomal-lysosomal pathway, which is dependent on low levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and independent of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Here, we use hiPSC-derived neurons overexpressing ACE2 in co-culture with human astrocytes to show that the infection with both SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan and Omicron XBB.1.5 variants is dependent on cathepsins and can be efficiently blocked by an inhibitor of cathepsin B (CA-074-ME). The result was reproducible in non-transgenic hiPSC-derived cortical organoids. The cathepsin L inhibitor SB412515 was less effective against the Wuhan strain but equally effective against the Omicron variant. Using PCR and reinfection assays, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can replicate in neurons in 2D co-cultures. Interestingly, the infectivity of the newly produced virions declined at 24 hours post-infection despite a further increase in released viral RNA at later time points, suggesting the possible activation of an antiviral response in neurons and/or astrocytes, which is supported by a correspondent increase in the levels of secreted cytokines. Furthermore, the number of infected neurons decreased within five days, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection eventually leads to the death of the target neuronal cell in vitro. The infection also caused the accumulation of the hypoxia-inducible stress factor HIF1-alpha in infected neurons under normoxia. Finally, we confirm and expand the previous finding that in SARS-CoV-2 infected neurons, the microtubule-associated protein tau is hyperphosphorylated at multiple loci, including S202/T205, and mislocalized to the soma of the infected neurons. Hyperphosphorylation and mislocalization of tau are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Our data provides further evidence supporting the neurodegenerative potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

To control the outbreak, public health officials began vaccination campaigns using the third-generation orthopoxvirus vaccine MVA-BN. Prior to this outbreak, the durability of MPXV-specific immunity induced by MVA-BN was poorly understood. In 2022, we launched the New York City Observational Study of Mpox Immunity (NYC OSMI, NCT05654883), a longitudinal study of 171 participants comprising MVA-BN vaccinees and mpox convalescent individuals. Peripheral blood sampling was performed at intervals including prior to vaccination, after one dose, and after the second dose. MVA-BN vaccinees with and without a history of smallpox vaccination demonstrated detectable mpox virus (MPXV)-specific memory B cells at one-year post-vaccination. Additionally, MVA-BN increased MPXV neutralizing titers in smallpox vaccine-naive vaccinees, with a comparable peak titer reached in naive and smallpox vaccine-experienced vaccinees. However, neutralizing titers returned to baseline within 5-7 months for naive individuals, while remaining elevated in those with prior smallpox vaccination. Both naive and experienced individuals generated robust, immunodominant IgG responses against MPXV H3 and A35, but naive vaccinees IgG responses showed lower avidity than experienced vaccinees. These data highlight a low avidity antibody response elicited by MVA-BN that is short-lived in naive vaccinees. This work supports the need for long-term studies on protection induced by MVA-BN including the potential need for booster doses as well as the development of next-generation orthopoxvirus vaccines.","NA","medrxiv",1732486163469

Here, we show that during development reactivation follows a hierarchical sequence, whereby anteriorly located qNSCs control the reactivation of more posterior qNSCs in the central nervous system (CNS). Electrical communication between qNSCs and neurons enables this precise spatial and temporal control of reactivation throughout the entire span of the CNS. Using single-cell RNA-seq we discovered that, remarkably, qNSCs switch on a host of neuronal genes while maintaining a stem cell identity. This transient mixed identity is specific to qNSCs, as neuronal genes are turned off after stem cells resume proliferation. Our results uncover long-range communication between qNSCs to coordinate reactivation, enabled by a transient stem cell-neuron fate.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

The capability for producing custom-shape high-quality backbones for very large proteins would further expand the scope of protein design. To this end, here we introduce the AlphaFold2 (AF2) cycler (af2cycler) design pipeline. AF2cycler is used to refine draft protein backbone geometries of arbitrary shape created by the Chroma diffusion model or other methods, using a combination of AF2 and ProteinMPNN to achieve high designability with minimal deviations from the initial target structure. In silico testing on multiple protein designs (100-1000 amino acids) demonstrated improvements in structural integrity and designability after af2cycling confirmed by enhanced ESMFold repredictions. Experimental wet lab validation through the design of a variety of test proteins with distinct shapes, each comprising 1000 amino acids, showed structural agreement between in silico predictions and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, establishing the af2cycler's efficacy in translating designs into real-world results. Af2cycler provides a convenient and reliable protein design workflow, particularly for large proteins, with potential for expanding to applications in areas such as design of higher-order protein complexes and multi-state backbone optimization.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

There are no vaccines available for protection and only one drug approved for treatment that has limited efficacy. A major barrier to developing new therapeutics is a lack of foundational knowledge of Cryptosporidium biology, including which parasite genes are essential for survival and virulence. Here, we iteratively improve the tools for genetically manipulating Cryptosporidium and develop a targeted CRISPR-based screening method to rapidly assess how the loss of individual parasite genes influence survival in vivo. Using this method we examine the parasite pyrimidine salvage pathway and a set of leading Cryptosporidium vaccine candidates. From this latter group we determined the parasite gene known as Cp23 to be essential for survival, which was confirmed through inducible knockout in vitro and in vivo. Parasites deficient in Cp23 were able to replicate within and emerge from infected epithelial cells, yet unable to initiate gliding motility which is essential for the reinfection of neighbouring cells. The targeted screening method presented here is highly versatile and will enable researchers to more rapidly expand the knowledge base for Cryptosporidium infection biology, paving the way for new therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

However, within individual brain areas, neurons often exhibit very diverse and seemingly disorganized responses. A more careful analysis shows that these neurons can sometimes be grouped together into specialized subpopulations (categorical representations). Organization can also be found at the level of the representational geometry in the activity space, typically in the form of low-dimensional structures. It is still unclear how the geometry in the activity space and the structure of the response profiles of individual neurons are related. Here, we systematically analyzed the geometric and selectivity structure of the neural population from 40+ cortical regions in mice performing a decision-making task (IBL public Brainwide Map data set). We used a reduced-rank regression approach to quantify the selectivity profiles of single neurons and multiple measures of dimensionality to characterize the representational geometry of task variables. We then related these measures within single areas to the position of each area in the sensory-cognitive cortical hierarchy. Our findings reveal that only a few regions (in primary sensory areas) are categorical. When multiple brain areas are considered, we observe clustering that reflects the brains large-scale organization. The representational geometry of task variables also changed along the cortical hierarchy, with higher dimensionality in cognitive regions. These trends were explained by analytical computations linking the maximum dimensionality of representational geometry to the clustering of selectivity at the single neuron level. Finally, we computed the shattering dimensionality (SD), a measure of the linear separability of neural activity vectors; remarkably, the SD remained near maximal across all regions, suggesting that the observed variability in the selectivity profiles allows neural populations to maintain high computational flexibility. These results provide a new mathematical and empirical perspective on selectivity and representation geometry in the cortical neural code.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Conversely, IGFBP7 and PGR were primarily expressed in developing maternal spiral arteries during placentation, with effects limited to the maternal genome. Risk loci were found to be under significant evolutionary selection, with the strongest effects on nausea and vomiting mid-pregnancy.

Recent studies have suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection can lead to reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), yet, the extent and impact of viral reactivation in COVID-19 and its effect on the host immune system remain incompletely understood.

Here we present a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of viral reactivation of all known chronically infecting viruses in 1,154 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study, who were followed prospectively for twelve months. We reveal significant reactivation of Herpesviridae, Enteroviridae, and Anelloviridae families during acute stage of COVID-19 (0-40 days post- hospitalization), each exhibiting distinct temporal dynamics. We also show that viral reactivation correlated with COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes, including mortality. Integration of cytokine profiling, cellular immunophenotyping, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics demonstrated virus-specific host responses, including elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, CXCL10, and TNF), increased activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and upregulation of cellular replication genes, independent of COVID-19 severity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Notably, persistent Anelloviridae reactivation during convalescence ([&ge;]3 months post-hospitalization) was associated with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptoms, particularly physical function and fatigue.

Our findings highlight a remarkable prevalence and potential impact of chronic viral reactivation on host responses and clinical outcomes during acute COVID-19 and long term PASC sequelae.

Here, we develop paired imaging and sequencing methods to construct large-scale, multi-modal genotype-phenotypes maps in tissue with pooled genetic perturbations. Using imaging, we identify genetic perturbations in individual cells while simultaneously measuring their gene expression and subcellular morphology. Using single-cell sequencing, we measure transcriptomic responses to the same genetic perturbations. We apply this approach to study hundreds of genetic perturbations in the mouse liver. Our study reveals regulators of hepatocyte zonation and liver unfolded protein response, as well as distinct pathways that cause hepatocyte steatosis. Our approach enables new ways of interrogating the genetic basis of complex cellular and organismal physiology and provides crucial training data for emerging machine-learning models of cellular function.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

A common objective in spatial transcriptomics data analysis is to identify spatially variable genes within predefined cell types or regions within the tissue. However, these regions are often implicitly one-dimensional, making standard two-dimensional coordinate-based methods less effective as they overlook the underlying tissue organization. Here we introduce a methodology grounded in spectral graph theory to elucidate a one-dimensional curve that effectively approximates the spatial coordinates of the examined sample. This curve is then used to establish a new coordinate system that better reflects tissue morphology. We then develop a generalized additive model (GAM) to detect genes with variable expression in the new morphologically relevant coordinate system. Our approach directly models gene counts, thereby eliminating the need for normalization or transformations to satisfy normality assumptions. We demonstrate improved performance relative to current methods based on hypothesis testing, while also accurately estimating gene expression patterns and precisely identifying spatial loci where deviations from constant expression are observed. We validate our approach through extensive simulations and by analyzing experimental data from multiple platforms such as Slide-seq and MERFISH.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Barrier formation requires positioning of functional tight junctions (TJ) to the most suprabasal viable layer of the epidermis through a mechanical circuit that is driven by generation of high tension at adherens junctions. However, what allows the sensing of tension build-up at these adhesions and how this tension is balanced to match the requirements of tissue mechanical properties is unclear. Here we show that the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 is essential for the maturation of intercellular junctions into functional, continuous adhesions. Deletion of Piezo1 results in an imbalance of cell contractility and membrane tension, leading to a delay in adhesion maturation. Consequently, the requirement for Piezo1 activity can be bypassed by lowering contractility or elevating membrane tension. In vivo, Piezo1 function in adhesion integrity becomes essential only in aged mice where alterations in tissue mechanics lead to impaired TJs and barrier dysfunction. Collectively these studies reveal an essential function of Piezo1 in the timely establishment and maintenance of cell-cell junctions in the context of a mechanically tensed epidermis.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

This review investigates whether excess weight increases the risk of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with PCC. Methods: Studies published up to July 2023 were searched independently across eight electronic databases to evaluate the risk of developing neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms more than 12 weeks post-infection between exposure and controls groups (excess weight vs. normal weight; obesity vs. non-obesity). Meta-analyses were conducted under a random-effects model. Results: Of the 10,122 abstracts screened, 18 studies (n = 139,091 adults) met the inclusion criteria and reported PCC symptoms according to nutritional status. These studies included 79,050 individuals with excess weight vs 57,926 normal-weight individuals and 30,694 individuals with obesity vs 107,612 non-obese individuals. The presence of excess weight in PCC significantly increased the risk of depression (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.03-1.42), headache (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.09-1.35), memory issues (RR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.24-1.65), sleep disturbance (RR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.16-1.48), and vertigo (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04- 1.41). Obesity significantly increased the risk of headache (RR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.34- 1.49), smell disorder (RR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.09-1.21), taste disorder (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.07-1.36), and vertigo (RR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.35-1.53). Conclusions: Excess weight or obesity increases the risk of experiencing neuro-symptoms related to PCC.

This makes it challenging to obtain high-resolution reconstructions or may even cause projects to fail altogether. We have previously observed that laser flash melting and revitrification of cryo samples reduces preferred orientation for large, symmetric particles. Here, we demonstrate that our method can in fact be used to scramble the orientation of proteins of a range of sizes and symmetries. The effect can be enhanced for some proteins by increasing the heating rate during flash melting or by depositing amorphous ice onto the sample prior to revitrification. This also allows us to shed light onto the underlying mechanism. Our experiments establish a set of tools for overcoming preferred orientation that can be easily integrated into existing workflows.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Variation in phage plaque morphology does not to reliably distinguish distinct phages and therefore many potentially redundant phages may need to be isolated, purified, and individually characterized to find phages of interest. Here, we present a method in which multiple bacterial strains are co-cultured on the same screening plate to add an extra dimension to plaque morphology data. In this method, Phage Discovery by Co-culture (Phage DisCo), strains are isogenic except for fluorescent tags and one perturbation expected to impact phage infection. Differential plaquing on the strains is easily detectable by fluorescent signal and implies that the perturbation made to the surviving strain in a plaque prevents phage infection. We validate the Phage DisCo method by showing that characterized phages have the expected plaque morphology on Phage DisCo plates and demonstrate the power of Phage DisCo for multiple targeted discovery applications, from receptors to phage defense systems.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

In contrast with the dorso-ventrally flat Drosophila wing, its serial homolog the haltere adopts a globular shape thought to arise from a lack of matrix-mediated adhesion between its dorsal and ventral surfaces. Contradicting this model, however, matrix manipulations are known to deform halteres. To understand haltere morphogenesis, we characterized matrix behavior and monitored metamorphic development of the haltere. We found that, similar to the wing, correct haltere morphogenesis requires Collagen IV degradation, which we show is mediated by ecdysone-controlled expression of Matrix metalloprotease 2 in both wing and haltere. After Collagen IV is degraded, similar again to the wing, dorsal and ventral haltere surfaces establish Laminin-mediated contact through long cytoskeletal projections. Furthermore, time-lapse analysis of shape changes in wild type and mutant halteres indicates that these projections couple the two surfaces through a central tensor, ensuring load distribution across the whole organ to create a globular shape against tissue-wide deforming forces. Our findings reveal an unexpected role for matrix-mediated adhesion in haltere morphogenesis and describe a novel type of matrix-based tensor structure building 3D shape from 2D epithelia.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Immunopeptidomics data of cell cultures infected with the foodborne model pathogen Listeria monocytogenes were searched by four different search engines, PEAKS, Comet, Sage and MSFragger, followed by data-driven rescoring with MS2Rescore. Compared to standard single search-engine results, this integrated workflow boosted the number of identified immunopeptides on average by 27% and led to the high confident detection of 18 additional bacterial peptides (+27%) matching 15 different Listeria proteins (+36%). Despite an overall large agreement between the search engines, a small number of conflicts (< 1%) in spectra-to-peptide assignments revealed ambiguous identifications that served as a quality filter. Finally, we show compatibility of our workflow with sensitive timsTOF data acquisition and find that rescoring, now with inclusion of ion mobility features, identifies 76% more peptides compared to orbitrap-based acquisition.

While polyploid organisms are prevalent, ancient polyploidy (paleopolyploidy) is decisively rare. Numerous studies have revealed adaptive changes at the genomic, cellular, and physiological levels that confer evolutionary advantages to polyploids, but the factors contributing to their long-term success remain poorly understood. Here, we assembled a large angiosperm genome dataset encompassing 470 different angiosperm species. We reconstructed a highly concordant evolutionary timescale of angiosperms and conducted a large-scale study to identify and date WGDs across this set of species. We unveiled 132 independent ancient WGD events that do not seem randomly distributed in time, but clustered around periods of great environmental upheaval. We observed that a majority of paleopolyploidizations occurred between 50 and 75 mya, coinciding with the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum and the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary. A more recent wave of ancient WGDs can be observed between 25 and 40 mya, coinciding with periods of glaciation expansion, rapid shifts in sea surface temperatures, and a marked decrease in global mean surface temperature. Integrating different lines of evidence, we argue that polyploids have an increased chance of survival during times of great environmental turmoil.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with poor cognition, but it is unclear whether supplementation would provide benefit, particularly in individuals with mild/moderate deficiencies which do not have other clinical risks. The objective of this study was to establish the impact of daily vitamin D supplementation on cognition in older adults with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency. Methods and Findings Two-arm parallel 24-month randomised controlled trial, with Vitamin D supplementation compared with a placebo. This was a remote trial, completed from home involving 620 adults 50 years or older with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency and early cognitive impairment. The primary outcome was executive function measured through Trail making B and other secondary measures of cognition, function and wellbeing. Vitamin D supplementation conferred no significant benefit to executive function compared to placebo at follow-up on the primary outcome (between-group difference: 5770, 95% CI: -2189 to 13730) or cognition, function, or wellbeing. Secondary analyses in defined subgroups and a per-protocol analysis also showed no significant impact on any outcome measures. Conclusions Vitamin D supplementation produced no measurable improvement in cognitive outcomes in older adults with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency. The remote trial methodology provides an innovative approach to large-scale trials.","NA","medrxiv",1732486163469

Biased compounds that selectively activate therapy-relevant pathways promise to be safer, more effective medications. The determinants of bias are poorly understood, however, and rationally-designed, G protein-subtype-selective compounds are lacking. Here, using the prototypical class A GPCR neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), we find that small molecules binding the intracellular GPCR-transducer interface change G protein coupling by subtype-specific and predictable mechanisms, enabling rational drug design. We demonstrate that the compound SBI-553 switches NTSR1 G protein preference by acting both as a molecular bumper and a molecular glue. Structurally, SBI-553 occludes G protein binding determinants on NTSR1, promoting association with select G protein subtypes for which an alternative, shallow-binding conformation is energetically favorable. Minor modifications to the SBI-553 scaffold produce allosteric modulators with distinct G protein subtype selectivity profiles. Selectivity profiles are probe-independent, conserved across species, and translate to differences in in vivo activity. These studies demonstrate that G protein selectivity can be tailored with small changes to a single chemical scaffold targeting the receptor-transducer interface and, as this pocket is broadly conserved, present a strategy for pathway-selective drug discovery applicable to the diverse GPCR superfamily.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Here, we characterize the mechanisms that drive the formation of these structures and their function in gene regulation in a lymphoid-to-myeloid differentiation system. Based on analyses at base-pair resolution, we demonstrate a close correlation between binding of regulatory proteins, formation of chromatin interactions, and gene expression. Integration of single-allele topologies and computational modeling shows that tissue-specific gene loci are organized into chromatin hubs, characterized by cooperative interactions between multiple enhancers, promoters, and CTCF-binding sites. Depletion of CTCF strongly impairs the formation of these structures, but has mild effects on gene expression, which can be explained by rewired enhancer-promoter interactions. This demonstrates an instructive role for enhancer-promoter interactions in gene regulation that is independent of cooperative interactions in chromatin hubs. Together, these results contribute to a mechanistic understanding of the structure-function relationship of the genome during cellular differentiation.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

DesignCohort study.

SettingElectronic health record data.

Participants2 528 916 singleton births from the UKs Clinical Practice Research Datalink (1996-2018), Norways Medical Birth Registry (2009-2020), and Swedens Medical Birth Register (2006-2020).

Main outcome measuresStillbirth, neonatal death, pre- and post-term delivery, small and large for gestational age, and low Apgar score five minutes post-delivery.

ResultsA total of 120 209 (4.8%) deliveries were exposed to maternal antidepressant use during pregnancy. Maternal antidepressant use during pregnancy was associated with increased odds of stillbirth (adjusted pooled OR (aOR) 1.16, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.28), preterm delivery (aOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.30), and Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.75 to 1.91). These findings persisted in the discordant sibling analysis, but with higher uncertainty. The adjusted predicted absolute risk for stillbirth was 0.34% (95% CI 0.33 to 0.35) among the unexposed and 0.40% (95% CI 0.36 to 0.44) in the antidepressant exposed. Restricting to women with depression or anxiety, the association between antidepressant exposure and stillbirth attenuated (aOR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.21). Paternal antidepressant use was modestly associated with preterm delivery and low Apgar score. Most antidepressants were associated with preterm delivery (except paroxetine) and Apgar score (except mirtazapine and amitriptyline).

ConclusionsMaternal antidepressant use during pregnancy may increase the risk of stillbirth, preterm delivery, and low Apgar score, although the absolute risks remained low. Confounding by severity of indication cannot be ruled out, as the severity of symptoms was not available. The modest association between paternal antidepressant use and both preterm delivery and low Apgar score suggests that residual confounding by familial environment cannot be ruled out.","NA","medrxiv",1732486163469

In animals and fungi, functional amyloids play a role in the control of RCD as molecular switches activating key cell death effectors, rather than causing direct toxicity as seen with pathological amyloids. Here, we describe a novel amyloid-based signal transduction mechanism in an antiphage defense system in Escherichia coli. This antiphage abortive infection (Abi) system is mediated by two proteins, Bab and Agp which share a common amyloid motif and are encoded by adjacent genes. Upon phage infection, Agp activates Bab through amyloid signaling, leading to cell death. We determined the structure of the Bab cell death execution domain, which is distantly related to pore-forming domains present in fungi, animals and plants. We show that Bab and the fungal HET-S amyloid-controlled cell death execution protein are functionally interchangeable in their respective roles in antiphage defense and allorecognition. These findings add antiphage defense to the functional repertoire of amyloids.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Here, using Mus musculus SPO11, we report a biochemical system that recapitulates all the hallmarks of meiotic DSB formation. We show that SPO11 catalyzes break formation in the absence of any partners and remains covalently attached to the 5' broken strands. We find that target site selection by SPO11 is influenced by the sequence, bendability and topology of the DNA substrate, and provide evidence that SPO11 can reseal single-strand DNA breaks. In addition, we show that SPO11 is monomeric in solution and that cleavage requires dimerization to reconstitute two hybrid active sites. SPO11 and its partner TOP6BL form a 1:1 complex that catalyzes DNA cleavage with a similar activity to SPO11 alone. However, the complex binds DNA ends with higher affinity, suggesting a potential role post-cleavage. We propose a model where additional partners of SPO11 required for DSB formation in vivo assemble biomolecular condensates that recruit SPO11-TOP6BL, enabling dimerization and cleavage. Our work establishes SPO11 dimerization as the fundamental mechanism that controls the induction of meiotic DSBs.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Understanding the association between CNVs and disease susceptibility is of significant importance in disease genetics research and often requires analysis of large sample sizes. One of the most cost-effective and scalable methods for detecting CNVs is based on normalized signal intensity values, such as Log R Ratio (LRR) and B Allele Frequency (BAF), from Illumina genotyping arrays. In this study, we present CNV-Finder, a novel pipeline integrating deep learning techniques on array data, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, to expedite the large-scale identification of CNVs within predefined genomic regions. This facilitates the efficient prioritization of samples for subsequent, costly analyses such as short-read and long-read whole genome sequencing. We focus on five genes--Parkin (PRKN), Leucine Rich Repeat And Ig Domain Containing 2 (LINGO2), Microtubule Associated Protein Tau (MAPT), alpha-Synuclein (SNCA), and Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein (APP)--which may be relevant to neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), or related disorders such as essential tremor (ET). By training our models on expert-annotated samples and validating them across diverse cohorts, including those from the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program (GP2) and additional dementia-specific databases, we demonstrate the efficacy of CNV-Finder in accurately detecting deletions and duplications. Our pipeline outputs app-compatible files for visualization within CNV-Finder's interactive web application. This interface enables researchers to review predictions and filter displayed samples by model prediction values, LRR range, and variant count in order to explore or confirm results. Our pipeline integrates this human feedback to enhance model performance and reduce false positive rates. Through a series of comprehensive analyses and validations using both short-read and long-read sequencing data, we demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of CNV-Finder in identifying CNVs with regions of varied sparsity, noise, and size. Our findings highlight the significance of contextual understanding and human expertise in enhancing the precision of CNV identification, particularly in complex genomic regions like 17q21.31.

Here, we focused on the prototypical yeast transcription factor Gcn4 and assessed two models for gene transcription activation, i.e., mediated via soluble complexes or transcriptional condensates. Both models rely on the ability of transcription factors and coactivators to engage in multivalent interactions. Unexpectedly, we found that propensity to form homotypic Gcn4 condensates does not correlate well with transcriptional activity. Contrary to prevailing models, binding to DNA suppresses Gcn4 phase separation. Notably, the ability of Gcn4 to form soluble complexes with coactivator subunit Med15 closely mirrored the propensity to recruit Med15 into condensates, indicating that these properties are intertwined and cautioning against interpretation of mutational data without head-to-head comparisons. However, Gcn4 variants with the highest affinity for Med15 do not function as well as expected and instead have activities that reflect their abilities to phase separate with Med15. These variants therefore indeed form cellular condensates, and those attenuate activity. Our results show that transcription factors can function as soluble complexes as well as condensates, reconciling two seemingly opposing models, and have implications for other phase-separating systems.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

PIP can routinely account for up to 40% of all quantitative results, with that proportion rising as high as 75% in single-cell proteomics. Therefore, a significant concern for any PIP method is the possibility of false discoveries: errors that result in peptides being quantified incorrectly. Although several tools for label-free quantification (LFQ) claim to control the false discovery rate (FDR) of PIP, these claims cannot be validated as there is currently no accepted method to assess the accuracy of the stated FDR. We present a method for FDR control of PIP, called ""PIP-ECHO"" (PIP Error Control via Hybrid cOmpetition) and devise a rigorous protocol for evaluating FDR control of any PIP method. Using three different datasets, we evaluate PIP-ECHO alongside the PIP procedures implemented by FlashLFQ, IonQuant, and MaxQuant. These analyses show that PIP-ECHO can accurately control the FDR of PIP at 1% across multiple datasets. Only PIP-ECHO was able to control the FDR in data with injected sample size equivalent to a single-cell dataset. The three other methods fail to control the FDR at 1%, yielding false discovery proportions ranging from 2-6%. We demonstrate the practical implications of this work by performing differential expression analyses on spike-in datasets, where different known amounts of yeast or E. coli peptides are added to a constant background of HeLa cell lysate peptides. In this setting, PIP-ECHO increases both the accuracy and sensitivity of differential expression analysis: our implementation of PIP-ECHO within FlashLFQ enables the detection of 53% more differentially abundant proteins than MaxQuant and 146% more than IonQuant in the spike-in dataset.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Using a computational approach that maximises phylogenetic diversity, we selected an optimal subset of 40 alphacoronavirus spike proteins, including the two human viruses NL63 and 229E, and characterised their host-range using broad mammalian APN and ACE2 receptor libraries. Based on this data, we were able to determine molecular genotypes that contribute to receptor tropism and identify alphacoronaviruses with broad (generalist) or restricted (specialist) receptor usage. Strikingly, we observed that generalism and specialism can vary significantly between closely related viruses. Using structural information, we identified key residues that determine the bat tropism of 229E-like viruses, as well as residues in the ACE2 receptor that likely restrict NL63 infection of certain mammals. Furthermore, we observed that the host range of certain bat alphacoronaviruses is expanded by TMPRSS2 priming of spike. All APN- and ACE2-using alphaCoVs in our study interacted with the receptor of at least one animal species within ecological proximity to humans, suggesting new routes for spillover. However, most bat alphacoronaviruses did not use any of receptors in our screen, refining our understanding of coronavirus entry.

Representation learning methods summarize high-dimensional single-cell data into a manageable latent space in a typically nonlinear fashion, allowing cross-sample integration or generative modeling. However, these methods often produce entangled representations, limiting interpretability and downstream analyses. Existing disentanglement methods instead either require supervised information or impose sparsity and linearity, which may not capture the complexity of biological data. We, therefore, introduce Disentangled Representation Variational Inference (DRVI), an unsupervised deep generative model that learns nonlinear, disentangled representations of single-cell omics. This is achieved by combining recently introduced additive decoders with nonlinear pooling, for which we theoretically prove disentanglement under reasonable assumptions. We validate DRVIs disentanglement capabilities across diverse relevant biological problems, from development to perturbational studies and cell atlases, decomposing, for example, the Human Lung Cell Atlas into meaningful, interpretable latent dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that if applied to batch integration, DRVIs integration quality does not suffer from the disentanglement constraints and instead is on par with entangled integration methods. With its disentangled latent space, DRVI is inherently interpretable and facilitates the identification of rare cell types, provides novel insights into cellular heterogeneity beyond traditional cell types, and highlights developmental stages.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

However, the neural principles underlying the facilitation of such allocation remain inadequately understood. In this work, we address this gap by uncovering brain-wide coherent causal structures in resting-state fMRI timeseries data. We identified five distinct and interpretable modes of signal propagation that most effectively predict future blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Each identified mode uniquely represents specific aspects of neural resource allocation among established networks: (1) signal propagation along cortical hierarchy; (2) the salience network's modulation between default mode and the central executive networks; (3) the mapping between visual and sensorimotor areas with frontal modulation; and (4) interhemispheric interaction. Notably, four of these modes were associated with the default mode network, highlighting its central role as a functional hub. Collectively, these modes account for a broad spectrum of well-known dynamical properties in the brain. Importantly, individual variability in these modes correlates with general cognitive abilities, is influenced by genetic factors, and exhibits stability across different cognitive tasks. Together, these modes not only integrate previously disparate phenomena observed in fMRI data but also offer a concise framework for characterizing individual functional fingerprints within BOLD signals.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

We previously showed that G protein-coupled receptor 17 (GPR17) is expressed in intestinal enteroendocrine cells (EECs) and modulates nutrient-induced GLP-1 secretion. However, the GPR17-mediated molecular signaling pathways in EECs have yet to be fully deciphered. Here, we expressed the human GPR17 long isoform (hGPR17L) in GLUTag cells, a murine EEC line, and we used the GPR17 synthetic agonist MDL29,951 together with pharmacological probes and genetic approaches to quantitatively assess the contribution of GPR17 signaling to GLP-1 secretion. Constitutive hGPR17L activity inhibited GLP-1 secretion, and MDL29,951 treatment further inhibited this secretion, which was attenuated by treatment with the GPR17 antagonist HAMI3379. MDL29,951 promoted both Gi/o and Gq protein coupling to mediate cyclic AMP (cAMP) and calcium signaling. hGPR17L regulation of GLP-1 secretion was Gq-independent and dependent upon Gi/o signaling, but was not correlated with MDL29,951-induced whole-cell cAMP signaling. Our studies revealed key signaling mechanisms underlying the role of GPR17 in regulating GLP-1 secretion and suggest future opportunities for pharmacologically targeting GPR17 with inverse agonists to maximize GLP-1 secretion

Untreated OUD is associated with pregnancy complications in particular, preterm birth. Medications for OUD, such as buprenorphine, are recommended with the added benefit that treatment during pregnancy increases treatment post-partum. However, the rate of preterm birth in individuals using illicit opioids or being treated with opioid agonist therapeutics is double that of the general population. Since inflammation in the placenta and the associated fetal membranes (FM) is a common underlying cause of preterm birth, we sought to determine if the opioid, buprenorphine, induces sterile inflammation in human FMs and to examine the mechanisms involved. Using an established in vitro human FM explant system, we report that buprenorphine significantly increased FM secretion of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6; the neutrophilic chemokine IL-8; and the inflammasome-mediated cytokine IL-1{beta}, mirroring the inflammatory profile commonly seen at the maternal-fetal interface in preterm birth. Other factors that were elevated in FMs exposed to buprenorphine included the mediators of membrane weakening, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and matrix metalloproteinases, MMP1 and MMP9. Furthermore, this sterile inflammatory and weakening FM response induced by buprenorphine was mediated in part by innate immune Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), the NLRP3 inflammasome, the -opioid receptor, and downstream NF{kappa}B and ERK/JNK/MAPK signaling. This may provide the mechanistic link between opioid use in pregnancy and the elevated risk for preterm birth. Since there are adverse consequences of not treating OUD, our findings may help identify ways to mitigate the impact opioids have on pregnancy outcomes while allowing the continuation of maintenance therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

A subset of JIA cases manifests as Systemic JIA (sJIA), which is characterized by joint pain, fevers, rashes, and systemic inflammation. Severe pulmonary complications have not historically been associated with sJIA. Since 2010, inhibitors of interleukin-1 and interleukin 6 (IL-1i/IL-6i) are the recommended course of treatment for sJIA, yet recently studies show evidence of a severe drug hypersensitivity reaction implicating these medications in a subset of those treated. With this reaction, sJIA patients can develop severe lung disease, including pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). As this drug-associated lung disease has only recently been identified, the etiology of sJIA drug-associated PAP (sJIA-daPAP) is poorly understood. We used multiplexed ion beam imaging by time-of-flight (MIBI-TOF) to define the cellular immune infiltrate and describe pathological features of PAP in sJIA-daPAP patients. We found an enrichment of eosinophils, neutrophils, and M2 macrophages within regions of lipoproteinosis. These enriched subsets all upregulate IFN{gamma} within lipoproteinosis, a signature specific to sJIA-daPAP samples compared to non-sJIA-PAP samples. In a cellular neighborhood analysis, we identified that eosinophils, neutrophils, and M2 macrophages frequently co-localize within the same cellular microenvironment, especially in lipoproteinosis regions. Therefore, this spatial coordination may be involved in clearance or persistence of lipoproteinosis in sJIA-daPAP. This study provides a comprehensive overview of sJIA-daPAP immune pathology and suggests cellular mechanisms that drive inflammation in sJIA patients experiencing pulmonary complications associated with delayed drug hypersensitivity during IL-1i/IL-6i treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Identifying the mechanisms controlling MUC CRC polarity is critical to understand disease progression. Here, we analyze patient-derived MUC CRC xenografts, with apical-in or apical-out polarity, ex vivo or within collagen gels to mimic the peritumoral stroma. Single-cell analyses reveal 2{beta}1-integrin as a key collagen-binding receptor in these models. Collagen-2{beta}1-integrin interaction activates Src and ERK/MAPK signaling and upregulates the expression of SorLA, an endosomal sorting receptor. SorLA supports apical-in polarity and carcinoma-stroma interactions by promoting integrin recycling to the plasma membrane and HER2/HER3 expression through a positive feedback mechanism. Accordingly, we observe positive correlation between HER2, HER3 and SorLA in patient samples with the highest HER2 expression in apical-in-presenting tissues. Treatment of tumor spheres with clinically relevant HER2/HER3-targeting antibodies reverts sphere polarity and impedes collagen remodeling and adhesion to mouse peritoneum.

Promyelocytic leukemia (Pml) is a key genetic interactor, since its loss allows for ALS symptoms to occur even in Nek1wt/t animals, mimicking the human situation.

However, the circuit mechanism underlying the heterogeneity of normalization is unclear. In this work, we study normalization in a spiking neuron network model of visual cortex. The model produces a range of neuronal heterogeneity of normalization strength and the heterogeneity is highly correlated with the inhibitory current each neuron receives. Our model reproduces the dependence of spike count correlations on normalization as observed in experimental data, which is explained by the covariance with the inhibitory current. We find that neurons with stronger normalization are more sensitive to contrast differences in images and encode information more efficiently. In addition, networks with more heterogeneity in normalization encode more information about visual stimuli. Together, our model provides a mechanistic explanation of heterogeneous normalization strengths in the visual cortex, and sheds new light on the computational benefits of neuronal heterogeneity.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Here, we show that high light (HL) induces a much stronger down-regulation of light reactions when lettuce plants are exposed to 1500 umol photons for 4 h at 13 degrees C (low temperature, LT) compared to 23 degrees C (growth temperature, GT). GT/HL treatment induced non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), which relaxed during 1 h recovery in darkness. In contrast, LT/HL treatment induced an exceptionally high NPQ that only partially relaxed during 1 h in darkness at GT. Such a high sustained NPQ (sNPQ) cannot be explained by canonical NPQ mechanism(s). Instead, sNPQ was associated with partial disassembly of PSII LHCII complexes and a transient increase in phosphorylation of the minor antenna proteins LHCB4.1/LHCB4.2. This coincided with increased expression of the light-harvesting like proteins SEP2 and ELIP1.2, the PSII assembly proteins HCF173 and LPA3, and accumulation of the pre-D1 protein. These results lead us to propose that LHCB4.1/LHCB4.2 phosphorylation-dependent disassembly of PSII-LHCII supercomplexes allows SEP2 to bind to CP47 and hypothetically quenches the inner PSII core antenna, while free CP43 released during PSII repair is proposed to be protected by LPA3.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

The alternating black-brownish and orange patches seen in tortoiseshell and calico cats are considered as classic examples of the phenotypic expression of random X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) occurring in female mammals. However, the O gene in the cat genome has not been identified, and the genetic variation responsible for the orange coloration remains unknown. We report here that a 5.1-kilobase (kb) deletion within an intron of the X-linked ARHGAP36 gene, encoding a Rho GTPase activating protein, is closely and exclusively associated with orange coloration. The deleted region contains a highly conserved putative regulatory element, whose removal presumably cause altered ARHGAP36 expression. Notably, ARHGAP36 expression in cat skin tissues is linked to the suppression of many melanogenesis genes, potentially shifting pigment synthesis from eumelanin to pheomelanin. Furthermore, we find evidence that the gene undergoes XCI in female human and mouse cells, and XCI-dependent CpG island methylation consistent with random XCI in female domestic cats. The 5.1-kb deletion seems widespread in domestic cats with orange coat coloration, suggesting a single origin of this coat color phenotype.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Yet, scRNA-seq data analysis is limited by the problem of measurement dropouts, i.e., genes displaying zero expression levels. We introduce ZiPo, a deep artificial neural network for rate estimation and library size prediction in scRNA-seq data which incorporates adjustable zero inflation in the distribution to capture the dropouts. ZiPo builds upon established concepts, including using deep autoencoders and adopting the Poisson and negative binomial distributions, by taking advantage of novel strategies, including library size prediction and residual connections, to improve the overall performance. A significant innovation of ZiPo is the introduction of a scale-invariant loss term, making the weights sparse and, hence, the model biologically more interpretable. ZiPo quickly handles vast singular and mixed datasets, with the processing time directly proportional to the number of cells. In this paper, we demonstrate the power of ZiPo on three datasets and show its advantages over other current techniques.

In bryophytes the dominant multicellular haploid phase produces motile sperm that swim through water to the egg to effect fertilization from which a relatively small diploid phase develops. In angiosperms, the reduced multicellular haploid phase produces non-motile sperm that is delivered to the egg through a pollen tube to effect fertilization from which the dominant diploid phase develops. These different life cycle characteristics are likely to impact the distribution of genetic variation among populations. However, little is known about the distribution of genetic variation among populations of bryophytes. To understand how genetic variation is distributed among populations of a bryophyte and to establish the foundation for population genetics research in bryophytes, we described the genetic diversity of collections of Marchantia polymorpha subspecies ruderalis, a cosmopolitan ruderal liverwort. We explored genetic diversity of this species using 78 genetically unique (non-clonal) accessions from a total of 209 collected from 37 sites in Europe and Japan. There was no detectable population structure among European populations but significant genetic differentiation between Japanese and European populations. By associating genetic variation across the genome with global climate data, we identified summer temperature and precipitation as climate factors influencing the frequency of adaptative alleles. We speculate that the requirement for water through which motile sperm swim imposes a constraint on the life cycle to which the plant genetically adapts.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

There are a range of treatment options, but no good way to match patients to their optimal treatment. For most newly diagnosed patients with early TNBC, the current standard of care is neoadjuvant chemo/immunotherapy before surgery, with patients who achieve a pathological complete response (pCR) having a better prognosis.

We have developed a Functional Precision Medicine (FPM) test that uses a fresh biopsy, dissociates the cells, embeds them in a 3D hydrogel matrix, cultures them in a microfluidics device and tests them against a range of systemic therapies, while using a computer vision pipeline to measure responses to therapies ex vivo.

MethodsWe designed and conducted an observational multi-centre clinical trial to assess the feasibility of using our FPM assay in patients with newly diagnosed TNBC undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. Patients underwent an additional core needle biopsy followed by systemic therapy as part of routine care. We assessed the response in our assay against whether patients achieved pCR or not at the time of definitive surgery, and calculated Receiver-Operating Characteristic curves (ROC) to optimize cut-offs. In patients who did not achieve pCR, we explored whether there were other regimens that had a better in-assay performance.

ResultsIn cohort A, we recruited 34 patients, of whom 12 are evaluable as of 31st July 2024 All were female. Nine patients achieved a pCR. The AUC for the ROC for predicting pCR vs. non-pCR was 0.78. In the 3 patients who did not achieve a pCR, one patient had a regimen that performed better in assay than the treatment they received, and where the response was greater than the cut-off that predicted pCR in other patients.

ConclusionWe have presented interim results from a novel FPM assay in patients with early stage TNBC. Our test demonstrates good performance in predicting pCR. The trial continues to accrue data, and Cohort B continues to recruit (PEAR-TNBC; NCT05435352).

In silico assessments show TaxSEA is accurate across a range of set sizes. When applied to differential abundance analysis output from Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Type 2 Diabetes metagenomic data, TaxSEA outperforms current tools and can rapidly identify changes in functional groups corresponding to known associations. We also show that TaxSEA is robust to the choice of differential abundance (DA) analysis package.

To control the infection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron JN.1 subvariants, JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccines have been developed. Some previous reports showed that the JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccine of Pfizer/BioNTech (US/Germany) increased antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 subvariants and XEC. However, the efficacy of other available JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccines (e.g., Daiichi-Sankyo, Japan) remains unassessed. To validate the antiviral efficacy induced by JN.1 mRNA vaccines, sera were collected from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech JN.1 mRNA vaccine (N=15) or Daiichi-Sankyo JN.1 mRNA vaccine (N=19) before and 3-4 weeks after vaccination. We then performed a neutralization assay using these sera and pseudoviruses. Both Pfizer/BioNTech JN.1 vaccine (2.4-to 8.0-fold, P=0.0001) and Daiichi-Sankyo JN.1 vaccine (2.3-to 13-fold, P=0.0001) boosted antiviral humoral immunity against all variants tested with statistical significance. While the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine encodes the full-length JN.1 spike (S), the Daiichi-Sankyo mRNA vaccine encodes the receptor-binding domain of JN.1 S. Our data suggest that the receptor-binding domain of JN.1 S can effectively induce antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 subvariants and XEC comparable to the full-length JN.1 S. However, it should be considered that the sizes of our cohorts are relatively small (<20 donors per cohort), and donor characteristics, such as age, sex, underlying disease status, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, may critically affect the experimental results. Future investigations with larger cohorts will address this concern. When compared to vaccination with JN.1 mRNA vaccines, our previous investigations showed that the natural infection of JN.1 and KP.3.3 elicited poorer antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 and its subvariants. Our results suggest that the JN.1 mRNA vaccination more robustly induces antiviral humoral immunity against recent JN.1 subvariants than the natural infection of JN.1 subvariants regardless of manufacturer. Moreover, as we reported last year, the humoral immunity induced by XBB.1.5 monovalent mRNA vaccine against XBB.1.5 was weaker than that against ancestral B.1.1. However, in the case of JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccine, here we showed that the 50% neutralization titer against XBB.1.5 is greater than that against ancestral B.1.1. These observations imply that immune imprinting has shifted from that biased toward pre-Omicron to that biased toward Omicron, depending on the time and/or number of immune stimuli (e.g., infection and/or vaccination).","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

However, the specific mechanisms by which viral proteins influence cholesterol remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cholesterol sequestration within lysosomes, with the viral protein ORF3a identified as the primary driver of this effect. Mechanistically, we found that ORF3a interacts directly with the HOPS complex subunit VPS39 through a hydrophobic interface formed by residues W193 and Y184. A W193A mutation in ORF3a significantly rescues cholesterol egress and corrects the mislocalization of the lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC2, which is caused by defective trafficking of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) sorting receptor, the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). We further observed a marked reduction in bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a lipid essential for lysosomal cholesterol egress, in both SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and ORF3a-expressing cells, suggesting BMP reduction as an additional mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-caused cholesterol sequestration. Inhibition of lysosomal cholesterol egress using the compound U18666A significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting a potential viral strategy of manipulating lysosomal cholesterol to modulate host cell susceptibility. Our findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a disrupts cellular cholesterol transport by altering lysosomal protein trafficking and BMP levels, providing new insights into virus-host interactions that contribute to lipid dysregulation in infected cells.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty. We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit.

The ADMIXTURE software is a widely used model-based approach to account for population stratification, however, it struggles with convergence issues and does not scale to modern human datasets or the large number of variants in whole-genome sequencing data. Likelihood-free approaches optimize a least square objective and have gained popularity in recent years due to their scalability. However, this comes at the cost of accuracy in the ancestry estimates in more complex admixture scenarios. We present a new model-based approach, fastmixture, which adopts aspects from likelihood-free approaches for parameter initialization, followed by a mini-batch expectation-maximization procedure to model the standard likelihood. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that the model-based approaches of fastmixture and ADMIXTURE are significantly more accurate than recent and likelihood-free approaches. We further show that fastmixture runs approximately 30x faster than ADMIXTURE on both simulated and empirical data from the 1000 Genomes Project such that our model-based approach scales to much larger sample sizes than previously possible.

Our aim was to examine skeletal muscle proteome response to 10-week resistance training (RT1) followed by 10-week training cessation (i.e. detraining, DT), and finally 10-week retraining (RT2). Thirty healthy, untrained participants conducted either periodic RT (RT1-DT-RT2, n=17) or a 10-week no-training control period (n=13) followed by 20 weeks of RT (n=11). RT included twice-weekly supervised whole-body RT sessions, and resting vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained for proteomics analysis using high-end DIA-PASEFs mass spectrometry. First RT period altered 150 proteins (93% increased) involved in e.g. energy metabolism, cytokine signalling, and protein processing compared with minor changes during the no-training control period. The proteome adaptations were similar after the second RT compared to baseline demonstrating reproducibility in proteome adaptations to RT. Many of the proteins were reversed towards baseline after detraining and increased again after retraining. These reversible proteins were especially involved in aerobic energy metabolism. Interestingly, several proteins remain elevated after detraining, including carbonyl reductase 1, histone H1.5, and many calcium-binding proteins. Specifically, Calpain 2 (CAPN2), a calcium-activated protease was recently identified as an epigenetic muscle memory gene. We show for the first time that human skeletal muscle experiences retained levels of several proteins even into detraining. This shows that resistance training evokes long-term protein changes in skeletal muscle and is the first study to demonstrate a proteomic memory of muscle growth following resistance training in human skeletal muscle.

Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and its deficiency induces extensive reprogramming of growth and defense strategies in plants. This process involves Phosphate Starvation Response 1 (PHR1), a master regulator of the Phosphate Starvation Response (PSR). In this study, we identify a novel, non-canonical role for TORC1 in regulating P starvation responses in Arabidopsis. We demonstrate that P limitation activates TORC1, leading to the stabilization of PHR1. Inhibition of TORC1 increased sensitivity to P starvation, accompanied by disruption of starvation-induced transcriptional reprogramming. Additionally, our results reveal that the TORC1-PHR1 signaling axis plays a crucial role in reprogramming the expression of genes involved in the plant immune signaling network. This regulation is critical for the symbiotic association with the endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica under P starvation. These findings underscore the significant role of the TORC1-PHR1 module in orchestrating the PSR and highlight the evolutionary adaptation of TORC1 signaling pathways in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Human skin undergoes both chronological aging and environmental degradation, particularly UV-induced photoaging. Detrimental structural and physiological changes caused by aging include epidermal thinning due to stem cell depletion and dermal atrophy associated with decreased collagen production. Here, we present a comprehensive single-cell atlas of skin aging, analyzing samples from young, middle-aged, and elderly individuals, including both sun-exposed and sun-protected areas. This atlas reveals age-related cellular composition and function changes across various skin cell types, including epidermal stem cells, fibroblasts, hair follicles, and endothelial cells. Using our atlas, we have identified basal stem cells as a highly variable population across aging, more so than other skin cell populations such as fibroblasts. In basal stem cells, we identified ATF3 as a novel regulator of skin aging. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor for genes involved in the aging process, with its expression reduced by 20% during aging. Based on this discovery, we have developed an innovative mRNA-based treatment to mitigate the effects of skin aging. Cell senescence decreased 25% in skin cells treated with ATF3 mRNA, and we observed an over 20% increase in proliferation in treated basal stem cells. Importantly, we also found crosstalk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts as a critical component of therapeutic interventions, with ATF3 rescue of basal cells significantly enhancing fibroblast collagen production by approximately 200%. We conclude that ATF3-targeted mRNA treatment effectively reverses the effects of skin aging by modulating specific cellular mechanisms, offering a novel, targeted approach to human skin rejuvenation.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Fusing an attenuated DarT2 to a Cas9 nickase, we program site-specific ADP-ribosylation of thymines within a target DNA sequence. In tested bacteria, targeting drives efficient homologous recombination in tested bacteria, offering flexible and scar-free genome editing without base replacement nor counterselection.

Here we present a systematic approach to extract and analyze interpretable features from PLMs using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). By training SAEs on embeddings from the PLM ESM-2, we identify up to 2,548 human-interpretable latent features per layer that strongly correlate with up to 143 known biological concepts such as binding sites, structural motifs, and functional domains. In contrast, examining individual neurons in ESM-2 reveals up to 46 neurons per layer with clear conceptual alignment across 15 known concepts, suggesting that PLMs represent most concepts in superposition. Beyond capturing known annotations, we show that ESM-2 learns coherent concepts that do not map onto existing annotations and propose a pipeline using language models to automatically interpret novel latent features learned by the SAEs. As practical applications, we demonstrate how these latent features can fill in missing annotations in protein databases and enable targeted steering of protein sequence generation. Our results demonstrate that PLMs encode rich, interpretable representations of protein biology and we propose a systematic framework to extract and analyze these latent features.

Unlike classical senses, signals from vestibular organs are not conveyed to a dedicated cortical area but are broadcast throughout the cortex. Surprisingly, the routes taken by vestibular signals to reach the cortex are still largely uncharted. Here we show that the primary visual cortex (V1) receives real-time head movement signals -- direction, velocity, and acceleration -- from the ipsilateral pulvinar and contralateral visual cortex. The ipsilateral pulvinar provides the main head movement signal, with a bias toward contraversive movements (e.g. clockwise movements in left V1). Conversely, the contralateral visual cortex provides head movement signals during ipsiversive movements. Crucially, head movement variables encoded in V1 are already encoded in the pulvinar, suggesting that those variables are computed subcortically. Thus, the convergence of inter- and intrahemispheric signals endows V1 with a rich representation of the animals head movements.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Here we use a computational model to explore how local and global components of a network shape the Slow Wave Activity (SWA). We performed a sensitivity analysis of multiple cellular and synaptic features in models of isolated and connected networks. This allowed us to explore how the interaction of local properties and long-range connections shape the SWA of a population and its neighbors, as well as how the sequential propagation of active Up states lead to the emergence of preferred modes of propagation. We described relevant features of cortical Up states that are modulated by stiff combinations of parameters of the local circuit as opposed to other that are sensitive to the level of excitability of the whole network and the input coming from neighbor populations. We found that while manipulations in the synaptic excitatory/inhibitory balance can create local changes, cellular components that modulate the excitability or adaptation of a population have a long-range effect that leads to changes in neighbor populations too. Additionally, our simulations guided in vivo experiments that showed how heterogeneities in excitability between cortical areas can determine the directionality of travelling waves during SWA. We expect these results to motivate future research exploring and comparing cortical circuits through the analysis of their Up states.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Here we take a bottom-up approach and investigate a simple biochemistry-based model based on prior electrophysiological measurements in Stentor along with general properties of receptor molecules. In this model, a mechanoreceptor senses the stimulus and leads to channel opening to change membrane potential, with a sufficient change in polarization triggering an action potential that drives contraction. Receptors that are activated can become internalized, after which they can either be degraded or recycled back to the cell surface. This activity-dependent internalization provides a potential means for the cell to learn. Stochastic simulations of this model confirm that it is capable of showing habituation similar to what is seen in actual Stentor cells, including the lack of dishabituation by strong stimuli and the apparently step-like response of individual cells during habituation. The model also can account for several habituation hallmarks that a previous two-state Markov model could not, namely, the dependence of habituation rate on stimulus magnitude, which had to be added onto the two state model but arises naturally in the receptor inactivation model; the rate of response recovery after cessation of stimulation; the ability of high frequency stimulus sequences to drive faster habituation that results in a lower response probability, and the potentiation of habituation by repeated rounds of training and recovery. The model makes the prediction that application of high force stimuli that do not normally habituate should drive habituation to weaker stimuli due to decrease in the receptor number, which serves as an internal hidden variable. We confirmed this prediction using two new sets of experiments involving alternation of weak and strong stimuli. Furthermore, the model predicts that training with high force stimuli delays response recovery to low force stimuli, which aligns with our new experimental data. The model also predicts subliminal accumulation, wherein continuation of training even after habituation has reached asymptotic levels should lead to delayed response recovery, which was also confirmed by new experiments. The model is unable to account for the phenomenon of rate sensitivity, in which habituation caused by higher frequency stimuli is more easily reversed leading to a frequency dependence of response recovery. Such rate sensitivity has not been reported in Stentor. Here we carried out a new set of experiments which are consistent with the models prediction of the lack of rate sensitivity. This work demonstrates how a simple model can suggest new ways to probe single-cell learning at an experimental level. Finally, we interpret the model in terms of a kernel estimator that the cell may use to guide its decisions about how to response to new stimuli as they arise based on information, or the lack thereof, from past stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

We find that upregulations of RNA Polymerase II subunits, especially the largest ones, correlates with poor cancer patients' outcome across a range of tumor types, presenting increased genome instability. Overexpressing the subunits RPB1, RPB3 and RPB4 in cells we find that these induce DNA damage. However, the mechanisms behind this increased genome instability are specific for each subunit, linked to the unique transcription alterations generated by the subunit overexpression. Importantly, we find significant overlap between the genes with more DNA damage in our cell line models and those more affected in cancers with subunit upregulation, indicating that upregulations could be responsible for some of the phenotypes present in these patients.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Crucially, fMRI is vital for studying subcortical areas, as those are practically out of reach for conventional EEG. At the same time, EEG is cost-effective and, thus, often preferable to fMRI if comparable information could be extracted which is not the case then the deep subcortical brain activity is of interest. Here we explore the possibility of recovering subcortical hemodynamics from the non-invasively recorded scalp EEG signals. To this end, we have developed a lightweight EEG-to-fMRI neural network and using an extended and publicly available dataset with concurrently recorded EEG-fMRI data show that our model allows for the prediction of the detailed Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity of 7 bilaterally symmetric subcortical structures solely from multichannel EEG data. We report the performance significantly above chance and exceeding the scores achieved for a single subcortical structure and obtained on the proprietary datasets. In contrast to the studies focusing on a single subcortical region in our approach we were able to decode multichannel EEG into 14 + 4 region-specific variations of BOLD signals measured relative to their mean hemodynamic activity. The use of relative BOLD signals allowed us to exert control over the artificial inflation of decoding accuracy scores when the decoder predicts the common mode component that is likely to have a non-neuronal origin (heartbeat, movement, etc). Finally, we interpreted our model. The electrical activity of the sensorimotor cortex appeared to contribute most to the prediction of the subcortical hemodynamics. Also, the hemodynamics of the thalamus has the smallest delay with respect to the EEG signals. Both observations are physiologically plausible and ensure the potential reliability of the decoder. Taken together, these findings pave the road towards the creation of low-cost AI-powered EEG-based fMRI digital twin technology capable of tracking subcortical activity in an ecological setting. The technology, once mature, will find numerous applications from fundamental neuroscience through diagnostics to neurorehabilitation and affective neurointerfaces.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Neurotransmitter release, for example, is usually the role of the axon. There are widespread exceptions to this rule, however, including many mammalian neuronal types that can release neurotransmitter from their dendrites. In the mouse olfactory bulb, closely related subclasses of dopaminergic interneuron differ markedly in their polarity, with one subtype lacking an axon entirely. These axon-bearing and anaxonic dopaminergic subclasses have distinct developmental profiles and sensory responses, but how their fundamental polarity differences translate to functional outputs remains entirely unknown. Here, we provide anatomical evidence for distinct neurotransmitter release strategies among these closely related dopaminergic subtypes: anaxonic cells release from their dendrites, while axon-bearing neurons release exclusively from their intermittently myelinated axon. These structural differences are linked to a clear functional distinction: anaxonic, but not axon-bearing dopaminergic neurons are capable of self-inhibition. Our findings suggest that variations in polarity can produce striking distinctions in neuronal outputs, and that even closely related neuronal subclasses may play entirely separate roles in sensory information processing.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

However, it remains unanswered why this region is recruited for speaking. Speech production involves not only conceptualization and motor planning, but also respiration that provides the airflow necessary for creating sounds. Thus, the role of Broca's area in speech may be shaped by the functionality and the related brain regions associated with lungs. To test this hypothesis, we recruited the patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and required them to speak out words while scanning their brains with functional and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI and qMRI). We found that the COPD patients exhibited altered cortical responses during speaking in left inferior prefrontal and other regions, and the cortical sites governing breathing functioned abnormally in this task. In addition, using the qMRI to generate longitudinal relaxation time (T1) maps as an index of brain microstructural changes including dendritic maturation and myelination, we discovered that the patients showed significantly higher T1 values than the control group in Broca's area, suggesting reduced myelination and impaired microstructural integrity. Crucially, the data indicated that more severe dyspnea was associated with less well-developed microstructure in Broca's area and its weaker activation. Our study has demonstrated for the first time that lungs may function to shape Broca's area as the speaking center, and this is consistent with the recent work of a lung-brain axis.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Moreover, multiple zoonotic infections in humans have been reported. Importantly, HPAI H5N1 viruses with genetic markers of adaptation to mammals have been detected. Together with HPAI H5N1, avian influenza viruses H7N9 (high and low pathogenic) stand out due to their high mortality rates in humans. This raises the question of how prepared we are serologically and whether seasonal vaccines are capable of inducing protective immunity against these influenza subtypes. An observational study was conducted in which sera from people born between years 1925-1967, 1968-1977, and 1978-1997 were collected before or after 28 days or 6 months post-vaccination with an inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine. Then, haemagglutination inhibition, viral neutralization, and immunoassays were performed to assess the basal protective immunity of the population as well as the ability of seasonal influenza vaccines to induce protective responses. Our results indicate that subtype-specific serological protection against H5N1 and H7N9 in the representative Spanish population evaluated was limited or nonexistent. However, seasonal vaccination was able to increase the antibody titers to protective levels in a moderate percentage of people, probably due to cross-reactive responses. These findings demonstrate the importance of vaccination and suggest that seasonal influenza vaccines could be used as a first line of defense against an eventual pandemic caused by avian influenza viruses, to be followed immediately by the use of more specific pandemic vaccines.

ImportanceInfluenza A viruses (IAV) can infect and replicate in multiple mammalian and avian species. Avian influenza virus (AIV) is a highly contagious viral disease that occurs primarily in poultry and wild water birds. Due to the lack of population immunity in humans and ongoing evolution of AIV, there is a continuing risk that new IAV could emerge and rapidly spread worldwide causing a pandemic, if the ability to transmit efficiently among humans was gained. The aim of this study is to analyze the basal protection and presence of antibodies against IAV H5N1, and H7N9 subtypes in the population from different ages. Moreover, we have evaluated the h humoral response after immunization with a seasonal influenza vaccine. This study is strategically important to evaluate the level of population immunity that is a major factor when assessing the impact that an emerging IAV strain would have, and the role of seasonal vaccines to mitigate the effects of a pandemic.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Here, we present tools that allow rapid manipulation of vimentin IFs in the whole cytoplasm or within specific subcellular regions by inducibly coupling them to microtubule motors, either pharmacologically or using light. Perinuclear clustering of vimentin had no strong effect on the actin or microtubule organization, cell spreading, and focal adhesions, but reduced cell stiffness. Mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum sheets were repositioned together with vimentin, whereas lysosomes were only briefly repositioned and rapidly regained their normal distribution. Keratin was displaced along with vimentin in some cell lines but remained intact in others.

Many neuronal types show a large depolarization baseline offset (DBLO), which is defined as the positive difference between the minimum membrane potential during action potential trains and resting. We used stochastic parameter search in experimentally constrained conductance-based models to show that four key factors together account for high DBLO: Liquid Junction Potential correction, high backpropagating passive charges during the repolarization phase of an action potential, fast potassium delayed rectifier kinetics, and appropriate transient sodium current kinetics. Several plausible mechanisms for DBLO, such as Ohmic depolarization due to current input or low-pass filtering by the membrane, fail to explain the effect, and many published conductance-based models do not correctly manifest high DBLO. Finally, physiological levels of DBLO constrain ion channel levels and kinetics, and are linked to cellular processes such as bistable firing, spikelets, and calcium influx.

Compared with 3 Tesla (3T) MRI, 7 Tesla (7T) MRI can detect more subtle injuries, including hippocampal subfield volume differences and additional standard biomarkers such as white matter lesions. 7T MRI could help with the interpretation of the various persistent post-acute and distal onset sequelae of COVID-19 infection.

ObjectiveTo investigate the differences in white matter hyperintensity (WMH), hippocampal subfields volumes, and cognition between patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and non-hospitalized participants in a multi-site/multi-national cohort.

DesignOriginal investigation of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between 5/2020 and 10/2022 in 3 USA and 1 UK medical centers with follow-up at hospital discharge.

ParticipantsA total of 179 participants without a history of dementia completed cognitive, mood and other assessments and MRI scans.

ExposureCOVID-19 severity, as measured by hospitalization vs no hospitalization

Main Outcomes and Measures7T MRI scans were acquired. All WMH and hippocampal subfield volumes were corrected for intracranial volumes to account for subject variability. Cognition was assessed using a comprehensive battery of tests. Pearson correlations and unpaired t-tests were performed to assess correlations and differences between hospitalized and non-hospitalized groups.

ResultsWe found similar WMH volume (4112 vs 3144mm3, p=0.2131), smaller hippocampal volume (11856 vs 12227mm3, p=0.0497) and lower cognitive and memory performance, especially the MoCA score (24.9 vs 26.4 pts, p=0.0084), duration completing trail making test B (97.6 vs 79.4 seconds, p=0.0285), Craft immediate recall (12.6 vs 16.4 pts, p<0.0001), Craft delay recall (12.0 vs 15.6 pts, p=0.0001), and Benson figure copy (15.2 vs 16.1 pts, p=0.0078) in 52 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (19[37%] female; mean[SD] age, 61.1[7.4] years) compared with 111 age-matched non-hospitalized participants (66[59%] female; mean[SD] age, 61.5[8.4] years).

Conclusions and RelevanceOur results indicate that hospitalized COVID-19 cases show lower hippocampal volume when compared to non-hospitalized participants. We also show that WMH and hippocampal volumes correlate with worse cognitive scores in hospitalized patients compared with non-hospitalized participants, potentially indicating recent lesions and atrophy.

Key PointsQuestion: Do white matter hyperintensity burden, hippocampal whole and subfield volumes, and cognition differ between patients hospitalized with COVID-19 versus participants without hospitalization?

Findings: We found no significant difference in white matter hyperintensity volume, but hippocampal volume was reduced, and cognitive and memory performance were worse in those hospitalized for COVID-19 compared with age-matched non-hospitalized group (either mild COVID-19 or no COVID-19 reported). In the hospitalized group, increased white matter hyperintensity and reduced hippocampal volumes are significantly higher correlated with worse cognitive and memory scores.

Meaning: Adults hospitalized for COVID-19 had lower hippocampal volumes and worse cognitive performance than adults with COVID-19 that did not lead to hospitalization or without reported COVID-19 infection.","NA","medrxiv",1732486163469

While intracellular Ca2+ signalling has been shown to control cell migration in multiple cell contexts, it is unknown whether it is required for DVE migration. The pattern of Ca2+ activity in the mouse embryo at early peri-implantation stages is also unknown. Using the GCaMP6f Ca2+ reporter line we performed a detailed assessment of Ca2+ dynamics between E0.5 - E5.5 using live imaging. We find that prior to implantation, Ca2+ transients are rare, but at E5.5 widespread, periodic, Ca2+ transients in extra-embryonic tissues can be observed, including in the VE and ExE. In contrast, cells of the E5.5 epiblast remain relatively quiescent but show sporadic large-scale multi-cellular waves. Inhibition of SERCA at E5.5 abolishes Ca2+ transients and leads to DVE arrest, indicative that these transients are required for axial patterning. Together these results reveal the pattern of Ca2+ handling in the early mouse embryo and a novel requirement in anterior-posterior axis formation.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Our ""Takoyaki"" pulse sequence uses the simultaneous scanning of multiple focal points to excite contrast agents with sufficient acoustic pressure for nonlinear imaging while efficiently covering 3D space. Through in vitro experiments, we first show that the Takoyaki sequence produces highly sensitive volume images of gas vesicle contrast agents and compare its performance with alternative imaging schemes. We then establish its utility in cellular imaging in vivo by visualizing acoustic reporter gene-expressing tumors in a mouse model of glioblastoma. Finally, we demonstrate real-time volumetric imaging by tracking the dynamics of fluid motion in brain ventricles after intraventricular contrast injection. Takoyaki imaging enables a more comprehensive understanding of biological processes by providing spatiotemporal information in 3D within the constraints of accessible multiplexed matrix array systems.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

This longevity discrepancy also extends to health and aging-larger dogs show higher rates of age-related diseases. Despite this well-established phenomenon, we still know little about the biomarkers and molecular mechanisms that might underlie breed differences in aging and survival. To address this gap, we generated an epigenetic clock using DNA methylation from over 3 million CpG sites in a deeply phenotyped cohort of 864 companion dogs from the Dog Aging Project, including some dogs sampled annually for 2-3 years. We found that the largest breed size tends to have epigenomes that are, on average, 0.37 years older per chronological year compared to the smallest breed size. We also found that higher residual epigenetic age was significantly associated with increased mortality risk, with dogs experiencing a 34% higher risk of death for each year increase in residual epigenetic age. These findings not only broaden our understanding of how aging manifests within a diverse species but also highlight the significant role that demographic factors play in modulating the biological mechanisms underlying aging. Additionally, they highlight the utility of DNA methylation as both a biomarker for healthspan-extending interventions, a mortality predictor, and a mechanism for understanding inter-individual variation in aging in dogs.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Despite considerable progress in physics-based methods for peptide design and deep-learning methods for protein design, there are currently no robust approaches for de novo design of protein-binding macrocycles. Here, we introduce RFpeptides, a denoising diffusion-based pipeline for designing macrocyclic peptide binders against protein targets of interest. We test 20 or fewer designed macrocycles against each of four diverse proteins and obtain medium to high-affinity binders against all selected targets. Designs against MCL1 and MDM2 demonstrate KD between 1-10 M, and the best anti-GABARAP macrocycle binds with a KD of 6 nM and a sub-nanomolar IC50 in vitro. For one of the targets, RbtA, we obtain a high-affinity binder with KD < 10 nM despite starting from the target sequence alone due to the lack of an experimentally determined target structure. X-ray structures determined for macrocycle-bound MCL1, GABARAP, and RbtA complexes match very closely with the computational design models, with three out of the four structures demonstrating Ca RMSD of less than 1.5 [A] to the design models. In contrast to library screening approaches for which determining binding mode can be a major bottleneck, the binding modes of RFpeptides-generated macrocycles are known by design, which should greatly facilitate downstream optimization. RFpeptides thus provides a powerful framework for rapid and custom design of macrocyclic peptides for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163469

Here, we present a framework for the identification and validation of tumor-reactive T cells as a biomarker to quantify ICI efficacy and as candidates for a personalized TCR-T cell therapy. Therefore, we profiled a pediatric malignant rhabdoid tumor patient with complete remission after ICI therapy using deep single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the peripheral blood. Specifically, we tracked T cell dynamics longitudinally from the tumor to cells in circulating over a time course of 12 months, revealing a systemic response and durable clonal expansion of tumor-resident and ICI-induced TCR clonotypes. We functionally validated tumor reactivity of TCRs identified from the TME and the blood by co-culturing patient-derived tumor cells with TCR-engineered autologous T cells. Here, we observed unexpectedly high frequencies of tumor-reactive TCR clonotypes in the TME and confirmed T cell dynamics in the blood post-ICI to predict tumor-reactivity. These findings strongly support spatio-temporal tracking of T cell activity in response to ICI to inform therapy efficacy and to serve as a source of tumor-reactive TCRs for personalized TCR-T designs.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163470

To address this, we present a comprehensive assessment of tissue changes occurring during human aging, utilizing a vast array of whole slide histopathological images from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx). We analyzed 25,712 images from 40 distinct tissue types across 983 individuals, applying deep learning to quantify the nuanced morphological changes that tissues undergo with age.

We developed  tissue clocks--predictors of biological age based on tissue images--which achieved a mean prediction error of 4.9 years and were associated with telomere attrition, the incidence of subclinical pathologies, and comorbidities. In a systematic assessment of biological age rates across organs, we identified pervasive non-uniform rates of aging across the human lifespan, with some organs exhibiting earlier changes (20-40 years old) and others showing bimodal patterns of age-related changes. We also uncovered several associations between demographic, lifestyle, and medical history factors and tissue-specific acceleration or deceleration of biological age, highlighting potential modifiable risk factors that influenced the aging process at the tissue level. Finally, by combining paired histological images and gene expression data, we developed a strategy to predict tissue-specific age gaps from blood samples. This approach was validated in external cohorts of both healthy individuals and those with chronic diseases, revealing the organs most differentially affected by aging in disease contexts.

This work offers a new perspective on the aging process by positioning tissue structure as an integrator of cellular and molecular changes that reflect the physiological state of organs. These findings underscore the value of histopathological imaging as a tool for understanding human aging and provide a foundation for the exploration of tissue-specific aging processes in age-associated diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163470

This includes the recent circulation of H5N1 in dairy cattle herds in the USA and a rise in associated human cases. In this study, we investigated differences in tissue tropism of two HPAI H5N1 strains, the isolate A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (VN1203) isolated from a fatal human case in 2004 and the bovine isolate A/Bovine/Ohio/B24osu-342/2024 (Bov342) isolated in 2024, in C57BL/6J mice. Infection with either HPAI H5N1 isolate was uniformly lethal in mice. However, tissue tropism differed significantly: while VN1203 replication was largely restricted to the respiratory tract, Bov342 successfully replicated in the respiratory tract as well as various regions of the brain. Bov342-challenged animals exhibited clinical signs consistent with central nervous system (CNS) infection, and infectious virus was detected in brain tissue. Correspondingly, cytokine profiles in the brain differed significantly between the isolates. Notably, in addition to abundant evidence of CNS infection in Bov342-challenged mice via immunohistochemistry, sporadic intranuclear and intracytoplasmic immunoreactivity was observed in other tissues in the head, including the choroid plexus, retina, and inner ear. This study demonstrates that while both HPAI H5N1 isolates are uniformly lethal in C57BL/6J mice upon aerosol exposure, significant differences exist in tissue tropism, with Bov342 resulting in respiratory disease as well as increased neurotropism and inflammation in the brain and nasal turbinates compared to VN1203, which predominantly induces respiratory disease.

Significance statementThe rise in HPAI H5N1 infections among mammals, including humans in the USA, highlights an emerging One Health concern. Understanding the phenotypic changes of HPAI H5N1 and associated increase in infection of mammalian hosts is critical. In this study, we investigated the tissue tropism in mice of a bovine HPAI H5N1 strain isolated in 2024 and compared it to a strain isolated from a human patient in 2004. Our findings reveal that the bovine isolate exhibits enhanced neurotropism, unlike the respiratory-restricted replication observed with the HPAI H5N1 isolate from 2004. This difference in tissue tropism, accompanied by distinct cytokine responses in the brain, underscores the potential for altered disease outcomes in other mammalian hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163470

In particular, plague has been linked to population declines in Late Neolithic Europe3,4. Although plague is amongst the most devastating diseases in human history, early strains of Yersinia pestis, the causal agent of plague, lack virulence factors required for the bubonic form5, and their severity remains unclear. Here, we describe the oldest strains of plague reported so far, associated with two early phases of outbreaks among prehistoric hunter-gatherers in the Lake Baikal region in East Siberia, beginning from [~]5600-5400 years ago (cal. BP). These outbreaks occur across four hunter-gatherer cemeteries; the largest of these (Ust-Ida I) has a 38.7% detection rate for plague infection (39% detection across all sites). By reconstructing kinship pedigrees, we show that small familial groups are affected, consistent with human-to-human spread of the disease, and the first outbreak occurred within a single generation. Intriguingly, the infections appear to have resulted in acute mortality events, especially among children. Zoonotic transmission is separately indicated by a Brucella infection in one of the children. Interestingly, we see differences in functional genomic variants in the prehistoric plague strains, including in the ypm superantigen known from Y. pseudotuberculosis today. The new strains diverge ancestrally to all known Y. pestis diversity and push back the Y. pestis divergence from Y. pseudotuberculosis by some 2000 years6. Our results show that plague outbreaks happen earlier than previously thought and that these early outbreaks were indeed lethal. The findings challenge the common notion that high population densities and lifestyle changes during the Neolithic transition were prerequisites for plague epidemics.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163470

While human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived organoids are valuable models for studying human organ function, they often lack critical tissue-resident immune cells. Here, we introduce an advanced human heart assembloid model, termed hHMA (human heart-macrophage assembloid), which fully integrates autologous cardiac tissue-resident macrophages (MPs) with pre-existing human heart organoids (hHOs). Through multi-omic analyses, we confirmed that these MPs are phenotypically similar to embryonic cardiac tissue-resident MPs and remain viable in the assembloids over time. The inclusion of MPs significantly impacts hHMA development, influencing cardiac cellular composition, boosting cellular communication, remodeling the extracellular matrix, promoting ventricular morphogenesis, and enhancing sarcomeric maturation. Our findings indicate that MPs contribute to homeostasis via efferocytosis, integrate into the cardiomyocyte electrical system, and support catabolic metabolism. To demonstrate the versatility of this model, we developed a platform to study cardiac arrhythmias by chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory factors linked to arrhythmogenesis in clinical settings, successfully replicating key features of inflammasome-mediated atrial fibrillation. Overall, this work introduces a robust platform for examining the role of immune cells in cardiac development, disease mechanisms, and drug discovery, bridging the gap between in vitro models and human physiology. These findings offer insights into cardiogenesis and inflammation-driven heart disease, positioning the hHMA system as an invaluable tool for future cardiovascular research and therapeutic development.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163470

In the context of natural selection analyses, specifically codon evolutionary models, excessive rates of false positives result. A characteristic signature of error-driven findings is unrealistically high estimates of dN/dS (e.g., >100), affecting only a small fraction (e.g., [~]0.1%) of the alignment. Despite the widespread use of codon models to assess alignment quality, their potential for error correction remains unexplored. We present BUSTED-E: a novel method designed to detect positive selection while concurrently identifying alignment errors. This method is a straightforward adaptation of the BUSTED flexible branch-site random effects model used to fit distributions of dN/dS, with an important modification: it integrates an ""error-sink"" component representing an abiological evolutionary regime (dN/dS > 100), and provides the option for masking errors in the MSA for downstream analyses. Statistical performance of BUSTED-E on data simulated without errors shows that there is a small loss of power, which can be mitigated by model averaged inference. Using four published empirical datasets, we show BUSTED-E reduces unrealistic rates of positive selection detection, often by an order of magnitude, and improves biological interpretability of results. BUSTED-E also detects errors that are largely distinct from other popular alignment cleaning tools (HMMCleaner and BMGE). Overall, BUSTED-E is a robust and scalable solution for improving the accuracy of evolutionary analyses in the presence of residual alignment errors, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of natural selection and adaptive evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163470

Biochemical large language models have transformed the interpretation of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, but have not yet had a comparable impact on understanding small molecule metabolism. Here, we present an approach that leverages chemical language models to discover previously uncharacterized metabolites. We introduce DeepMet, a chemical language model that learns the latent biosynthetic logic embedded within the structures of known metabolites and exploits this understanding to anticipate the existence of as-of-yet undiscovered metabolites. Prospective chemical synthesis of metabolites predicted to exist by DeepMet directs their targeted discovery. Integrating DeepMet with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data enables automated metabolite discovery within complex tissues. We harness DeepMet to discover several dozen structurally diverse mammalian metabolites.

However, most scientists dont have access to experts from multiple fields. Fortunately, large language models (LLMs) have recently shown an impressive ability to aid researchers across diverse domains by answering scientific questions. Here, we expand the capabilities of LLMs for science by introducing the Virtual Lab, an AI-human research collaboration to perform sophisticated, interdisciplinary science research. The Virtual Lab consists of an LLM principal investigator agent guiding a team of LLM agents with different scientific backgrounds (e.g., a chemist agent, a computer scientist agent, a critic agent), with a human researcher providing high-level feedback. We design the Virtual Lab to conduct scientific research through a series of team meetings, where all the agents discuss a scientific agenda, and individual meetings, where an agent accomplishes a specific task. We demonstrate the power of the Virtual Lab by applying it to design nanobody binders to recent variants of SARS-CoV-2, which is a challenging, open-ended research problem that requires reasoning across diverse fields from biology to computer science. The Virtual Lab creates a novel computational nanobody design pipeline that incorporates ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta and designs 92 new nanobodies. Experimental validation of those designs reveals a range of functional nanobodies with promising binding profiles across SARS-CoV-2 variants. In particular, two new nanobodies exhibit improved binding to the recent JN.1 or KP.3 variants of SARS-CoV-2 while maintaining strong binding to the ancestral viral spike protein, suggesting exciting candidates for further investigation. This demonstrates the ability of the Virtual Lab to rapidly make impactful, real-world scientific discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163470

Our integration study unexpectedly reveals two distinct apCAF lineages present in most cancer types: one associated with mesothelial-like cells and the other with fibrocytes. Using a high-resolution single-cell spatial imaging platform, we characterize the spatial niches of these apCAF lineages. We find that mesothelial-like apCAFs are located near cancer cells, while fibrocyte-like apCAFs are associated with tertiary lymphoid structures. Additionally, we discover that both apCAF lineages can up-regulate the secreted protein SPP1, which facilitates primary tumor formation and peritoneal metastasis. Taken together, this study offers an unprecedented resolution in analyzing apCAF lineages and their spatial niches.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163470

Comprehensive studies are needed to assess its transmission dynamics and clinical presentation.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective observational cohort study at Kamituga General Hospital in South Kivu, DRC, between May 2 and October 9, 2024. Sociodemographic, exposure and clinical data were collected from mpox suspected cases. Cases confirmed by Xpert(R) Mpox PCR were presumed Clade Ib infections (awaiting Clade confirmation) and followed through hospitalization and on days 29 and 59 post-diagnosis to assess clinical progression and outcomes.

FindingsOf 511 included suspected cases, 431 (84%) tested PCR positive; with 205 being women (47%). Age distribution was bimodal, with 279 (65%) individuals aged 15-34 years, and 63 (15%) children under five. Most cases (59%) reported contact with a suspected or confirmed mpox case; among adults, this was primarily a spouse, colleague or sexual partner, while for children, the primary contacts were parents or siblings. Comorbidities were rare (4%), including six (1%) HIV infections. Prodromal symptoms were present in 346 (88%) patients, active skin lesions in 414 (96%), mucosal lesions in 338 (82%), and lymphadenopathy in 295 (71%). In adults, lesions were more concentrated in the genital area, with 90% of adults presenting lesions in this region. In contrast, only 39% of children had genital lesions, with lesions more frequently found elsewhere on the body. Among 427 hospitalized patients, two deaths (0{middle dot}5%) occurred. Among 315 patients with detailed hospital follow-up, complications were primarily genito-urinary (55%) or cutaneous (40%). Four of six pregnant women with recorded outcome (67%) had adverse pregnancy outcomes. Significant sequelae at days 29 and 59 were rare.

InterpretationClade Ib MPXV infections presented differently from previously reported Clade Ia and Clade IIb infections. In adults, the disease primarily affected the genito-urinary system, compatible with sexual transmission, while children mostly manifested extragenital lesions.

To explore these scenarios we analyzed odor-evoked activity in telencephalic area pDp of juvenile and adult zebrafish, the homolog of piriform cortex. No obvious signatures of attractor dynamics were detected. Rather, olfactory discrimination training selectively enhanced the separation of neural manifolds representing task-relevant odors from other representations, consistent with predictions of autoassociative network models endowed with precise synaptic balance. Analytical approaches using the framework of manifold capacity revealed multiple geometrical modifications of representational manifolds that supported the classification of task-relevant sensory information. Manifold capacity predicted odor discrimination across individuals, indicating a close link between manifold geometry and behavior. Hence, pDp and possibly related recurrent networks store information in the geometry of representational manifolds, resulting in joint sensory and semantic maps that may support distributed learning processes.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163470

We identified potential pathways contributing to the occurrence and tolerance of CIN. These findings were further validated using single cell multiome data from human placentas, where we observed a high prevalence of heterogeneous aneuploidy across trophoblast cells. Despite extensive chromosomal abnormalities, TSCs maintained their proliferative and differentiation capacities, suggesting that CIN is a typical aspect of placental development.

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163470

However, null space theory makes the counter-intuitive prediction that neurons often generate spikes not to cause behavior, but to prevent the effects that other neurons would have on behavior. What is missing is a direct way to test this theory in the brain. Here, we found that in the marmoset cerebellum, spike-triggered averaging identified a potent vector unique to each Purkinje cell (P-cell) along which the spikes of that cell displaced the eyes. Yet, the P-cells were active not just for saccades along their potent vector, but for all saccades. Simultaneous recordings revealed that two spikes in two different P-cells produced superposition of their potent vectors. The result was a population activity in which the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. But why was one neuron producing spikes that would be canceled by another neuron? To answer this question, we recorded from the mossy fiber inputs and the interneurons in the molecular layer. We found that the mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands as well as the sensory goal of the movement, then the interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P-cells as a population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped. Because this output had faster dynamics than was present in the individual neurons, the cerebellum placed the cells in subtractive competition with each other such that the downstream effects of spiking in one neuron were partially or completely eliminated because of the spiking in another neuron.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163470

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163470

Through computational mining of the human proteome using structure-based approaches, we predict over 1,400 CRBN-compatible {beta}-hairpin G-loop proteins across diverse target classes, identify novel mechanisms of neosubstrate recognition through structurally differentiated helical motifs and molecular surface mimicry, and validate 22 representative neosubstrates with clinical implications. This work broadens the CRBN target space, redefines rules for neosubstrate recognition and establishes a platform for the elimination of challenging drug targets by repurposing CRL4CRBN through next-generation molecular glue degraders.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163470

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment. The findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF.","NA","biorxiv",1732486163470
"Pain among US adults before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","10.1101/2024.10.24.24316018","medrxiv",39.5,0,0,0,39.5,"Zajacova, A.; Grol-Prokopczyk, H.","Anna Zajacova","University of Western Ontario","2024-10-25","1","PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","cc_by_nc_nd","public and global health","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/25/2024.10.24.24316018.source.xml","ImportanceChronic pain is a major public-health problem in the US. The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey. Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1732486163470
