Nanopore sequencing has long held the promise for such progress, but has had limited market penetration. This is because efficient and accurate nanopore sequencing of nucleic acids has been challenged by fundamental signal-to-noise limitations resulting from the poor spatial resolution and molecular distinction of nucleobases. Here, we describe Sequencing by Expansion (SBX), a single-molecule sequencing technology that overcomes these limitations by using a biochemical conversion process to encode the sequence of a target nucleic acid molecule into an Xpandomer, a highly measurable surrogate polymer. Expanding over 50 times longer than the parent DNA templates, Xpandomers are engineered with high signal-to-noise reporter codes to enable facile, high-accuracy nanopore sequencing. We demonstrate the performance of SBX and present the specialized molecular structures, chemistries, enzymes and methods that enable it. The innovative molecular and systems engineering in SBX create a transformative technology to address the needs of existing and emerging sequencing applications.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

We previously discovered that human TB granulomas are enriched for immunosuppressive factors typically associated with tumor-immune evasion, raising the intriguing possibility that they promote tolerance to infection. In this study, our goal was to identify the prime drivers for establishing this tolerogenic niche and to determine if the magnitude of this response correlates with bacterial persistence. To do this, we conducted a multimodal spatial analysis of 52 granulomas from 16 non-human primates (NHP) who were infected with low dose Mtb for 9-12 weeks. Notably, each granulomas bacterial burden was individually quantified allowing us to directly ask how granuloma spatial structure and function relate to infection control. We found that a universal feature of TB granulomas was partitioning of the myeloid core into two distinct metabolic environments, one of which is hypoxic. This hypoxic environment associated with pathologic immune cell states, dysfunctional cellular organization of the granuloma, and a near-complete blockade of lymphocyte infiltration that would be required for a successful host response. The extent of these hypoxia-associated features correlated with worsened bacterial burden. We conclude that hypoxia governs immune cell state and organization within granulomas and is a potent driver of subverted immunity during TB.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

In this study, we identified a subset of microglia distributed in close proximity to the ependymal wall of ventricles. They differed from parenchymal microglia in morphology, behaviors and transcriptomes. In particular, the paraventricular microglia extended transependymal dendrites into the lumen of ventricles and were proficient in sequestering and phagocytosing intraventricular exogenous particles when present. A specific removal of the paraventricular microglia led to an acute ventriculomegaly due to an increased colloid osmotic pressure in the CSF resulting from protein accumulation. Thus, we identified the paraventricular microglia as specific guardians in monitoring and cleaning the CSF.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

Yet imperiled seabird populations also contain prebreeders, including juveniles and subadults, that wait several years before breeding at colonies. We use previously-published data on reproductive and survival rates for 84 species to quantify the conservation relevance of prebreeding seabirds. We find, first, that prebreeders average about half of seabird populations (median 47.4%, range 11.2%-66.7%). Second, while seabird population growth is much more sensitive to adult survival than prebreeder survival, human-driven changes may shift the importance of prebreeders for future population stability. Third, lowering the breeding age is a powerful, but underexplored, route to increasing population growth. Managing prebreeders could thus play a key role in protecting seabirds. This task may require answering fundamental questions about the behavior of young birds. Broadly, we suggest that life history characteristics (e.g., breeding age) actively shape both obstacles to, and opportunities for, successful conservation.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

Neurologically deceased donors often show ischemic changes, while tissues near diseased regions may have altered gene expression. The liver, with its unique regenerative capacity, allows analysis from live healthy donors (LHDs). Using spatial transcriptomics (Visum, Visium HD and MERFISH), we analyzed 16 liver samples: eight from young LHDs and eight from patients with liver pathology, sampling  adjacent normal tissue. LHD livers displayed significant gene expression differences from  adjacent normal tissues. Hepatocytes exhibited marked zonation along the porto-central axis of liver lobules, with key functions pericentrally shifted compared to other mammals. Our atlas identified dynamic programs in early steatotic hepatocytes, showing transitions from lipid uptake in low-lipid regions to insulin hypersensitivity in high-lipid regions.

P. aeruginosa is known to be dominant, often compromising S. aureus through the secretion of inhibitory compounds. We previously demonstrated that S. aureus can become resistant to growth-inhibitory compounds during experimental evolution. While resistance arose rapidly, the underlying mechanisms were not obvious as only a few genetic mutations were associated with resistance, while ample phenotypic changes occurred. We thus hypothesize that resistance may result from a combination of phenotypic responses and genetic adaptation. Here, we tested this hypothesis using proteomics. We first focused on an evolved strain that acquired a single mutation in tcyA (encoding a transmembrane transporter unit) upon exposure to P. aeruginosa supernatant. We show that this mutation leads to a complete abolishment of transporter synthesis, which confers moderate protection against PQS and selenocystine, two toxic compounds produced by P. aeruginosa. However, this genetic effect was minor compared to the fundamental phenotypic changes observed at the proteome level when both ancestral and evolved S. aureus strains were exposed to P. aeruginosa supernatant. Major changes involved the downregulation of virulence factors, metabolic pathways, membrane transporters, and the upregulation of ROS scavengers and an efflux pump. Our results suggest that the observed multi-variate phenotypic response is a powerful adaptive strategy, offering instant protection against competitors in fluctuating environments and reducing the need for hard-wired genetic adaptations.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

Here, we present structures of the midnolin-proteasome complex, revealing how established proteasomal components are repurposed to enable a unique form of proteolysis. While the proteasomal subunit PSMD2/Rpn1 binds to ubiquitinated or ubiquitin-like proteins, we discover that it also interacts with the midnolin nuclear localization sequence, elucidating how midnolins activity is confined to the nucleus. Likewise, PSMD14/Rpn11, an enzyme that normally cleaves ubiquitin chains, surprisingly functions non-enzymatically as a receptor for the midnolin ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain, positioning the substrate-binding Catch domain directly above the proteasomal entry site to guide substrates into the proteasome. Moreover, we demonstrate that midnolin downregulation is critical for the survival of myeloma cells by promoting the expression of its transcription factor substrate IRF4. Our findings uncover the mechanisms underlying the midnolin-proteasome pathway and midnolin downregulation as a driver of multiple myeloma.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

Using genome-wide screening, we identified Ldm1 (Lipid Droplet Motility 1/Yer085c) as a myosin adaptor. Ldm1 binds to the globular tail domain of the myosin Myo2 and to the LD surface protein Ldo16 to enable actin-dependent LD motility.

However, it has largely been developed using data from individuals of White ethnicity.

MethodsWe utilised data from multiple sources to derive estimates for the distributions of risk factors and their effect sizes in major UK ethnic groups (White, Black, South Asian, East Asian, and Mixed). We combined these with ethnicity-specific population cancer incidences to update BOADICEA so that it provides ethnicity-specific risk estimates. We also developed and included a method for deriving adjusted polygenic scores for individuals of mixed genetic ancestry.

ResultsThe predicted average absolute risks were smaller in all non-White ethnic groups than in Whites, and the risk distributions were narrower. The proportion of women classified as at moderate or high risk of breast or ovarian cancer, according to national guidelines, was considerably smaller in non-White women.

DiscussionThe updated BOADICEA (v7), available in the CanRisk tool (www.canrisk.org), is based on estimates more appropriate for non-White women in the UK. Further validation of the model in prospective studies is required. Considering these findings, risk classification guidelines for non- White women may need to be revised.","NA","medrxiv",1740607705641

Stool MCBAs showed distinct age-dependent trajectories and correlated with gut microbiome composition. Altered levels of ursodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acid conjugates were linked to islet autoimmunity as well as modulated monocyte activation in response to immunostimulatory lipopolysaccharide and Th17/Treg cell balance.

Similar to other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 proteins modulate host genomic responses through epigenomic modifications, facilitating viral replication and immune evasion. While the nucleocapsid protein is well known for its role in RNA stability and immune modulation, its impact on host chromatin organization remains unclear. To investigate this, we generated stable human alveolar cell lines expressing nucleocapsid proteins from endemic and pandemic human coronaviruses. Our analysis revealed that nucleocapsid proteins from all tested coronaviruses induced changes in nucleosome positioning and occupancy at specific gene promoters involved in coagulation pathways, hormone signaling, and innate immune responses. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-specific alterations were identified in genes dysregulated in severe infections, such as suggesting a direct role for epigenomic modifications in disease pathophysiology. We also observed extensive changes in nucleosome susceptibility to nuclease digestion in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 samples that were not observed in common cold cell lines. Promoters with altered sensitivity and resistance to nuclease were linked to innate immune, metabolic, olfactory, and signaling pathways known to be dysregulated in severe COVID-19 and post-acute sequelae (PASC). These findings demonstrate that nucleocapsid protein expression alters chromatin structure at specific loci, implicating viral proteins in host genome dysregulation. Furthermore, we identified both shared and unique chromatin targets of SARS-CoV-2 and common cold coronaviruses, highlighting pathways for further investigation and potential therapeutic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

Studies in Alzheimer's rodent models report that KD and/or ketogenic supplements attenuate cognitive-behavioral impairments, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta plaques and tau pathology. However, it is unknown whether KD can similarly benefit individuals with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a prevalent condition in which amyloid accumulates in cerebral vessels. CAA is highly comorbid in patients with Alzheimer's and, on its own, increases the risk of stroke, cognitive impairment, and dementia, yet no effective treatments currently exist. The objective of this study was to determine whether KD can improve cognitive-behavioral and neuropathological outcomes in a mouse model with CAA. Male Tg-SwDI mice were fed either a standard chow or KD from 3.5 to 7.5 months of age. Following ~3 months of dietary intervention, glucose and ketone-body levels were assessed, then mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests to evaluate locomotor activity, anxiety-related behaviors, and cognition. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess amyloid pathology, vascular density, neuroinflammation, white matter integrity, and hippocampal neurogenesis. In addition to KD inducing nutritional ketosis and achieving metabolic benefits, mice on KD exhibited increased activity, enhanced spatial learning and memory, and a trend toward improved spatial working memory. These cognitive benefits were accompanied by an attenuation of amyloid pathology and increased hippocampal neurogenesis. These findings suggest that a ketogenic diet may be safe and effective in Alzheimer's and dementia patients with CAA.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

Analysis of spontaneous events typically requires evaluation of hundreds of events over minutes to hours, and the most common method of analysis, z-scoring, was not designed for this purpose. Here, we compare the accuracy and reliability of three different analysis methods to identify pharmacologically induced changes in dopamine release and uptake in freely moving C57BL/6J mice. The D1-like receptor antagonist SCH23390 was used to prevent dLight sensors from interacting with dopamine in the extracellular space, while cocaine was used to inhibit uptake and raclopride to increase release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. We examined peak-to-peak frequency, peak amplitude, and width, the time spent above an established cutoff. The three methods were 1) the widely-used ""Z-Score Method"", which automatically smooths baseline drift and normalizes recordings using signal-to-noise ratios, 2) a ""Manual Method"", in which local baselines were adjusted manually and individual cutoffs were determined for each subject, and 3) the ""Prominence Method"" that combines z-scoring with prominence assessment to tag individual peaks, then returns to the preprocessed data for kinetic analysis. First, SCH23390 drastically reduced the number of signals detected as expected, but only when the Manual Method was used. Z-scoring failed to identify any changes, due to its amplification of noise when signals were diminished. Cocaine increased signal width as expected using the Manual and Prominence Methods, but not the Z-Score Method. Finally, raclopride-induced increases in amplitude were correctly identified by the Manual and Prominence Methods. The Z-Score Method failed to identify any of the changes in dopamine release and uptake kinetics. Thus, analysis of spontaneous dopamine signals requires assessment of the %{Delta}F/F values, ideally using the Manual Method, and the use of z-scoring is not appropriate.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

However, access to and extraction of relevant data from this extensive resource remain challenging. Advances in text and data mining (TDM) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques offer new opportunities for liberating such information from the literature. Testing and using such approaches to annotate articles in machine actionable formats is therefore necessary to enable the exploitation of existing knowledge in new biology, ecology, and evolution research. Here we explore the potential of these methods to annotate and extract organismal and ecological trait data for the most diverse animal group on Earth, the arthropods. The article processing workflow uses manually curated trait dictionaries with trained NLP models to perform labelling of entities and relationships of thousands of articles. A subset of manually annotated documents facilitated the formal evaluation of the performance of the workflow in terms of entity recognition and normalisation, and relationship extraction, highlighting several important technical challenges. The results are made available to the scientific community through an interactive web tool and queryable resource, the ArTraDB Arthropod Trait Database. These methodological explorations provide a framework that could be extended beyond the arthropods, where TDM and NLP approaches applied to the taxonomy and biodiversity literature will greatly facilitate data synthesis studies and literature reviews, the identification of knowledge gaps and biases, as well as the data-informed investigation of ecological and evolutionary trends and patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

These make it possible to compare genome sequences across the Tree of Life, deepening our understanding of evolutionary relationships. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) is a distance measure that has been applied to species delineation, building of guide trees, and searching large sequence databases. Since computing ANI is computationally expensive, the field has increasingly turned to sketch-based approaches that use assumptions and heuristics to speed this up. We propose a suite of simulated and real benchmark datasets, together with a rank-correlation-based metric, to study how these assumptions and heuristics impact distance estimates. We call this evaluation framework EvANI. With EvANI, we show that ANIb is the ANI estimation algorithm that best captures tree distance, though it is also the least efficient. We show that k-mer based approaches are extremely efficient and have consistently strong accuracy. We also show that some clades have inter-sequence distances that are best computed using multiple values of k, e.g. k = 10 and k = 19 for Chlamydiales. Finally, we highlight that approaches based on maximal exact matches may represent an advantageous compromise, achieving an intermediate level of computational efficiency while avoiding over-reliance on a single fixed k-mer length.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

Human studies on this topic, however, have yielded inconsistent results. We hypothesized that the microbiome would influence innate immune responses, and thus vaccine reactogenicity, more directly than vaccine immunogenicity. To test this, we established the uHEAT (Microbial-Human Ecology And Temperature) study, which longitudinally profiled the fecal microbiota, oral body temperature and serum antibody responses of 171 healthy adults (18-40 years old) before and after vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Increased temperature after vaccination (delta-T) was associated with habitual diet and with baseline metabolic and immune markers. The microbiomes of delta-T-high (delta-Thi) participants were characterized by high expression of flagellin and an overabundance of the flagellated bacterium Waltera. Fecal samples from delta-Thi participants induced more inflammation in human cells and stronger post-vaccine temperature responses in mice compared to delta-Tlo samples, suggesting a causal role for the microbiome. Moreover, Waltera flagellin replicated the inflammatory phenotypes in vitro and was modulable via a dietary additive. Overall, these data suggest that flagellin from the gut microbiome stimulates innate immunity and vaccine reactogenicity, and that this axis can be manipulated via diet. These findings have implications for improving human vaccine tolerance and immunogenicity.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

Apical hook opening in dark- grown Arabidopsis seedlings serves as an excellent model to study how coordinated cell expansion generates organ bending. Several works highlight the influence of hormone signaling, cell wall mechanics, and environmental cues on cortical microtubule (cMT) arrangement in bending tissues. However, the precise genetic hierarchy governing these processes remains largely unknown.

ResultsHere, we reveal a two-step growth rate during apical hook opening, in which an initial phase of differential cell expansion is followed by a phase of more balanced growth. We show that cMT re-arrangement precedes and predicts cell expansion patterns, suggesting a central role in coordinating differential growth. Our findings indicate that PIF transcription factors regulate this process, as pifq mutants fail to align cMT reorganization with growth dynamics, resulting in premature hook opening. RNA- seq analysis further supports a role for PIFs in coordinating cell wall remodeling and microtubule-associated gene expression, including kinesins and cell wall-modifying enzymes.

ConclusionsOur study uncovers a PIF-dependent regulatory mechanism that orchestrates cytoskeletal dynamics and cell expansion to control apical hook opening.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

Myrmecophagous species are characterized by striking convergent morphological adaptations such as skull elongation, enlargement of salivary glands, and long claws to dig into ant and termite nests. These evolutionary modifications also include anatomical regression, such as dental simplification or loss, reduction of masticatory muscles, and possessing a reduced set of taste buds. To gain insights into the molecular changes underlying the regression of these morpho-anatomical traits, we investigated the functionality of candidate genes related to dentition, gustation, and mastication in nine convergent myrmecophagous mammalian lineages. We examined these genes in a comparative phylogenetic context, paired with molecular evolutionary analyses, to estimate the relative timing of loss of gene function over the evolutionary history of each convergent lineage. We found that gustatory reduction and pseudogenization of masticatory myosin often were associated with the regression of dental genes. Evidence of pseudogenization events linked to oral anatomy dates to as early as the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary, and is an ongoing process including examples of incipient gene inactivations. Whereas we found evidence for gene inactivations across all three functional categories occurring during distinct temporal intervals, there was variation in the sets of genes lost and the relative timing of inactivation events. The combined evidence suggests that the convergent evolution of myrmecophagy has occurred as a protracted process with distinct phases of anatomical evolution, over timescales as long as 60 Myr.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

Differential Golgi organisation in cancer cells could drive changes in trafficking and processing of cargoes. A simple screen evaluating Golgi organisation identifies breast (MDAMB231 vs MCF7) and lung cancer (A549 vs CaLu1) cell line pairs with differently organised Golgi, regulated differentially by loss of adhesion. In silico analysis of differentially expressed genes in the CCLE database, evaluated for their association with the Golgi in interaction networks and literature, identified AXL as a putative regulator of Golgi in these cancers. AXL prominently localized at the Golgi, undergoes displacement from the Golgi when inhibited by R428 and knocked down using siRNA, causing the Golgi to disorganize. AXL-dependent regulation of Golgi organisation is also dependent on cell-matrix adhesion. AXL binds active Arf1, whose recruitment to the Golgi is vital for its organisation. On loss of adhesion, loss of AXL and active Arf1 from the Golgi, drives its disorganization to affect Golgi-dependent microtubule acetylation and cell surface glycosylation in MDAMB231 and A549 cells respectively. Together, this validates our screen to identify novel regulators of the Golgi, and identifies AXL-Arf1 crosstalk as a vital mediator of its organisation and function in cancer cells.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

With TIRF illumination, fluorophores near a sample substrate are excited by an evanescent field, thereby circumventing the axial diffraction limit of light. Prism-based TIRF (p-TIRF) microscopes are comparatively easy to use. They may be readily adjusted to meet the requirements of a broad range of experimental applications, such as to examine of macromolecular complexes, to study of the behaviour of vesicles and small organelles, the study of protein-DNA complexes at the single-molecule level. These experiments can give unique insights into the mechanisms driving the molecular interactions that underline many fundamental activities within the cell by providing information on fluctuation distributions and unusual events. Here, we report a detailed method to build a p-TIRF setup inexpensively using an existing confocal microscope where the same light source can be used for both systems. Furthermore, we provide a brief overview that aims to give the readers a stepwise tutorial protocol for building, assembling, aligning, and preparing the specimen to conduct single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments using a custom-built p-TIRF setup. We believe that this article will be of assistance to labs that already have a confocal microscope and want to perform TIRF experiments for potential future applications.

In addition, it plays important roles in host cell defenses against pathogenic viruses, and small molecules that activate NRF2 signaling can exert potent antiviral effects. We recently found that the NRF2 activators 4-octyl itaconate (4OI), bardoxolone (BARD), and sulforaphane (SFN) interfere with influenza A virus replication by blocking the nuclear export factor exportin 1 (XPO1), which did not require NRF2 signaling. Here, we have assessed their potential to inhibit highly pathogenic (SARS-CoV-2) and seasonal (hCoV-229E) coronaviruses and begun to elucidate the involved mechanisms of action. Using human cell lines and iPSC-derived vascular endothelial cells, we find that NRF2 knock-out or knock-down enhances infection by both viruses, indicating that physiologic NRF2 signaling restricts human coronavirus infection. 4OI, BARD, SFN, as well as the XPO1 blocker Selinexor (SEL), greatly limit infection by both viruses, but in an NRF2-independent manner. Strikingly, the compounds (particularly 4OI) downregulate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA and protein in Calu3 cells, leading to a >10-fold reduction in viral cell entry by 4OI and SEL, as assessed using SARS-CoV-1 and -2 spike protein VSV pseudotypes. A cycloheximide chase experiment revealed that 4OI dramatically reduces ACE2 half-life, which requires the E3 ligases NEDD4L and MCM1, suggesting that 4OI targets ACE2 for destruction by the proteasome. Moreover, 4OI and SEL reduce XPO1 protein levels, and all compounds reduce XPO1 mRNA levels. Co-incubation experiments of 4OI and the transcription blocker actinomycin D in A549 cells suggest that 4OI acts primarily by interfering with transcription of the XPO1 gene. XPO1 knock-down markedly reduces 229E replication. All four compounds interfere with 229E infection, but do not alter expression of ANPEP, the cellular receptor for this virus. Their anti-229E efficacy depends on expression of XPO1 in host cells in the order of SEL (most dependent) >4OI >SFN >BARD (least dependent), suggesting that especially BARD interferes with 229E infectivity via yet another, unknown, target. Taken together, these results suggest that ""NRF2 activators"" act as potent antivirals against human coronaviruses by targeting diverse host factors which are critical for viral infectivity.

Author summaryHost-directed antiviral compounds act by a variety of mechanisms. For instance, they stimulate cellular antiviral immune responses and target host cell factors which are required for the viral life cycle. Pharmacologic activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway is a particularly attractive antiviral strategy, as this pathway restricts replication of a variety of viruses and also protects cells from excessive inflammation and oxidative stress resulting from accumulation of reactive oxygen species. In our previous study of the NRF2 activators bardoxolone, sulforaphane, and 4-octyl itaconate as host-directed treatments for influenza A virus infection, we found that these compounds interfered with replication of the virus. Unexpectedly, this antiviral activity was completely independent of NRF2 signaling, but resulted from blocking the nuclear export factor XPO1. In the present study, we find that these compounds limit infection by SARS-CoV-2 and hCoV-229E and that, again, this antiviral effect is NRF-independent. Instead, it depends to a large extent on downregulating ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (the major host cell receptors for SARS-CoV-1 and 2) and blocking/downregulating XPO1. Our results underscore the potential of ""NRF2 activators"" as adjunct treatments for viral infections, as they protect the host by anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective mechanisms and also interfere with diverse host factors required for the viral life cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

Central to its therapeutic effects are cannabinoids, which interact with the endocannabinoid system to influence various physiological processes such as anxiety, pain, and inflammation. Despite its benefits, cannabinoid production faces challenges and scarcity from plant extraction. This work leverages Yarrowia lipolytica as a platform for cannabinoid biosynthesis. By optimizing precursor supply, engineering biomolecular condensate-like dual prenyltransferase expression and expanding endogenous metabolism with a noncanonical polyketide synthase, we achieved the de novo biosynthesis of various cannabinoid and its analogs. Our engineered Y. lipolytica produced ~3.5 mg/L of cannabigerolic acid, 18.8 mg/L of orsellinic acid, and 0.5 mg/L of cannabigerorcinic acid. Additionally, CBGA titer reached 15.7 mg/L with olivetolic acid supplement. This work demonstrates Y. lipolytica's versatility as a promising host for cannabinoid and its analogs production, which opens avenues for further research and medicinal applications.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

Similarly, despite well-documented sex differences in opioid responses, the anatomical basis for this sexual dimorphism is not well characterized. To address these questions, we developed an automated, scalable, and unbiased approach for whole-brain anatomical mapping of the neuronal activity marker c-Fos in response to acute morphine exposure. Using ribbon scanning confocal microscopy, we imaged whole cleared brains from male and female wild-type mice at 1 hour and 4 hours post-morphine administration. Our whole-brain analysis of c-Fos expression revealed distinct patterns of morphine-induced regional brain activation across time and sex. Notably, we observed a greater number of structures with significant activity differences at 4 hours compared to 1 hour. In male mice, significant changes were primarily localized to regions within the dopamine system, whereas in female mice, they were concentrated in cortical regions. By combining high-throughput imaging with whole-brain expression analysis, particularly in the context of opioid actions, our approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of how drugs of abuse affect the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

We identify a new, chromatin-localized lncRNA - MUSHER, which activates two parallel regulatory pathways to increase Arabidopsis seed dormancy. MUSHER is upregulated in response to high temperatures, contributing to the induction of secondary dormancy. It promotes DOG1 expression by recruitment of the CPSF complex to enhance the proximal cleavage and polyadenylation at the DOG1 gene. It also increases ABA sensitivity in seeds by activating PIR1 gene transcription. These genes, located on different chromosomes, are both bound by MUSHER, despite lacking sequence homology. The chromatin association of MUSHER enables the integration of the DOG1- and ABA pathways to adjust seed germination timing. Additionally, MUSHER and other lncRNAs interact with U1 snRNP, which is required for their chromatin localisation, revealing a novel function of U1 snRNP in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

Here, we use Desulfovibrio magneticus RS-1 to uncover the mechanisms behind tooth-shaped magnetosome assembly in deep-branching MTB. Our findings reveal that RS-1 magnetic particles initially form randomly within the cell before localizing to the positive cell curvature. Genetic and proteomic analyses indicate that early biomineralization involves membrane-associated proteins found in all MTB, while later stages depend on coiled-coil (Mad20, 23, 25, and 26) and actin-like (MamK and Mad28) proteins, most of which are unique to deep-branching MTB. These findings suggest that while biomineralization originates from a common ancestor, magnetosome chain formation has diverged evolutionarily among different MTB lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

Bo Yi had two sons who each established a state, one named Huang and the other Xu. After the fall of Huang, its people adopted Huang as their surname and migrated to Hubei. Similarly, after the fall of Xu, its people adopted Xu as their surname, spreading throughout Jiangsu. Further descendants of Bo Yi also gave rise to 12 other surnames, including the Liang surname. Given that the narratives of ancient texts are often regarded as legendary, we aim to independently verify the authenticity of the historical records by analyzing the paternal haplotypes of the Huang surname and its related surnames using scientific methods. We analyzed the surname genetic data of 207,333 Han Chinese males published by 23Mofang and combined it with independent sequencing research. In 189 Y chromosome haplotype branches, each containing at least five individuals with the surnames Huang, Xu, or Liang, and formed around 4,000 years ago, we analyzed the proportion of samples with the Huang surname from Hubei among all samples nationwide with the Huang surname. Branches with a high proportion in Hubei are likely to represent the Hubei-specific lineage of the Huang surname. We similarly analyzed the proportion of samples with the Xu surname in the Jiangsu area and of samples with the Liang surname in the Hebei area. We further applied two criteria to identify the ancestral genotype of a specific surname in a given region: first, the surname should appear at a high frequency among all surnames within that genotype; second, the proportion of samples of the region among nationwide samples should be high. The results showed that the Hubei-specific Huang surname likely carries the MF14296/MF15137 haplotype downstream of the supergrandfather O-M117-F8-F2137-A16635-A16636. Our independent sampling study found that A16636 is the dominant haplotype among the Huang surname population in nine neighboring Huang surname villages around Luohansi in Huangpi, Hubei. The Jiangsu-specific Xu surname likely carries the MF38096/SK1726 haplotype under the A16636 sister branch F15823, while the Hebei-specific Liang surname likely carries the F15823 related MF14287/MF15398/MF14963 haplotype. This conclusion aligns with the historical records, providing strong genetic evidence that supports the authenticity of these ancestral claims regarding the Huang and Xu states and the Xia dynasty.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

We recently demonstrated that the loss of biosynthetic pathways for these outsourced AAs is driven by energy-saving selection. Paradoxically, these metabolic simplifications enabled animals to use costly AAs more frequently in their proteomes, allowing them to explore sequence space more freely. Based on these findings, we proposed that environmental AA availability and cellular respiration mode are the two primary factors determining the evolution of AA auxotrophies in animals. Remarkably, our recent analysis showed that bacterial AA auxotrophies are also governed by energy-related selection, thereby roughly converging with animals. However, bacterial AA auxotrophies are highly heterogeneous and scattered across the bacterial phylogeny, making direct ecological and physiological comparisons with the animal AA outsourcing model challenging. To better test the universality of our model, we focused on Bdellovibrionota and Myxococcota--two closely related bacterial phyla that, through aerobic respiration and a predatory lifestyle, best parallel animals. Here, we show that Bdellovibrionota, driven by energy-related selection, outsourced a highly similar set of AAs to those in animals. This sharply contrasts with Myxococcota, which exhibit far fewer AA auxotrophies and rarely show signatures of energy-driven selection. These differences are also reflected in Bdellovibrionota proteomes, which are substantially more expensive than those of Myxococcota. Finally, we found evidence that the expression of costly proteins plays a crucial role in the predatory phase of the Bdellovibrio life cycle. Together, our findings suggest that Bdellovibrionota, through their obligate predatory lifestyle, exhibit the closest analogy to the AA auxotrophy phenotype observed in animals. In contrast, facultative predation, as seen in Myxococcota, appears to substantially limit the evolution of AA auxotrophies. These cross-domain convergences strongly support the general validity of our AA outsourcing model.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

A computational network model of the canonical microcircuit consisting of SOM, PV and excitatory neurons reproduced key experimental findings, including: Stochastic gamma oscillations with drive-dependent frequency; precise phase-locking of PV interneurons and delayed firing of SOM interneurons; and the distinct effects of optogenetic perturbations of SOM and PV cells. In CAMINOS, the generation of network oscillations depends on both the precise spike timing of SOM and PV interneurons, with PV cells regulating oscillation frequency and network stability, and delayed SOM firing controlling the oscillation amplitude. The asymmetric PV-SOM connectivity is found to be the key source ingredient to generate these oscillations, that naturally establishes distinct PV and SOM-cell spike timing. The CAMINOS model predicts that increased SOM/PV densities along the cortical hierarchy leads to decreased oscillation frequencies (from gamma to alpha/beta) and increased seizure susceptibility, suggesting a unified circuit model for oscillations across different frequency bands.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

By combining immunofluorescence techniques with click chemistry-based nascent DNA labelling and transfection of fluorescent nucleotide derivatives, we map multi-colour DNA synthesis events in relation to established replication proteins, local RNA-protein condensates or large subnuclear domains. We demonstrate quantitative changes in size, relative abundance and spatial arrangement of nanoscale DNA synthesis events upon chemotherapeutic treatment, CDC6 oncogene expression and loss of chromatin organiser RIF1. The flexibility, precision and modular design of 3D-SPARK helps bridging the gap between spatial cell biology, genomics, and 2D fibre-based replication studies in health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

Current treatments often fail to provide sustained relief, highlighting the need to better understand the mechanisms driving discogenic LBP. During disc degeneration, the extracellular matrix degrades, allowing nociceptive nerve fibers to innervate previously aneural disc regions. Persistent mechanical and inflammatory stimulation of nociceptors can induce plastic changes within dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, characterized by altered gene expression, enhanced excitability, and lowered activation thresholds. Although these transcriptional changes have been described in other pain states, including osteoarthritis, they remain underexplored in discogenic LBP. To address this gap, this study represents the first application of comprehensive single-nuclei RNA sequencing of DRG neurons in a rat model of chronic discogenic LBP. Eighteen distinct DRG subpopulations were identified and mapped to existing mouse and cross-species atlases revealing strong similarities in neuronal populations with the mouse. Differential expression analysis revealed increased expression of pain-associated genes, including Scn9a and Piezo2, and neuroinflammatory mediators such as Fstl1 and Ngfr, in LBP animals. Axial hypersensitivity, measured using grip strength, significantly correlated with increased expression of Scn9a, Fstl1, and Ngfr, which suggests their role in maintaining axial hypersensitivity in this model. These findings establish a relationship between DRG transcriptomic changes and axial hypersensitivity in a discogenic LBP model, identifying potential molecular targets for non-opioid treatments and advancing understanding of discogenic LBP mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

However, the composition and RNA substrate specificity of this multisubunit ribonucleoprotein complex in higher eukaryotes remain a mystery. Here, we identify NEPRO and C18ORF21 as constitutive subunits of metazoan RNase MRP. Both proteins are specific to RNase MRP and are the only ones distinguishing this enzyme from the closely related RNase P, which selectively cleaves transfer RNA-like substrates. We find that NEPRO and C18ORF21 each form a complex with all other subunits of RNase MRP, stabilize its catalytic RNA, and are required for rRNA maturation and cell proliferation. We harness our discovery to identify a full suite of in vivo RNA targets of each enzyme, including positions of potential cleavage sites at nucleotide resolution. These findings resolve the general composition of metazoan RNase MRP, illuminate its RNA binding specificity, and provide valuable assets for functional exploration of this essential eukaryotic enzyme.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

During smooth pursuit eye movements, the floccular complex performs distinct input-output transformations of temporal dynamics and directional response properties. The responses of different interneuron types localize the circuit mechanisms of each transformation. Mossy fibers and unipolar brush cells emphasize eye position dynamics uniformly across the cardinal axes; Purkinje cells and molecular layer interneurons code eye velocity along directionally biased axes; Golgi cells show unmodulated firing. Differential directional response properties of different neuron types localize the directional input-output transformation to the last-order inputs to Purkinje cells. Differential temporal dynamics pinpoint the site of the temporal input-output transformation to granule cells. Specific granule cell population dynamics allow the temporal transformations required in the area we study and generalize to many temporal transformations, providing a complete framework to understand cerebellar circuit computation.

Impact statementWe dissect the circuit computations performed by the floccular complex of the cerebellum during an exemplar sensory-motor behavior, taking advantage of knowledge of the circuit architecture, existence of discrete neuron types, and a newfound ability to identify neuron types from extracellular recordings. Our results describe the contributions of the major neuron types to the cerebellar input-output computations, identify the population dynamics needed in granule cells to support those computations, and to create a basis set to enable temporally-specific motor behavior and motor learning.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

Archaeobotanical remains provide critical insights into its cultivation history, but no comprehensive review or dedicated platform currently exists to synthesize and analyze these data.
C_LIO_LITo address this gap, we conducted an extensive literature review and developed DateBack (https://cloudapps.france-bioinformatique.fr/dateback), a digital open access repository of archaeobotanical remains of Phoenix spp. In its first version, DateBack records macroremains (e.g., seeds, fruits, stems, petioles) from prehistoric to Late Antiquity contexts in Southwest and South Asia.
C_LIO_LIWe assembled 140 entries from 99 archaeological sites across 110 references, along with a separate table of 55 radiocarbon-dated entries from 17 sites, refining chronological assessments. Most entries comprise charred seeds (55.7%), with a smaller proportion of charred vegetative parts or desiccated remains. Our findings highlight regional disparities in remain distribution, concentrated in the Levant and Gulf, while Saudi Arabia and southern Iran are underrepresented, and in data reliability, particularly dating resolution, complicating the reconstruction of date cultivation history. Our evidence shows that the earliest securely dated remains, indicating date consumption, appear in the Gulf around 5000 BCE, while cultivation emerges later, first in southern Mesopotamia and the northern Gulf in the 4th millennium BCE, then in eastern Arabia and the Indus Valley in the 3rd millennium BCE. The Levant presents challenges, with numerous presumed early finds but significant uncertainties, with secure evidence of cultivation only appearing by the late 2nd millennium BCE, as in northwestern Arabia, while in the southern Arabian Peninsula, it is not attested until the 1st millennium BCE.
C_LIO_LIBy compiling and standardizing archaeobotanical data, DateBack facilitates advanced spatiotemporal analyses and supports additional archaeobotany-based research including ancient DNA studies. Moreover, the platform is dynamic, scalable, and collaborative, enhancing data integration and refinement, with future expansions planned to include additional periods (Islamic era and beyond), geographic regions (North Africa), and new types of evidence, such as plant microremains and iconography.

Both plaques and tangles cause neuronal damage and stimulate inflammatory responses in glial cells. The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1)-mediated signaling pathways support the function of damaged neurons and modulate inflammatory response. The FGFR1 agonists, including Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) and FG loop peptide (FGL), have been implicated in multiple disease therapy. Whether FGFR1 agonists can improve pathology and cognitive function in AD remains unknown. Here, we showed that administration of FGF1 and FGL to the AD mouse model reversed spatial memory impairment, enhanced neurogenesis, suppressed reactive astrogliosis, and restricted dystrophic neurite. However, only FGF1 treatment reduced the deposition of senile plaque. In microglial culture studies, FGF1 improves the phagocytosis ability of microglia, which contributes to the clearance of plaques. Together, our findings suggested that FGFR1 agonists alleviate pathology and cognitive impairment via immunomodulatory and improve neuronal health in the AD mouse model.

However, it remains challenging to investigate protein subcellular localization changes on a proteome-wide scale. Here, we apply Dynamic Organellar Maps (DOMs) by label-free mass spectrometry to detect localization changes of native, untagged proteins during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We find that hundreds of proteins shift between cellular compartments. For example, we show that numerous secretory pathway proteins accumulate in the ER, thus defining the extent and selectivity of ER retention of misfolded proteins. Furthermore, we identify candidate cargo proteins of the ER reflux pathway, determine constituents of reticulon clusters that segregate from the remainder of the ER and provide evidence for altered nuclear pore complex composition and nuclear import. These findings uncover protein relocalization as a major aspect of cellular reorganization during ER stress and establish DOMs as a powerful discovery tool in yeast.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641

We conducted an integrated analysis that combines electrophysiological and transcriptomic profiling, along with machine learning, of islet cells from T1D donors to investigate the mechanisms underlying their dysfunction. Surviving {beta}-cells exhibit altered electrophysiological properties and transcriptomic signatures indicative of increased antigen presentation, metabolic reprogramming, and impaired protein translation. In -cells, we observed hyper-responsiveness and increased exocytosis, which are associated with upregulated immune signaling, disrupted transcription factor localization and lysosome homeostasis, as well as dysregulation of mTORC1 complex signaling. Notably, key genetic risk signals for T1D were enriched in transcripts related to -cell dysfunction, including MHC class I which were closely linked with -cell dysfunction. Our data provide novel insights into the molecular underpinnings of islet cell dysfunction in T1D, highlighting pathways that may be leveraged to preserve residual {beta}-cell function and modulate -cell activity.

Unmodified RNAs stimulate human innate immunity, but RNA modifications suppress this response. mRNA m6A modification is essential for Arabidopsis thaliana viability. However, the molecular basis of the impact of mRNA m6A depletion is poorly understood. Here, we show that disruption of the Arabidopsis mRNA m6A writer complex triggers autoimmunity. Most gene expression changes in m6A writer complex vir-1 mutants grown at 17{degrees}C are explained by defence gene activation and are suppressed at 27{degrees}C, consistent with the established temperature sensitivity of Arabidopsis immunity. Accordingly, we found enhanced pathogen resistance and increased premature cell death in vir-1 mutants at 17{degrees}C but not 27{degrees}C. Global temperature-sensitive mRNA poly(A) tail length changes accompany these phenotypes. Our results demonstrate that autoimmunity is a major phenotype of mRNA m6A writer complex mutants, which has important implications for interpreting this modifications role. Furthermore, we open the broader question of whether unmodified RNA triggers immune signalling in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1740607705641
