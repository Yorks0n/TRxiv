Domestication of these grasses in the last 10,000 years has yielded our most productive crops, including maize, sugarcane, and sorghum. The majority of Andropogoneae species, including maize, show a history of polyploidy -- a condition that, while offering the evolutionary advantage of multiple gene copies, poses challenges to basic cellular processes, gene expression, and epigenetic regulation. Genomic studies of polyploidy have been limited by sparse sampling of taxa in groups with multiple polyploidy events. Here, we present 33 genome assemblies from 27 species, including chromosome-scale assemblies of maize relatives Zea and Tripsacum. In maize, the after-effects of polyploidy have been widely studied, showing reduced chromosome number, biased fractionation of duplicate genes, and transposable element (TE) expansions. While we observe these patterns within the genus Zea, 12 other polyploidy events deviate significantly. Those tetraploids and hexaploids retain elevated chromosome number, maintain nearly complete complements of duplicate genes, and have only stochastic TE amplifications. These genomes reveal variable outcomes of polyploidy, challenging simple predictions and providing a foundation for understanding its evolutionary implications in an ecologically and economically important clade.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

It has often been considered as a source of novel genes but quantitative assessments of this claim are lacking. To investigate the potential role of natural transformation in gene acquisition, we analysed a large collection of genomes of Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) and Legionella pneumophila (Lp) for which transformation rates were experimentally determined. Natural transformation rates are weakly correlated with genome size. But they are negatively associated with gene flow in both species. This might result from a negative balance between transformation's ability to cure the chromosome from mobile genetic elements (MGEs), resulting in gene loss, and its facilitation of gene acquisition. By focusing on the latter, we found that transformation was significantly associated with small gene acquisition events while MGEs-driven gene acquisition tend to be associated with larger ones. Events of gene gain by transformation were spread more evenly in the chromosome than MGEs encoding the ability to integrate autonomously. We estimated the contribution of natural transformation to gene gains by comparing recombination-driven gene acquisition rates between transformable and non-transformable strains. Natural transformation may have caused the acquisition of up to 6.4% (Ab) and 1.1% (Lp) of the novel genes. This low contribution of natural transformation to the acquisition of novel genes implies that most novel genes must have been acquired by other means. Interestingly, the ones potentially acquired by transformation include almost 15% of the recently acquired antibiotic resistance genes in A. baumannii. Hence, natural transformation may drive the acquisition of relatively few novel genes but these may have high fitness impact.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

However, different stimuli could form distinct memories, leading to stimulus-specific trained responses. Here, we use primary human monocyte-derived macrophages to demonstrate phenotypic and epigenetic stimulus specificity of innate immune memory six days after initial exposure. Quantification of cytokine production with single-molecule RNA imaging demonstrates stimulus-specific patterns of response to restimulation at the single cell level. Differential licensing of inflammatory transcription factors is associated with encoding of specificities in chromatin. Trained cells show stronger responses to secondary stimuli that are more similar to the initial stimulus they experienced, suggesting a functional role for these stimulus-specific memories. Rather than activating a universal training state, our findings demonstrate that different stimuli impart specific memories that generate distinct training phenotypes in macrophages.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Furthermore, existing morphological datasets for crown birds are frequently limited by restricted taxon or character sampling, inconsistent character construction, incorrect scoring, or a combination of several of these factors. As part of an effort to address these limitations, in this study we focus on identifying phylogenetically informative characters of the avian pectoral girdle and forelimb skeleton, elements of which are commonly preserved as avian fossils. We assembled and vetted a dataset of 204 characters, which were then scored for a phylogenetically diverse range of 75 extant avian taxa and incorporated into phylogenetic analyses. Analyses run without topological constraints exhibited notable conflicts with the results of recent phylogenomic studies, possibly due to functional convergence and rapid cladogenesis in the early evolutionary history of crown birds. Qualitative anatomical comparisons and quantitative metrics of homoplasy further highlighted the fact that similar morphologies in pectoral girdle and forelimb elements have evolved repeatedly in distantly related groups of birds, representing a major confounding factor in avian morphological phylogenetics. However, the implementation of molecular scaffolds allowed identification of diagnostic character combinations for numerous avian clades previously only recognized through molecular data, such as Phaethontimorphae, Aequornithes, and Telluraves. Although large morphological datasets may not guarantee increased congruence with molecular phylogenetic studies, they can nonetheless be valuable tools for identifying anatomical synapomorphies of key clades, placing fossils into phylogenetic context, and studying macroevolutionary patterns within major groups of organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Despite recent breakthroughs in protein design and structure prediction, designing biocatalysts with activities rivaling those of natural enzymes remains challenging. Here, we present AI.zymes, a modular platform integrating cutting-edge protein engineering algorithms within an evolutionary framework. By combining programs such as Rosetta, ESMFold, ProteinMPNN, and FieldTools in iterative rounds of design and selection, AI.zymes optimizes a broad range of catalytically relevant properties, such as transition state affinity and protein stability. Notably, AI.zymes can also improve properties that are not targeted by the employed design algorithms. For instance, AI.zymes enhanced electrostatic catalysis by iteratively selecting variants with stronger catalytic electric fields. AI.zymes was benchmarked by improving the promiscuous Kemp eliminase activity of ketosteroid isomerase, yielding a 7.7-fold increase in activity after zero-shot experimental validation of only 7 variants. Due to its modularity, AI.zymes can readily incorporate emerging design algorithms, paving the way for a unifying framework for enzyme design.

Here we show that plasmids are depleted in beneficial genes compared to the chromosome, and this effect is stronger for ancient plasmids compared to recently acquired plasmids. These findings support the hypothesis that evolution drives beneficial genes to become localized to the bacterial chromosome, resulting in a gradual decay in the ecological value of plasmids. These findings question the ecological importance of plasmids and highlight the challenge of understanding how plasmids persist over the long term.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

With the elaboration of large banks of data describing the presence and absence of narrative motifs around the world, scholars have been able to statistically investigate their potential routes and mechanisms of diffusion. However, despite genetic data allowing for increasingly refined demographic movement inferences, few have integrated it into their models, and none at a global scale. In this work, we capitalise on the augmenting availability of modern and ancient genetic data and on a database of more than 2000 mythological motifs worldwide to investigate the mechanisms involved in generating their present-day distribution at a global scale. The direct combination of both kinds of evidence allows us to explore in more depth the respective influences of population movement and replacement versus cultural diffusion on motif transmission. Our results show that both processes have played important roles in shaping their present-day distribution. By leveraging available ancient DNA (aDNA) and deepening the temporal scale of the detected signals, we reveal that correlations between mythemes and genetic patterns can be traced back to population movements that pre-date the Last Glacial Maximum and go back to at least 38,000 years ago, and possibly even earlier to the human expansion out of Africa some 60,000 years ago. Our work shows the earliest evidence for the transmission of stories and storytelling in human history, and supports the joint use of cultural evolutionary theory and population genetics to illuminate the biocultural processes that shaped our species.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Long COVID and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) disproportionately affect females, suggesting modulation by sex hormones. We sought to investigate whether symptom severity is influenced by changes in sex hormones over the menstrual cycle, or by hormonal contraception. Methods. We carried out a retrospective analysis of menstrual and symptom data, prospectively collected via the Visible app from individuals with long COVID, ME/CFS, or both, who had regular menstrual cycles, between 7 September 2022 and 6 March 2024. Mixed-effects models were used to examine associations between symptom severity, menstrual cycle phase and contraception type. Findings. 948 users were included; 100% of users were female and 92.6% identified as women. The most tracked symptoms were fatigue (99.5% of users), brain fog (88.3%), headaches (85.1%) and muscle aches (78.6%). All menstrual cycle phases showed a modest, but significant, improvement compare to the menstrual phase, most markedly in the early luteal (IRR 0.963%, 95% CI: 0.958 - 0.968), but also the follicular (IRR = 0.985, 95% CI: 0.981 - 0.990) and late luteal phase (IRR = 0.980, 95% CI: 0.974-0.985). Crashes (sudden and severe worsening of symptoms following exertion) were significantly more frequent during menstruation than in other phases. Users of combined hormonal contraception (n=70) had a statistically significant reduction in overall symptom score (OR = 0.827, 95% CI: 0.690 - 0.992) and crash incidence (OR = 0.548, 95% CI: 0.350 - 0.856) compared to those not using hormonal contraception (=786). Interpretation. Menstruation is associated with worsened symptoms in long COVID and ME/CFS. Users of combined hormonal contraception report a lower symptom burden than non-users, suggesting a modulatory role of ovarian hormones. These findings could empower menstruating people living with long COVID and ME/CFS to anticipate cyclical changes in symptoms and plan their activities accordingly, and could also inform their use of contraception.","NA","medrxiv",1738015719449

We address this challenge through the lens of continuous-attractor networks, which model how neural circuits may represent continuous variables, such as head direction or spatial location, through collective dynamics. In classical continuous-attractor models, a continuous symmetry of the connectivity generates a manifold of stable states, resulting in tuning curves that are identical up to shifts. However, mouse head-direction cells show substantial heterogeneity in their responses that appears incompatible with this classical picture. To understand the mechanistic origin of these data, we use an optimization principle to construct recurrent-network models that match the observed responses while exhibiting quasi-continuous-attractor dynamics. To study how such systems scale with increasing numbers of neurons N, we develop a statistical generative process that produces artificial tuning curves that match many features of the experimental data quantitatively. Due to a continuous symmetry in the generative process, the connectivity matrix exhibits doublet degeneracy in its spectrum at large N, reflecting an underlying circular geometry. Unlike classical models, where the ring structure is embedded in the neuronal space through a structured Fourier embedding, our model uses a random, disordered embedding. Analysis of the network dynamics in the large-N limit through dynamical mean-field theory reveals that the system becomes equivalent to a classical ring-attractor model. We extend this approach to higher-dimensional symmetries, applying it to grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex and showing that the mean-field description recovers classical continuous-attractor models. Our work implies that large mammalian neural circuits could represent continuous variables using continuous-attractor dynamics, complete with continuous symmetry, in a way that is fully compatible with their heterogeneity and disorder.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

These ssDNA sequences, predominantly isolated from the ""no-hits"" zone with no significant matches in existing genomic databases, exhibit conserved motifs, distinct secondary structural features, and a unique AT-rich composition. These characteristics suggest potential roles in autoreplication, molecular stabilization, and resilience under extreme conditions, consistent with extremophilic adaptations. Notably, this discovery aligns with observations of a provisionally termed New Biological Structure (NBS) detected in diverse contexts, including meteorites and biogenic materials, though its characterization lies beyond the scope of this study.

The sequences were detected using a rigorous methodology that included stringent contamination controls, advanced metagenomic assembly techniques, and exhaustive taxonomic filtering to ensure robustness and minimize false positives. Their consistent detection across meteorites of varying types and geographic origins further underscores the reliability of the findings. Repeat analyses revealed specific motifs associated with potential regulatory or structural roles, while secondary structure predictions suggested configurations that could support autoreplication and stability under extreme conditions.

This groundbreaking discovery highlights the potential of meteorites to harbor previously uncharacterized genomic elements, offering profound insights into molecular diversity, prebiotic chemistry, and molecular evolution. By situating these findings within the broader context of extremophilic biology and astrobiological exploration, this study establishes a foundation for investigating the structural, functional, and evolutionary implications of these sequences. Future research will also explore their relevance as biosignatures in the search for life under extreme and extraterrestrial conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

A proper error analysis for time series data leads to significantly wider confidence intervals than the official evaluation. In addition to vaccination and seasonality, only few NPIs -- such as restrictions in public spaces -- can be confidently associated with variations in R(t), but even then effect sizes have large uncertainties. Furthermore, due to multicollinearity in NPI activation patterns, it is difficult to distinguish potential effects of NPIs in public spaces from other interventions that came into force early, such as physical distancing. %In future, a more careful design of NPIs is required to enable meaningful ex-post evaluation.

Cell competition (CC) is a cell non-autonomous quality control in which ''winner'' cells eliminate viable but suboptimal ''loser'' cells based on their relative difference in fitness. Due to its central role in fitness perception, loss of p53 results in the emergence of ''supercompetitor'' cells, which stand at the apex of cell competition and induce apoptosis in neighboring wild-type (WT) cells. Here, we investigate CC dynamics using mosaic 3D mouse gastruloids, an embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based in vitro model of gastrulation, composed of defined numbers of WT and p53-KO cells. In mosaic gastruloids, even low numbers of p53-KO cells robustly outcompete WT cells, and introduction of as few as two p53-KO cells is sufficient to measurably impair neighboring WT cell growth. CC in gastruloids is independent of cell proliferation rates, nutrient availability, or reactive oxygen species (ROS), and not influenced by Nodal and ERK signaling. However, we observe that Wnt and BMP signaling protect from CC, which is exclusively driven by intrinsic apoptosis, as indicated by Bcl2-mediated complete rescue of WT cells. During gastruloid development, CC is temporally restricted to a window of 48-96 hours after aggregation, mirroring embryonic days E5.5-E7.5 in the mouse. Heterochronic mosaic gastruloid experiments demonstrate that relative differences in pluripotency levels are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause supercompetition, but that CC is contingent on both competitors residing within the developmental window permissive to CC. Neither pluripotent mosaic 3D aggregates, nor 3D EpiGastruloids, which model more advanced developmental processes, display any competition, supporting the hypothesis that developmental CC is specific to the onset of gastrulation. Our findings offer insights into the mechanisms of cell fitness evaluation in mammalian embryogenesis and establish gastruloids as a powerful 3D model for investigating developmental stage-specific cell competition.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Fungi encode genes with features similar to non-self recognition systems in plants, animals, and bacteria. However, limited functional or mechanistic evidence exists for the surveillance-system recognition of heterologous microbes in fungi. We found that Neurospora species coexist with Pseudomonas in their natural environment. We leveraged two model organisms, Neurospora crassa and Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 (PSTDC3000) to observe immediate fungal responses to bacteria. PSTDC3000 preferentially surrounds N. crassa cells on a solid surface, causing environmental dependent growth responses, bacterial proliferation and varying fungal fitness. Specifically, the Type III secretion system (T3SS) {Delta}hrcC mutant of PSTDC3000 colonized N. crassa hyphae less well. To dissect initial cellular signaling events within the population of germinated asexual spores (germlings), we performed transcriptomics on N. crassa after PSTDC3000 inoculation. Upon contact with live bacteria, a subpopulation of fungal germlings initiate a response as early as ten minutes post-contact revealing transcriptional differentiation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) mechanisms, trace metal warfare, cell wall remodeling dynamics, multidrug-efflux transporters, secondary metabolite synthesis, and excretion. We dissected mutants of plausible receptors, signaling pathways, and responses that N. crassa uses to detect and mount a defense against PSTDC3000 and found seven genes that influence resistant and susceptibility phenotypes of N. crassa to bacterial colonization. Mutants in genes encoding a ctr copper transporter (tcu-1), ferric reductase (fer-1), superoxide reductase (sod-2), multidrug resistance transporter (mdr-6), a secreted lysozyme-Glycoside hydrolase (lyz) and the Woronin body tether leashin (NCU02793, lah-1 and lah-2) showed a significant reduction of growth in the presence of bacteria, allowing the bacteria to fully take over the fungal mycelium faster than wildtype. In this study we provide a bacterial-fungal model system within Dikarya that allows us to begin to dissect signaling pathways of the putative fungal immune system.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Functionally and structurally distinct chromatin domains are defined by the so-called histone code, which consists of combinations of post-translational histone modifications deposited by ""code writers"" and recognized by ""code readers."" The primary mark of heterochromatin, trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3), is deposited by histone methyltransferases, such as SetDB1, and serves as a binding platform for readers, most notably HP1 family proteins. Using a reporter system to monitor the dynamics of heterochromatin establishment and maintenance, we demonstrated that transient tethering of HP1 triggers the SetDB1-dependent establishment of stable heterochromatin. This finding indicates the presence of a feedback mechanism wherein the reader of the H3K9me3 mark recruits the writer. We further discovered that the genetic interaction between SetDB1 and HP1 is mirrored by a direct physical interaction. This interaction requires the auto-methylation of two conserved histone mimic motifs located in unstructured regions of SetDB1. HP1 binds these SetDB1 motifs using the same molecular interface it employs to recognize the modified histone tail. Our findings show that SetDB1 auto-methylation is essential for the spreading and stable maintenance of heterochromatin. This includes its roles in processes such as X-chromosome inactivation and the negative feedback regulation of a large gene family encoding KRAB-ZNF transcriptional repressors. Thus, the primary heterochromatin mark is not limited to nucleosomes but is also deployed on the mark's writer itself. This fosters a direct physical interaction between the writer and the reader, ensuring key features of heterochromatin: its spreading to establish extended domains and its stable maintenance through cell divisions.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

In this way, cells valuable for therapeutic purposes and disease modeling can be produced. However, the efficiency of this process is low, partly due to properties of somatic donor nuclei which stabilize their differentiated fate but also act as barriers reprogramming-associated cell fate changes. The identity of these reprogramming barriers is not fully understood.

Here, we developed an artificial intelligence-based approach to model nuclear reprogramming and used it to identify the chromatin modification H3K27ac as an epigenetic barrier to reprogramming-induced cell fate changes. Using reprogramming by nuclear transfer (NT) to eggs of Xenopus laevis as a model system, we profiled chromatin modifications in differentiated cell types alongside gene expression patterns before and after reprogramming. Our model integrated the data and by leveraging model predictions, we find that genes resisting inactivation during reprogramming display chromatin modification barcodes. This revealed H3K27ac as a novel candidate barrier to NT reprogramming. Reducing H3K27ac levels using p300/CBP inhibitors before reprogramming led to an improved downregulation of genes linked to H3K27ac-modified enhancers after reprogramming. Importantly, these effects were accompanied by improved embryonic development of the resulting nuclear transfer embryos.

In summary, our study identified H3K27ac as a safeguarding mechanism of cellular identities and as a reprogramming barrier during NT. Hence, the here-developed  Digital Reprogramming"" approach is capable of modelling and improving current cell-fate reprogramming strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

While the virus's overall resistance to human polyclonal antibody responses has steadily increased over time, the dynamics by which it escaped individual monoclonal antibodies within these responses have not been thoroughly explored. Recently, a series of studies by Cao et al. used deep mutational scanning (DMS) to identify which mutations allow the Wuhan-Hu-1 receptor-binding domain to escape binding by individual antibodies, doing so for thousands of antibodies. Here, we sought to use these data to retrospectively examine the evolutionary dynamics of escape from a set of 1,603 antibodies. For each antibody, we used the DMS data to predict an antibody-escape score for each of thousands of globally circulating viral sequences from the first 3.5 years of the pandemic, and then computed an escape trajectory that quantifies how the population's average escape score changed over time. We use pseudovirus neutralization data from Cao et al. and Wang et al. to validate common patterns in escape trajectories. While some trajectories increase monotonically over time, others show large fluctuations as a result of clade-displacement events that reduce the frequency of antibody-escape mutations in the viral population. Fitness effects of mutations estimated from natural sequences suggest that the mutations are displaced due to clonal interference. Further, these estimates suggest that the order in which escape mutations arose is shaped by changing selective pressures. Overall, this work helps describe how SARS-CoV-2 evaded the individual components of a polyclonal immune response in nature, and suggests that evasion occurred via complex evolutionary dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

KTYQR is found to fully impede LE activity, while YDF hinders cohesin to complete LE step cycles and converts cohesin into a unidirectional extruder by strengthening the affinity of STAG1 to DNA. We thus identify two distinct NTR motifs that stall LE via different yet synergistic mechanisms, highlighting the multifaceted ways employed by CTCF to modulate LE to shape and regulate genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

We study molecular conservation in the development of an organ, the molar, by comparing the temporal profiles of expression in mice and hamsters. We find that molar development is characterized by a rarely observed pattern of conservation of expression level and coding sequences forming an inverse hourglass, with more conservation at the beginning and end of morphogenesis than at intermediate stages. As the development of the rodent molar is well described, we were able to link this pattern to the properties of the expressed genes and the activity of different developmental processes. Early and late stages mobilize different sets of pleiotropic genes, cell division for bud growth and secretion for tooth mineralization. The particularities of dental morphogenesis and homeostasis, with the degradation of certain tissues at the end of development and the hosting of immune cells, as well as heterochronies linked to adaptations, also probably contribute to the pattern. Our study of the different actors explains the inverted hourglass of molars by a combination of processes intrinsic to the teeth, and by negative and positive selection which is mostly extrinsic to the teeth. This is likely translatable to explain molecular conservation patterns in many other biological systems.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Compared to their shallower counterpart, MCEs have been traditionally understudied, primarily due to their inaccessibility with traditional monitoring methodologies. In this study, we aim to provide an interdisciplinary assessment of the biodiversity of Bermudan reef fish communities from the upper/lower mesophotic interface (60 m) by utilising a combination of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding and baited remote underwater videos (BRUVs). In total, 155 species from 137 genera were detected by eDNA metabarcoding whilst a total of 85 species from 53 genera were detected by BRUVs. The combined species detections totalled 182 species with approximately half of those detections unique to this study when compared to previous studies. Both methodologies found differences in alpha diversity between study locations, with each method independently detecting the highest species richness at the same location. The species assemblage at each location was dominated (~80%) by species known to occur throughout the shallow reef system and the upper mesophotic, whilst species only known to inhabit mesophotic ecosystems accounted for ~6% at each location. These findings suggest a high level of species continuity with the adjacent shallower reef systems. The complementary nature of eDNA metabarcoding and BRUVs allows for a more accurate characterisation of fish biodiversity at the upper/lower mesophotic interface, which can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystem structure and more informed management decisions.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

In the insect mushroom body (MB), odours are encoded by the activity of Kenyon cells (KCs). The random wiring of olfactory projection neurons (PNs) and KCs in the MB calyx is thought to enhance odour discrimination. Here, we examined the impact of deviations from random wiring and demonstrated their significant roles in shaping odour representations. We confirm that different KC types have distinct PN input biases correlated with the contextual relevance of the odour information delivered by the PNs. By recording the functional responses of different KC types to ethologically defined odour categories, we found that the {beta} and '{beta}' KCs produce segregated representations of relevant odour groups, potentially enhancing the categorisation of odours based on ethological relevance. Simultaneously, these same KC types displayed distinct representations for food-related odours, supporting precise discrimination. In contrast, {gamma} KCs lacked significant segregation of odour representations by ethological category. Computational simulations refined with our functional data indicated that the specific PN input connection pattern of individual KC types largely accounts for the observed representations. Taken together, we propose that individual KC types process odour information with distinct objectives, supporting both ethological categorisation and discrimination.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Despite many advances in this area, a persisting problem is that of wrong assignment of molecules to cells, which limits most current applications to the level of a priori defined cell subsets and complicates the discovery of novel cell states.

Moreover, the fastest rubiscos that we know of so far were found among the sparsely sampled prokaryotes.

We assess the distribution of the carboxylation rates at saturating levels of CO2, and establish that rubisco is a relatively slow enzyme across the tree of life, never exceeding {approx}20 reactions per second. We show that relatively faster subclades share similar evolutionary contexts, involving micro-oxygenic environments or a CO2 concentrating mechanism. Leveraging a simple machine learning model trained on this dataset, we predict the carboxylation rate for all {approx}68,000 sequenced rubisco variants found in nature to date. This study provides the largest and most diverse dataset of natural variants for an enzyme and their associated rates, establishing a solid benchmark for future efforts to predict catalytic rates from sequence data.

SignificanceDiscovering a fast carboxylating rubisco has been a long-standing challenge in the scientific community, given its potential impact on sustainable food and fuel production. Yet, only a small fraction of rubiscos natural diversity has been kinetically characterized. Here, we present a large-scale kinetic survey covering the entire spectrum of rubiscos diversity found in nature. Focusing on genetic clusters with above-average rates, we show that rubiscos catalytic rate does not exceed {approx}20 reactions per second. Supported by a machine-learning predictive model, we extend this finding to all sequenced natural variants. Our study provides the most comprehensive kinetic dataset for a single enzyme to date.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

JAM generates antibodies de novo in both single-domain (VHH) and paired (scFv/mAb) antibody formats that achieve double-digit nanomolar affinities, strong early-stage developability profiles, and precise epitope targeting without experimental optimization. We demonstrate JAMs capabilities across multiple therapeutic contexts, including the first fully computationally designed antibodies to multipass membrane proteins - Claudin-4 and CXCR7. Against SARS-CoV-2, JAM-designed antibodies achieved sub-nanomolar pseudovirus neutralization potency, with early stage developability metrics achieving established clinical benchmarks. We show that increasing test-time computation by allowing JAM to iteratively introspect on its outputs substantially improves both binding success rates and affinities, representing the first evidence that test-time compute scaling may extend to physical protein design systems. The entire process from design to recombinant characterization requires <6 weeks, and multiple targets can be pursued in parallel with minimal additional experimental overhead. These results establish de novo antibody design as a practical approach for therapeutic discovery, offering paths to both improved efficiency in standard workflows and new opportunities for previously intractable targets.

Here we propose new approaches to bridge this gap by combining quantitative estimates of gene-trait relationships from loss-of-function burden tests with gene-regulatory connections inferred from Perturb-seq experiments in relevant cell types. By combining these two forms of data, we aim to build causal graphs in which the directional associations of genes with a trait can be explained by their regulatory effects on biological programs or direct effects on the trait. As a proof-of-concept, we constructed a causal graph of the gene regulatory hierarchy that jointly controls three partially co-regulated blood traits. We propose that perturbation studies in trait-relevant cell types, coupled with gene-level effect sizes for traits, can bridge the gap between genetics and biology.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

SOMs occur seasonally and are hypothesized to result from elevated microbial net primary productivity (NPP). Here, we set out to identify mechanistic drivers of the SOM near the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) site in the Sargasso Sea in October 2019. Coupled time-series analysis of metatranscriptomics, flow cytometry, and family-specific cyanophage quantification revealed elevated Prochlorococcus abundances, cyanophage abundances, and cyanophage-specific transcriptional activity in the SOM. These findings spurred us to analyze historical oxygen saturation profiles at BATS - identifying a repeated, seasonal cycle in SOM emergence associated with elevated virus-like particles and Prochlorococcus numbers. Returning to the 2019 study site, we found that transcriptional markers for increased dissolved organic matter uptake by copiotrophic bacteria were enriched in the SOM, consistent with enhanced catabolic activity due to the viral shunt. In addition, Prochlorococcus exhibited enrichment in ammonium transport transcripts at the SOM, consistent with increased responsiveness to remineralization activity by heterotrophs. Altogether, these findings suggest that enhanced viral lysis leads to locally elevated nutrient recycling and oxygen production, further reinforcing hypotheses that viruses may play a critical role in the emergence of SOMs in the oligotrophic ocean.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Through a re-analysis of a 16S rRNA gene sequencing dataset (n=497 preterm infants), we found that S. haemolyticus was abundant and prevalent in the gut in the first month of life. To better understand the diversity of S. haemolyticus among preterm infants, we generated genome sequences of S. haemolyticus strains (n=140), which were isolated from 44 stool samples of 22 preterm infants from four different hospitals in the United Kingdom. Core genome phylogenetic analyses, incorporating 126 publicly available S. haemolyticus genome sequences, showed that 85/140 (60.1%) of the isolates, from three different hospitals, formed a clonal group with 79/85 (92.9%) strains being assigned to Multi-Locus Sequence Type (ST) 49. Antibiotic resistance genes were highly prevalent in the genome sequences. Using logistic regression, we found a strong association between the presence of the gene mecA and phenotypic resistance to oxacillin (odds ratio [OR]: 158.00, p<0.0001), and the aacA-aphD gene and phenotypic resistance to gentamicin aacA-aphD (OR: 162.00, p<0.001). None of the strains from the preterm infant cohort had a complete Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec) element. The aacA-aphD gene was associated with the transposon Tn4001. Using hybrid genome assemblies, we found it to be present on the chromosome (54.5% of strains) or on diverse plasmids (27.3%). Four strains (18.2%) had Tn4001 copies on both plasmid and chromosome. Our data suggest the existence of a distinct sub-population of S. haemolyticus that has adapted to colonise the gut of preterm infants. Prevalent resistance to antibiotics is of clinical concern and the diversity of genetic contexts of mecA and Tn4001 suggests widespread horizontal gene transfer and recombination in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

In Arabidopsis, responses to light are heavily regulated at the transcriptional level. Shade, for example, can limit photosynthesis and is rapidly perceived by phytochromes as a reduction of red to far-red light ratio (LRFR). Under shade, phytochromes become inactive, enabling PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs), particularly PIF7, to promote genome-wide reprogramming essential for LRFR responses. An initial strong and fast regulation of shade-responsive genes is followed by attenuation of this response under prolonged shade. We wanted to determine whether the transcriptional response to shade depends on chromatin accessibility. For this, we used ATAC-seq to profile the chromatin of seedlings exposed to short (1h) and long (25h) simulated shade. We found that PIF7 binding sites were accessible for most early target genes before LRFR treatment. The transcription pattern of most acute shade-responsive genes correlated with a rapid increase in PIF levels and chromatin association at 1h, and its decrease at 25h of shade exposure. For a small subset of acutely responding genes, PIFs also modulate chromatin accessibility at their binding sites early and/or late in the response to shade. Our results suggest that in seedlings a state of open chromatin conformation allows PIFs to easily access and recognize their binding motifs, rapidly initiating gene expression triggered by shade. This transcriptional response primarily depends on a transient increase in PIF stability and gene occupancy, accompanied by changes in chromatin accessibility in a minority of genes.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the T7SSb core complex from Bacillus subtilis, revealing how a ubiquitin-like protein, YukD, coordinates assembly of the secretion machinery. YukD forms extensive interactions with the central channel component YukB and promotes its association with the pseudokinase YukC, creating a stable building block for channel assembly. Using microscopy and competition assays, we demonstrate that YukD is essential for proper T7SSb complex formation and contact-dependent bacterial killing. Structural modeling suggests this YukD-dependent assembly mechanism is conserved across diverse Gram-positive bacteria. Our findings reveal how bacteria have adapted a ubiquitin-like protein as a structural regulator for assembling a large secretion complex.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Although appreciated for centuries, the identity of position-dependent cues and how they control tissue growth are not resolved. Here, we quantify Erk signaling events in whole populations of osteoblasts during zebrafish fin regeneration. We find that osteoblast Erk activity is dependent on Fgf receptor signaling and organized into millimeter-long gradients that extend from the distal tip to the amputation site. Erk activity scales with the amount of tissue amputated, predicts the likelihood of osteoblast cycling, and predicts the size of regenerated skeletal structures. Mathematical modeling suggests gradients are established by the transient deposition of long-lived ligands that are transported by tissue growth. This concept is supported by the observed scaling of expression of the essential epidermal ligand fgf20a with extents of amputation. Our work provides evidence that localized, scaled expression of pro-regenerative ligands instructs long-range signaling and cycling to control skeletal size in regenerating appendages.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

However, traditional approaches for dividing the genomic sequences into training data, used to create the model, and test data, used to determine the models performance on unseen data, fail to account for the widespread homology that permeates the genome. Using models that predict human gene expression from DNA sequence, we demonstrate that model performance on test sequences varies by their similarity with training sequences, consistent with homology-based data leakage that influences model performance by rewarding overfitting of homologous sequences. Because the sequence and its function are inexorably linked, even a maximally overfit model with no understanding of gene regulation can predict the expression of sequences that are similar to its training data. To prevent leakage in genome-trained models, we introduce hashFrag, a scalable solution for partitioning data with minimal leakage. hashFrag improves estimates of model performance and can actually increase model performance by providing improved splits for model training. Altogether, we demonstrate how to account for homology-based leakage when partitioning genomic sequences for model training and evaluation, and highlight the consequences of failing to do so.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

However, cross-fed metabolites are often only available at low concentrations, limiting the growth rates of gene-loss mutants that are dependent on those metabolites. Here we define conditions that support a loss of function mutant in a three-member bacterial community of: (i) N2-utilizing Rhodopseudomonas palustris as an NH4+-excreting producer, (ii) N2-utilizing Vibrio natriegens as the ancestor, and (iii) a V. natriegens N2-utilizaton mutant that is dependent on the producer for NH4+. Using experimental and simulated cocultures, we found that the ancestor outcompeted the mutant due to low NH4+ availability under uniform conditions where both V. natriegens strains have equal access to nutrients. However, spatial structuring that separated the mutant from the ancestor, while maintaining access to NH4+ from the producer, allowed the mutant to avoid extinction. Counter to predictions, mutant enrichment under spatially structured conditions did not require a growth rate advantage from gene loss and the mutant coexisted with its ancestor. Thus, cross-feeding can originate from loss-of-function mutations that are otherwise detrimental, provided that the mutant can segregate from a competitive ancestor.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Here, we show that zebrafish fibroblasts possess a dual role in inducing and resolving inflammation, which are both essential for regeneration. We identify a transient, injury-specific cthrc1a+ fibroblast state with an inflammation-associated, less differentiated, and non-fibrotic profile. Induction of this fibroblast state precedes and contributes to the initiation of the inflammatory response. At the peak of neutrophil influx, cthrc1a+ fibroblasts coordinate the resolution of inflammation. Disruption of these inflammation dynamics alters the mechano-structural properties of the lesion environment and inhibits axon regeneration.

One of the possible causes underlying this phenomenon could be related to the high content of transposable elements (TE) in the Y chromosome (toxic Y hypothesis). TE activity is normally repressed by epigenetic mechanisms, but this regulation weakens with age. Since the Y chromosome is rich in TEs, age-related TE activity should be more pronounced in old males than in old females, likely affecting longevity patterns. In this work, we studied the natural variation in SGL in wild-type populations of three different Drosophila species that vary in their TE content: Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans, and Drosophila suzukii. Transcriptomic data revealed increased copy-specific TE expression in D. melanogaster and D. suzukii older flies. Moreover, we observed a higher number of upregulated TEs in old males compared to old females across all the three species tested. Additionally, we detected an increase in TE-chimeric transcript generation in some aged samples, particularly in D. suzukii males. Finally, the replacement of the Y chromosome between strains with different SGL led to a progressive reduction in male lifespan and increased TE transcriptional release over generations, suggesting a Y chromosome important role in male longevity. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the genomic differences that lead to variation in longevity patterns between sexes in several species, and emphasizes the importance of studying the role of TEs in male longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Spontaneous associations between different sensory modalities -crossmodal associations- are widely observed in humans. More recently, crossmodal associations have been reported in chimpanzees, monkeys, dogs, chickens, and tortoises, indicating a general cognitive strategy that reflects natural correlations in the environment or similarities in the architecture of the nervous system. Alternatively, or complementarily, crossmodal associations may arise from learning of species-specific occurrences. Recent research on primates has tentatively linked human pitch-luminance associations to the evolution of language. While humans and chimpanzees spontaneously match a high-pitched sound with a white shape and a low-pitched sound with a black shape, baboons and chickens do not exhibit any preferential association. Identifying spontaneous pitch-luminance associations in species that do not rely on vocal communication, such as the solitary Hermann's tortoises, would support the idea of a language-independent phenomenon. To test this idea, we studied tortoises for pitch-luminance associations in a spontaneous food-searching task. After hearing a high-pitched (700 Hz) vs low-pitched (450 Hz) sound, animals could choose to search for food behind either a light- or dark-coloured wall. When hearing the high-pitched sound, tortoises chose the white stimulus, whereas when hearing the low-pitched sound, they chose the black stimulus, similarly to what humans and chimpanzees do. These results demonstrate crossmodal pitch-luminance associations in tortoises. While showing this commonality in the perceptual organization of phylogenetically distant species, we shift the question on whether pitch-luminance associations reflect homology or convergent evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

In primary motor cortex (M1), we know that this process depends on neural activity, but large gaps remain in our understanding of how M1 neural activity is patterned prior to the development of cortical motor control. To track the development of movement-related activity in M1 across sleep and wake, we performed acute, extracellular recordings of single-unit activity in the forelimb region of M1 of unanesthetized, head-fixed rats from postnatal day 12 (P12) to P24. At all ages, a subset of M1 neurons responded robustly and somatotopically to spontaneous limb twitches that occur during REM sleep. M1 neurons also showed robust responses to wake movements at these ages. From P12 to P24, the proportion of M1 neurons that showed twitch-related activity decreased, twitch-related activity became more temporally refined, and there was an increase in the proportion of activity that preceded movement onset. To compare M1's developmentally nascent activity at P24 with that of an established motor structure, we performed simultaneous recordings in M1 and the red nucleus (RN). RN activity reliably preceded both twitches and wake movements, particularly compared to M1, reinforcing the conclusion that as late as P24 RN still predominantly drives limb movements. These results highlight M1's protracted development and the continued importance of subcortically generated movements in driving activity that shapes M1's circuitry, suggesting that movement-related activity during sleep and wake promotes the development of M1's motor functions.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Starting with the Form II Rubisco from Gallionella, we first show that the enzyme can replace the native Form I Rubisco in Synechocystis and that growth rates become sensitive to CO2 and O2 levels. We address the challenge of designing a zero-shot input library, without prior experimental knowledge, by coupling the phylogenetically-guided model EVmutation with ""in silico evolution"". Starting with this targeted mutagenesis library, we used competitive growth coupled to deep sequencing to compare the properties of Rubisco protein variants under different cultivation conditions. We identified an amino acid exchange which increased the thermostability of Gallionella Rubisco and conveyed resilience to detrimental exchanges. The establishment of this platform is a first step towards high-throughput screening of Rubisco variants in Synechocystis and creating optimized enzyme variants to accelerate the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle in cyanobacteria and possibly chloroplasts.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Many of these functions are upregulated on demand, therefore cells control peroxisome abundance, and by extension peroxisome function, in response to environmental and developmental cues. The mechanisms upregulating peroxisomes in mammalian cells have remained unclear. Here we identify a signaling regulatory network and a mechanism that coordinate cellular demand for peroxisomes and peroxisome abundance by regulating peroxisome proliferation. We show that protein kinase C (PKC) promotes peroxisome PEX11b-dependent formation. PKC activation leads to an increase in peroxisome formation, promoting peroxisome-ER contact site formation through inactivation of GSK3?. We show that removal of VAPA and VAPB impairs peroxisome biogenesis and PKC regulation. Inhibition of PKC reduces peroxisome-ER interactions, leading to a decrease in peroxisome abundance. During neuronal differentiation, active PKC leads to a significant increase in peroxisome formation. We propose that peroxisomal regulation by transient active PKC signaling enables rapid and fine-tuned responses to the need for peroxisomal activity.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Colonization of the intestine by the common but non-ubiquitous commensal, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), reprograms AM to resist RVI-induced depletion. Hence, we examined if SFB against secondary infection by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or S. aureus, following primary infection by influenza virus (IAV). Indeed, SFB colonization conferred strong post-IAV protection against these lethal bacterial pathogens. AM depletion and transplant studies indicated that SFB reprogramming these cells was necessary and sufficient for such protection. Assay of AM, ex vivo, from SFB-colonized mice argued their protection against secondary bacterial infection was not only due to their withstanding IAV-induced depletion. Rather, AM from SFB-colonized mice displayed complement-dependent increases in phagocytosis and killing of these bacteria. Furthermore, AM from SFB-colonized mice stably held their enhanced anti-bacterial phenotype even when transplanted into an inflamed interferon-rich post IAV-environment. Thus, SFB, and perhaps gut microbiota composition in general influences proneness to bacterial pneumonia, especially post-RVI.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Increasingly, molecular methods of species monitoring are integrated into freshwater biodiversity surveys and fisheries management. Inferring organism abundance or biomass from sequence counts derived from metabarcoding data has been an exciting but contentious concept in the biomonitoring community for some time. Although demonstrating a strong correlation with abundance has proven difficult, many researchers have assumed that quantitative metabarcoding data can at least provide broad-scale ranking of abundance. However, robust field validations of this widely-held assumption remain scarce. 2. Here, we analyse metabarcoding read counts of fish eDNA data derived from 20 lakes and use betabinomial mixed effects models to compare this to rank abundance generated from long-term fish survey data. Rank abundance data for 18 species was generated within-species across-sites, meaning that ranks compare the abundance of the same species in different lakes. We also investigated a possible allometric effect on eDNA production by analysing a subset of data for effects of fish body mass on the amount of eDNA sequences. 3. We found a good relationship between species-specific eDNA sequences and within-species rank abundance categories for fishes, with rare fish producing 3% of sequences in a library, moderately abundant producing 7% and abundant fish producing 29%, according to model predictions. 4. We found a small negative effect of body mass on the amount of eDNA sequences, where the proportion of reads recovered significantly decreased with increased mean body mass of the population. 5. Synthesis and applications: The benefit of this approach is the potential for rapid assessment of rank abundance for multiple species, including smaller species which are often missed by conventional methods such as gillnetting, with relatively low amounts of additional effort. This approach will assist practitioners taking a species-based approach to freshwater habitat management in lakes worldwide.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Lung-resident group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) express notably high levels of androgen receptors (AR). In IAV infection, ILC2s produce type 2 cytokines and facilitate tissue repair, but they also may be functionally suppressed by type 1 cytokines. Here we report sex differences in the magnitude of lung ILC2 functional suppression at the peak of sublethal IAV infection. Relative to males, ILC2s in females show attenuated proliferation, decreased propensity for IL-5 and amphiregulin production and reduced expression of GATA3 and IL-33R, features supported by divergent transcriptomes. Equivalent inflammatory cytokine levels and viral load suggested sex differences in ILC2-intrinsic factors. Indeed, naive female ILC2s showed elevated IFNGR expression and higher phospho-STAT1 levels following IFNG stimulation, and lymphocyte-restricted STAT1 deficiency reversed IAV-induced suppression of female ILC2s. Lymphocyte-restricted AR deficiency or loss of androgens via orchiectomy led to increased IFNGR expression and suppression of male ILC2s. These data support the hypothesis that intrinsic AR activity regulates IFNGR-STAT1 signaling pathways to preserve canonical ILC2 function in males during IAV infection.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Orofacial movements must be coordinated with rhythmic breathing to avoid aspiration and because they share muscles. Understanding how brainstem circuits coordinate rhythmic motor programs requires neurophysiological measurements in behaving animals. We used Neuropixels probe recordings to map brainstem neural activity related to breathing, licking, and swallowing in mice drinking water. Breathing and licking rhythms were tightly coordinated and phase-locked, whereas intermittent swallowing paused breathing and licking. Multiple clusters of neurons, each recruited during different orofacial rhythms, delineated a lingual premotor network in the intermediate nucleus of the reticular formation (IRN). Local optogenetic perturbation experiments identified a region in the IRN where constant stimulation can drive sustained rhythmic licking, consistent with a central pattern generator for licking. Stimulation to artificially induce licking showed that coupled brainstem oscillators autonomously coordinated licking and breathing. The brainstem oscillators were further patterned by descending inputs at moments of licking initiation. Our results reveal the logic governing interactions of orofacial rhythms during behavior and outline their neural circuit dynamics, providing a model for dissecting multi-oscillator systems controlling rhythmic motor programs.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Specifically, a Cholesteric Liquid Crystal (CLC) model was proposed in which DNA is organized into parallel fibers within stacked discs, such that the fiber orientation rotates by a constant angle between adjacent discs. Extrachromosomal loops extending from the discs were hypothesized to be more accessible and thus to contain transcriptionally active genes. Although the CLC model captures some features of dinoflagellate chromosome structure, its validity has not been rigorously tested against modern genomic data. Here, we use chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) data to simulate 3D conformations of chromosome scaffolds for two dinoflagellate species, Symbiodinium kawagutii and Symbiodinium microadriaticum. These polymer conformations are compact helices with significant orientational and nematic order. However, we find no evidence of cholesteric discs. Moreover, simulated Hi-C contact maps of CLC structures lack topologically associating domains (TADs), which are observed in experimental Hi-C contact maps for these species. Finally, by mapping RNA-seq data onto our simulated conformations, we show that actively transcribed genes are present throughout the entire chromosome, and not exclusively on extrachromosomal loops or at the surface.

Flavodiiron proteins (FLV) are crucial enzymes in PCET, found in all photosynthetic organisms but lost during the evolution of angiosperms.

Here, we showed that CO exposure minimally affects microbial abundance, richness, and composition in diverse ecosystem soils, suggesting most microbes are tolerant of this gas. Genome-resolved metagenomic profiling showed that these soils harbored diverse bacteria capable of using CO an electron donor for aerobic respiration and carbon fixation. CO stimulated the growth of several of these putative CO-oxidizing bacteria in a dose-dependent manner, especially widespread proteobacterial and actinobacterial lineages.

However, limited knowledge exists about the environmental, physiological, and genetic factors influencing mosquito activity patterns. This knowledge gap is partly due to a lack of tools to accurately quantify the behavior of free-flying mosquitoes over extended periods. Here, we introduce BuzzWatch, an open-source, low-cost platform designed to continuously monitor mosquito flight behavior over several weeks with high temporal resolution. BuzzWatch records videos of mosquitoes freely flying in a transparent cage and automates the extraction, analysis, and visualization of behavioral data, including flight trajectories and population-level flight and sugar-feeding statistics. Using BuzzWatch, we quantified the daily rhythms of 10 Aedes aegypti populations from various geographic origins. Globally invasive Ae. aegypti showed increased sugar feeding and flight activity during midday compared to native African populations. Our platform further revealed subtle, long-lasting effects of blood feeding on activity patterns and a complex response to extended daylight periods. By integrating a host-seeking module in BuzzWatch to deliver CO2 and heat pulses, we observed a twofold increase in Ae. aegypti's response to host-associated cues during the daytime compared to nighttime. Combined, these results demonstrate BuzzWatch's potential to investigate responses to host cues over seconds, natural variability in daily rhythms over hours, and phenotypic plasticity over days. BuzzWatch offers a novel perspective on mosquito behavior over multiple timescales, paving the way for advanced ecological and epidemiological studies that can inform targeted and effective vector control strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Of the 23 sequence modifications tested, two induced the DNA duplex to adopt a Z-like left-handed conformation under physiological salt conditions, bypassing the specific sequences typically required for a left-handed Z-DNA structure. The impact of these modifications varied with the linker type: flexible propyl linkers exhibited distinct effects compared to rigid propargyl linkers. Notably, modifications positioned directly on or near a restriction site emphasized the pivotal role of linker rigidity in controlling DNA conformation. Specifically, the conformational change induced by the flexible linker impacted nuclease and restriction endonuclease cleavage, reducing sequence specificity. In contrast, the rigid linker suppressed this effect. Furthermore, our findings indicate that nucleic acid duplexes modified with indole-linked nucleotides using a flexible propyl linker have a pronounced tendency to form BZ or Z-like regions in longer DNA sequences. A higher density of modifications may even induce a full Z-like conformation throughout the duplex. These modified nucleotides hold potential for the development of novel antisense therapeutics and introducing valuable tools for in vitro screening of small molecules targeting distorted B-DNA, BZ-DNA, and Z-DNA structures.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Their modifications can therefore explain the unusual mitotic and meiotic behaviour of certain chromosomes, such as the germline-restricted chromosome (GRC) of songbirds. This chromosome is eliminated from somatic cells during early embryogenesis and later also from male germ cells during spermatogenesis. Although the mechanism of elimination is not yet known, it is possible that it involves a modification of the centromeric sequence on the GRC, resulting in problems with the attachment of this chromosome to the mitotic or meiotic spindle and its lagging during anaphase, which eventually leads to its elimination from the nucleus. However, the repetitive nature and rapid evolution of centromeres make their identification and comparative analysis across species and chromosomes challenging. Here, we used a combination of cytogenetic and genomic approaches to identify the centromeric sequence of two closely related songbird species, the common nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) and the thrush nightingale (L. luscinia). We found a 436-bp satellite repeat present in the centromeric regions of all regular chromosomes, making it a strong candidate for the centromeric repeat. This centromeric repeat was highly similar between the two nightingale species. Interestingly, hybridization of the probe to this satellite repeat on meiotic spreads suggested that this repeat is missing on the GRC. Our results indicate that the change of the centromeric sequence may underlie the unusual inheritance and programmed DNA elimination of the GRC in songbirds.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Efforts to scan mice in the awake state and avoid the use of anesthesia have demonstrated many benefits. However, the majority of current awake fMRI approaches involve head fixation through invasive surgical means. These approaches are limited for several reasons including increased subject morbidity and mortality, prolonged study timelines due to surgical recovery, a higher risk of susceptibility artifacts contaminating T2*-weighted images and obstructed access to the head for multi-modal recording techniques such as electrophysiology and fibre photometry. To address this need, we propose a non-invasive restraint to scan mice in the awake state. The restraint was designed to be compatible with brain stimulation and recording approaches. It was evaluated on the basis of motion, fMRI data quality, and animal stress levels, and subsequently compared to a conventional headpost restraint. We found the proposed approach was effective at restraining mice across a broad range of weights without the need for any anesthesia for setup. Conservatively, acquiring 25% more data with the non-invasive restraint compensates for censored frames in high motion runs and results in comparable network spatial specificity to less motion-vulnerable headpost approaches. This validation of network robustness paired with its non-invasive nature makes it a favourable approach for applications requiring high-throughput and/or multimodal imaging studies.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Met-ID enables annotation of m/z features from any type of MALDI-MSI experiment, involving either derivatizing or conventional matrices. It utilizes structural information for derivatizing matrices to generate a subset of targets that contain only functional groups specific to the derivatization agent. The software is able to identify multiple derivatization sites on the same molecule, facilitating identification of the derivatized compound. This ability is exemplified by FMP-10, a reactive matrix that assists the covalent charge-tagging of molecules containing phenolic hydroxyl and/or primary or secondary amine groups. Met-ID also permits users to recalibrate data with known m/z ratios, boosting confidence in mass match results. Furthermore, Met-ID includes a database featuring MS2 spectra of numerous chemical standards, consisting of neurotransmitters and metabolites derivatized with FMP-10, alongside peaks for FMP-10 itself, all accessible directly through the software. The MS2 spectral database supports user-uploaded spectra and enables comparison of these spectra with user-provided tissue MS2 spectra for similarity assessment. Although initially installed with basic data, Met-ID is designed to be customizable, encouraging users to tailor the software to their specific needs. While several MSI-oriented software solutions exist, Met-ID stands out as a pioneer in seamlessly combining both MS1 and MS2 functionalities. Developed in alignment with the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific software, Met-ID is freely available as an open-source tool on GitHub, ensuring wide accessibility and collaboration.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

ObjectiveThe primary objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the global prevalence of long COVID and its subtypes and symptoms in individuals with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, while the secondary objective is to assess risk factors for long COVID in the same population.

Data SourcesStudies on long COVID published from July 5, 2021, to May 29, 2024, searched from PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were used for this systematic review. Supplemental updates to the original search period were made.

Study SelectionThere were four inclusion criteria: (1) human study population with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis; (2) appropriate index diagnosis date; (3) outcome must include either prevalence, risk factors, duration, or symptoms of long COVID; and (4) follow-up time of at least two months after the index date. The exclusion criteria were: (1) non-human study population; (1) case studies or reviews; (2) studies with imaging, molecular, and/or cellular testing as primary results; (3) studies with specific populations such as healthcare workers, residents of nursing homes, and/or those living in long-term care facilities; and (4) studies that did not meet the sample size threshold needed to estimate overall prevalence with margin of error of 0.05.

Data Extraction and SynthesisTwo screeners independently performed screenings and data extraction, and decision conflicts were collectively resolved. The data were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis framework with a DerSimonian-Laird inverse variance weighted estimator.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary estimand (target population parameter of interest) was the prevalence of long COVID and its subtypes among individuals with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, and the secondary estimand was effect sizes corresponding to ten common risk factors of long COVID in the same population.

ResultsA total of 442 studies were included in this mega-systematic review, and 429 were meta-analyzed for various endpoints, avoiding duplicate estimates from the same study. Of the 442 studies, 17.9% of the studies have a high risk of bias. Heterogeneity is evident among meta-analyzed studies, where the I2 statistic is nearly 100% in studies that estimate overall prevalence. Global estimated pooled prevalence of long COVID was 36% among COVID-19 positive individuals (95% confidence interval [CI] 33%-40%) estimated from 144 studies. Geographical variation was observed in the estimated pooled prevalence of long COVID: Asia at 35% (95% CI 25%-46%), Europe at 39% (95% CI 31%-48%), North America at 30% (95% CI 24%-38%), and South America at 51% (95% CI 35%-66%). Stratifying by follow-up duration, the estimated pooled prevalence for individuals with longer follow-up periods of 1 to 2 years (47% [95% CI 37%-57%]) compared to those with follow-up times of less than 1 year (35% [95% CI 31%-39%]) had overlapping CI and were therefore not statistically distinguishable. Top five most prevalent long COVID subtypes among COVID-19 positive cases were respiratory at 20% (95% CI 14%-28%) estimated from 31 studies, general fatigue at 20% (95% CI 18%-23%) estimated from 121 studies, psychological at 18% (95% CI 11%-28%) estimated from 10 studies, neurological at 16% (95% CI 8%-30%) estimated from 23 studies, and dermatological at 12% (95% CI 8%-17%) estimated from 10 studies. The most common symptom based on estimated prevalence was memory problems estimated at 11% (95% CI 7%-19%) meta-analyzed from 12 studies. The three strongest risk factors for long COVID were being unvaccinated for COVID-19, pre-existing comorbidity, and female sex. Individuals with any of these risk factors had higher odds of having long COVID with pooled estimated odds ratios of 2.34 (95% CI 1.49-3.67) meta-analyzed from 6 studies, 1.59 (95% CI 1.28-1.97) from 13 studies, and 1.55 (95% CI 1.25-1.92) from 22 studies, respectively.

Conclusions and RelevanceThis study shows long COVID is globally prevalent in the COVID-19 positive population with highly varying estimates. The prevalence of long COVID persists over extended follow-up, with a high burden of symptoms 1 to 2 years post-infection. Our findings highlight long COVID and its subtypes as a continuing health challenge worldwide. The heterogeneity of the estimates across populations and geographical regions argues for the need for carefully designed follow-up with representative studies across the world.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the prevalence and patterns of long COVID and its subtypes, and what are the risk factors of long COVID?

ResultsMeta-analysis of 429 studies published from 2021-2024 estimated a pooled global long COVID prevalence of 36% in COVID-19 positive individuals. Variations in geographical regions showed that South America had the highest pooled prevalence of 51% (95% CI: 35%-66%), and the prevalence does not seem to diminish with extended follow-up (less than 1 year: 35%, 95% CI: 31%-39% vs. 1 to 2 years: 47%, 95% CI: 37%-57%). The estimated pooled prevalence of eight major long COVID subtypes in COVID-19 positive individuals were 20% (respiratory), 20% (general fatigue), 18% (psychological), 16% (neurological), 12% (dermatological), 10% (cardiovascular), 9% (musculoskeletal) and 5% (gastrointestinal).

MeaningQuantitative evidence shows a persistent prevalence of long COVID globally, with a significant burden of symptoms 1 to 2 years post-infection, underscoring the need for having accurate and standardized diagnostic tests and biomarkers for long COVID, a better understanding of the physiology of the condition, its treatment, and its potential effect on healthcare needs and workforce participation. The heterogeneity and wide range of the prevalence estimates call for representative samples in well-designed follow-up studies of long COVID across the world.","NA","medrxiv",1738015719449

We developed a simple regression-based point score in 2020 based on an objective of forecasting critical care occupancy in the Canadian province of Ontario based on mean age of cases, case numbers, and testing volume. Evolution of the pandemic (variants of concern, vaccination) led us to re-assess and re-calibrate our earlier work, with inclusion of information vaccination which became widespread in 2021.

MethodsWe obtained complete provincial SARS-CoV-2 case, testing, and vaccination data for the period from March 2020 to September 2022, with data subdivided into 6 major ""waves"", following the approach applied by other Canadian investigators. Our initial model was fit only using the first two ""wild type"" SARS-CoV-2 waves; an updated model included wave 3 (N501Y+ variants). Our model was validated by comparing model projections to waves not used for model fitting; validation model fits were evaluated with Spearmans rho; counterfactuals without vaccination were modeled to impute fraction of critical care admissions prevented with vaccination. Costing was based on published economic estimates.

ResultsOur initial model (fit to waves 1 and 2) was well calibrated (rho 0.85) but predictive validity was modest (rho 0.46). Predictive validity improved in models fit to the first 3 pandemic waves without vaccination (rho 0.60) or with vaccination (rho 0.68) (P for inclusion of vaccination 0.013 by Likelihood Ratio Test). Prevented fraction of ICU admissions attributable to vaccination was 144% (22017 admissions expected vs. 9020 observed); based on published estimates of ICU admission cost for SARS-CoV-2 the 12977 admissions averted $2.9 (CDN) billion in economic costs, in contrast to the $3 billion total cost of the vaccination program.

ConclusionsSimple time series regression incorporating case and testing characteristics continues to be useful as a tool for forecasting critical care occupancy due to SARS-CoV-2 but early pandemic models need to be updated to capture the preventive effects of widespread vaccination. The economic benefit of vaccination for prevention of critical care resource consumption during the pandemic is substantial, achieving near cost neutrality with the provinces entire vaccination program.","NA","medrxiv",1738015719449

The loss of either RSRC2 or C1QTNF1-AS1 results in defects in chromosome congression and mitotic progression. We show that RSRC2 interacts with distinct sets of proteins involved in splicing and centrosome biogenesis, contributing to the fidelity of cell division through two different mechanisms: one linked to the splicing of mitotic regulators and the other by localising to mitotic centrosomes for which the interaction with the C1QTNF1-AS1 RNA is required.

NRC proteins are classified as CNL, which contain a coiled-coil (CC) domain in their N-terminal region. Previous studies highlighted the importance of the MADA motif in the first alpha helix of the CC domain for NRC-mediated defense responses. However, how other alpha helices in the CC domain contribute to NRC function remains unclear. In this study, we identified a novel hydrophobic feature localized in the CC domain barrel that contributes to NRC-mediated immunity. We screened the conserved hydrophobic residues among NRCs and identified seven required for NRC4-mediated cell death. Structural analysis revealed that four of these residues form a hydrophobic center in the CC domain. We further demonstrated that this hydrophobic core is important for NRC4 subcellular localization, oligomerization, and phospholipid association, but not for NRC4 focal accumulation on the extra-haustorial membrane during Phytophthora infestans infection. By comparing sequences of multiple NLRs in the NRC superclade, we found that the residues of the hydrophobic core in sensor NLRs exhibit greater diversity than those in helper NLRs. Cell death assays indicated that the function of the hydrophobic core has degenerated in certain sensor NLRs but remains essential in NRCs and ZAR1.

Historical contingencies arise when elements from an organism's past leave lasting effects on the genome, altering the paths available for adaptation. We utilize strains isolated before and after widespread antibiotic use to study the impact of deep historical differences shaped by decades of evolution in varying antibiotic and host pressures. We evaluated these effects by comparing immediate and adaptive responses of two strains of Acinetobacter baumannii to the last-resort antibiotic, tigecycline (TGC). When grown in subinhibitory TGC, the two strains demonstrated divergent transcriptional responses suggesting that baseline transcript levels may dictate global responses to drug and their subsequent evolutionary trajectories. Experimental evolution in TGC revealed clear differences in population-genetic dynamics - with hard sweeps in populations founded by one strain and no mutations reaching fixation in the other strain. Transcriptomes of evolved populations no longer showed signatures of drug response, as was seen in the ancestors, suggesting that genetic adaptation may outweigh preexisting differences in transcriptional networks. Genetically, AMR was acquired through predictable mechanisms of increased efflux and drug target modification; however, the two strains adapted by mutations in different efflux regulators. Fitness tradeoffs of AMR were only observed in lineages evolved from the pre-antibiotic era strain, suggesting that decades of adaptation to antibiotics resulted in preexisting compensatory mechanisms in the more contemporary isolate, an important example of a beneficial effect of historical contingencies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Acinetobacter baumannii is a high priority pathogen often causing multidrug resistant nosocomial infections. Many healthcare systems experience clonal outbreaks of A. baumannii infections, yet treatment strategies are often strain-agnostic, ignoring the importance of strain differences. We show that historical differences between two strains, one isolated prior to widespread antibiotic use and the other following decades of selection to clinical conditions, dictate transcriptional patterns and response to a last-resort antibiotic and influence the genetic and phenotypic routes of resistance adaptation. While our study focuses on two reference strains of A. baumannii, these findings can be more broadly applicable to other pathogenic organisms in which a better understanding of the forces influencing resistance adaptation is essential for combating the antimicrobial resistance crisis.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Temporal changes in hematopoiesis parallel age-dependent incidences of blood diseases. Several heterochronic regulators of hematopoiesis have been identified, but how the master transcription factor (TF) circuitry of definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) adapts over the lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that expression of the ETS family TF Erg is adult-biased, and that programmed upregulation of Erg expression during juvenile to adult aging is evolutionarily conserved and required for complete implementation of adult patterns of HSC self-renewal and myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid differentiation. Erg deficiency maintains fetal transcriptional and epigenetic programs, and persistent juvenile phenotypes in Erg haploinsufficient mice are dependent on deregulation of the fetal-biased TF Hmga2. Finally, Erg haploinsufficiency in the adult results in fetal-like resistance to leukemogenesis. Overall, we identify a mechanism whereby HSC TF networks are rewired to specify stage-specific hematopoiesis, a finding directly relevant to age-biased blood diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Using consensus sequences of immunodominant antigens is a promising antigen design strategy for board cross-protection. Combining these two features, we designed and evaluated a TA mRNA vaccine encoding a consensus spike protein from SARS-CoV-2. Mice receiving the TA mRNA vaccine produced neutralizing antibody levels comparable to a conventional mRNA vaccine using 40 times less antigen mRNA.

To begin to understand the mechanism by which FAM151B-DT mediates tau aggregation and contributes to several neurodegenerative diseases, we deeply characterized this novel lncRNA and found that FAM151B-DT resides in the cytoplasm where it interacts with tau, -synuclein, HSC70, and other proteins enriched in protein homeostasis. When silenced, FAM151B-DT blocks autophagy, leading to the accumulation of tau and -synuclein. Importantly, we discovered that increasing FAM151B-DT expression is sufficient to promote autophagic flux, reduce phospho-tau and -synuclein, and reduce tau aggregation.

Positive delta in adults is normally interpreted as implying that an individual is aging (or has aged) faster than the population norm, an indicator of unhealthy aging. Unfortunately, from cross-sectional (single timepoint) imaging data, it is impossible to know whether a single individuals positive delta reflects a state of faster ongoing aging, or an unvarying trait (in other words, a ""historical baseline effect"" in the context of the population being studied). However, for a cross-sectional dataset comprising many individuals, one could attempt to disambiguate the overall relative contributions of varying aging rates vs. fixed baseline effects. We present a method for doing this, and show that for the most common approaches, which estimate a single delta per subject, baseline effects are likely to dominate. If instead one estimates multiple biologically distinct modes of brain aging, we find that some modes do reflect aging rates varying strongly across subjects. We demonstrate this, and verify our modelling, using longitudinal (two timepoint) data from 4,400 participants in UK Biobank. In addition, whereas previous work found incompatibility between cross-sectional and longitudinal brain aging, we show that careful data processing does show consistency between cross-sectional and longitudinal results.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1738015719449

Resolving this uncertainty is critical for understanding whether the blind truly ""see"" via SSDs. Using electrical neuroimaging of EEG data from congenitally blind adults, we show for the first time that inferotemporal visual cortices are the earliest site of face sensitivity when conveyed via SSDs. The blind do indeed ""see"" with SSDs. By providing the temporal dynamics of SSD perception, our findings provide unique evidence for the theory that cortices are characterised by task-contingent functional organisation.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Iteratively Defined Lengths of Inaccessibility (IDLI) classifies nucleosomes on the basis of shared patterns of intranucleosomal accessibility, into: i.) minimally-accessible chromatosomes; ii.) octasomes with stereotyped DNA accessibility from superhelical locations (SHLs) {+/-}1 through {+/-}7; iii.) highly-accessible unwrapped nucleosomes; and iv.) subnucleosomal species, such as hexasomes, tetrasomes, and other short DNA protections. Applying IDLI to mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) chromatin, we discover widespread nucleosomal distortion on individual mammalian chromatin fibers, with >85% of nucleosomes surveyed displaying degrees of intranucleosomally accessible DNA. We observe epigenomic-domain-specific patterns of distorted nucleosome co-occupancy and positioning, including at enhancers, promoters, and mouse satellite repeat sequences. Nucleosome distortion is programmed by the presence of bound transcription factors (TFs) at cognate motifs; occupied TF binding sites are differentially decorated by distorted nucleosomes compared to unbound sites, and degradation experiments establish direct roles for TFs in structuring binding-site proximal nucleosomes. Finally, we apply IDLI in the context of primary mouse hepatocytes, observing evidence for pervasive nucleosomal distortion in vivo. Further genetic experiments reveal a role for the hepatocyte master regulator FOXA2 in directly impacting nucleosome distortion at hepatocyte-specific regulatory elements in vivo. Our work suggests extreme--but regulated--plasticity in nucleosomal DNA accessibility at the single-molecule level. Further, our study offers an essential new framework to model transcription factor binding, nucleosome remodeling, and cell-type specific gene regulation across biological contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing was used to compare the two production modes using healthy donor and CLL patient-derived T cells and a CD19-CAR T cell control. SB products were shifted towards CD8+ subsets with expression of activation/co-inhibition markers (CD69, LAG-3, TIM-3) despite their naive-like phenotype and lack of antigenic challenge. The CAR binding moiety modulated these patterns with R110-CAR T cells showing more aberrant phenotypes. Moreover, SB engineering resulted in inflammatory signatures along with RIG-I-like and TOLL-like nucleotide sensing potentially resulting from the transfection procedure. Patient-derived products showed significantly fewer CAR-expressing cells, reduced proliferation clusters, and lower T cell diversity, particularly with SB manufacturing, pointing at potential challenges with this method when engineering CLL T cells. Together, our data suggest that the engineering mode may substantially influence T cell properties and that these are further modulated by the CAR binding moiety and the type of T cell donor.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

While carboxysome number, size and spatial organization are observed to vary in different environmental conditions (CO2, light, temperature, light quality), molecular mechanisms underlying this potentially adaptive process remain elusive. Herein, we observed that mutants of the circadian rhythm/metabolism factor, Regulator of Phycobilisome Associated A (RpaA), exhibit a striking breakdown of carboxysomes under certain environmental conditions. We find that growth conditions leading to overreduction of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool (mixotrophic growth, high irradiance, or chemical inhibition of electron transfer from PQ to the cytochrome b6f complex) are accompanied by elevated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and correlate with carboxysome breakdown. Carboxysome breakdown is reversed by environmental conditions or chemical inhibitors that prevent PQ overreduction and accompanying ROS generation. Taken together, our data supports a novel link between the redox status of the PQ pool and carboxysome status and/or integrity. Our results have implications for fundamental understanding of cyanobacterial energy balancing pathways and may indicate new research directions for understanding how the carboxysome is remodeled in response to changing environments.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

The selection of appropriate symbionts is paramount for the host to gain valuable nutrients and could be tailored to increase stress tolerance against anthropogenic induced changes in ocean environments, such as coral bleaching in response to ocean warming. Previous research suggests glycan-lectin interactions play a role in symbiont uptake; however, blockage of such interactions does not fully inhibit symbiosis establishment, suggesting other receptors are at play. Potential candidates include RGD peptide binding integrins, which are known to mediate phagocytosis of microbes in other systems. Here, we used a combination of cnidarian model systems and human cell lines to determine if integrins facilitate symbiont recognition and uptake. Integrins are highly expressed in the endodermal tissue of the host, where symbiosis takes place, and upon uptake into endodermal cells, symbionts altered the expression of integrins and downstream signaling molecules. Blockage of integrin binding sites with RGD competitor peptides reduced symbiont uptake, but had no effect on the general uptake of non-symbiotic algae, or uptake in a non-symbiotic cnidarian. In addition, inert beads coated with integrin RGD peptide ligands were phagocytosed more readily than beads coated with scrambled peptide. Finally, overexpression of RGD-binding integrins in human cells increased symbiont uptake and mutation of the active binding site abolished uptake. Our findings reveal RGD-binding integrins as key players in symbiosis establishment and shed light on the evolutionary functions of integrins as phagocytic receptors.

Significance statementCorals engage in a symbiotic partnership with photosynthetic algae to survive in challenging environments. To date it is largely unclear how the two partners recognize each other. Using a comparative model systems approach, we have identified evolutionary conserved integrins as molecular receptors for specifically engulfing symbionts, but not other algae. This suggests that integrins allow the host to distinguish between symbiotic and non-symbiotic algae and preferentially take up symbionts. Our findings establish a new paradigm for symbiosis establishment in corals and shed light on the ancient function of integrins as environmental sensors.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Inner membranes of mitochondria are known to be permeable to potassium ions (K+), which enter the matrix either through ATP-sensitive channels (MitoKATP) or leakage across the bilayer driven by inner membrane potentials. Mitochondrial K+ influx is associated with increased osmotic pressure, promoting water influx and increasing matrix volume. Since BAT mitochondria have lower inner membrane potentials due to uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) activity, we hypothesized this could involve compensatory changes in MitoKATP activity, and thus tested MitoKATP involvement in brown adipocyte activities under basal and stimulated conditions. We find that cold exposure and adrenergic stimulation in mice modulate BAT MitoK levels, the channel portion of MitoKATP. Genetic ablation of the gene that codes for the pore-forming subunit of MitoKATP in human pre-adipocytes decreased cellular respiration and proliferation, compromising differentiation into mature adipocytes. In mouse cell lines, the absence of the protein limited cellular oxygen consumption in the precursor stage, but not in mature adipocytes. Interestingly, inhibition of MitoKATP in mature adipocytes increased adrenergic-stimulated oxygen consumption, indicating that shutdown of this pathway is important for full BAT thermogenesis. Similarly, MitoKATP inhibition increased oxygen consumption in BAT mitochondria isolated from mice treated with beta 3 adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243. Overall, our results suggest that the activity of MitoKATP regulates differentiation and metabolism of brown adipocytes, impacting on thermogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

This structural modulation determines the balance between intra- and intermolecular interactions, which in turn governs the molecular network, thermodynamic stability, and material properties of chromatin condensates. Mammalian nuclei contain dense clusters of nucleosomes whose non-random organization is mirrored by the reconstituted condensates. Our work explains how the structure of individual chromatin molecules ultimately determines physical properties of chromatin condensates, with implications for cellular chromatin organization.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

However, existing full-length single-cell RNA-sequencing methods suffer from multiple technical limitations, such as the pervasive presence of reverse transcription artifacts across genes. Here, we introduce Ouro-Seq, a novel single-cell long-read sequencing framework with a versatile artifact removal mechanism for characterizing full-length mRNA species expressed by individual cells. We also developed a computational pipeline that identifies genuine full-length cDNAs and normalizes full-length mRNA size distributions for integration. Using Ouro-Seq, we constructed the Mouse Single-Cell Long-Read Splicing Atlas by collecting full-length transcriptomes of 103,304 nuclei or cells from 12 major organs and tissues of adult mice. Our atlas comprehensively characterizes alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, and alternative polyadenylation events across cell types, revealing previously unappreciated functional heterogeneity among individual cells. Different cell types exhibit largely distinct expression patterns of various isoforms, corresponding to their specific morphologies and biological functions. Our splicing atlas and generalized long-read frameworks will empower researchers to fully interpret biological variation across full-length transcriptomes of single cells.","NA","biorxiv",1738015719449

Despite existing research, it remains unclear how the gut microbiome is affected by different intensities of PA, and how other lifestyle factors influence this relationship. Here we study the relation between PA intensity and gut microbiome composition and function in a large Lifelines Dutch Microbiome Project dataset.

MethodsA cross-sectional design was performed on 5409 adults aged 40 to 60 from the community-based Lifelines Dutch Microbiome Project and from all these participants metagenomic shotgun data was available. Participants were categorized into sedentary (N=2501), moderate (N=1915), and vigorous (N=993) PA groups, based on self-reported activity levels. We investigated association between PA intensity and microbial diversity, bacterial species, and metabolic pathways by multiple regression models sequentially adjusted for the covariates age/sex, BMI, stool consistency and diet quality/alcohol intake.

ResultsVigorous PA, but not moderate PA, was significantly associated with higher gut microbiome alpha diversity (i.e., species richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity) as compared to sedentary PA. Compared to the sedentary group, the vigorous PA group showed a lower abundance of the bacterial species Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus ({beta} = -0.003, p = 0.042), even after extensive covariate adjustments and correction for multiple testing. Other species were initially also significantly associated with vigorous PA, but they disappeared after adjusting for covariates resulting in a loss of significance. Pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of two distinct metabolic pathways related to cellular energy recycling (Pyruvate fermentation to acetate and lactate II, {beta} = 8.11x10-05, p = 0.035) and purine metabolism (Purine ribonucleosides degradation, {beta} = 3.36x10-04, p = 0.039) in participants engaging in vigorous PA as compared to sedentary PA.

ConclusionsVigorous PA is associated with higher gut microbiome diversity and with specific alterations of microbial composition. The lower abundance of Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus within the vigorous PA group may be linked to increased gut permeability. The identified enrichment of microbial fermentation and purine metabolism in vigorous PA hints at a potential role of PA in affecting gut microbiome functionality and host health. The results of our modeling strategy highlight the importance of adjusting for dietary covariates to understand how PA may impact the gut microbiome independently from other influences.","NA","medrxiv",1738015719449

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1738015719449
