Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

Compared with 3 Tesla (3T) MRI, 7 Tesla (7T) MRI can detect more subtle injuries, including hippocampal subfield volume differences and additional standard biomarkers such as white matter lesions. 7T MRI could help with the interpretation of the various persistent post-acute and distal onset sequelae of COVID-19 infection.

ObjectiveTo investigate the differences in white matter hyperintensity (WMH), hippocampal subfields volumes, and cognition between patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and non-hospitalized participants in a multi-site/multi-national cohort.

DesignOriginal investigation of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between 5/2020 and 10/2022 in 3 USA and 1 UK medical centers with follow-up at hospital discharge.

ParticipantsA total of 179 participants without a history of dementia completed cognitive, mood and other assessments and MRI scans.

ExposureCOVID-19 severity, as measured by hospitalization vs no hospitalization

Main Outcomes and Measures7T MRI scans were acquired. All WMH and hippocampal subfield volumes were corrected for intracranial volumes to account for subject variability. Cognition was assessed using a comprehensive battery of tests. Pearson correlations and unpaired t-tests were performed to assess correlations and differences between hospitalized and non-hospitalized groups.

ResultsWe found similar WMH volume (4112 vs 3144mm3, p=0.2131), smaller hippocampal volume (11856 vs 12227mm3, p=0.0497) and lower cognitive and memory performance, especially the MoCA score (24.9 vs 26.4 pts, p=0.0084), duration completing trail making test B (97.6 vs 79.4 seconds, p=0.0285), Craft immediate recall (12.6 vs 16.4 pts, p<0.0001), Craft delay recall (12.0 vs 15.6 pts, p=0.0001), and Benson figure copy (15.2 vs 16.1 pts, p=0.0078) in 52 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (19[37%] female; mean[SD] age, 61.1[7.4] years) compared with 111 age-matched non-hospitalized participants (66[59%] female; mean[SD] age, 61.5[8.4] years).

Conclusions and RelevanceOur results indicate that hospitalized COVID-19 cases show lower hippocampal volume when compared to non-hospitalized participants. We also show that WMH and hippocampal volumes correlate with worse cognitive scores in hospitalized patients compared with non-hospitalized participants, potentially indicating recent lesions and atrophy.

Key PointsQuestion: Do white matter hyperintensity burden, hippocampal whole and subfield volumes, and cognition differ between patients hospitalized with COVID-19 versus participants without hospitalization?

Findings: We found no significant difference in white matter hyperintensity volume, but hippocampal volume was reduced, and cognitive and memory performance were worse in those hospitalized for COVID-19 compared with age-matched non-hospitalized group (either mild COVID-19 or no COVID-19 reported). In the hospitalized group, increased white matter hyperintensity and reduced hippocampal volumes are significantly higher correlated with worse cognitive and memory scores.

Meaning: Adults hospitalized for COVID-19 had lower hippocampal volumes and worse cognitive performance than adults with COVID-19 that did not lead to hospitalization or without reported COVID-19 infection.","NA","medrxiv",1732140559758

This longevity discrepancy also extends to health and aging-larger dogs show higher rates of age-related diseases. Despite this well-established phenomenon, we still know little about the biomarkers and molecular mechanisms that might underlie breed differences in aging and survival. To address this gap, we generated an epigenetic clock using DNA methylation from over 3 million CpG sites in a deeply phenotyped cohort of 864 companion dogs from the Dog Aging Project, including some dogs sampled annually for 2-3 years. We found that the largest breed size tends to have epigenomes that are, on average, 0.37 years older per chronological year compared to the smallest breed size. We also found that higher residual epigenetic age was significantly associated with increased mortality risk, with dogs experiencing a 34% higher risk of death for each year increase in residual epigenetic age. These findings not only broaden our understanding of how aging manifests within a diverse species but also highlight the significant role that demographic factors play in modulating the biological mechanisms underlying aging. Additionally, they highlight the utility of DNA methylation as both a biomarker for healthspan-extending interventions, a mortality predictor, and a mechanism for understanding inter-individual variation in aging in dogs.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

This includes the recent circulation of H5N1 in dairy cattle herds in the USA and a rise in associated human cases. In this study, we investigated differences in tissue tropism of two HPAI H5N1 strains, the isolate A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (VN1203) isolated from a fatal human case in 2004 and the bovine isolate A/Bovine/Ohio/B24osu-342/2024 (Bov342) isolated in 2024, in C57BL/6J mice. Infection with either HPAI H5N1 isolate was uniformly lethal in mice. However, tissue tropism differed significantly: while VN1203 replication was largely restricted to the respiratory tract, Bov342 successfully replicated in the respiratory tract as well as various regions of the brain. Bov342-challenged animals exhibited clinical signs consistent with central nervous system (CNS) infection, and infectious virus was detected in brain tissue. Correspondingly, cytokine profiles in the brain differed significantly between the isolates. Notably, in addition to abundant evidence of CNS infection in Bov342-challenged mice via immunohistochemistry, sporadic intranuclear and intracytoplasmic immunoreactivity was observed in other tissues in the head, including the choroid plexus, retina, and inner ear. This study demonstrates that while both HPAI H5N1 isolates are uniformly lethal in C57BL/6J mice upon aerosol exposure, significant differences exist in tissue tropism, with Bov342 resulting in respiratory disease as well as increased neurotropism and inflammation in the brain and nasal turbinates compared to VN1203, which predominantly induces respiratory disease.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

While intracellular Ca2+ signalling has been shown to control cell migration in multiple cell contexts, it is unknown whether it is required for DVE migration. The pattern of Ca2+ activity in the mouse embryo at early peri-implantation stages is also unknown. Using the GCaMP6f Ca2+ reporter line we performed a detailed assessment of Ca2+ dynamics between E0.5 - E5.5 using live imaging. We find that prior to implantation, Ca2+ transients are rare, but at E5.5 widespread, periodic, Ca2+ transients in extra-embryonic tissues can be observed, including in the VE and ExE. In contrast, cells of the E5.5 epiblast remain relatively quiescent but show sporadic large-scale multi-cellular waves. Inhibition of SERCA at E5.5 abolishes Ca2+ transients and leads to DVE arrest, indicative that these transients are required for axial patterning. Together these results reveal the pattern of Ca2+ handling in the early mouse embryo and a novel requirement in anterior-posterior axis formation.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

This method combines enzymatic in situ polyadenylation of both bacterial and host RNA with spatial RNA-sequencing. Application of this method in a mouse model of intestinal neoplasia revealed the biogeography of the mouse gut microbiome as function of location in the intestine, frequent strong inter-microbial interactions at short length scales, shaping of local microbiome niches by the host, and tumor-associated changes in the architecture of the host-microbiome interface.

Here, we present a framework for the identification and validation of tumor-reactive T cells as a biomarker to quantify ICI efficacy and as candidates for a personalized TCR-T cell therapy. Therefore, we profiled a pediatric malignant rhabdoid tumor patient with complete remission after ICI therapy using deep single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the peripheral blood. Specifically, we tracked T cell dynamics longitudinally from the tumor to cells in circulating over a time course of 12 months, revealing a systemic response and durable clonal expansion of tumor-resident and ICI-induced TCR clonotypes. We functionally validated tumor reactivity of TCRs identified from the TME and the blood by co-culturing patient-derived tumor cells with TCR-engineered autologous T cells. Here, we observed unexpectedly high frequencies of tumor-reactive TCR clonotypes in the TME and confirmed T cell dynamics in the blood post-ICI to predict tumor-reactivity. These findings strongly support spatio-temporal tracking of T cell activity in response to ICI to inform therapy efficacy and to serve as a source of tumor-reactive TCRs for personalized TCR-T designs.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

Multiple cave-dwelling populations of the Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, have converged on sleep loss compared to river dwelling surface fish. However, the extent to which sleep has been lost across cave populations, and whether sleep loss occurs in wild fish, is poorly understood. We have measured sleep and locomotor activity in 15 distinct populations of A. mexicanus representing multiple lineages that are broadly representative of the 34 cavefish populations identified to date. Strikingly, sleep was largely lost in all cave and hybrid populations that were tested. Hybrid populations retained intermediate eye and pigmentation phenotypes, suggesting sleep loss precedes cave-associated morphological changes. Mapping behavioral changes onto the phylogeny of A. mexicanus populations revealed that independent loss of sleep and elevated locomotor activity has occurred at least three times. Analysis of sleep in the wild confirms that the sleep loss phenotype observed in lab-reared fish is also present in the natural environment. Together, these findings reveal deep evolutionary convergence on sleep loss in cavefish and provide evidence for sleep loss as a primary trait contributing to cave adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

However, the specific mechanisms by which viral proteins influence cholesterol remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cholesterol sequestration within lysosomes, with the viral protein ORF3a identified as the primary driver of this effect. Mechanistically, we found that ORF3a interacts directly with the HOPS complex subunit VPS39 through a hydrophobic interface formed by residues W193 and Y184. A W193A mutation in ORF3a significantly rescues cholesterol egress and corrects the mislocalization of the lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC2, which is caused by defective trafficking of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) sorting receptor, the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). We further observed a marked reduction in bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a lipid essential for lysosomal cholesterol egress, in both SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and ORF3a-expressing cells, suggesting BMP reduction as an additional mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-caused cholesterol sequestration. Inhibition of lysosomal cholesterol egress using the compound U18666A significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting a potential viral strategy of manipulating lysosomal cholesterol to modulate host cell susceptibility. Our findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a disrupts cellular cholesterol transport by altering lysosomal protein trafficking and BMP levels, providing new insights into virus-host interactions that contribute to lipid dysregulation in infected cells.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

Clair3-RNA leverages the strengths of the Clair series pipelines and incorporates several techniques optimized for lrRNA-seq data, such as uneven coverage normalization, refinement of training materials, editing site discovery, and the incorporation of phasing haplotype to enhance variant-calling performance. Clair3-RNA is available for various platforms, including PacBio and ONT complementary DNA sequencing (cDNA), and ONT direct RNA sequencing (dRNA). Our results demonstrated that Clair3-RNA achieved a ~91% SNP F1-score on the ONT platform using the latest ONT SQK-RNA004 kit (dRNA004) and a ~92% SNP F1-score in PacBio Iso-Seq and MAS-Seq for variants supported by at least four reads. The performance reached a ~95% and ~96% F1-score for ONT and PacBio, respectively, with at least ten supporting reads and disregarding the zygosity.

Despite considerable progress in physics-based methods for peptide design and deep-learning methods for protein design, there are currently no robust approaches for de novo design of protein-binding macrocycles. Here, we introduce RFpeptides, a denoising diffusion-based pipeline for designing macrocyclic peptide binders against protein targets of interest. We test 20 or fewer designed macrocycles against each of four diverse proteins and obtain medium to high-affinity binders against all selected targets. Designs against MCL1 and MDM2 demonstrate KD between 1-10 uM, and the best anti-GABARAP macrocycle binds with a KD of 6 nM and a sub-nanomolar IC50 in vitro. For one of the targets, RbtA, we obtain a high-affinity binder with KD < 10 nM despite starting from the target sequence alone due to the lack of an experimentally determined target structure. X-ray structures determined for macrocycle-bound MCL1, GABARAP, and RbtA complexes match very closely with the computational design models (RMSD < 2 [A]). In contrast to library screening approaches for which determining binding mode can be a major bottleneck, the binding modes of RFpeptides-generated macrocycles are known by design, which should greatly facilitate downstream optimization. RFpeptides thus provides a powerful framework for rapid and custom design of macrocyclic peptides for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

Representation learning methods summarize high-dimensional single-cell data into a manageable latent space in a typically nonlinear fashion, allowing cross-sample integration or generative modeling. However, these methods often produce entangled representations, limiting interpretability and downstream analyses. Existing disentanglement methods instead either require supervised information or impose sparsity and linearity, which may not capture the complexity of biological data. We, therefore, introduce Disentangled Representation Variational Inference (DRVI), an unsupervised deep generative model that learns nonlinear, disentangled representations of single-cell omics. This is achieved by combining recently introduced additive decoders with nonlinear pooling, for which we theoretically prove disentanglement under reasonable assumptions. We validate DRVIs disentanglement capabilities across diverse relevant biological problems, from development to perturbational studies and cell atlases, decomposing, for example, the Human Lung Cell Atlas into meaningful, interpretable latent dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that if applied to batch integration, DRVIs integration quality does not suffer from the disentanglement constraints and instead is on par with entangled integration methods. With its disentangled latent space, DRVI is inherently interpretable and facilitates the identification of rare cell types, provides novel insights into cellular heterogeneity beyond traditional cell types, and highlights developmental stages.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

No obvious signatures of attractor dynamics were detected. Rather, olfactory discrimination training selectively enhanced the separation of neural manifolds representing task-relevant odors from other representations, consistent with predictions of autoassociative network models endowed with precise synaptic balance. Analytical approaches using the framework of manifold capacity revealed multiple geometrical modifications of representational manifolds that supported the classification of task-relevant sensory information. Manifold capacity predicted odor discrimination across individuals, indicating a close link between manifold geometry and behavior. Hence, pDp and possibly related recurrent networks store information in the geometry of representational manifolds, resulting in joint sensory and semantic maps that may support distributed learning processes.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

Endothelial cells (ECs) of the BBB are enwrapped by mural cells including pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) that regulate angiogenesis, vessel stability and barrier function. To explore mural cell control of the BBB, we investigated neurovascular phenotypes in zebrafish pdgfrb mutants that lack brain pericytes and vSMCs. As expected, mutants showed an altered cerebrovascular network with mis-patterned capillaries. Unexpectedly, mutants displayed no BBB leakage from larval through to young adult stages. This demonstrates that pericytes and vSMCs do not control BBB function in young zebrafish. Instead, we observed adult BBB disruption occurring at ""hotspot"" focal haemorrhages at major vessel aneurysms. ECs at leakage hotspots showed induction of caveolae on abluminal surfaces and major structural defects including basement membrane thickening and disruption. Our work suggests that capillary pericytes regulate cerebrovascular patterning in development and vSMCs of major arteries protect from haemorrhage and BBB breakdown in older zebrafish. The fact that young zebrafish can have a conserved BBB with intact barrier function in the absence of mural cells, warrants renewed interrogation of the paradigm of mural cell control of the BBB.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

Biochemical large language models have transformed the interpretation of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, but have not yet had a comparable impact on understanding small molecule metabolism. Here, we present an approach that leverages chemical language models to discover previously uncharacterized metabolites. We introduce DeepMet, a chemical language model that learns the latent biosynthetic logic embedded within the structures of known metabolites and exploits this understanding to anticipate the existence of as-of-yet undiscovered metabolites. Prospective chemical synthesis of metabolites predicted to exist by DeepMet directs their targeted discovery. Integrating DeepMet with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data enables automated metabolite discovery within complex tissues.

The presence of spectrally broad ('white') light is therefore the exclusive remit of the visual foreground. However, if and how aquatic visual systems exploit this 'white effect' as an inductive bias, for example to judge distance, remains unknown. By combining two-photon imaging with hyperspectral stimulation, genetic cone-type ablation, and behaviour, we here show that zebrafish suppress neural responses to the visual background by contrasting 'greyscale' and 'colour' circuits that emerge at the first synapse of vision. To do so, zebrafish use an early retinal architecture that fundamentally differs from that of mammals: Rather than combining cone signals to drive the retinal output leading to behaviour, zebrafish vision is built around competing ancestral cone systems: Red/UV versus green/blue. Of these, the non-opponent red and UV cones, which are retained in mammals, are necessary and sufficient for vision. By contrast, the colour opponent green and blue cones, which are lost in mammals, form a net-suppressive 'auxiliary' system that shape the 'core' drive from red and UV cones. Our insights challenge the long-held notions that cones act in concert to drive visual behaviour, and that their spectral diversity primarily serves colour vision. Instead, we posit that vertebrate vision is ancestrally built upon opposing cone systems that emerged to exploit the strong spectral interactions of light with water. This alternative view points at terrestrialisation, not nocturnalisation, as the leading driver for visual circuit reorganisation in mammals.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

Participants received 5 or 10 mg / week of compounded rapamycin, or placebo for 48 weeks. Safety, adverse events (AEs) and blood biomarkers were collected. Efficacy was assessed using DEXA scan-based measures and standardized surveys assessing quality of life (QoL) and frailty. We did not detect significant differences in safety blood biomarkers, or moderate to severe AEs between the rapamycin treatment groups and placebo after 48 weeks. We detected dose-dependent (10 mg group) and sex-specific improvements in lean tissue mass, pain, social functioning, overall QoL, and overall osteoarthritis score in females, and in bone mineral content in men. Additionally, some individuals receiving rapamycin experienced significant improvements in body composition metrics that were associated with beneficial changes in gut health and lipid metabolism. We conclude that low-dose, intermittent rapamycin administration over the course of 48 weeks is safe and induces sex-specific improvements in multiple aspects of healthspan, with the most robust improvements in lean tissue mass in women taking 10 mg rapamycin/week.

We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024.

The present study investigated the composition of DOM in cryoconite holes using reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. We evaluated various solvent combinations of water, methanol, and acetonitrile to extract chemically diverse polar and non-polar metabolites from the cryoconite holes. Among the single solvents, organic-rich MeOH: Water (70:30 v/v) and in parallel 2-single solvent combinations of MeOH: Water (70:30 v/v) and Acetonitrile: Methanol: Water (40:40:20 v/v) provided increased number and chemical diversity of extracted metabolites. Combining RP with the hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) technique provided the highest number of unique metabolites. This dual-LC and ionization polarity combination increased the detection of metabolic features by 46.96% and 24.52% in single- and two-solvent combinations compared to RP alone.

Studying whole genomes, we make three contributions in this respect, with a particular focus on regions with low pLDDT values. First, we use 3D packing properties to encode a structure into a distribution amenable to comparisons using optimal transport. Summarizing this distribution using two numbers yields an informative 2D embedding, the arity map, which summarizes structural elements in all predictions. Second, we establish a clear correlation between the number of homologs of a protein sequence in UniProtKB, and the quality of its prediction, possibly hinting at the learning biases incurred by AlphaFold. Third, we show that certain regions of the arity map are connected with poor quality structures: proteins rich in false positive intrinsically disordered regions. The arity map thus also provides a way for detecting prediction errors that the pLDDT cannot detect.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

Our integration study unexpectedly reveals two distinct apCAF lineages present in most cancer types: one associated with mesothelial-like cells and the other with fibrocytes. Using a high-resolution single-cell spatial imaging platform, we characterize the spatial niches of these apCAF lineages. We find that mesothelial-like apCAFs are located near cancer cells, while fibrocyte-like apCAFs are associated with tertiary lymphoid structures. Additionally, we discover that both apCAF lineages can up-regulate the secreted protein SPP1, which facilitates primary tumor formation and peritoneal metastasis. Taken together, this study offers an unprecedented resolution in analyzing apCAF lineages and their spatial niches.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

Comprehensive studies are needed to assess its transmission dynamics and clinical presentation.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective observational cohort study at Kamituga General Hospital in South Kivu, DRC, between May 2 and October 9, 2024. Sociodemographic, exposure and clinical data were collected from mpox suspected cases. Cases confirmed by Xpert(R) Mpox PCR were presumed Clade Ib infections (awaiting Clade confirmation) and followed through hospitalization and on days 29 and 59 post-diagnosis to assess clinical progression and outcomes.

FindingsOf 511 included suspected cases, 431 (84%) tested PCR positive; with 205 being women (47%). Age distribution was bimodal, with 279 (65%) individuals aged 15-34 years, and 63 (15%) children under five. Most cases (59%) reported contact with a suspected or confirmed mpox case; among adults, this was primarily a spouse, colleague or sexual partner, while for children, the primary contacts were parents or siblings. Comorbidities were rare (4%), including six (1%) HIV infections. Prodromal symptoms were present in 346 (88%) patients, active skin lesions in 414 (96%), mucosal lesions in 338 (82%), and lymphadenopathy in 295 (71%). In adults, lesions were more concentrated in the genital area, with 90% of adults presenting lesions in this region. In contrast, only 39% of children had genital lesions, with lesions more frequently found elsewhere on the body. Among 427 hospitalized patients, two deaths (0{middle dot}5%) occurred. Among 315 patients with detailed hospital follow-up, complications were primarily genito-urinary (55%) or cutaneous (40%). Four of six pregnant women with recorded outcome (67%) had adverse pregnancy outcomes. Significant sequelae at days 29 and 59 were rare.

InterpretationClade Ib MPXV infections presented differently from previously reported Clade Ia and Clade IIb infections. In adults, the disease primarily affected the genito-urinary system, compatible with sexual transmission, while children mostly manifested extragenital lesions.

This study introduces a versatile molecular detection toolbox (C12a) for antibiotic resistance gene markers using CRISPR/Cas12a coupled to PCR. Our toolbox can detect less than 3x10-7 ng of DNA (100 attoMolar) or 102 CFU/mL. High concordance was observed when comparing the C12a toolbox with sequenced genomes and antibiotic susceptibility tests for the blaCTX-M-15 and floR antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which confer resistance to cefotaxime and other {beta}-lactams, and amphenicols, respectively. C12aINT, designed to detect the Integrase 1 gene, confirmed a high prevalence of the integrase/integron system in E. coli containing multiple ARGs. The C12a toolbox was tested across a wide range of laboratory infrastructure including a portable setup. When combined with lateral flow assays (LFA), C12a exhibited competitive performance, making it a promising solution for on-site ARG detection.

Unfortunately, intrinsic or acquired resistance, often causing therapy discontinuation, is frequently caused by mutations in the kinase therapeutic target. The advent of clinical tumor sequencing has opened additional opportunities for precision oncology to improve patient outcomes by pairing optimal therapies with tumor mutation profiles. However, modern precision oncology efforts are hindered by lack of sufficient biochemical or clinical evidence to classify each mutation as resistant or sensitive to existing inhibitors. Structure-based methods show promising accuracy in retrospective benchmarks at predicting whether a kinase mutation will perturb inhibitor binding, but comparisons are made by pooling disparate experimental measurements across different conditions. We present the first prospective benchmark of structure-based approaches on a blinded dataset of in-cell kinase inhibitor affinities to Abl kinase mutants using a NanoBRET reporter assay. We compare NanoBRET results to structure-based methods and their ability to estimate the impact of mutations on inhibitor binding (measured as {Delta}{Delta}G). Comparing physics-based simulations, Rosetta, and previous machine learning models, we find that structure-based methods accurately classify kinase mutations as inhibitor-resistant or inhibitor-sensitizing, and each approach has a similar degree of accuracy. We find that physics-based simulations are best suited to estimate {Delta}{Delta}G of mutations that are distal to the kinase active site. To probe modes of failure, we investigate two clinically significant mutations poorly predicted by our methods, T315A and L298F, and find that starting configurations and protonation states significantly alter the accuracy of our predictions. Our experimental and computational measurements provide a benchmark for estimating the impact of mutations on inhibitor binding affinity for future methods and structure-based models. These structure-based methods have potential utility in identifying optimal therapies for tumor-specific mutations, predicting resistance mutations in the absence of clinical data, and identifying potential sensitizing mutations to established inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

In neuroscience, this translates into how the brain anatomy shapes brain dynamics. From neuroanatomy, the topology of the mammalian brain can be approximated by local connectivity, accurately described by an exponential distance rule (EDR). The compact, folded geometry of the cortex is shaped by this local connectivity and the geometric harmonic modes can reconstruct much of the functional dynamics. However, this ignores the fundamental role of the rare long-range cortical connections, crucial for improving information processing in the mammalian brain, but not captured by local cortical folding and geometry. Here we show the superiority of harmonic modes combining rare long-range connectivity with EDR (EDR+LR) in capturing functional dynamics (specifically long-range functional connectivity and task-evoked brain activity) compared to geometry and EDR representations. Importantly, the orchestration of dynamics is carried out by a more efficient manifold made up of a low number of fundamental EDR+LR modes. Our results show the importance of rare long-range connectivity for capturing the complexity of functional brain activity through a low-dimensional manifold shaped by fundamental EDR+LR modes.

Significance StatementExplaining how structure of the brain gives rise to its emerging dynamics is a primary pursuit in neuroscience. We describe a fundamental anatomical constraint that emphasises the key role of rare long-range connections in explaining functional organisation of the brain in terms of spontaneous and task-evoked activity. Specifically, this constraint unifies brain geometry and local connectivity through the Exponential Distance Rule while considering the long-range exceptions to this local connectivity as derived from the structural connectome. In addition, when using this structural information, we show that the task-evoked brain activity is described by a low-dimensional manifold of several modes suggesting that less is more for the efficient information processing in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

This is a challenging task as such states must be sufficiently strained to be poorly populated, but not so strained that they are not populated at all, and because protein design methods have generally focused on creating near-ideal structures4-7.

Recently, we proposed that recombination suppression may evolve in sex chromosomes simply because of the presence of recessive deleterious mutations within genomes. Specifically, we demonstrated that chromosomal inversions suppressing recombination and carrying by chance fewer deleterious mutations than average have a selective advantage. In addition, we showed that the permanent heterozygosity of Y-like sex chromosomes facilitates the fixation of these less-loaded inversions by a sheltering effect, i.e., by preventing the expression of recessive deleterious mutations in a homozygous state when they increase in frequency. In contrast, similar less-loaded inversions in autosomes suffer from a disadvantage in the homozygous state as their frequency increases, preventing their fixation. However, the methodology and significance of our previous study have been questioned. Here, we present new analyses that further reinforce our original claims, demonstrating that the lower-load advantage and the sheltering effect can explain the fixation of inversions on sex chromosomes over a broad range of parameter values. We show that these mechanisms promote the fixation of inversions on Y-like chromosomes at rates exceeding those expected under drift alone. We used, as a control, autosomes with a similar population size as the Y chromosome, which, we argue, provides the appropriate neutral control for the sheltering effect. We also address criticisms regarding our focus on inversions surviving the first 20 generations in a figure of our previous study, and show that these criticisms stemmed from a misunderstanding of what this figure was intended to illustrate. Including all inversions, even those that went extinct within 20 generations, does not alter our conclusions. Overall, the present study offers new support for our theory based on the combination of lower-load advantage and sheltering effect, and addresses the questions about its significance and range of applicability.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b exhibits tropism for the mammary gland, with milk from infected cows containing high levels of viral RNA and infectious virus. The viruss ability to infect the mammary gland suggests potential risks of transmission to offspring through breastfeeding. Here, we show that mammary gland infection with bovine H5N1 influenza in lactating ferrets transmits virus and disease to suckling kits. Viral RNA titers significantly increased in milk over time and remained high in mammary gland tissue. Suckling kits had significantly increased viral RNA in the oral and nasal cavity, as well as in feces. However, viral detection in the dam nasal cavities was delayed, with only minimal virus present in the oral cavity. Lung viral RNA levels were low in dams but high in a sampled suckling kit. Additionally, we detected the expression of the H5N1 receptor, 2,3 sialic acid, in mammary tissue from both ferrets and humans. These data demonstrate that H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b infection in lactating dams leads to mastitis-related disease and transmits to suckling pups, resulting in 100% mortality among the neonates.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

Here, we introduce a method for efficient, dynamic imaging of contrast agents and reporter genes in 3D using multiplexed matrix array transducers. Our ""Takoyaki"" pulse sequence uses the simultaneous scanning of multiple focal points to excite contrast agents with sufficient acoustic pressure for nonlinear imaging while efficiently covering 3D space. Through in vitro experiments, we first show that the Takoyaki sequence produces highly sensitive volume images of gas vesicle contrast agents and compare its performance with alternative imaging schemes. We then establish its utility in cellular imaging in vivo by visualizing acoustic reporter gene-expressing tumors in a mouse model of glioblastoma. Finally, we demonstrate real-time volumetric imaging by tracking the dynamics of fluid motion in brain ventricles after intraventricular contrast injection. Takoyaki imaging enables a more comprehensive understanding of biological processes by providing spatiotemporal information in 3D within the constraints of accessible multiplexed matrix array systems.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

As viruses engage in a wide range of interactions with their hosts, it is essential to study bat viruses in a system that resembles their natural environment like bat-derived in vitro cellular models. However, stable and accessible bat cell lines are not widely available for the broader scientific community. Here, we generated in vitro reagents for the Seba's short-tailed bat (Carollia perspicillata), tested multiple methods of immortalization, and characterized their susceptibility to virus infection and response to immune stimulation. Using a pseudotyped virus library and authentic virus infections, we show that these C. perspicillata cell lines derived from a diverse array of tissues are susceptible to viruses bearing the glycoprotein of numerous orthohantaviruses, including Andes and Hantaan virus and are also susceptible to live hantavirus infection. Furthermore, stimulation with synthetic double-stranded RNA prior to infection with VSV and MERS-CoV induced a protective antiviral response, demonstrating the suitability of our cell lines to study the bat antiviral immune response. Taken together, the approaches outlined here will inform future efforts to develop in vitro tools for virology from non-model organisms and these C. perspicillata cell lines will enable studies on virus-host interactions in bats.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

Recent studies have suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection can lead to reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), yet, the extent and impact of viral reactivation in COVID-19 and its effect on the host immune system remain incompletely understood.

Here we present a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of viral reactivation of all known chronically infecting viruses in 1,154 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study, who were followed prospectively for twelve months. We reveal significant reactivation of Herpesviridae, Enteroviridae, and Anelloviridae families during acute stage of COVID-19 (0-40 days post- hospitalization), each exhibiting distinct temporal dynamics. We also show that viral reactivation correlated with COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes, including mortality. Integration of cytokine profiling, cellular immunophenotyping, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics demonstrated virus-specific host responses, including elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, CXCL10, and TNF), increased activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and upregulation of cellular replication genes, independent of COVID-19 severity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Notably, persistent Anelloviridae reactivation during convalescence ([&ge;]3 months post-hospitalization) was associated with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptoms, particularly physical function and fatigue.

Our findings highlight a remarkable prevalence and potential impact of chronic viral reactivation on host responses and clinical outcomes during acute COVID-19 and long term PASC sequelae.

In particular, plague has been linked to population declines in Late Neolithic Europe3,4. Although plague is amongst the most devastating diseases in human history, early strains of Yersinia pestis, the causal agent of plague, lack virulence factors required for the bubonic form5, and their severity remains unclear. Here, we describe the oldest strains of plague reported so far, associated with two early phases of outbreaks among prehistoric hunter-gatherers in the Lake Baikal region in East Siberia, beginning from [~]5600-5400 years ago (cal. BP). These outbreaks occur across four hunter-gatherer cemeteries; the largest of these (Ust-Ida I) has a 38.7% detection rate for plague infection (39% detection across all sites). By reconstructing kinship pedigrees, we show that small familial groups are affected, consistent with human-to-human spread of the disease, and the first outbreak occurred within a single generation. Intriguingly, the infections appear to have resulted in acute mortality events, especially among children. Zoonotic transmission is separately indicated by a Brucella infection in one of the children. Interestingly, we see differences in functional genomic variants in the prehistoric plague strains, including in the ypm superantigen known from Y. pseudotuberculosis today. The new strains diverge ancestrally to all known Y. pestis diversity and push back the Y. pestis divergence from Y. pseudotuberculosis by some 2000 years6. Our results show that plague outbreaks happen earlier than previously thought and that these early outbreaks were indeed lethal. The findings challenge the common notion that high population densities and lifestyle changes during the Neolithic transition were prerequisites for plague epidemics.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

In the context of natural selection analyses, specifically codon evolutionary models, excessive rates of false positives result. A characteristic signature of error-driven findings is unrealistically high estimates of dN/dS (e.g., >100), affecting only a small fraction (e.g., [~]0.1%) of the alignment. Despite the widespread use of codon models to assess alignment quality, their potential for error correction remains unexplored. We present BUSTED-E: a novel method designed to detect positive selection while concurrently identifying alignment errors. This method is a straightforward adaptation of the BUSTED flexible branch-site random effects model used to fit distributions of dN/dS, with an important modification: it integrates an ""error-sink"" component representing an abiological evolutionary regime (dN/dS > 100), and provides the option for masking errors in the MSA for downstream analyses. Statistical performance of BUSTED-E on data simulated without errors shows that there is a small loss of power, which can be mitigated by model averaged inference. Using four published empirical datasets, we show BUSTED-E reduces unrealistic rates of positive selection detection, often by an order of magnitude, and improves biological interpretability of results. BUSTED-E also detects errors that are largely distinct from other popular alignment cleaning tools (HMMCleaner and BMGE). Overall, BUSTED-E is a robust and scalable solution for improving the accuracy of evolutionary analyses in the presence of residual alignment errors, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of natural selection and adaptive evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

Here, we expand the capabilities of LLMs for science by introducing the Virtual Lab, an AI-human research collaboration to perform sophisticated, interdisciplinary science research. The Virtual Lab consists of an LLM principal investigator agent guiding a team of LLM agents with different scientific backgrounds (e.g., a chemist agent, a computer scientist agent, a critic agent), with a human researcher providing high-level feedback. We design the Virtual Lab to conduct scientific research through a series of team meetings, where all the agents discuss a scientific agenda, and individual meetings, where an agent accomplishes a specific task. We demonstrate the power of the Virtual Lab by applying it to design nanobody binders to recent variants of SARS-CoV-2, which is a challenging, open-ended research problem that requires reasoning across diverse fields from biology to computer science. The Virtual Lab creates a novel computational nanobody design pipeline that incorporates ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta and designs 92 new nanobodies. Experimental validation of those designs reveals a range of functional nanobodies with promising binding profiles across SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Acute inhibition of ATR with ATR inhibitor (ATRi) triggers a surge in origin firing, leading to increased levels of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that rapidly deplete all available RPA. This leaves ssDNA unprotected and susceptible to breakage, a phenomenon known as replication catastrophe. However, the mechanism by which unprotected ssDNA breaks remains unclear. Here, we reveal that APOBEC3B is the key enzyme targeting unprotected ssDNA at replication forks, triggering a reaction cascade that induces fork collapse and PARP1 hyperactivation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that uracils generated by APOBEC3B at replication forks are removed by UNG2, creating abasic sites that are subsequently cleaved by APE1 endonuclease. Moreover, we demonstrate that APE1-mediated DNA cleavage is the critical enzymatic step for PARP1 trapping and hyperactivation in cells, regardless of how abasic sites are generated on DNA. Finally, we show that APOBEC3B-induced toxic PARP1 trapping in response to ATRi drives cell sensitivity to ATR inhibition, creating to a context of synthetic lethality when combined with PARP inhibitors. Together, these findings reveal the mechanisms that cause replication forks to break during replication catastrophe and explain why ATRi-treated cells are particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

They play a vital role in maintaining ecological equilibrium and promoting the health of their hosts. Consequently, understanding the strain diversity within microbial communities is crucial, as variations between strains can lead to distinct phenotypic expressions or diverse biological functions. However, current methods for taxonomic classification from metagenomic sequencing data have several limitations, including their reliance solely on species resolution, support for either short or long reads, or their confinement to a given single species. Most notably, the majority of existing taxonomic classifiers rely solely on a single linear representative genome as a reference, which fails to capture the strain diversity, thereby introducing single-reference biases.

PanTax provides a comprehensive solution to taxonomic classification for strain resolution, compatibility with both short and long reads, and compatibility with single or multiple species.

Human skin undergoes both chronological aging and environmental degradation, particularly UV-induced photoaging. Detrimental structural and physiological changes caused by aging include epidermal thinning due to stem cell depletion and dermal atrophy associated with decreased collagen production. Here, we present a comprehensive single-cell atlas of skin aging, analyzing samples from young, middle-aged, and elderly individuals, including both sun-exposed and sun-protected areas. This atlas reveals age-related cellular composition and function changes across various skin cell types, including epidermal stem cells, fibroblasts, hair follicles, and endothelial cells. Using our atlas, we have identified basal stem cells as a highly variable population across aging, more so than other skin cell populations such as fibroblasts. In basal stem cells, we identified ATF3 as a novel regulator of skin aging. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor for genes involved in the aging process, with its expression reduced by 20% during aging. Based on this discovery, we have developed an innovative mRNA-based treatment to mitigate the effects of skin aging. Cell senescence decreased 25% in skin cells treated with ATF3 mRNA, and we observed an over 20% increase in proliferation in treated basal stem cells. Importantly, we also found crosstalk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts as a critical component of therapeutic interventions, with ATF3 rescue of basal cells significantly enhancing fibroblast collagen production by approximately 200%. We conclude that ATF3-targeted mRNA treatment effectively reverses the effects of skin aging by modulating specific cellular mechanisms, offering a novel, targeted approach to human skin rejuvenation.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

To address this, we present a comprehensive assessment of tissue changes occurring during human aging, utilizing a vast array of whole slide histopathological images from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx). We analyzed 25,712 images from 40 distinct tissue types across 983 individuals, applying deep learning to quantify the nuanced morphological changes that tissues undergo with age.

We developed  tissue clocks--predictors of biological age based on tissue images--which achieved a mean prediction error of 4.9 years and were associated with telomere attrition, the incidence of subclinical pathologies, and comorbidities. In a systematic assessment of biological age rates across organs, we identified pervasive non-uniform rates of aging across the human lifespan, with some organs exhibiting earlier changes (20-40 years old) and others showing bimodal patterns of age-related changes. We also uncovered several associations between demographic, lifestyle, and medical history factors and tissue-specific acceleration or deceleration of biological age, highlighting potential modifiable risk factors that influenced the aging process at the tissue level. Finally, by combining paired histological images and gene expression data, we developed a strategy to predict tissue-specific age gaps from blood samples. This approach was validated in external cohorts of both healthy individuals and those with chronic diseases, revealing the organs most differentially affected by aging in disease contexts.

This work offers a new perspective on the aging process by positioning tissue structure as an integrator of cellular and molecular changes that reflect the physiological state of organs. These findings underscore the value of histopathological imaging as a tool for understanding human aging and provide a foundation for the exploration of tissue-specific aging processes in age-associated diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

Yet, the role of the nervous system in disease pathogenesis has not received much attention. Herein, we demonstrate that allergen exposure evokes pain-like behavior in association with increased nociceptor signaling and transcriptional responses in dorsal root ganglia. NaV1.8+ sensory nerves were found traveling along the length of the esophagus, organized in distinct bundles adjacent to the basal epithelium, with beta III-tubulin+ sensory nerves distributed more distal to the lumen. Targeted deletion of Il4ra in NaV1.8+ neurons impeded allergen-induced increases in nerve innervation density. Furthermore, Il4ra-/-NaV1.8 mice had diminished allergen-induced allergic inflammation in the esophagus including eosinophilia and transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. Translational studies revealed extensive myelinated nerve innervation in the human esophagus, which was increased in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis. Taken together, these data indicate that allergic inflammation is associated with an increase in non-evoked pain, esophageal nerve density, altered sensitivity of sensory neurons, and transcriptional changes in dorsal root ganglia. These finding identify a type 2 neuroimmune circuit that involves the interplay of allergen-induced IL-4 receptor-dependent DRG responses that modify esophageal end-organ inflammatory responses.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

While improvements have been made, high-coverage long-read sequencing is associated with higher costs and input DNA requirements. To decrease the cost one can lower the sequence coverage, but the current long-read SV callers perform poorly with coverage below 10X. Synthetic long-read (SLR) technologies hold great potential for structural variant (SV) detection, although utilizing their long-range information for events smaller than 50 kbp has been challenging. Results: In this work, we propose a hybrid novel integrated alignment- and local-assembly-based algorithm, Blackbird, that uses SLR together with low-coverage long reads to improve SV detection and assembly. Without the need for a computationally expensive whole genome assembly, Blackbird uses a sliding window approach and barcode information encoded in SLR to accurately assemble small segments and use long reads for an improved gap closing and contig assembly. We evaluated Blackbird on simulated and real human genome datasets. Using the HG002 GIAB benchmark set, we demonstrated that in hybrid mode, Blackbird demonstrated results comparable to state-of-the-art long-read tools, while using less long-read coverage. Blackbird requires only 5X coverage to achieve F1 scores (0.835 and 0.808 for deletions and insertions) similar to PBSV (0.856 and 0.812) and Sniffles2 (0.839 and 0.804) using 10X Pacbio Hi-Fi long-read coverage.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

However, this integration remains challenging due to the fragmented landscape of current methodologies, which often require programming experience or bioinformatics expertise. Moreover, existing approaches are limited in their ability to accommodate unidentified metabolites, resulting in the exclusion of a significant portion of data from untargeted metabolomics experiments. Here, we introduce iModMix, a novel approach that uses a graphical lasso to construct network modules for integration and analysis of multi-omics data. iModMix uses a horizontal integration strategy, allowing metabolomics data to be analyzed alongside proteomics or transcriptomics to explore complex molecular associations within biological systems. Importantly, it can incorporate both annotated and unidentified metabolites, addressing a key limitation of existing methodologies. iModMix is available as a user-friendly R Shiny application that requires no programming experience (https://imodmix.moffitt.org), and it includes example data from several publicly available multi-omic studies for exploration.

However, null space theory makes the counter-intuitive prediction that neurons often generate spikes not to cause behavior, but to prevent the effects that other neurons would have on behavior. What is missing is a direct way to test this theory in the brain. Here, we found that in the marmoset cerebellum, spike-triggered averaging identified a potent vector unique to each Purkinje cell (P-cell) along which the spikes of that cell displaced the eyes. Yet, the P-cells were active not just for saccades along their potent vector, but for all saccades. Simultaneous recordings revealed that two spikes in two different P-cells produced superposition of their potent vectors. The result was a population activity in which the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. But why was one neuron producing spikes that would be canceled by another neuron? To answer this question, we recorded from the mossy fiber inputs and the interneurons in the molecular layer. We found that the mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands as well as the sensory goal of the movement, then the interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P-cells as a population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped. Because this output had faster dynamics than was present in the individual neurons, the cerebellum placed the cells in subtractive competition with each other such that the downstream effects of spiking in one neuron were partially or completely eliminated because of the spiking in another neuron.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559758

We show here that the continued spread between farms could be explained by the rapid pace of pathogen spread reported within farms, which greatly limits the potential effectiveness of these recommendations. Under reasonable surveillance strategies, we show that the time farms have to mobilize interventions is extremely limited, as few as a couple days and typically less than a week. Our findings suggest that passive surveillance measures, such as detection of H5N1 via weekly bulk milk testing, comes too late such that most infections have already occurred. For current interventions to be valuable, more sensitive and extensive surveillance is needed and an emphasis should be placed on biosecurity practices rather than reactive practices.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559759

While human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived organoids are valuable models for studying human organ function, they often lack critical tissue-resident immune cells. Here, we introduce an advanced human heart assembloid model, termed hHMA (human heart-macrophage assembloid), which fully integrates autologous cardiac tissue-resident macrophages (MPs) with pre-existing human heart organoids (hHOs). Through multi-omic analyses, we confirmed that these MPs are phenotypically similar to embryonic cardiac tissue-resident MPs and remain viable in the assembloids over time. The inclusion of MPs significantly impacts hHMA development, influencing cardiac cellular composition, boosting cellular communication, remodeling the extracellular matrix, promoting ventricular morphogenesis, and enhancing sarcomeric maturation. Our findings indicate that MPs contribute to homeostasis via efferocytosis, integrate into the cardiomyocyte electrical system, and support catabolic metabolism. To demonstrate the versatility of this model, we developed a platform to study cardiac arrhythmias by chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory factors linked to arrhythmogenesis in clinical settings, successfully replicating key features of inflammasome-mediated atrial fibrillation. Overall, this work introduces a robust platform for examining the role of immune cells in cardiac development, disease mechanisms, and drug discovery, bridging the gap between in vitro models and human physiology. These findings offer insights into cardiogenesis and inflammation-driven heart disease, positioning the hHMA system as an invaluable tool for future cardiovascular research and therapeutic development.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559759

The transition from OPC to oligodendrocyte involves a complex cascade of molecular and morphological states that position the cell to make a fate decision to integrate as a myelinating oligodendrocyte or die through apoptosis. Oligodendrocyte maturation impacts the cell death mechanisms that occur in degenerative conditions, but it is unclear if and how the cell death machinery changes as OPCs transition into oligodendrocytes. Here, we discovered that differentiating oligodendrocytes transiently upregulate the zymogen procaspase-3, equipping these cells to make a survival decision during differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of caspase-3 decreases oligodendrocyte density, indicating that procaspase-3 upregulation promotes differentiation. Moreover, using procaspase-3 as a marker, we show that oligodendrocyte differentiation continues in the aging cortex and white matter.

The accuracy of IMMClock is first validated across multiple independent datasets, demonstrating its robustness. Second, utilizing the IMMClock, we find that intrinsic cellular aging processes are more strongly altered during immune aging than differentiation processes. Thirdly, our analysis confirms the strong associations between immune aging and established processes such as cellular senescence, exhaustion, and telomere length at the single cell level. Furthermore, immune aging is accelerated under several disease conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Finally, we apply IMMClock to analyze a perturb-seq gene activation screen of T cell functionality. We find that the post-perturbation immune age of individual T cells is strongly correlated with their pre-perturbation immune age. Furthermore, the immune age at resting state of individual T cells is strongly predictive of their post-stimulation activation state.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes relevant to many physiological and pathological processes. As with all members of the steroid receptor family, GR forms condensates of unknown function. Here, we examine whether GR condensates are involved in transcription regulation using Airyscan super-resolution microscopy and nano-antibodies targeting initiation and elongating states of RNA polymerase II (Pol2). We observed subpopulations of GR condensates colocalizing with initiating and, surprisingly, elongating Pol2 foci. The analysis of GR mutants with different transcriptional outputs suggests a correlation between condensate formation capability and transcription initiation. Moreover, the number of GR molecules within initiation and elongation condensates appears to be linked to transcriptional activity. Taken together, our data suggests an involvement of GR condensates in transcription initiation and elongation.

Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently.

Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1.

Generally, experienced bullying showed increased subcortical volumes in the putamen ({beta}=0.12), caudate ({beta}=0.06), accumbens ({beta}=0.06), amygdala ({beta}=0.07), hippocampus ({beta}=0.06), paired with decreased cerebellar ({beta}=-0.10), entorhinal, ({beta}=-0.12), and insula ({beta}=-0.11) volumes. Females exhibited more volumetric changes in emotional processing areas whereas males had more changes in motor and sensory regions. These findings point to widespread associations between bullying victimization and brain development, offering a potential neurobiological framework to explain the emotional and behavioral difficulties observed. Importantly, this study emphasizes the need for a sex-sensitive approach in future research and interventions related to bullying.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559759

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559759

Known CRBN neosubstrates share a generalizable {beta}-hairpin G-loop recognition motif, yet systematic exploration of the CRBN target landscape is still pending. Through computational mining of the human proteome using structure-based approaches, we predict over 1,400 CRBN-compatible {beta}-hairpin G-loop proteins across diverse target classes, identify novel mechanisms of neosubstrate recognition through structurally differentiated helical motifs and molecular surface mimicry, and validate 22 representative neosubstrates with clinical implications. This work broadens the CRBN target space, redefines rules for neosubstrate recognition and establishes a platform for the elimination of challenging drug targets by repurposing CRL4CRBN through next-generation molecular glue degraders.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559759

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment. The findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF.","NA","biorxiv",1732140559759
"Pain among US adults before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","10.1101/2024.10.24.24316018","medrxiv",39.5,0,0,14,39.5,"Zajacova, A.; Grol-Prokopczyk, H.","Anna Zajacova","University of Western Ontario","2024-10-25","1","PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","cc_by_nc_nd","public and global health","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/25/2024.10.24.24316018.source.xml","ImportanceChronic pain is a major public-health problem in the US. The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey. Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1732140559759
