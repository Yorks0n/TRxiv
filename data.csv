Using data from the All of Us Research Program (n=18,746), we conducted both intention-to-treat and per-protocol phenome-wide association studies comparing diagnoses following GLP-1 RA prescription, including semaglutide-specific analyses, to those following sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) prescriptions in individuals with T2D. GLP-1 RAs were associated with reduced risks of genitourinary and dental conditions relative to comparators, while semaglutide was linked to lower risks of cardiac arrhythmia, hyperglycemia, and chronic kidney disease. However, GLP- 1 RAs were also associated with increased risks of dysthymic disorder and vitamin D deficiency. Time-to-event analyses revealed modest delays in diagnosis for key outcomes. These findings underscore differences in downstream associations across second-line T2D therapies and highlight semaglutides distinct profile. Results may inform clinical decision-making and motivate further research on effectiveness, safety, and personalized prescribing.","NA","medrxiv",1750198190207

Yet, they take over a year to complete, are prone to human error, and face challenges with reproducibility; limiting access to timely and reliable information. We developed otto-SR, an end-to-end agentic workflow using large language models (LLMs) to support and automate the SR workflow from initial search to analysis. We found that otto-SR outperformed traditional dual human workflows in SR screening (otto-SR: 96.7% sensitivity, 97.9% specificity; human: 81.7% sensitivity, 98.1% specificity) and data extraction (otto-SR: 93.1% accuracy; human: 79.7% accuracy). Using otto-SR, we reproduced and updated an entire issue of Cochrane reviews (n=12) in two days, representing approximately 12 work-years of traditional systematic review work. Across Cochrane reviews, otto-SR incorrectly excluded a median of 0 studies (IQR 0 to 0.25), and found a median of 2.0 (IQR 1 to 6.5) eligible studies likely missed by the original authors. Meta-analyses revealed that otto-SR generated newly statistically significant conclusions in 2 reviews and negated significance in 1 review. These findings demonstrate that LLMs can autonomously conduct and update systematic reviews with superhuman performance, laying the foundation for automated, scalable, and reliable evidence synthesis.","NA","medrxiv",1750198190207

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.

The etiology of PMDD, or more generally premenstrual syndrome (PMS) including subclinical forms, is not well understood and both biological and psychological models have been postulated. In the current manuscript we explore the role of emotion regulation ability for the emergence of premenstrual symptoms. Specifically, we were interested whether difficulties in emotion regulation in women with PMS/PMDD persisted as a trait across all cycle phases or were specific to the symptomatic premenstrual phase. We also explored for the first time, whether difficulties in emotion regulation already emerged during the high progesterone mid-luteal phase. 105 women aged 18 to 35 years completed a trait questionnaire on difficulties in emotion regulation, as well as two state measures of emotion regulation during three cycle phases (mid-follicular, mid-luteal, premenstrual). PMS/PMDD was prospectively confirmed across two menstrual cycles in 54 women, while the remaining 51 were assigned to the control group. Our results confirm previous findings that women with PMS/PMDD subjectively report more difficulties in emotion regulation on a trait scale. However, these difficulties were not confirmed in any of the state measures employed in the current study. Furthermore, difficulties in emotion regulation did not account for premenstrual symptom severity in a mediation analysis. This raises the question, whether difficulties in emotion regulation underly premenstrual symptoms or the perception of impaired emotion regulation arises as a consequence of untreated PMS/PMDD. Noteworthy, we were also able to demonstrate via Bayesian analyses, that mood worsening in the premenstrual phase is not a universal occurrence and absent in healthy controls. Taken together these findings highlight the importance of adequate diagnosis and treatment of PMDD.","NA","medrxiv",1750198190207

Their carriage often corresponds with changes to the host transcriptome, but it is unknown during which stage of the conjugation process these transcriptional changes are initiated, and how gene transfer is modulated as they occur. This is because they are normally studied after their full acquisition by conjugation has already occurred, not during the process. Here, active RP4 conjugation revealed that the transcriptional response to plasmid acquisition is almost immediate and is host and surface factor dependent. Responses included activation of non-SOS stress pathways, motility, exopolysaccharide production, anaerobic respiration, and metabolic adaptation. These responses were not a barrier to conjugation, indicating that their significance relates to host homeostasis rather than gene transfer. The recipient could prevent these responses by blocking conjugation through capsule expression. RP4 expression was also inhibited by recipient capsule, since capsule physically blocked donor-recipient contact. Unexpectedly, within a population, RP4 was found to exploit single cell variation in recipient capsule thickness and to successfully conjugate with recipient bacteria with reduced capsule. These results show a novel interplay between plasmid and surface architecture across diverse species that controls the conjugation transcriptional landscape, with important ramifications for plasmid dissemination and evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

We present a novel framework integrating Morphometric Inverse Divergence (MIND) networks with hierarchical Bayesian large-scale population modelling to identify individual-level neuroanatomical deviations.

METHODSMIND networks quantify similarity between brain regions using multivariate MRI features. A normative model of regional MIND values trained on UK Biobank (N=35,133) was applied to the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center cohort (N=3,567). We examined brain deviations across clinical stages, APOE genotypes, mortality risk, and neuropathological burden.

RESULTSNegative deviations (reduced MIND) stratified disease stages (p<0.01) and showed functional network enrichment in AD. Greater negative deviations characterised APOE {varepsilon}4 homozygotes and correlated with postmortem neuropathological severity (p=0.032). Neurobiological decoding revealed associations with neurotransmitter receptor distributions and cortical organisation properties.

In modern landscape models, attractors represent cell types, and stochastic jumps and bifurcations drive cellular decisions, allowing for quantitative and predictive descriptions. However, given a biological problem of interest, we still lack tools to infer and build possible Waddington landscapes systematically. In this study, we propose a generative model for deriving epigenetic landscapes compatible with data. To build the landscapes, we combine gradient and rotational vector fields composed of locally weighted elements that encode  valleys of the Waddington landscape, resulting in interpretable models. We optimize landscapes through computational evolution and illustrate our approach with two developmental examples: metazoan segmentation and neuromesoderm differentiation. In both cases, we obtain ensembles of solutions that reveal both known and novel landscapes in terms of topology and bifurcations. Conversely, topographic features appear strongly constrained by dynamical data, which suggests that our approach can generically derive interpretable and predictive epigenetic landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

In such cases, we understand the information by selectively attending to one of the modalities. Previous research has shown that selective attention to a specific stimulus modality modulates cortical activity patterns. However, it remains unclear which aspects of linguistic information are selectively modulated by attention and how such modulation influences the decodability of semantic content. To address this question, we constructed decoding models of latent semantic features from the functional magnetic resonance imaging data of six participants in both unimodal (either visual or auditory) and bimodal conditions (simultaneously visual and auditory, with participants attending to a single modality at a time). In unimodal conditions, we successfully decoded the semantic contents from the brain activity. Decodable features were consistent across modalities in both intra-modal and cross-modal decoding. For bimodal conditions, decoding accuracies for the attended stimuli were higher than for the ignored when training and test stimuli belonged to the same modality. Furthermore, decodable features were more consistent across modalities with attended than ignored stimuli in both intra-modal and cross-modal decoding. These results indicate common decodable semantic features regardless of the presentation modality and that selective attention enhances the semantic representations contributing to such decodability.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

Previous studies highlighted neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption. Here, we identify distinct biomarkers and dysregulated pathways, with a focus on cardiovascular and neurovascular involvement.

MethodsWe analyzed public RNA-sequencing data (GEO: GSE251849) comparing long COVID-19 patients with brain fog, long COVID-19 patients without cognitive symptoms, convalescent patients, and healthy controls. Differential gene expression, principal component analysis, and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DESeq2, KEGG, GO, and Enrichr tools.

ResultsOur analysis revealed a distinct gene expression profile in patients with brain fog, identifying exclusive biomarkers such as NRCAM, GRIN2C, NOS2, and EDNRB. Pathway analysis revealed significant dysregulation in cardiovascular, calcium signaling, and relaxin signaling pathways, suggesting novel biological mechanisms that contribute to cognitive impairment. These findings expand beyond neuroinflammation and highlight potential cardiovascular involvement in long COVID-related cognitive dysfunction.

ConclusionOur study reveals novel transcriptomic signatures that highlight cardiovascular and neurovascular dysregulation, providing promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Future research should validate these findings and investigate therapeutic interventions addressing these unique pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

CRISPR-Cas systems are known to be important regulators of these host-MGE interactions, but a global understanding of CRISPR-Cas diversity, activity, and roles across Earths biomes is still lacking. Here, we use an optimized computational approach to search short-read data and collect [~]800 million CRISPR spacers across [~]450,000 public metagenomes. Comparing spacers across samples and taxa revealed a high population diversity for CRISPR loci overall, with typically only a small subset of spacers detected as prevalent and conserved within a microbial population. From this extensive CRISPR spacer dataset, we identified 1.18 billion hits between 41 million spacers and 2.5 million viruses and plasmids. Prevalent and conserved spacers were over-represented in these MGE-matching spacers, and CRISPR spacers frequently matched multiple MGEs, consistent with a positive selection pressure associated with MGE targeting. Focusing on the role of CRISPR as anti-phage defense, we observed surprising cases of viruses targeted by microbes not expected to be viable hosts. These were more frequent for viruses encoding a diversification mechanism (DGR) for their host attachment proteins, and associated with a reduced rate of escape mutations. This suggests that broad spacer targeting may derive from the recurring entry of a virus genome into a non-host microbial cell, leading to some viruses being targeted by taxonomically diverse microbes well outside of their actual host range. Taken together, this petabase-scale exploration of CRISPR arrays in nature outlines the extensive diversity of CRISPR array loci across microbiomes.

Evolutionarily-young L1s are transcribed in human pluripotent stem cells, but how CpG methylation is patterned to these L1s upon exit of pluripotency is unknown. Here we investigate the critical functions of chromatin regulator MORC2 in epigenome reprogramming of the repetitive genome in early human neurodevelopment. We find that reversible ATP-dependent dimerization is required for MORC2 accumulation over L1s but not gene promoters. Mutation of the MORC2 ATPase module, causative for neurodevelopmental disorders, severely disrupts the distribution of MORC2 chromatin binding, leading to simultaneous loss of L1 transcriptional control and hyper-repression of clustered ZNF genes in human pluripotent stem cells. Upon neural differentiation these phenotypes persist due to striking, targeted defects in CpG methylation patterning. Together our results define the vital role of MORC2 in safeguarding the somatic human genome upon exit of pluripotency by directing CpG methylation patterning over transcriptionally-active retrotransposons in a manner analogous to the piRNA pathway in the germline.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

Here, we present a comprehensive proximity labeling study of five conserved Caenorhabditis elegans proteins--NEKL-2, NEKL-3, MLT-2, MLT-3, and MLT-4--that form two NEKL-MLT kinase-scaffold subcomplexes involved in membrane trafficking and actin regulation. Using endogenously expressed TurboID fusions and a data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (MS) pipeline, we profiled NEKL-MLT interactomes across 23 experiments, including several methodological variations, applying stringent controls and filtering strategies. By analyzing and comparing experimental outcomes, we develop a set of intuitive quantitative metrics to assess experimental outcomes and quality. We demonstrate that DIA-based workflows produce sensitive physiologically relevant findings, even in the presence of experimental noise and variability across biological replicates. Our approach is validated through the identification of known NEKL-MLT binding partners and conserved genetic suppressors of nekl-mlt mutant phenotypes. Gene ontology enrichment further supports the involvement of newly identified NEKL-MLT interactors in processes including membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal regulation, and cell adhesion. Additionally, several novel proximate interactors were functionally validated using genetic assays. Our findings underscore the utility of DIA-MS in proximity labeling applications and highlight the value of incorporating internal controls, quantitative metrics, and biological validation to enhance confidence in candidate interactors. Overall, this study provides a scalable, organismal-level strategy for probing endogenous protein networks and offers practical guidelines for proximity labeling in multicellular systems.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

Unlike traditional learning rules, BTSP learns correlations on the timescales of seconds and rapidly changes single-unit activity in only a few trials. To explore how BTSP-like learning can be integrated into network models, we propose a generalized BTSP rule (gBTSP), which we apply to unsupervised and supervised learning tasks, in both feedforward and recurrent networks. Unsupervised gBTSP mirrors classical frameworks of competitive learning, learning place field maps (in the feed-forward case), and attractive memory networks (in the recurrent case). For supervised learning, we show that plateau events can reduce task error, enabling gBTSP to solve tasks such as trajectory matching and delayed non-match-to-sample. However, we find that credit assignment via gBTSP becomes harder to achieve with increased network depth or CA3-like recurrence. This suggests that additional features may be needed to support BTSP-mediated few-shot learning of complex tasks in the hippocampus.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

Mathematical models of spreading have been developed leading to several established methods of inferring whether information spreads via social or individual learning. Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) has emerged as a leading frequentist framework for inferring and quantifying social transmission, particularly in non-human animal populations.
C_LIO_LINBDA has been extended several times to account for multiple diffusions, multiple networks, individual-level variables, and complex transmission functions. Bayesian implementations of NBDA were introduced in two prior studies. However, there is not yet a user-friendly package to implement a Bayesian NBDA, and the approach has seen limited usage by other researchers.
C_LIO_LIHere, we present a unified framework for performing Bayesian analysis of social transmission using NBDA-type models, implemented in the widely used Stan programming language. We provide a user-friendly R package ""STbayes"" (ST: social transmission) for other researchers to easily use this framework. STbayes accepts user-formatted data, but can also import data directly from the existing NBDA R package. Based on the data users provide, STbayes automatically generates multi-network, multi-diffusion models that allow for individual covariates that may influence transmission, as well as individual-level varying (random) effects.
C_LIO_LIUsing simulated data, we demonstrate that this model can accurately differentiate the relative contribution of individual and social learning in the spread of information through networked populations. We illustrate how incorporating upstream uncertainty about the relationships between individuals in the social group can improve model fit. We show that our framework can be used to infer complex transmission rules and describe a new parameterization of frequency-dependent transmission that is more numerically stable than prior parameterizations. Finally, we introduce support for dynamic transmission weights and a ""high-resolution"" data mode, which allows users to make use of fine-scale data collected by contemporary automated tracking methods. These extensions increase the set of contexts that this type of model may be used for.

Despite their relevance to human pulmonary fibrosis, the exotic molecular profile of Aberrant Basaloid cells has obscured their etiology, preventing insights into how or why these cells emerge with fibrosis. Here we identify cellular intermediaries between Aberrant Basaloid and normal alveolar epithelial cells in human IPF tissue. We track the emergence of Aberrant Basaloid cells from alveolar epithelial cells ex vivo and uncover a role for similar cells in epithelial regeneration under normal conditions. Lastly, we characterize the epigenetic changes that distinguish Aberrant Basaloid cells from their progenitors and identify hallmarks of AP-1 injury memory retention.

From February to December 2021, we carried out one of the highest-intensity SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance programmes in Europe and implemented genomics-enhanced contact tracing for the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. Here, we report on the first retrospective analysis of the complete dataset, integrating data 32,380 cases, 49,906 forward and backward contact tracing records, 162 recorded institutional outbreaks, and 8,028 viral genome sequences (case sequencing coverage 24.5%). 84% of putative transmission detected by forward contact tracing were associated with private households (estimated attack rate 30%), followed by ""recreational context"" contacts (9% of putative transmissions, 13% transmission probability). Lower transmission probabilities in the 3% - 6.5% range observed for many contexts (e.g. workplaces, schools, residential care facilities) suggested effective infection prevention in these. All institutional outbreaks combined were associated with 5% of total cases; schools and kindergartens exhibited the highest (1.3 and 1.2, respectively), and care homes the lowest (0.2), number of outbreak-linked community cases per outbreak case. A sequencing-led search showed that routine contact tracing underestimated the number of cases associated with school outbreaks (18% increase in associated sequenced cases) and it detected previously unrecognized links between different outbreaks. Combining all available epidemiological data, we identified a putative infection source for 23.7% of sequenced cases; even when ignoring genetic constraints, however, 55.6% of all registered cases remained without a putative transmission source. The available genetic data indicated that a sequencing-led search for epidemiological connections across all sequenced cases could substantially contribute to the detection of transmission events not captured by routine contact tracing (upper bound 60.5% of sequenced cases with a putative infection source, assuming that that all genetic links imply a discoverable epidemiological connection). Different indicators of the ability to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission showed no evidence of saturation towards the achieved case sequencing proportion of 24.5%, suggesting that higher sequencing rates would have been desirable. In conclusion, we demonstrated the comprehensive characterization of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in different contexts. Our study informs the implementation and application of genomics-enhanced contact tracing, which could become an instrument for more efficient infection prevention during future pandemics and help navigate difficult societal trade-offs.","NA","medrxiv",1750198190207

Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the nucleosome-bound full-length DNMT3A2-3L and its oligomeric assemblies in the nucleosome-free state. Strikingly, DNMT3L C-terminal ""Switching Helix"" displayed a distinct conformation with a 180{degrees} rotational difference compared to its DNMT3B3 counterpart in the presence of nucleosome, preventing direct interactions with the nucleosome acidic patch. Instead, DNMT3L ADD domain promotes nucleosome binding, while DNMT3A PWWP domain inhibits it, indicating multi-layer regulation. Additionally, the novel oligomeric arrangement of DNMT3A2-3L in nucleosome-free states highlights its dynamic assembly and potential allosteric regulation. Furthermore, we identified the critical role of DNMT3L as a sensor of histone modifications, guiding the complexs chromatin interaction. These findings uncover a previously unknown mechanism by which DNMT3A-3L mediates de novo DNA methylation on chromatin through complex reorganization, histone tail sensing, dynamic DNA search, and nucleosome engagement, providing key insights into epigenetic regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

To establish an infection, UPEC must evade infiltrating neutrophils and their antimicrobial neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). In this study, we identify a previously uncharacterized two-gene regulatory system within the pathogenicity island PAIUTI89II, which we named DanRI (Defense against neutrophil Regulator and Inhibitor). DanRI is induced by nucleosomes present in NETs and enables UPEC to suppress neutrophil responses by attenuating reactive oxygen species production and NET formation. Mechanistically, DanI functions as an antagonist to the transcriptional regulator DanR, thereby modulating key bacterial processes, including metabolic processes, flagellar biosynthesis, and stress response pathways. DanRI is required for UPEC fitness and long-term persistence in a mouse model of UTI. Taken together, our findings reveal DanRI as a novel regulatory system that promotes UPEC pathogenesis through immune evasion.

We previously showed that multiple ApoER2-Dab1 pathway components accumulate in regions affected in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since the amygdala is a hub for emotional regulation and fear memory, we hypothesized that accumulation of ApoER2-Dab1 components in amygdala may correlate with cognitive or neuropsychiatric manifestations of AD. METHODS: We used single-marker and multiplex immunohistochemistry to label ApoER2-Dab1 components in amygdala from 32 cases spanning the clinicopathological spectrum of AD. RESULTS: Seven ApoER2-Dab1 pathway components accumulated in amygdala and correlated with histological progression and cognitive or neurobehavioral deficits in AD. ApoER2-Dab1 components accumulated within ApoER2-expressing neurons and dystrophic neurites surrounding ApoE-enriched extracellular plaques. DISCUSSION: Findings add to growing evidence implicating ApoER2-Dab1 disruption in neurodegeneration and suggest that ApoER2-Dab1 disruption in amygdala may contribute to neuropsychiatric manifestations of AD.","NA","medrxiv",1750198190207

However, there is a population of TB patients who require longer treatment durations. Prospectively identifying those who require shorter versus longer treatment durations would support evaluation and implementation of optimized regimens.

MethodsWe analysed data from the RIFASHORT TB treatment-shortening non-inferiority trial to define a TB phenotype classification. The RIFASHORT trial primary outcome was reanalysed using the protocol-defined non-inferiority criterion of eight percentage points, stratifying by those classified as having limited or extensive disease.

ResultsXpert MTB/RIF(R) semiquantitative bacterial burden in combination with TB disease involvement grading on chest X-ray achieved the strongest differentiation between relapse and non-relapse. The extensive disease TB phenotype (high semiquantitative bacterial burden and extensive TB disease on X-ray) accounted for one quarter of the RIFASHORT trial population and more than half of all post-treatment TB relapses (13/23). For the limited TB disease phenotype (<high semiquantitative bacterial burden or no extensive TB disease on X-ray), the experimental 4-month 1200mg rifampicin-containing regimen met the protocol-defined non-inferiority criterion in both modified-intention-to-treat (adjusted risk difference: -1.3% (95% confidence interval: -6.7% to 4.0%)) and per protocol analyses (1.7% (95% CI: -3.8% to 7.1%)).

ConclusionA four-month treatment duration, with a widely available, tolerable, rifampicin-based TB treatment regimen, was non-inferior to the standard of care for three-quarters of people with TB in the RIFASHORT trial. This finding justifies definitive evaluation of disease-stratified rifampicin-based TB treatment in a phase III randomised trial.

summaryXpert MTB/RIF(R) and chest radiography at TB treatment initiation identify a majority of patients for whom a 4-month treatment duration is non-inferior to the standard of care. These widely available measures may facilitate personalised TB treatment durations.","NA","medrxiv",1750198190207

The human LT-HSC compartment is molecularly and functionally heterogeneous and also varies across ontogeny. Dissecting the molecular basis for this variation is impeded by the absence of immunophenotypic markers to resolve LT-HSC heterogeneity. Here, we identified ATPase plasma membrane Ca2+transporting 1 (ATP2B1/PMCA1) as a novel cell surface marker that is heterogeneously expressed by CD49f+ LT-HSC across ontogeny. ATP2B1 immunophenotypic expression stratified human CD49f+ LT-HSC from fetal liver (FL), neonatal cord blood (CB) and adult mobilized peripheral blood (mPB) sources into functionally distinct subpopulations in single-cell (sc) clonogenic assays. CD49f+ATP2B1+ LT-HSC exhibited superior long-term repopulation and self-renewal capacities in vivo compared to CD49f+ATP2B1- LT-HSC. Molecular profiling by scMultiome and immunofluorescence microscopy point to enrichment of an HSC self-renewal program that includes the TFEB-endolysosomal axis in CD49f+ATP2B1+ LT-HSC.

Spacer acquisition relies on the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and accessory proteins like Cas4, which select DNA sequences flanked by the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and insert them into the CRISPR array. It has been shown that in type II-A systems selection of PAM-proximal prespacers is mediated by the effector nuclease Cas9, which forms a  supercomplex with the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and the Csn2 protein. However, the supercomplex structure and the role of the ring-like Csn2 protein remain unknown. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the type II-A prespacer selection supercomplex in the DNA-scanning and two different PAM-bound configurations. Our study uncovers the mechanism of Cas9-mediated prespacer selection in type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems, and reveals the role of the accessory protein Csn2, which serves as a platform for the assembly of Cas9 and Cas1-Cas2 integrase on prespacer DNA, reminiscent of the sliding clamp in DNA replication.

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 E ion channel activity triggers the proton pump V-ATPases to recruit the ATG16L1 complex during infection. This results in ATG8 molecules such as LC3B decorating perturbed compartments. This recruitment of autophagy machinery does not inhibit viral replication, rather SARS-CoV-2 exploits this response. Inhibition of the V-ATPase/ATG16L1 interaction using the Salmonella effector SopF inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Careful distinction between use of the autophagic machinery from canonical macroautophagy is required in order to better understand coronavirus replication and for rational targeting of any potential host-directed therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

However, current tools employing variational inference on single-cell datasets, including methods for paired and mosaic integration, transfer learning, and modality imputation, typically act as black boxes. This lack of interpretability makes it challenging to evaluate whether biological variation is preserved, which can compromise downstream analyses. Here, we introduce NetworkVI, a sparse deep generative model designed for the integration and interpretation of multimodal single-cell data. NetworkVI utilizes biological prior knowledge as an inductive bias, specifically it relies on gene-gene interactions inferred from topologically associated domains and structured ontologies like the Gene Ontology to aggregate gene embeddings to cell embeddings, enhancing the interpretability at the gene and subcellular level. While achieving state-of-the-art data integration, modality imputation, and cell label transfer via query-to-reference mapping benchmarks across bimodal and trimodal datasets, NetworkVI additionally excels in providing biologically meaningful modality- and cell type-specific interpretations. NetworkVI aids researchers in identifying associations between genes and biological processes and uncovers immune evasion mechanisms in a Perturb CITE-seq dataset of melanoma cells. NetworkVI will support researchers in interpreting cellular disease mechanisms, guiding biomarker discovery, and ultimately aiding the development of targeted therapies in large-scale single-cell multimodal atlases.

However, limitations on parameter estimation have prevented their use with individual, high-resolution human neuroimaging data. Furthermore, most studies focus only on connectivity, ignoring node heterogeneity, even though real brain regions have different structural and dynamical properties.

Here we present an improved approach to fitting Ising models to 360-region functional MRI data: derivation of an initial guess model from group data, optimization of simulation temperature, and two stages of Boltzmann learning, first with group data, then with individual data. We then analyze how data binarization threshold affects goodness-of-fit, the role of the external field in model behavior, and correlations between model parameters and features from structural MRI, including myelination and sulcus depth.

The fitted models can reproduce the functional connectivity of the data across a wide range of thresholds, but the role of the external field parameters in model behavior increases with threshold. In parallel, the coupling between nodes correlates with structural connectivity throughout this range, but correlations between the external field and structural features increase with threshold. These results show how our methodology enables personalized, biophysically interpretable modeling of structure-function relationships at the whole-brain level, which can aid understanding of individual differences in brain network organization and dynamics. This approach will help to bridge the gap between connectomics, which emphasizes brain networks, and translational neuroscience, which often focuses on the unique roles of brain regions.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

While mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in SLE, its cell-type-specific impact on immune subsets remains underexplored.

MethodsWe repurposed existing RNA-seq data from SLE patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with a focus on nuclear-encoded mitochondrial (NEmt) genes, as well as mitochondrial genes themselves, to identify differentially expressed genes compared to healthy controls. Mitochondrial stress tests were performed on freshly isolated CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and monocytes from SLE patients and healthy donors to assess bioenergetic function.

ResultsRNA-seq revealed that both NEmt genes and mitochondrial genes were downregulated in the PBMC population of SLE patients. In situ mitochondrial stress tests revealed significant reductions in oxygen consumption rate (OCR), indicating impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) across all immune subsets, while extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), a marker of glycolysis, remained unchanged. These findings highlight immune-cell-specific mitochondrial bioenergetic failure in SLE, without compensatory glycolytic adaptation.

ConclusionOur results position mitochondrial fitness as a novel therapeutic target in SLE. We propose leveraging high-throughput screening of mitochondria-targeted compounds, including FDA-approved agents, to enhance OXPHOS, regulate mitophagy, or mitigate oxidative stress.

This precision-based approach offers a paradigm shift from conventional immunosuppression to metabolic recalibration, with the potential to restore immune homeostasis in SLE.

Key messagesO_LIWhat is already known on this topic:
Mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming have been linked to SLE pathogenesis, but the cell-type-specific extent of mitochondrial impairment and its therapeutic potential remained unclear.

Improving pDNA production in the most common production host (E. coli) has faced obstacles arising from the complex network of genes responsible for pDNA synthesis, with the specific enzyme(s) limiting pDNA yield remaining unidentified. To address this challenge, we employed an inducible genome-wide mutagenesis strategy, combined with fluorescent screening, to isolate E. coli NEB 5 strains with enhanced pDNA production. Following selection, we successfully isolated an E. coli strain (M3) with elevated plasmid copy numbers (PCNs) across multiple origin types. Specifically, we observed a 5.93-fold increase in PCN for the GFP reporter plasmid, a 1.93-fold increase for the gWiz DNA vaccine plasmid, and an 8.7-fold increase for the pAAV-CAGG-eGFP plasmid, all of which contain pUC origins. In addition, plasmids with p15A and pSC101 origins showed 1.44-fold and 1.68-fold increases in PCN, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing of the adapted strain M3 identified 85 mutations, including one in recG, which encodes an ATP-dependent DNA helicase. Replacement of the mutant recG with its wild-type counterpart in the mutant strain resulted in a 63% reduction in PCN, but the recG mutation alone was insufficient to increase PCN in the wild-type strain. These findings suggest that the recG mutation plays a synergistic role with other genomic mutations to drive PCN increases. Taken together, this study presents the development of a pDNA hyperaccumulating E. coli strain with promising applications in industrial and therapeutic pDNA production, while also offering important insights into key genes involved in pDNA production.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

Recent computational methods have aimed to more accurately model GRNs by estimating the hidden Transcription Factor Activity (TFA), from prior knowledge of TF target regulatory connections, encoded as an input directed graph, to relax the assumption that mRNA level of the regulator correlates with the protein activity of the regulator. However, the noise in the prior knowledge can adversely affect the estimated TFA levels and the quality of the downstream inferred GRNs. Here, we present a new approach, MERLIN+P+TFA, that uses prior knowledge-guided sparsity regularization to robustly and accurately estimate TFA and downstream GRNs. We apply our method to simulated and real expression data in yeast and mammalian systems and show improved quality of inferred GRNs for both bulk and single-cell datasets. Regularized TFA offers benefits to a variety of other GRN inference algorithms, including those that have traditionally be used with expression alone, in both bulk and scRNA-seq settings. We used the inferred GRN to prioritize key regulators for the mouse Embryonic Stem Cell (mESC) state and validate 58 regulators experimentally. We identify both known and novel regulators of the mESC state and further validate the targets of 4 known and novel regulators. Our validation experiments suggest that computationally inferred networks can capture functional targets of TFs with higher precision than estimated in current benchmarks, however, it is important to generate context-specific gold standards.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

Unlike the nitrite-anammox reaction, this reaction was accompanied by an acid production process, which caused a decrease in pH. When the substrate was changed to nitrite and ammonium, the total nitrogen removal rate of only 1.1-1.3 mg/(L{middle dot}d) was achieved. This new biochemical reaction of nitrogen was defined as nitrate-anammox. The study reveals a new pathway of nitrogen transformation, providing novel insights into the global nitrogen cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

They are also excellent testbeds for engineering protein superstructures. Engineers often employ techniques such as amino acid substitutions and insertions/deletions. Yet evolution also utilizes circular permutation, a powerful natural strategy that has not been fully explored in engineering self-assembling protein nanoparticles. Here, we demonstrate this technique using the MS2 VLP as a model self-assembling, proteinaceous nanoparticle. We constructed, for the first time, a comprehensive circular permutation library of the fused MS2 coat protein dimer construct. The strategy revealed new terminal locations, validated via cryo-electron microscopy, that enabled C-terminal peptide tagging and led to a stable protein encapsulation strategy via covalent bonding - a feature the native coat protein does not permit. Our systematic study demonstrates the power of circular permutation for engineering new features as well as quantitatively and systematically exploring VLP structural determinants.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

However, EHR data may be prone to misclassification and unmeasured confounding, requiring systematic mitigation to ensure robust findings.

MethodsIn VEBIS-EHR, a retrospective multi-country COVID-19 VE cohort study, we examined unmeasured confounding using a negative control outcome (death not related to COVID-19) and misclassification from varying data extraction intervals. The evaluation spanned two periods (November-December 2023, January-February 2024), encompassing up to 18.7 million individuals across six EU/EEA countries. Vaccine confounding-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.

ResultsaHRs against non-COVID-19 mortality ranged from 0.35 (95% CI: 0.28-0.44) to 0.70 (0.66-0.73) when comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated. Delaying EHR data extraction modestly increased the capture of outcome and exposure events, with some variation by vaccination status. Site-level fluctuations in aHRs did not meaningfully alter the overall pooled VE, suggesting stable estimates despite misclassification related to extraction timing.

ConclusionsWe observed some evidence of unmeasured confounding when using non-COVID-19 deaths as a negative outcome, though the specificity of our negative control must be considered. This result may suggest overestimation of VE, but also the need for further analysis with more specific negative control outcomes and confounding-adjustment techniques. Addressing such confounding using richer data sources and more refined approaches remains critical to ensure accurate, timely VE estimates when using real-world EHR-based data. Extending the delay between the end of observation and data extraction modestly improves the completeness of exposure and outcome data, with limited effect on pooled VE estimates.

Key MessagesA Key Messages section should be added after the keywords and before the articles introduction, with the key messages of the paper made in 3 bullet points that succinctly describe:

O_LIWhat your research question was: Whether vaccine effectiveness estimates based on EHR data are internally valid according to analyses focused on two topics of concern related to EHR-based observational research - unmeasured confounding and misclassification.
C_LIO_LIWhat you found: We observed unmeasured confounding in our estimates when using non-COVID19 deaths as negative outcome, and timing of data abstraction from source EHRs was found to have a small influence on the capture and classification of exposure and outcome.
C_LIO_LIWhy it is important: Our results reinforce earlier evidence of the healthy vaccinee phenomenon indicating possible biases in the estimates of vaccine effectiveness estimates obtained from EHR data and that there appears to be little influence of EHR extraction timing on data completeness.

To address missingness, a penalty factor can be used to correct for absent proteins contributing to predictions.

We demonstrate MLMarkers utility across three public datasets: (i) cerebral melanoma metastases, where brain-like proteomic profiles were linked to poor treatment response and invasive phenotypes, revealing 241 differentially expressed proteins; (ii) a pan-cancer FFPE dataset, where tissue origin predictions reached 79% accuracy using broad tissue mappings despite the absence of cancer-specific training data; and (iii) cerebrospinal fluid and plasma, where the model identified brain and pituitary origin in biofluid samples.

Here, we report a Phosphorylation-Inducing Chimeric Small molecule (PHICS) that rewires the hyperactivity of an oncogenic kinase, BCR-ABL, to phosphorylate its active site residue. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest this phosphorylation inhibits BCR-ABL by inducing electrostatic rearrangements of its active site. This ""event-driven"" mechanism selectively induces apoptosis of BCR-ABL-dependent cancer cells at substoichiometric concentrations (vs. stoichiometric concentrations of occupancy-driven drugs). Furthermore, PHICS is effective on other oncogenic ABL fusions or clinically observed resistance mutations, including to occupancy-driven drugs with the same binding site as PHICS, pointing to the orthogonality of their resistance mechanisms.

The N-terminal helix 0 of PspA (and other ESCRT-III members) has been suggested to act as a membrane anchor, the detailed mechanism, however, of how it binds to membranes and eventually triggers membrane fusion and/or fission events remains unclear. By solving a total of 15 cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of PspA and a truncation lacking the N-terminal helix 0 in the presence of EPL membranes, we show in molecular detail how PspA interacts with and remodels membranes: binding of the N-terminal helix 0 in the outer tubular membrane leaflet induces membrane curvature, supporting membrane tubulation by PspA. Detailed molecular dynamics simulations and free energy computations of interactions between the helix 0 and negatively charged membranes suggest a compensating mechanism between helix/membrane interactions and the energy contributions required for membrane bending. The energetic considerations are in line with the membrane structures observed in the cryo-EM images of tubulated membrane vesicles, fragmented vesicles inside tapered PspA rods, and shedded vesicles emerging at the thinner PspA rod ends. Our results provide insights into the molecular determinants and a potential mechanism of vesicular membrane remodeling mediated by a member of the ESCRT-III superfamily.

To tease apart global processing from local interactions, we applied a novel statistical approach called pCCA-FA (a combination of probabilistic canonical correlation analysis and factor analysis) to analyze trial-to-trial variability in neuronal responses. We found substantial shared variability among neurons within each population, much of which was actually shared across populations and linked to an arousal process.

Here we explore the metabolism of epigenetic ribonucleosides in human cells by studying effects on cell growth, quantifying misincorporation into cellular RNAs and identifying metabolic regulators, and exploring phenotypes associated with cytotoxicity. We find that bulky N6-modified adenosines (i.e. i6A) exhibit high levels of cytotoxicity and RNA misincorporation, whereas cells dramatically restrict the misincorporation of small N6-modified adenosines (i.e. m6A), partly through sanitization by enzymatic deamination. Epigenetic ribopyrimidines also exhibit cytotoxicity, mediated primarily by nucleoside kinase UCK2, but only at much higher concentrations than ribopurines. We further characterize the effects of cytotoxic ribonucleoside metabolism on nucleolar morphology and protein translation. Taken together, our work provides new insights into the metabolism of epigenetic ribonucleosides and mechanisms underlying their cytotoxicity to cells.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

Studies of neural circuit evolution often focus on a few elements within a network. However, addressing fundamental questions in evolutionary neuroscience, such as whether some elements are more evolvable than others, requires a more global and unbiased approach. Here, we used synapse-level comparative connectomics to examine how an entire olfactory circuit evolves. We compared the full antennal lobe connectome of the larvae of two closely related Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. erecta, which differ in their ecological niches and odour-driven behaviours. We found that evolutionary change is unevenly distributed across the network. Some features, including neuron types, neuron numbers and interneuron-to-interneuron connectivity, are highly conserved. These conserved elements delineate a core circuit blueprint presumably required for fundamental olfactory processing. Superimposed on this scaffold, we find rewiring changes that mirror each species ecologies, including a systematic shift in the excitation-to-inhibition balance in the feedforward pathways. We further show that some neurons have changed more than others, and that even within individual neurons some synaptic elements remain conserved while others display major species-specific changes, suggesting evolutionary hot-spots within the circuit. Our findings reveal constrained and adaptable elements within olfactory networks, and establish a framework for identifying general principles in the evolution of neural circuits underlying behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1750198190207

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated.

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

Although dietary tryptophan is associated with various health benefits, excessive intake can result in adverse physiological effects. The specific tryptophan-derived metabolites responsible for such toxicity, however, remain incompletely characterized. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying tryptophan-induced toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We observe that tryptophan concentrations of 1 mM or higher are highly toxic to C. elegans, blocking egg hatching. Notably, supplementation with various sugars alleviates this toxicity. Genetic analyses reveal that host tryptophan metabolism is dispensable for the observed effects. Instead, bacterial metabolism, particularly the conversion of tryptophan to indole, is essential for mediating toxicity. Bacterial strains deficient in indole production abolished tryptophan-induced toxicity, and all sugars that conferred protection also suppressed bacterial indole synthesis. These findings demonstrate that tryptophan toxicity in C. elegans is primarily mediated by microbial metabolism and underscore the pivotal role of host-microbiota interactions in shaping the physiological consequences of dietary amino acid intake.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1750198190207

Common wisdom holds that G should respond to drift only as a scaled reduction. In contrast, I find that drift causes drastic and predictable shifts in the orientation of G by driving genetic correlations to their extremes. Biologically, this is a consequence of linkage build-up introduced by drift. I compare these theoretical results to empirical observations based on experiments conducted by Phillips et. al. (2001). Additionally, to derive the model of G-matrix evolution, I developed a novel synthetic framework for modelling ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations carrying multivariate traits. By striking a balance between genetic detail and analytical tractability, and by minimizing requisite technical background, this framework is optimized for deriving new models across a wide range of topics in population biology. Foundations of the framework are formalized by the theory of measure-valued processes, but application of the framework only requires multivariate calculus, and heuristics are presented in the main text for making additional calculations involving stochastic processes. Collectively, this work establishes a powerful framework enabling efficient formal analysis of integrated population processes across evolution and ecology, and its potential for making new discoveries is illustrated by novel findings on fundamental aspects of G-matrix evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

Search queries may vary in size from short gene sequences to multiple whole genomes that are too large to fit in computer memory. In microbial genomics, a routine search application involving both large queries and large collections is the removal of contaminating host genome sequences from microbial (meta)genomes. Where the host is human, sensitive classification and excision of host sequences is usually necessary to protect host genetic information. Precise classification is also critical in order to retain microbial sequences and permit accurate microbial genomic analysis. While human pangenomes have been shown to increase sensitivity of human sequence classification, existing bioinformatic host depletion approaches have either limited precision when used with metagenomes or large computing resource requirements.

ResultsWe present Deacon, an efficient and versatile sequence filter for raw sequence files and streams. We demonstrate its leading accuracy for the task of host depletion, using less computing resource than existing approaches. By querying a human pangenome index for minimizers contained in each input sequence, Deacon is able to accurately classify and discard diverse human sequences from long reads at over 250Mbp/s with a commodity laptop. We present validation of classification sensitivity, specificity and speed with simulated short and long reads for diverse catalogues of human, bacterial and viral genomes alongside existing methods. Beyond host depletion, Deacon is well suited to common sequence search and filtering applications, particularly those involving large queries. Capable of indexing a human genome in under 30s, Deacon is equipped to rapidly compose custom minimizer indexes using set operations, facilitating efficient search and filtering of massive sequence datasets using gigabase queries.

In bacteria, diverse clades of repurposed TnpB and CRISPR-associated proteins repress gene expression by blocking transcription initiation or elongation, enabling non-canonical modes of regulatory control and adaptive immunity1,6,7. Intriguingly, a distinct class of nuclease-dead Cas12f homologs (dCas12f) instead activates gene expression through its association with unique extracytoplasmic function sigma factors ({sigma}E) 8, though the molecular basis has remained elusive. Here we reveal a novel mode of RNA-guided transcription initiation by determining cryo-electron microscopy structures of the dCas12f-{sigma}E system from Flagellimonas taeanensis. We captured multiple conformational and compositional states, including the DNA-bound dCas12f-{sigma}E-RNAP holoenzyme complex, revealing how RNA-guided DNA binding leads to {sigma}E-RNAP recruitment and nascent mRNA synthesis at a precisely defined distance downstream of the R-loop. Rather than following the classical paradigm of {sigma}E-dependent promoter recognition, these studies show that recognition of the -35 element is largely supplanted by CRISPR-Cas targeting, while the melted -10 element is stabilized through unusual stacking interactions rather than insertion into the typical recognition pocket. Collectively, this work provides high-resolution insights into an unexpected mechanism of RNA-guided transcription, expanding our understanding of bacterial gene regulation and opening new avenues for programmable transcriptional control.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

Among these, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and extracellular targeted protein degradation (eTPD) specifically depend on efficient lysosomal trafficking for activity. However, many tumor antigens exhibit poor internalization, limiting ADC effectiveness. To address this, we developed low-density lipoprotein receptor-targeting chimeras (LIPTACs), leveraging the constitutive endocytic and recycling activity of the LDLR to enhance lysosomal delivery. LIPTACs enable efficient and selective degradation of diverse extracellular membrane proteins. Additionally, by coupling LIPTACs with cytotoxic payloads to generate degrader-drug conjugates, we can achieve superior intracellular delivery and enhanced cytotoxicity compared to conventional ADCs. The dual modality addresses key challenges of inadequate internalization in conventional ADCs and cytotoxic potency for current eTPD strategies. Our findings demonstrate that LDLR-mediated trafficking can enhance eTPD and ADCs, providing a hybrid blueprint for developing next-generation antibody therapeutics with broader utility and improved efficacy in cancer treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

Growth suppression by ppGpp is implicated in the formation of persister cells, which survive antibiotic challenge only to regrow once the drug is removed. However, there is also evidence that low levels of ppGpp contribute to resistance to certain cell wall-active antibiotics in actively growing cells. To characterize ppGpps contribution to antibiotic resistance, we measured MICs of a panel of {beta}-lactams in actively growing Escherichia coli cells overexpressing a ppGpp synthase (relA*). Cells engineered to modestly overproduce ppGpp exhibited up to 64-fold increases in resistance to PBP2-targeting {beta}-lactams only, with mecillinam the most dramatically affected. Resistance required the transcription factor DksA and the class A penicillin binding protein (PBP) PBP1B. PBP1B variants defective for transpeptidase activity, glycosyltransferase activity, or both were incapable of mediating resistance, suggesting the full enzymatic activity of PBP1B is required for resistance. Transcriptomics revealed that ppGpp overproduction leads to increased expression of lpoB, which encodes an activator of PBP1B. LpoB was required for mecillinam resistance, with an lpoB deletion mutant exhibiting a loss of ppGpp-dependent resistance. Resistance was partially lost in an lpoB deletion strain expressing an LpoB-bypass variant of PBP1B (mrcB*). Together these results support a model wherein overproduction of ppGpp favors cell wall synthesis by PBP1B, in part via increased expression of lpoB, allowing PBP1B to substitute for PBP2 when it is inhibited by {beta}-lactams.

ImportanceAntimicrobial resistance is an increasing global health threat, but the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance remain incompletely understood. This work clarifies the role of the alarmone ppGpp in mediating antibiotic resistance in the model bacterium Escherichia coli. Elevated levels of ppGpp were found to cause resistance to {beta}-lactam antibiotics targeting the cell wall synthesis enzyme PBP2. Resistance required transcriptional regulation by ppGpp and enzymatic activity of the cell wall enzyme PBP1B. This work suggests that ppGpp causes resistance in part by increasing expression of lpoB, which encodes an activator of PBP1B. Because ppGpp levels are controlled by nutritional conditions, this work suggests that nutritional availability could impact the efficacy of antibiotics. Furthermore, this study adds to a number of studies demonstrating that cell wall synthesizing PBP enzymes can compensate for one another under certain conditions, leading to {beta}-lactam resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1750198190207

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.
