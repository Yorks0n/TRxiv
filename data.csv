Here, we present a second high-quality Denisovan genome, reconstructed from a molar found at Denisova Cave. It belonged to a man who lived ~200,000 years ago in a small Denisovan group. This group mixed with early Neandertals and was then replaced by Denisovans who had mixed with later Neandertals. We show that in addition Denisovans received gene flow from hominins that diverged before the split of the ancestors of Denisovans and modern humans. The two Denisovan genomes allow us to disentangle Denisovan ancestry in present-day humans revealing contributions from at least three distinct Denisovan groups. In particular, Oceanians and South Asians independently inherited DNA from a deeply diverged Denisovan population which was likely isolated in South Asia. This supports an early migration of the ancestors of Oceanians through South Asia followed by the later arrival of the ancestors of present-day South Asians. East Asians do not share this Denisovan component in their genomes, suggesting that their ancestors arrived independently, perhaps by a northerly route. Finally, the two high-quality Denisovan genomes allow us to refine the catalogue of genetic changes that arose on the Denisovan lineage, some of which were contributed to present-day humans.","[{""name"":""Max Planck Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01hhn8329"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""694707;""},{""name"":""Russian Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03y2gwe85"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""24-18-00069;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

In this work, we develop an end-to-end automation strategy for repeat-target structure determination using new tools in CryoSPARC. We demonstrate completely hands-off processing of 21 challenging G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) datasets. In 17 of 21 cases, automated processing meets or exceeds published resolution and map quality and, in several cases, provides significant improvement in receptor and ligand density that allows improved model building. Our results on both active and inactive state GPCRs show that our automation strategy generalizes easily to new target classes, and that complete automation of data processing is straightforward to achieve in CryoSPARC. We provide downloadable CryoSPARC Workflow files so that users can import, replicate, adapt and extend our automated workflow for their own targets, enabling cryo-EM to be applied at larger scales and to answer larger biological questions.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

It facilitates molecular evolution and has been characterized in a variety of biological systems, but studies of prokaryotic promoters are limited. Prokaryotic promoters are non-coding DNA sequences that regulate transcription. The main housekeeping promoters (sigma70) share two sequence motifs called the -35 and the -10 box that are spaced 17+/-1 base pairs (bps) apart. The sequence of these boxes, their distance, and the existence of multiple nearby boxes can determine promoter strength, the ability of a promoter to drive high levels of transcription. Here we used computational modelling to show that the mutational robustness of sigma70 promoters - the persistence of promoter strength upon mutation - correlates with promoter strength itself. Mutational robustness is also influenced by potential overlaps between -10 and -35 boxes, and by specific positions within the boxes. It is higher when the boxes are exactly 17 bps apart. These findings can be partially explained by the flexibility of -35 boxes, which enables adjacent bases to create overlapping and new -35 boxes. Our work can help to engineer synthetic promoters for strength and robustness, and to understand the dynamics of promoter evolution.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""31003A_172887;310030_208174;""},{""name"":""University of Zurich"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02crff812"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FK-23-120;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Here, we studied the role of innate immune cells as potential effectors of vascular damage using a human in vitro 3D-BBB model. Parasite-stimulated immune cells from malaria-naive donors increased adhesion to microvessels, at least partly through LFA-1. This caused barrier disruption and inflammatory activation of BBB cells. Secretion of TNF-, IFN-{gamma}, and granzyme B by monocytes, NK and {gamma}{delta} T cells correlated with vascular injury, and accumulation of immune cells was required for local barrier damage. Our computational analysis disentangled pathogenic mechanisms driven specifically by either P. falciparum parasite or immune cells, as well as shared pathways. These findings demonstrate how vascular-immune interactions may contribute to vascular injury in cerebral malaria and point towards the potential of immunomodulatory therapeutics.","[{""name"":""European Reseach Council"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""948088;847543;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Laboratory"",""id"":""https://ror.org/010jaxs89"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NA;""},{""name"":""Agencia Estatal de Investigación"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RYC 2020-029886-I/AEI/10.13039/501100011033;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

While recent outbreaks have revealed much about the epidemiological dynamics that sustain human-to-human transmission, the mechanisms by which the virus persists between outbreaks are unknown. Previously, phylogenetic approaches have been used to characterise the EBOV reservoir from the evolutionary relationships among observed human outbreaks. We here employ a novel phylogenetic latency model -- inspired by recent observations of extreme EBOV evolutionary rate heterogeneity in humans -- to characterise the natural history of EBOV and by extension its reservoir. We find the prevailing model of EBOV reservoir dynamics is deficient, and the long-term EBOV evolutionary rate is slower than previously believed. The hypothesis that EBOV diversity dates back to a bottleneck event just prior to the first human outbreak is not supported by the data. Further, our results suggest that EBOV undergoes extended periods of quiescence in the reservoir, similar to that observed in a small fraction of human infections. These findings have significant implications for understanding the source of EBOV outbreaks, characterising the EBOV reservoir, and uncovering the factors that contribute to EBOV outbreaks in humans.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""206298/Z/17/Z;313694/Z/24/Z;218471/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Research Foundation - Flanders"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03qtxy027"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""G0E1420N;G098321N;""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""01102733;""},{""name"":""Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""260003/005679/2023;260003/013252/2024;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IG-5305-2023;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AI153044;AI162611;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""725422;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

BCI implants have targeted broad cortical regions known to have relevant motor representations, but emerging technologies will allow flexible targeting to specific neural populations. The structure of motor representations at this scale, however, has not been well characterized across frontal motor cortices. Here, we investigate how motor representations and population dynamics (temporal coordination) vary across a large expanse of frontal motor cortices. We used high-density, laminar, microelectrode arrays to simultaneously record many neurons and then sampled neural populations across frontal motor cortex in two monkeys while they performed a reaching task. Our experiments allowed us to map neuronal activity across three spatial dimensions and relate them to movement. Target decoding analysis revealed that task information was heterogeneously distributed across the cortical surface and in depth. Similarly, we found that the temporal dynamics of different neural populations were heterogeneous, but that the amount of task information predicted which neural populations had similar dynamics. The neural populations with the most similar dynamics were composed of neurons with high task information regardless of spatial location. Our results highlight the spatiotemporal complexity of motor representations across frontal motor cortex at the level of neurons and neural populations, where well-learned movements consistently recruit a spatially distributed subset of neurons. Further insights into the spatiotemporal structure of neural activity patterns across frontal motor cortex will be critical to guide future implants for improved BCI performance.","[{""name"":""National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TL1 TR002318;""},{""name"":""Heiwa Nakajima Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/000k40t10"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Graduate Fellowship;""},{""name"":""Weill Neurohub"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""postdoctoral fellowship;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Simons Collaboration for the Global Brain Pilot award, 898220;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2117997;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIH R01 NS134634;UF1NS126485;""},{""name"":""Office of Research Infrastructure Programs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01jdyfj45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P51 OD010425;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Across 21 families, Constellation independently identified all known causative variants and resolved previously unsolved trios. It reliably resolved complex structural and copy number variants (e.g. impacting MECP2) and recovered haplotype phasing information across key disease impacting variants, all from low DNA input using existing Illumina infrastructure.

In hub enzymes such as tyrosine kinases, the activation loop critically controls substrate specificity, catalytic efficiency, and downstream signaling, shaping cellular fate. Yet, the molecular mechanisms by which loop dynamics encode these functions remain incompletely understood. Here, we used SRC kinase as a model to dissect how minimal perturbations of the activation loop reprogram kinase behavior. By generating and characterizing multiple variants, we identified a triple-deletion mutant with altered loop dynamics. Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that this variant explores distinct loop conformations and exhibits a subtle shift in substrate preference toward more acidic motifs. These fine-tuned conformational changes translated into specific cellular signaling outcomes, as demonstrated by phosphoproteomic profiling. Comparative analysis across species further showed that nature exploits similar loop remodeling strategies to modulate kinase function. Together, our findings provide a blueprint for rationally tuning kinase activity and offer a generalizable framework for rewiring signaling pathways in diverse cellular contexts.","[{""name"":""JSPS Kakenhi Early Career Scientist Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""22K15064;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

We attenuated ACD across distinct striatal regions, finding that ACD attenuation specifically in ventral striatum (VS) increased decision noisiness and impaired reward-guided choice. This effect was largely due to a reduction in win-stay behavior. Using in-vivo calcium imaging, we found that VS ACD correlated with reward prediction errors (RPEs). Furthermore, these trial-by-trial ACD fluctuations predicted trial-by-trial choice variability. Finally, ex-vivo slice electrophysiology and computational modeling revealed two mechanisms through which astrocytes could regulate behavioral variability: by regulating presynaptic excitatory-inhibitory balance, and by sharing RPE signals across populations of striatal neurons.

Oct4, a master regulator of pluripotency, exemplifies this capacity as it can bind nucleosome-occupied DNA. Yet, how Oct4 reshapes chromatin fibres beyond the scale of a single nucleosome has remained unclear. Here, we harness our near-atomistic coarse-grained chromatin model to dissect how full-length Oct4 interacts with chromatin fibres of varying nucleosomal repeat lengths. We find that Oct4 increases DNA accessibility not by decondensing chromatin, but by driving fibres into compact liquid-like states in which nucleosomes breathe, reorient, exchange neighbours, and transiently expose DNA. Oct4 binds preferentially to linker DNA through its structured POU domains, while its disordered activation domains mediate cluster formation: a three-stage process consisting of nucleation of small clusters, attachment to chromatin via the DNA binding domains, and growth that is amplified when long DNA linkers enable fibre bending and looping. Oct4 clusters deform chromatin and bridge distal DNA segments in a stoichiometry- and linker length-dependent manner, revealing a tunable mechanism for controlling higher-order structure. Together, our results establish how Oct4 exploits multivalency, nucleosome breathing, and chromatin flexibility to reorganise fibres into liquid-like states that reconcile condensation with enhanced accessibility, providing a physical route to overcome the transcription-factor ""search problem"" and activate silenced genes during reprogramming.","[{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X02332X/1;EP/Z002028/1;EP/X035603/1;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""803326;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Through multiplex, single-cell enhancer assays, we identify HAQERs as active enhancers in the developing brain and cardiomyocytes, highlighting their potential contributions to human-specific gene regulation across multiple tissues.","[{""name"":""Duke University"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00py81415"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Duke Whitehead Scholarship;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35HG011332;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T32GM007748;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R37NS11038;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01MH132089;""},{""name"":""National Heart Lung and Blood Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012pb6c26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HL157277;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

More than half of human proteins, however, contain mixtures of disordered regions and one or more folded domains, and the biological function of these multi-domain proteins depends on the interplay between the folded and disordered regions. Here, we developed AF-CALVADOS, a coarse-grained simulation model that is informed by AlphaFold to model the dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins and multi-domain proteins containing mixtures of folded and disordered regions. AF-CALVADOS leverages information from AlphaFold 2 to model folded regions that we then integrate with the coarse-grained CALVADOS model. Our automated framework makes it possible to perform simulations of any soluble folded or disordered protein without manually defined folded regions, enabling scaling to the proteome level. We validate AF-CALVADOS using experimental data and consistency between our simulations and the AlphaFold 2 predicted aligned error matrix. We demonstrate the scalability of AF-CALVADOS by performing simulations of 12,483 cytosolic human proteins and make the data freely available; we envisage that large-scale simulation data generated by AF-CALVADOS can be used to benchmark or train machine learning models for flexible, multi-domain proteins. The conformational ensembles can be used to study sequence-dynamics-function relationships at scale, and can shed light on the interplay between folded and disordered regions. We exemplify this by analysing the disordered regions in 1,487 human transcription factors.","[{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04txyc737"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF18OC0033950;NF18OC0032608;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Numerous lethal alleles persist in wild populations at higher frequencies than expected given their extreme deleterious nature. Though these findings spurred historical debate whether classical balancing selection maintains some lethal alleles at elevated frequencies (versus mutation-selection balance acting alone), we propose the question remained unanswered, especially given that the genetic basis of most naturally occurring lethal effects is still unknown. Given current genome-wide point mutation rate estimates, mutation-selection balance alone cannot explain some of this lethal variation in nature. However, evolutionary biologists have historically studied genetic variation through a lens of single nucleotide variants, when in fact the spectrum of mutational changes is far broader than point mutations alone, including indels, structural variants, short tandem repeats, and transposable element insertions. We uncover the genetic basis of lethality in nature and provide insight on the possible evolutionary forces allowing some to persist at higher frequencies. By locating hundreds of recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster via complementation testing, fine-mapping, and sequencing a subset, we determine candidate lethal mutations in specific genes. We discover that many lethal disruptions are caused by transposable element insertions, potentially suggesting a higher mutation rate more compatible with mutation-selection balance. The most common transposable element in our data is estimated to have recently invaded D. melanogaster (between 2013-2016). This finding demonstrates that the many lethal alleles studied in D. melanogaster in the last century had a distinct genetic basis. Hence, we propose a model that could explain lethal variation in natural populations of D. melanogaster: lethal mutation frequencies are driven by invasions of new transposable elements and as time passes after each invasion, those frequencies decline as D. melanogaster evolves suppression mechanisms, allowing for natural selection to more efficiently remove lethal insertions. Upon the invasion of a new TE, the cycle repeats. The ubiquity of lethal alleles in natural populations is a classic conundrum for evolutionary geneticists for over a century, and this study utilized modern tools and sequencing technology to provide novel insight into this age-old mystery.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

We introduce a population-scale framework that unites three unprecedented resources: whole genome data from 504,000 individuals in the Emirati Genome Program (EGP); electronic health record (EHR) data from 426,000 of these participants through phenoEGP, phenotype resource derived from Malaffi; and genetically reconstructed pedigrees, made possible by the rich familial structures within the EGP. Together, these datasets enable real-world penetrance estimation of rare variants at a population scale, stratification of individuals and families by clinical actionability, and the discovery of novel IRD-associated variants. Among 1,879 known variants, we found 96 high or complete penetrance, supporting clinical integration, while 36 showed null penetrance, warranting reclassification. We identified 2,131 asymptomatic individuals and 1,013 families as potential candidates for preventive care. Using phenotype-first familial prioritization, we identified 69 likely pathogenic variants among high-disease-burden families, including a novel biallelic BBS12 variant confirmed through cross-cohort screening.

Using a nanoluciferase (Nluc)-expressing attenuated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 lacking the open reading frames (ORF) 3a and 7b ({Delta}3a7b-Nluc), we characterized resistance profiles of two broadly protective NAbs targeting the S receptor binding domain (RBD) in S1 (1301B7) and the stem helix domain (SH) in S2 (1249A8). Serial passaging of {Delta}3a7b-Nluc under selective pressure identified a 1301B7 antibody-resistant mutants (ARM-B7) harboring an RBD mutation (S371F) that conferred resistance to 1301B7 and other RBD-directed NAbs (Casirivimab, SC27 and Sotrovimab). In contrast, no ARM emerged under treatment with 1249A8, or an antibody cocktail of 1301B7 (RBD) + 1249A8 (SH).

Together, our findings provide critical insights into developing next-generation resistance-evading NAb therapies against SARS-CoV-2, and potentially other coronaviruses, and demonstrate the value of using our attenuated viral platforms for the safe identification of ARM without the potential biosafety concerns of doing these experiments using wild-type (WT) forms of SARS-CoV-2.","[{""name"":""NIAID"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 AI161363;75N93021C00014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

In this work we propose a framework to capture this interplay by decomposing residues into collections of oriented rigid bodies, allowing us to apply SE(3) flow matching for all-atom protein structure generation. Our method, ProteinZen, generates designs with high sequence-structure consistency while retaining competitive diversity and novelty on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks.

At the molecular level, these responses are partly mediated by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. In Arabidopsis thaliana, numerous studies have examined stress-induced changes in DNA methylation, aiming to elucidate their roles in stress acclimation. However, comparing these studies remains difficult due to variations in analytical methods and focus. To address this, we conducted an integrative analysis of 13 studies (16 datasets) using a unified bioinformatic pipeline to identify common and stress-specific methylation responses. Our results show that the number and distribution of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) vary by stress type and methylation context CG, CHG, and CHH. CG DMRs were primarily located in gene bodies, while CHG and CHH DMRs were enriched in transposable elements (TEs). Gene Ontology analysis revealed consistently enriched stress-related terms across conditions, indicating shared epigenetic regulation. As TEs have been proposed to act as stress sensors and regulators of nearby gene expression, we examined gene-proximal TEs in more detail. We found significant enrichment of stress-responsive methylation changes in LINE/L1, RathE1_ons, and DNA/HAT elements. While stress-induced methylation is often considered transient, many affected CG DMRs overlapped with loci known to accumulate stable epimutations over generations, suggesting that stress may contribute to long-term heritable epigenetic variation. These findings enhance our understanding of epigenetic regulation in plant stress responses, highlighting both shared and stress-specific methylation dynamics.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Exploring these mechanisms has proven instrumental in understanding how tissues robustly develop and prevent tumor initiation. Here, we investigate how epithelial tissues preserve their architecture and cell number in the face of spindle mis-orientation. Spindle mis-orientation, due to the lack of spindle pulling forces, centrosomes, or mitotic rounding, can cause epithelial cells to be mispositioned within or outside the tissue, leading to significant cell loss. By inducing spindle mis-orientation in Drosophila epithelial tissue, we first found that acentrosomal microtubules and cell contractility prevent excessive epithelial cell loss by enabling mispositioned cells to reintegrate into the epithelium. However, this mechanism alone is insufficient to maintain the total epithelial cell number. We uncovered that epithelial mechanics and cell size sensing monitor and compensate for epithelial cell loss predominantly by reducing physiological apoptosis through Hippo/YAP signaling. Lastly, we found that systemic TNF signaling protects the organism by eliminating potentially harmful non-reintegrating cells. Overall, our results delineate the complementary roles of mechanics and systemic signaling in controlling cell number and position at both tissue and organismal levels.","[{""name"":""ERC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0489qz649"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SL220130607097;""},{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TiMecaDiv 20CE13000801;ChronoDamage 20CE13-0013;11-LBX-0044, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02;""},{""name"":""CANCERO-INCA"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PLBIO2020/BELLAICHE;""},{""name"":""Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UMR 3215;""},{""name"":""Inserm"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02vjkv261"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U934;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04t0gwh46"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UMR 3215 U934;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Our platform comprises a two-tiered screening approach: a primary screen measuring growth inhibition in sensitized in S. cerevisiae (yeast) strains and a secondary screen that relies on production of a fluorescent protein as a readout for splicing inhibition. Using this approach, we identified 4 small molecules that cause accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNA in vivo in yeast. In addition, cancer cells expressing a myelodysplastic syndrome-associated splicing factor mutation (SRSF2P95H) are more sensitive to one of these compounds than those expressing the wild-type version of the protein. Transcriptome analyses showed that this compound causes widespread changes in gene expression in sensitive SRSF2P95H-expressing cells.

Leveraging the high spatiotemporal fidelity of intracranial recordings in humans (N = 30), we provide evidence that mental sound manipulation involves the inhibition of sensory cortex and the coordinated engagement of memory and control networks. This modulation manifests in two ways. First, there is a shift in the balance between faster (> 30 Hz) and slower (< 30 Hz) dynamics in primary and secondary auditory areas, suggesting a decrease in local excitability. Second, there is a distributed increase in oscillatory synchrony (6-10 Hz), which predicts imagery vividness and task performance. This evidence points to a key role of local excitability and inter-areal synchrony in the manipulation of thought.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

The ICM proposes that serially developing features, such as molar teeth, is governed by the relative magnitudes of one activating and one inhibiting developmental process. The statistical expectations of the ICM are typically expressed and analyzed on a first-element standardized scale and seem to be a good predictor of molar proportions. However, the ICM has been applied to traits that occur in series but do not develop in sequence and still recovers as good a fit as when applied to serially developing traits. Such an undiscriminating result raises questions about whether the fit of the ICM is an artifact of standardization. The mathematical rendition of the ICM do not correspond with the verbal descriptions of the developmental argument. Applying our novel re-articluation of the ICM to biological, non-biological, and simulated data, we demonstrate that the apparent goodness of fit of the ICM to many biological systems is an artifact of scaling correlated values with a common denominator. There is little evidence supporting the ICM at the developmental, variational, or evolutionary levels.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Since 2019, chicks on the New Zealand mainland have been affected by a deadly neonatal disease called respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), contributing to a decline to fewer than 143 breeding pairs. To investigate the putative genetic basis of this disease, we generated high-quality whole-genome data from 249 individuals spanning the species' range, including from the New Zealand mainland (Northern range) and subantarctic Enderby and Campbell Islands (Southern). Population genomic analyses unexpectedly revealed three deeply divergent lineages with negligible gene flow, consistent with recognition of three distinct subspecies. Phylogenetic divergence dating suggests that these splits predate human arrival by several millennia, with the Northern lineage diverging from the Southern populations 5-16 ka. Genome scans for local adaptation revealed regions of strong differentiation, and genome-wide association analyses identified candidate immune and respiratory genes linked to RDS. In partnership with Ngai Tahu, who hold indigenous guardianship over yellow-eyed penguins, we recommend recognition of three subspecies, urgent conservation action for the critically small and rapidly declining Northern subspecies, and the need for immediate population size and trend assessments for Auckland and Campbell Island populations.","[{""name"":""Genomics Aotearoa"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Approximately half of affected individuals carry a pathogenic brain mosaicism in the X-linked SLC35A2 gene, and all suffer from epilepsy. In this work, we extended the search for genetic alterations of MOGHE by investigating sex chromosome copy number alterations in 29 brain tissue samples from 19 males and 10 females with histopathologically confirmed MOGHE. Twenty individuals carried pathogenic SLC35A2 variants, while no genetic alteration was identified in nine individuals using targeted deep panel sequencing. Interestingly, DNA methylation-derived copy number variation (CNV) plots revealed significant gains of the Y chromosome in 16/19 males (84.2%) and in 5/10 females (50%). These findings were validated by chromogenic and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (ISH), PCR amplification of Y-specific sequences, and microscopic localisation of cells with Y-chromosomal gain in clusters of oligodendroglial hyperplasia. PCR and ISH demonstrated lesion-restricted Y-chromosome gains, absent in the overlying non-lesional neocortex. Together with pathogenic variants in the X-chromosomal SLC35A2 gene, Y-chromosomal sequences detected in phenotypic females and mosaic Y chromosome gains in males provide a genomic correlate for all cases of MOGHE. Based on SLC35A2 mutational status and Y-chromosome copy number changes, we stratified the cohort into three subgroups: SLC35A2-mutant without Y gain (SLC+/Y-, n = 8), SLC35A2-mutant with Y gain (SLC+/Y+, n = 12), and SLC35A2-wild type with Y gain (SLC-/Y+, n = 9). These genetically defined subgroups also differed in their clinical presentation, with individuals from group 2 having the earliest disease onset and the largest lesion volume on MRI. These findings expand the genetic spectrum of epileptogenic cortical malformations and highlight a potentially overlooked role of sex chromosome biology in this focal epilepsy.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1761084589781

The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a valuable experimental model to study immunity and the pathophysiology of brain infections. The exact cellular pathways through which brain-specific immune responses are mounted in Drosophila, however, remain poorly characterized. Here, we investigated how brain-specific or systemic infection with Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli bacteria activates the Drosophila NF-{kappa}B innate immune pathways Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) in the central nervous system of the fly. We tested the hypothesis that these pathways are acutely activated in the Drosophila brain, and that their activation persists over time, even if bacteria have been cleared. We demonstrate that in control genotypes, brain-specific bacterial infection leads to Drosomycin (Drs, Toll pathway) and Diptericin B (DiptB, IMD pathway) upregulation and that glia appear to be the primary cell type mounting this immune response at both early and later stages of infection, although some activation is observed in neurons as well. We show that the upregulation of Drs and DiptB expression also depends on canonical components of the Toll and IMD pathways, respectively. Interestingly, we found that systemic infection with M. luteus leads to brain-specific Drs activation and that signals from the fat body and hemocytes can activate the Toll pathway in the brain, pointing to an inter-organ communication. Together, these results contribute to our understanding of how non-lethal bacterial infections result in activation of NF-{kappa}B immunity in Drosophila brain that could potentially be targeted to prevent progression of neurodegeneration.","[{""name"":""Merrymac/McKinley Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""University of Alabama Graduate School"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Predicting the spectrum of these mutations is important for designing effective antibiotic treatments, but the underlying regulatory networks are large and complex, making them difficult to map experimentally. To address this challenge, we developed a mathematical framework that integrates dynamical equations for efflux pump regulation with a genetic algorithm for parameter estimation and evolutionary simulations. Using this framework, we simulated in silico evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa under exposure to the antibiotics meropenem, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin. The simulations revealed mutational spectra affecting the expression of four RND efflux pumps and their shared regulatory network. The most frequently mutated genes were single-target regulators that matched well with previous observations in clinical and in vitro studies. The model also showed that the shared use of the OprM protein by two pumps is a key factor shaping their distinct mutational patterns. Mutations often produced multi-trait phenotypes, manifesting as collateral sensitivity or cross-resistance to antibiotics not used for selection. While cross-resistance evolved readily, its extent depended on initial pump expression levels and thus may vary between strains. Finally, simulations of changing environments showed that efflux pump genes tend to be lost in the absence of antibiotics, suggesting a potential strategy to steer bacterial evolution toward reduced capacity to re-evolve resistance.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

At high plasmid copy numbers, the intracellular equilibrium of tetA+ and tetA- plasmids robustly responds to tetracycline through rapid evolutionary dynamics. Theory predicts that the GFP response to tetracycline is determined by the covariance between GFP expression and bacterial fitness.

The DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), classically defined as the maintenance methyltransferase that preserves DNA methylation patterns during replication, exemplifies this versatility. Beyond its canonical role, DNMT1 is highly expressed in the developing and adult brain, where it contributes to transcriptional regulation in postmitotic neurons. Notably, cytoplasmic DNMT1 localization has been observed in neural cells, and emerging evidence links DNMT1 to mitochondrial function with implications for neurodegenerative disease, whereby the underlying functional mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized cytosolic function of DNMT1 in developing cortical excitatory neurons. Through genetic perturbation, proteomics, and high-resolution imaging, we show that DNMT1 regulates dendritic and axonal branching independently of its catalytic activity and nuclear localization. Instead, DNMT1 operates as a cytosolic scaffold interacting with the polarity regulator DOCK7 to modulate Rac1/STMN1 signaling, microtubule dynamics, and organelle trafficking. These findings expand the conceptual framework of DNMT1 from a genome guardian to a dual-compartment regulator that coordinates cytoskeletal remodeling and mitochondrial positioning. Beyond advancing our understanding of neuronal morphogenesis, this work provides mechanistic insight into how DNMT1 mutations may lead to neurodegenerative diseases.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ZI-1224/13-1;ZI-1224/13-1;368482240/GRK2416;""},{""name"":""Excellence Strategy of the Federal Government and the Länder"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OPSF678;OPSF812;SFASIA002;""},{""name"":""European Union&#8722;NextGenerationEU-HEAL ITALIA"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PE00000019;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

The clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi is especially well-suited for investigating the neuronal and genetic underpinnings of these behaviors5. Unlike most ant species, O. biroi lacks a queen caste. Instead, colonies consist entirely of regular workers and slightly larger intercaste workers6. All workers reproduce in synchrony via parthenogenesis, giving rise to age-matched cohorts of clonally identical offspring7,8. This unique life history enables precise experimental control over age, genotype, and colony composition. These features have also facilitated the introduction of genetically encoded calcium indicators into O. biroi, enabling in vivo two-photon imaging to investigate the neural basis of social behaviors9. Despite its promise as a neuroscience model, the structure of the clonal raider ant brain has not been systematically characterized, and a representative reference brain does not exist. To address this gap, we imaged the brains of 40 age-matched, genetically identical individuals with confocal microscopy and, using 3D groupwise registration, generated the first reference brain for the species. We introduce a registration pipeline to align brains to this reference, facilitating the comparison of anatomical features across labeling experiments with high spatial precision. Unexpectedly, despite homogeneity in genotype, age, and external morphology, we discovered extensive interindividual variability across our collection of brain samples. This raises the possibility that behavioral division of labor in O. biroi is linked to individual differences in brain structure.

Here, we identified microglia as key regulators of memory accessibility in infancy. We profiled dynamic changes in microglial morphology across the postnatal window that parallelled the onset of infantile forgetting. We found that pharmacological inhibition of microglial activity during a specific postnatal window prevents infantile amnesia for a contextual fear memory, implicating microglia as active modulators of infant memory persistence. Using activity-dependent tagging of infant encoded engram cells, we demonstrated that microglial inhibition alters engram size and engram reactivation in the amygdala and results in changes in microglia-engram cell interactions. Furthermore, we characterized a relationship between microglial dysfunction and the lack of infantile amnesia in MIA offspring. Together, these findings reveal a novel role for microglia in regulating infant memory retrieval and suggest that microglial dysfunction may contribute to altered memory trajectories in neurodevelopmental disorders.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""715968;""},{""name"":""Science Foundation Ireland"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0271asj38"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""15/YI/3187;""},{""name"":""Irish Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/051xex213"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GOIPG/2020/1294;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R01NS121316;""},{""name"":""Jacobs Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03tj32a09"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Despite the poor prognostic impact established by increasingly sensitive MRD detection methods, the molecular pathways defining MRD remain unknown. To identify the unique features of MRD and the molecular forces shaping its progression, we performed single-cell multi-omic profiling on DNA, RNA and protein layers for a longitudinal patient cohort with relapsed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) after stem cell transplantation (SCT), the only curative modality for MDS. We provide a comprehensive molecular portrait of MRD cells with novel markers, shared across genetically heterogeneous patients. MDS relapse after SCT manifested universally with marked phenotypic evolution. Genotype and phenotype analyses revealed MRD progression as a dynamic, evolutionary process rather than a static expansionary one, driven by both subclonal sweeping and cell state transitions. Malignant cells adapted to infiltrating T cells by rewiring IFN-{gamma} responses to activate a key immunoevasive pathway.

Downstream analyses of GWAS summary statistics require accurate in-sample LD, the variant correlations in the same individuals used for the GWAS, as even small discrepancies can propagate into substantial error. In practice, privacy and consent restrictions prevent sharing of individual-level genotypes, forcing researchers either to rely on external reference panels, which reduce accuracy and power, or to store and distribute massive precomputed LD matrices that are inflexible and difficult to analyze. Here we introduce SAFE-LD (Shrinkage and Anonymisation Framework for LD Estimation), a novel method that produces pseudo-genotypes designed to reproduce the exact in-sample LD of a cohort, while discarding all individual-level genetic content. SAFELD surrogates can be stored in VCF/PGEN formats and used seamlessly with standard pipelines, providing LD estimates indistinguishable from the originals but free from privacy concerns. Using extensive simulations on UK Biobank data, we show that SAFE-LD is robust across genomic regions and population sizes. Notably, SAFE-LD achieves finemapping accuracy on par with internal LD, and significantly outperforms external LD even under best-case conditions with cohort-matched reference panels. We further extend this framework to existing GWAS summary statistics through SAFE-LDss, which exploits existing published summary statistics where numerous traits have been analyzed on the same samples. SAFE-LD offers a scalable, privacy-preserving, and highly accurate alternative to traditional LD estimation, enabling easy sharing and seamless utilization with standard tools. By storing compact pseudo-genotypes instead of massive precomputed LD matrices, it also provides a highly efficient solution in terms of disk space and data management, while safeguarding participant privacy and supporting precise fine-mapping.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Recent reports have claimed that deep learning-based perturbation models fail to outperform simple, uninformative baselines, raising doubts about their utility. Here, we show that these conclusions largely stem from limitations of benchmarking metrics, not from the models themselves. We introduce a framework for evaluating benchmark metric calibration using positive and negative controls, including a new positive control baseline (the interpolated duplicate) and a quantitative calibration measure (the dynamic range fraction). Across 14 perturbation datasets and 13 evaluation metrics, we find that conventional metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and control-referenced delta correlation (Pearson({triangleup}ctrl)) are often poorly calibrated, whereas weighted and rank-based alternatives exhibit consistent calibration. Under well-calibrated metrics, deep learning models outperform mean, control, and linear baselines, and in some cases even surpass the additive baseline in combination-prediction tasks. Calibrated evaluation thus explains prior reports of model underperformance, revealing that deep learning models do outperform uninformative baselines.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

One issue determining their status is species taxonomy. A recent mtDNA analysis compiled from several previous studies found they were united as one species, with weak support for a western sublineage and four haplogroups correlated with specific geographic regions. However, the crucial section of their midrange, Bhutan, was absent from that analysis. Now, sequences from red pandas in Bhutan have been added to that dataset and reanalyzed here. Phylogenetic analyses of these data, 91 haplotypes from [~]770 samples representing the entire red panda range, indicate again that red pandas are only one species, based on mtDNA. Bhutan hosted three of the previously defined four haplogroups and both putative subspecies (red and pink A. f. fulgens, orange A. f. styani). However, with the addition of the Bhutan missing link, the haplogroups graded even more into one another phylogeographically across their range, effectively displaying a genetic cline. Additionally, no large geographically specific subclade representing a subspecies was significantly supported within the large clade grouping all red pandas as one species. This study further reinforces the conservation priority of encouraging gene flow via protecting prime habitat areas internationally, connected by wildlife corridors and transboundary cooperation, allowing natural evolution for species survival.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Accordingly, CI recordings are prime candidates for population-level latent variable analyses, for example using models such as Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA), hidden Markov models (HMMs), and latent dynamical systems. However, these models have been primarily developed and fine-tuned for electrophysiological measurements of spiking activity. To adapt these models for use with the calcium signals recorded with CI, per-neuron fluorescence time-traces are typically either de-convolved to approximate spiking events or analyzed directly under Gaussian observation assumptions. The former approach, while enabling the direct application of latent variable methods developed for spiking data, suffers from the imprecise nature of spike estimation from CI. Moreover, isolated spikes can be undetectable in the fluorescence signal, creating additional uncertainty. A more direct model linking observed fluorescence to latent variables would account for these sources of uncertainty. Here, we develop accurate and tractable models for characterizing the latent structure of neural population activity from CI data. We propose to augment HMM, GPFA, and dynamical systems models with a CI observation model that consists of latent Poisson spiking and autoregressive calcium dynamics. Importantly, this model is both more flexible and directly compatible with standard methods for fitting latent models of neural dynamics. We demonstrate that using this more accurate CI observation model improves latent variable inference and model fitting on both CI observations generated using state-of-the-art biophysical simulations as well as imaging data recorded in an experimental setting.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

However, most computational methods rely on three-dimensional structural models, which are often unavailable for many complexes.

ResultsWe introduce BindPred, a structure-agnostic input framework that predicts affinities directly from amino acid sequences by combining embeddings from large protein language models with gradient boosting trees. On the PPB-Affinity benchmark, which comprises 11,919 diverse complexes, BindPred achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.86 in random split five-fold cross-validation, where the training and test sets share <30% global sequence identity. Ablation analysis indicates that evolutionary embeddings alone capture most of the predictive signals, while augmenting with physics-based energy terms from PyRosetta and BindCraft increases the correlation by only 0.01. A more stringent protein-level split that places entire protein families (wild-type and all mutants) exclusively in either training or testing sets, results in only a modest decline in performance, demonstrating robust generalization to novel interaction pairs. Because BindPred operates exclusively on sequence input, it enables rapid inference (approximately 3 million complexes per GPU (T4) hour), making proteome-scale screening computationally feasible.

Conventional transformation methods rely on purified DNA and physical force to drive uptake into the chloroplast, often resulting in DNA shearing and thus low transfer efficiency for large constructs. Bacterial conjugation offers an attractive alternative as this is an entirely in vivo process, enabling DNA transfer without any physical manipulation. To assess the feasibility of this approach, we attempted to generate an Escherichia coli donor strain carrying both the broad-host-range conjugative plasmid pTA-Mob (52.7 kb) and the cloned Phaeodactylum tricornutum chloroplast genome (pPt_Cp, 132.9 kb). Unexpectedly, pTA-Mob and pPt_Cp proved incompatible: co-maintenance could not be achieved via electroporation, and conjugation with a self-transmissible pTA-Mob variant resulted in a [~]10{square}-fold decrease in transfer efficiency. Systematic testing of pTA-Mob and pPt_Cp plasmid variants as well as sequence analysis of evolved transconjugants revealed that the incompatibility arose from the pBBR1 replicon present in pTA-Mob. Guided by these insights, we identified an alternative conjugative plasmid, pRL443, that was compatible with pPt_Cp. Together, these findings provide a framework for dissecting plasmid incompatibility when working with large constructs and establish a functional conjugative system capable of mobilizing the P. tricornutum chloroplast genome.","[{""name"":""Advanced Research + Invention Agency (ARIA)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PROP-PR01-P003;""},{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN-2025-05428;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

In this study, we applied an integrative approach, combining behavioral assays with neurophysiological recordings, to investigate hippocampal circuit integrity. We used Octodon degus, a rodent with exceptional longevity (up to 10 years in laboratory conditions), as a natural model of aging and neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer. To assess age-related cognitive changes, we employed three behavioral tasks: Novel Object Recognition (NOR), Open Field (OF), and the Burrowing Test (BT). The BT reflects Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and is based on species-typical spontaneous burrowing behavior, which has been linked to neurodegenerative markers in degus. We also performed multielectrode electrophysiological recordings to assess GABAergic function in the hippocampus. Aged degus with high BT performance (classified as good burrowers, or GB) showed robust hippocampal activity, especially in the CA3 region, a key hub for signal integration and memory encoding. In contrast, degus with poor BT performance (bad burrowers, or BB) exhibited reduced spontaneous hippocampal activity, suggesting potential compensation via GABA-independent synaptic mechanisms. Altogether, our findings suggest that preserved GABAergic function supports cognitive resilience in aging degus. These results offer new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying healthy cognitive aging and may inform future strategies for preventing or mitigating neurodegeneration.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Arabidopsis AGO1 effects post-transcriptional silencing by microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and is necessary for siRNA amplification through conversion of RISC target RNAs into double-stranded RNA by the RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase RDR6 and its mandatory cofactors SGS3 and SDE5. Many AGO proteins harbor hydrophobic pockets that interact with tryptophan residues, often surrounded by glycine (GW/WG), in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of RISC cofactors. Here, we show that GW/WG dipeptides in the IDR of SGS3 and the hydrophobic pockets in AGO1 are required for fully functional RDR6-dependent siRNA amplification. We also show that this mechanism requires AGO1-specific structural elements, including positively charged residues surrounding the binding pockets, and a conserved, negatively charged patch in the IDR of SGS3.

While clonal expansions in the hematopoietic system have been extensively characterized and reported to be nearly ubiquitous, clonal mosaicism (CM) has more recently also been described across multiple solid tissues. However, outstanding questions remain about the parameters and processes of human somatic evolution in non-cancerous solid human tissues, including when clones arise, how they evolve over time, and what mechanisms lead to their expansion. Questions of timing and clonal dynamics can be addressed through phylogenetic reconstruction, which serves as a  temporal microscope, while uncovering the mechanisms of expansion necessitates simultaneous phenotypic profiling. To address this gap, here we develop Single-cell Miniaturized Automated Reverse Transcription and Primary Template-directed Amplification (SMART-PTA) for joint single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing for large scale and cost efficient interrogation of solid tissue CM. We established a workflow that generates hundreds of matched single-cell whole genome and transcriptome libraries within a week. We profiled phenotypically normal esophagus tissue from four aged donors and used somatic variants to build high-resolution single-cell lineages from >2,700 cells with accompanying transcriptomic information, reconstructing >70 years of somatic evolution. T cell expansions identified from T cell receptor (TCR) sequences validated the clonal structure of the single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based phylogenies and phylogenetic cross-correlation analysis showed that epithelial cells had higher degrees of shared ancestry by spatial location compared to immune cells. Mapping mutation signatures to the phylogenetic tree revealed the emergence of tobacco/alcohol exposure-related signatures later in life, consistent with the donors exposure histories. We identified variants in driver genes that were previously reported in the phenotypically normal esophagus, detecting clonal expansions harboring mutations in genes including TP53 and FAT1. We mapped the evolution of clones with both monoallelic as well as biallelic TP53 loss, including a clone associated with high expression of cell cycling genes and higher chromosome instability. Leveraging the matched transcriptome data, we uncovered cell type biases in mutant clones, with a higher proportion of TP53 or FAT1-mutant cells in an earlier basal epithelial cell state compared to wild-type cells. We further observed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) events on chromosome 9q that spanned the NOTCH1 locus in up to [~]35% of epithelial cells. Mapping CNLOH events to the phylogenetic tree revealed a striking pattern in which CNLOH was separately acquired many times, reflecting convergent evolution. Cells with CNLOH events were biased towards the earlier basal epithelial state, suggestive of a selective advantage that leads to prevalent recurrence of chr9q CNLOH. Together, we demonstrate that SMART-PTA is an efficient, scalable approach for single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome profiling to build phenotypically annotated single-cell phylogenies with enough throughput and power for application to normal tissue somatic evolution. Moreover, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the esophageal epithelium at high scale and resolution, providing a window into the dynamics and processes that shape clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues throughout a lifespan.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3NS132139;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R33 CA267219;""},{""name"":""NIDDK"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30 DK132710;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RM1HG011014;""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01d35cw23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Career Award for Medical Scientists;""},{""name"":""Vallee Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05nmp3276"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Scholar Award;""},{""name"":""Blood Cancer United"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00v7th354"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MacMillan Family Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

In Drosophila, previous work has shown that fruitless and doublesex transcription factors identify neurons driving sexually dimorphic behaviour. However, the organisation of dimorphic neurons into functional circuits remains unclear.

We now present the connectome of the entire Drosophila male central nervous system. This contains 166,691 neurons spanning the brain and ventral nerve cord, fully proofread and comprehensively annotated including fruitless and doublesex expression and 11,691 cell types. By comparison with a previous female brain connectome, we provide the first comprehensive description of the differences between male and female brains to synaptic resolution. Of 7,319 cross-matched cell types in the central brain, 114 are dimorphic with an additional 262 male- and 69 female-specific (totalling 4.8% of neurons in males and 2.4% in females).

This resource enables analysis of full sensory-to-motor circuits underlying complex behaviours as well as the impact of dimorphic elements. Sex-specific and dimorphic neurons are concentrated in higher brain centres while the sensory and motor periphery are largely isomorphic. Within higher centres, male-specific connections are organised into hotspots defined by male-specific neurons or the presence of male-specific arbours on neurons that are otherwise similar between sexes. Numerous circuit switches reroute sensory information to form conserved, antagonistic circuits controlling opposing behaviours.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""220343/Z/20/Z;221300/Z/20/Z;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00tw3jy02"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

A promising strategy for ""proteome editing"" is to use bifunctional molecules (e.g. PROteolysis-Targeting Chimeras or PROTACs1) that bring a target protein into proximity with a degradation or stabilization effector, but their broader application is constrained by a limited repertoire of well-characterized target or effector ""handles"". We asked whether coupling de novo protein design to a multiplex screening framework could address this gap by accelerating the discovery of effector handles for intracellular protein degradation, stabilization, or relocalization. Using LABEL-seq2, a sequencing-based assay that enables multiplex, quantitative measurement of protein abundance, we screened 9,715 de novo designed candidate effector handles for their ability to recruit a target protein to components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system3 (UPS) (FBXL12, TRAF2, UCHL1, USP38) or the autophagy pathway4 (GABARAP, GABARAPL2, MAP1LC3A). In a single experiment, we discovered hundreds of de novo designed effector handles that reproducibly drove either intracellular degradation (n = 277) or stabilization (n = 204) of a reporter protein. Validation of a subset of these hits in an orthogonal assay confirmed that sequencing-based measurements from the primary screen reliably reflected changes in intracellular abundance of the target protein. Successful effector handles were discovered for both the UPS (n = 194) and autophagy (n = 287) pathways, which provide complementary routes for programmable proteome editing. Autophagy-recruiting effector handles generalized to endogenous targets, as substituting the reporter-specific target handle with a high-affinity MCL1 binder5 reduced endogenous levels of this intracellular oncoprotein6. Moreover, directing autophagy-recruiting effector handles to the outer mitochondrial membrane dramatically perturbed mitochondrial networks in a manner consistent with synthetic tethering and sequestration7,8. Beyond generating a diverse repertoire of protein abundance or localization effector handles, our results establish a scalable, low-cost platform that links deep learning-guided protein design to functional cellular readouts, and chart a course toward a general framework for programmable proteome editing.","[{""name"":""National Heart Lung and Blood Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012pb6c26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31HL168982;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T32GM136534;""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV-043758;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG010632;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Here, we find that the promoter-proximal region is critical for cell-type specific enhancer-promoter compatibility. Using high-throughput genome-engineering in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), we systematically replace the endogenous Sox9 promoter with different libraries of core and extended (i.e. full) promoters and assess their response to long-range regulatory elements in mESCs and neural progenitor cells. We find that only a subset of full promoters is activated by distal neuronal enhancers and that the promoter-proximal region is necessary for this enhancer-promoter compatibility. Core promoters alone are insufficient to respond to distal enhancers but modulate the transcriptional output of responsive promoters. Our results suggest that within multipartite regulatory domains, the promoter-proximal region fulfills a facilitator-like function that filters and transmits signal from distal enhancers, ultimaltely conferring enhancer-promoter compatibility.","[{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101076709;101125530;813327;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IB 139/6-1;KR 5247/1-1;KR 5247/1-2;KR 5247/1-3;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

This is especially a problem in children, where cancer survivors experience a subsequent high risk of bone mineral deficits and fractures, normally seen in the older population. Here, we model this to show that early-life treatment with a single dose of the commonly used chemotherapy cisplatin profoundly impairs late-life bone health, and that these bone deficits are completely resolved through treatment with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). While we had previously shown that this same strategy protects against chemotherapy induced female infertility, this maintenance of aged bone health appears to be unrelated to endocrine changes due to protection of the ovarian reserve. Rather, this is driven by altered phosphorus homeostasis and protection against renal damage, which otherwise increases parathyroid hormone secretion to mobilise calcium stores from bone.

This revealed that selenoprotein production is limited by ribosome collisions that occur at inefficiently decoded selenocysteine codons. Accordingly, slowed translation elongation reduced collisions and enhanced selenocysteine decoding. Oxidative stress also slowed translation elongation and augmented selenoprotein production.

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV), presents a major health threat in Asia--especially in Japan, where multiple cases of cat-to-veterinarian transmission have been reported. To address the need for safer diagnostics, we sought to establish a sebum-based RNA virus detection method for cats. We designed primers that efficiently detected RNA from feline sebum while distinguishing it from human and feline DNA/RNA. Using this platform, we determined the ear to be the optimal sebum collection site and confirmed that feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) RNA can be reliably identified from ear sebum with sensitivity comparable to conventional blood-based testing. In addition, we detected SFTSV RNA from sebum samples of infected cat.

Regulation of this process is complex, depends on factors that include cell state and the subcellular environment, and is subject to modulation via crosstalk to processes like transcription or translocation. Here, we used cryo-electron tomography of native and antibiotic-perturbed Mycoplasma pneumoniae cells to resolve 140 maps that recapitulate bacterial translation during the initiation, elongation, termination, and recycling phases. We visualized multiple transcription-translation complexes, allowing us to propose a threading-based translation reinitiation mechanism, and to provide structural evidence for a long-hypothesized supercomplex that coordinates transcription, translation, and membrane attachment. We further resolved abundant membrane-associated large ribosomal subunits, and suggest that dissociation from membranes depends on the conditional initiation of new translation, consistent with a conserved mechanism in mammalian cells. This work visualizes the multilayered control of bacterial translation and demonstrates the power of in-cell structural biology to investigate regulatory circuits in gene expression.","[{""name"":""Independent Research Fund Denmark"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""0106-00010A;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2021-234620;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

When a protein is correlated with, but not causally linked to, disease, its genetic determinants can add unwanted variability to protein-disease associations. In such cases, removing the genetic component may improve their predictive performances.

Here, we tested this hypothesis by genetically adjusting 94 highly heritable proteins spanning diverse biological pathways and evaluating their associations with the onset of 37 diseases in 39,871 UK Biobank participants. Genetically adjusted proteins showed stronger associations in 88% of 1,312 significant protein-disease pairs, equivalent to a 30% median reduction in required sample size for comparable power. Of 96 protein-disease pairs with significant differences, all but one showed larger effects for adjusted proteins. Most proteins also showed consistently stronger associations with environmental and lifestyle factors once genetic effects were removed.

Finally, we constructed multi-protein scores from genetically adjusted proteins and demonstrated that they significantly improve prediction for 7 diseases compared to unadjusted proteins. These findings demonstrate that removing genetic effects from plasma proteins is an effective strategy to increase power for biomarker discovery and clinical trial design, consistent with the largely non-causal role of most plasma proteins in disease risk.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1761084589781

Using single-cell multiomics data for the cerebellum from human, macaque, marmoset, and mouse, we revealed that TE contributions to different cell types are shaped by differences in evolutionary constraint across cell types, as well as the preferential co-option of certain TEs in specific cell states. Using a sequence-based deep-learning model predicting cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility, we systematically assessed the co-option potential of TEs into cerebellar gene regulatory networks, identifying seventeen TE fragments with complex regulatory sequences in their ancestral states that facilitate their co-option as cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements. Primate-specific HERVL (human endogenous retrovirus L) is predominantly accessible in differentiating granule cells and other rhombic-lip-derived neuroblasts during hindbrain development, and contributes to species-specific gene expression patterns. Our study uncovers a pivotal role for TEs in the evolution of the cerebellum. More generally, it demonstrates how TEs can be directly co-opted into the gene regulatory networks of specific cell types and introduces a generalizable analytical framework for dissecting their contribution to mammalian regulatory evolution.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

However, these input-output functions can take surprisingly different forms. Here, we reconcile seemingly conflicting findings by considering the possibility that the hippocampus prioritizes different dimensions of visual similarity across different stages of learning. First, we generated a set of natural scene images from two visual categories and rigorously characterized visual similarity using a wide array of methods: neural networks, artificial intelligence models, and human perceptual and memory decisions. We then identified two orthogonal dimensions of visual similarity that each predicted memory interference, but that did so at distinct stages of learning. Using high-resolution fMRI, we then tested for dimension-specific input-output functions within the hippocampus. Within CA3 and dentate gyrus (CA3/DG), we show that dimensions of visual similarity were inverted (negative functions) at stages of learning when they contributed to memory interference. When the dimensions did not contribute to interference, functions were positive. These findings reveal that hippocampal representations of visually-similar stimuli are highly dynamic and critically depend on the dimensions of similarity that currently contribute to memory interference.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health grant NIH-NINDS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2R01NS089729;""},{""name"":""Ruth L.

It has been instrumental in the adaptation of mammalian species to diverse environments, as reflected by its rapid molecular evolution7,8. However, the origins and evolutionary dynamics of liver cell types and their structural organization remain largely unexplored. Here we report evolutionary analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data for liver cells from 17 species, spanning all major feeding strategies (herbivory, omnivory, carnivory, insectivory), great apes (including humans), placental clades (Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Laurasiatheria, Euarchontoglires), major mammalian lineages (placentals, marsupials, monotremes), and a bird as outgroup. Integrated with spatial transcriptomics, our data reveal that liver zonation--the compartmentalization of hepatocyte functions along the lobule, the livers fundamental anatomical and functional unit--is conserved across mammals but absent in other vertebrates. We find that zonation originated in the mammalian ancestor, driven by the emergence of WNT and R-spondin signaling from central vein endothelial cells, which activate central hepatocyte gene expression via the transcription factor TCF7L2. Despite this conserved architecture and signaling, genes with zonated expression exhibit rapid evolutionary turnover. Consistently, hepatocytes evolve fast, likely due to reduced selective constraints, enabling adaptive changes under positive selection. Alongside immune cells, hepatocytes are therefore key drivers of the livers rapid evolution and functional innovations. In great apes, we identify human-specific shifts in zonation and cell-type-specific expression linked to recent cis-regulatory changes, particularly in genes involved in lipid metabolism, likely contributing to human-specific metabolic traits. Our study uncovers the origins of a mammal-specific liver cell architecture, within which reduced constraints facilitated molecular changes underlying ecological adaptations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Here, we identify the PRC2 accessory protein AEBP2 as a specific genetic dependency in EZH2-mutant DLBCL. While AEBP2 acts through PRC2, its essential role is surprisingly independent of canonical H3K27me3-mediated gene silencing. Instead, AEBP2 functions within a PRC2.2 complex lacking JARID2, using its zinc-finger domains to sample intergenic chromatin to sustain H3K27me2. Notably, loss of AEBP2 or NSD2 caused contrasting changes in intergenic H3K27me2 levels, driving sensitivity or resistance to PRC2 inhibitors, respectively. Our findings identify AEBP2-PRC2.2-maintained intergenic H3K27me2 as a therapeutic vulnerability in EZH2-mutant DLBCL and highlight dysregulated H3K27me2 as an underappreciated form of PRC2 dysfunction in cancer, with important therapeutic implications.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

We introduce the BirdsPlus Index (BPI), a novel, scalable approach that integrates monitoring data, remote sensing, and conservation-weighted species scores to quantify deviations of observed site scores from spatiotemporally explicit expectations. Using nearly 29,000 recordings from the Macaulay Library, we generated acoustic checklists with the Merlin and BirdNET sound identification models under multiple detection thresholds. We matched these acoustic checklists with species-specific conservation values (BirdsPlus species scores), then trained random forest models to predict total, site-level biodiversity (the sum of these species scores) given environmental and effort covariates. The resulting model also enabled us to map expected BirdsPlus site scores across the landscape.

These scores integrate information on species conservation status, ecological roles, and phylogenetic and functional uniqueness. BPI was calculated as the residual between observed and expected site scores, thereby providing a direct site-level measure of conservation value. Across 30 sites, we found that BPI values were consistent across acoustic models and detection thresholds, with high-scoring sites supporting regionally uncommon breeders and habitat specialists. While acoustic- and observer-based (eBird) models showed differing spatial patterns, both aligned with known ecological drivers such as urban density, elevation, and wetland cover. Our results demonstrate that acoustic checklists can be used to model expected biodiversity over time and space, and that the BPI provides a robust, interpretable metric for evaluating the ecological integrity of local sites. Beyond its immediate application to conservation planning, this framework lays the foundation for global, real-time biodiversity monitoring that leverages automated acoustic classifiers, citizen science, and remote sensing to integrate conservation value into development and management decisions.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Here, we investigated the neuroanatomical foundations of inter-individual variability in decision-making strategies. To this end, 122 healthy participants completed a gamified multi-armed bandit paradigm aimed at teasing apart distinct exploration-exploitation decision strategies. We also collected whole-brain quantitative MRI maps indexing microstructural features of cortical myelination and iron content.

Whole-brain regression analyses identified significant associations between value-free exploration and increased cortical myelination in right frontal brain areas with reported links to impulsivity. By elucidating the brain microstructural correlates of distinct exploration-exploitation strategies, we aimed to further our understanding of why individuals differ in their decision-making capabilities, and how decision-making may become aberrant in mental health conditions.","[{""name"":""Lundbeck (Denmark)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0564cd633"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R272-2017-4345;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC-2020-StG-948788;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""316955/Z/24/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Using 60 years of life-history data from over 83,000 individuals, and historical daily climate records, we show that developmental stages in wild great tits (Parus major) differ in their sensitivity to extreme climatic events (ECEs). Exposure to extreme cold events during the first week of development is particularly detrimental to fledging mass, while extreme rain events have a stronger negative impact as chicks grow older and their energetic requirements increase. Synergistic effects of ECEs and average climatic conditions can be particularly severe, exacerbating the challenges faced by these birds. Our findings indicate that combined exposure to extreme heat and heavy rainfall during early development is associated with a predicted reduction in fledging mass by up to 27%. Additionally, birth timing may further modulate these effects, since late-season broods exposed to frequent hot ECEs during early development are predicted to fledge nestlings up to 4.27 standard deviations (35%) lighter than broods laid earlier in the season. Moreover, phenotypic plasticity has enabled many similar populations to shift towards an overall earlier laying date, which may have increased susceptibility to cold extremes during development. However, our analyses suggest that the benefits of being part of an early-laid clutch within a season may, to some extent, offset the negative effects of extreme climate on fledging mass and apparent survival. In climate scenarios where ECEs are predicted to increase in frequency, duration, and severity, these developmental stage-specific insights are crucial for understanding how climate change may be influencing wild avian populations.","[{""name"":""Natural Environment Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02b5d8509"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NE/K006274/1;NE/S010335/1;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/L006081/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

The question of how we can entertain no thoughts while awake is challenging for the study of spontaneous thinking. By combining EEG-fMRI with experience sampling during task performance, we categorised changes in mental content and self-reported vigilance to map the neurophysiological signatures of MB. We demonstrate that fMRI connectivity around MB reports is characterised by a ""rich"" pattern of long and short-range signal anticorrelations. At the same time, sleepiness reports are linked to a ""simpler"" hyperconnected fMRI pattern, characterised by overall positive connectivity. Put together, an interaction appears: when people report being alert, connectomes around MB reports resemble the hyperconnected pattern, indicating that the neuronal correlates of MB depend on self-rated vigilance. The hyperconnected pattern also correlated with EEG slow-wave activity, tying MBs topology to sleep-like electrophysiology during wakefulness. Collectively, we show that distinct cortical events underlie the shared phenomenology of a thought-free mind. We conclude that MBs neurophysiological correlates vary across perceived vigilance levels and that more refined characterisation of the neuronal correlates of thought-less mental states exist.

However, whether skeletal muscle retains a memory of disuse remains unknown. We investigated repeated lower-limb immobilization in young adults and a refined aged rat model of repeated disuse, integrating multi-omics, histology, biochemistry, and primary human cell analyses. In young human muscle, a second period of disuse elicited an attenuated transcriptional response in oxidative and mitochondrial pathways, suggesting a protective molecular memory, although this did not translate into attenuated atrophy. In contrast, aged muscle exhibited a detrimental molecular memory, with greater atrophy, exaggerated suppression of aerobic metabolism genes/pathways despite recovery of these genes after initial disuse, depletion of NAD+ and mitochondrial DNA, and activation of proteasomal, extracellular matrix and DNA-damage pathways. Repeated disuse induced DNA hypermethylation and downregulation of aerobic metabolism and mitochondrial genes across species. NR4A1 remained suppressed into recovery after initial disuse in young human muscle, whereas acetylcholine receptor subunit genes (e.g., CHRNA1, CHRND) were epigenetically primed in humans and further upregulated with repeated atrophy in both young and aged muscle. NMRK2 was among the most downregulated genes after both periods of atrophy in humans, and nicotinamide riboside improved myotube size in primary human muscle cells derived post-atrophy. These findings reveal that disuse atrophy imprints a molecular memory in skeletal muscle- attenuated transcriptional resilience in young adults yet exaggerated susceptibility in aged muscle.","[{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""314157;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

These dynamics are central to predicting how species will respond to environmental change, particularly climate-driven shifts in plant phenology. The winter moth (Operophtera brumata) relies on synchronising larval egg hatch with leaf budburst of deciduous trees, yet whether they are locally adapted to their hosts phenology, and their capacity to track future change, remains unclear. Here, we investigated potential small-scale local adaptation of winter moths to oak tree phenology in Wytham Woods, UK, a 385-hectare woodland, within which oak budburst can vary by up to three weeks within a given year. We conducted laboratory temperature manipulation experiments using 76 clutches across six temperature treatments, and field translocation experiments using over 200 clutches. We combined these experiments with assessment of population structure from whole-genome sequencing of 59 individuals. This integrative approach allowed us to assess local adaptation in terms of phenotypic differences, fitness consequences, and genetic evidence. Temperature manipulations revealed systematic differences in the timing of egg hatching across temperature treatments at the clutch level which were linked to carry-over effects from the mothers emergence time, but unrelated to their source tree budburst timing. Field translocation experiments further showed no significant differences in survival of individuals transplanted to trees with phenology differing from their original host tree, and there was no genetic structure across the population. Together, these results reveal consistent differences in hatching phenology despite the absence of population structure, strong selection, or accordance with relative tree phenology. Our findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms maintaining close synchrony in trophic interactions at small scales, which may drive spatial variation in evolutionary responses to future climate change.","[{""name"":""UKRI Frontiers Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X024520/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting  spacetime attractor excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219525/Z/19/Z;225926/Z/22/Z;219627/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3955;GAT3755;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0040/2024-L;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 651-2023;""},{""name"":""Fondation Fyssen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589781

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589782

Here, we developed a new computational framework to minimize negative transfer for domain-adaptive brain decoding by reframing source selection as a mixture model parameter estimation problem, allowing each source subject to contribute through a continuous mixture weight rather than being outright included or excluded. To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer. Collectively, this research advances toward a more principled and generalizable brain decoding framework, laying the mathematical foundation for scalable brain-computer interfaces and other applications in computational neuroscience.","[{""name"":""Schroeder Institute for Brain Innovation and Recovery"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589782

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility.

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589782

Using polymer simulations and high-resolution live-cell microscopy, we identify rare but long-lived chromatin encounters arising from cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. These events occur when cohesin loads near the midpoint between two loci and extrudes them through a defined spatial radius, producing encounter durations that exceed those of random collisions. We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors. Our findings support a time-gated model of distal enhancer-promoter communication in which only rare, long-lived and mostly extrusion-driven encounters are productive, offering a unifying framework for how chromosome dynamics control transcription in single cells.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_192642;TMCG-3_213782;320030-236070;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 1305-2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589782

While infection is known to impair mitochondrial function and enhance glycolysis, the role of viral accessory proteins in these alterations remains unclear. Here, we investigate the metabolic impact of the accessory protein ORF7a. Lentiviral expression of ORF7a in human lung epithelial (A549) and monocytic (THP1) cells, coupled with integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, revealed profound dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. ORF7a impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reducing basal and maximal respiration, inducing mitochondrial depolarization, and increasing reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, ORF7a upregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), promoting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex phosphorylation and suppressing pyruvate oxidation. However, pharmacological PDK4 inhibition did not restore respiration. High-resolution respirometry in frozen samples revealed impaired complex I function, while Blue Native-PAGE demonstrated defective respiratory supercomplex assembly. By linking enzymatic inhibition with structural destabilization, our study uncovers a functional vulnerability of the mitochondrial respiratory chain to viral manipulation. These findings establish ORF7a as a key modulator of host metabolic reprogramming and highlight mitochondrial pathways as potential therapeutic targets in COVID-19.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589782

While open models for unconstrained ""minibinder"" design have shown great experimental promise, methods for designing binders in specific formats, such as antibodies, have lagged behind in experimental success rates. In this work, we present mBER, an open-source protein binder design system capable of designing antibody-format binders with state-of-the-art experimental success rates. mBER builds on the ColabDesign framework, achieving successful antibody design primarily through the inclusion of informative sequence and structure conditioning information. Using mBER, we designed two libraries comprising over 1 million VHH binders against 436 diverse targets. We experimentally screened the two libraries against 145 of these targets, resulting in a dataset of over 100 million binding interactions. We achieved specific and significant design success against 45% of targets. In a filtered set of designs, we detect binding rates to specific epitopes as high as 38%. Through mBER, we demonstrate that format-specific binder design is possible with no additional training of underlying folding and language models. This work represents the largest reported de novo protein design and validation campaign, and one of the first open-source methods to demonstrate double-digit percentage experimental success rates for antibody binder design.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589782

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589782

Little is known, however, about whether and how phages can establish long-term genetic stability. We addressed this eco-evolutionary question in an open marine animal associated system, through two longitudinal samplings years apart in an oyster farm, obtaining >1,000 virulent phages and >600 Vibrio crassostreae strains. Surprisingly, lineages of phage and bacteria were very persistent, with some phages remaining strictly identical after four years. The phage-vibrio infection network remained modular with multiple lineages co-habitating within individual oysters for long periods of time. Seasonal restriction of V. crassostreae, overwintering in wild oysters, and limited viral decay may explain phage stability. Oysters also act as hotspots of activity of diverse mobile genetic element (MGE), hosting plasmids, prophages, phage-plasmids and entirely new classes of satellite-plasmids. Our findings demonstrate how nested ecological constraints can stabilize viral lineages: oysters house vibrio populations that escape host immunity, vibrios restrict phages via receptors and defenses, and satellites parasitize their cognate helper phages. We suggest that ecological context can favor the long-term maintenance of viral lineages and stabilize MGE persistence in the ocean, even amid ongoing mutation and antagonistic co-evolution.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""884988;""},{""name"":""Canada Excellence Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02tvrwm90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-00051;""},{""name"":""FRQ-NT, Fonds des leaders John-R.-Evans"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""44584;""},{""name"":""ANR"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""20-CE35-0014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589782

Here, we describe a generative diffusion framework, RFDpoly, for generalized de novo biopolymer (RNA, DNA and protein) design, and use it to create diverse and designable RNA structures. We design RNA structures with novel folds and experimentally validate them using a combination of chemical footprinting (SHAPE-seq) and electron microscopy. We further use this approach to design protein-nucleic acid assemblies; the crystal structure of one such design is nearly identical to the design model. This work demonstrates that the principles of structure-based de novo protein design can be extended to nucleic acids, opening the door to creating a wide range of new RNA structures and protein-nucleic acid complexes.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589782

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has allowed proteome-scale quantification of hundreds of thousands of ubiquitination sites (ubi-sites), however the functional importance and regulatory roles of most ubi-sites remain undefined. Here, we assembled a human reference ubiquitinome of 108,341 ubi-sites by harmonizing public proteomics data. We identified a core subset of ubi-sites under evolutionary constraint through alignment of ubiquitin proteomics data from six non-human species, and determined ultra-conserved ubi-sites recurring at regulatory hotspots within protein domains. Perturbation proteomics revealed that these highly conserved ubi-sites are more likely to regulate signaling functions rather than proteasomal degradation. To further prioritize functional ubi-sites with roles in cellular signaling, we constructed a functional score for more than 100,000 ubi-sites by integrating evolutionary, proteomic, and structural features using machine learning. Our score identifies ubi-sites regulating diverse protein functions and rationalizes mechanisms of genetic disease. Finally, we employed chemical genomics to validate the functional relevance of high-scoring ubi-sites and leveraged genetic code expansion to demonstrate that ubiquitination of K320 in the RNA-regulator ELAVL1 disrupts RNA binding. Our work reveals systems-level principles of the ubiquitinome and provides a powerful resource for studying protein ubiquitination.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589782

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761084589782

Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching.
