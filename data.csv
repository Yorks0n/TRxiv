Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.

Such stresses can emerge from structural incompatibilities, which arise from the juxtaposition of layers of tissue with different intrinsic lengths. Although growth of individual plant cells is driven by mechanical stresses, the impact and role of tissue-scale internal residual stresses on shape dynamics at the organ scale remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce a novel theoretical framework in which the organ, described as a set of connected, concentric morphoelastic cylindrical shells representing distinct tissues, grows axially in response to its local elastic strain. This approach allows to formulate analytical expressions relating tissue-level differences in elasticity and intrinsic growth to macroscopic characteristics such as organ axial growth rates, bending motions, and residual stress profiles. To demonstrate the framework, we analyze a minimal two-layer model representing the epidermis and inner tissues, and use it to explore the ""epidermal growth control"" hypothesis, which posits that the epidermis regulates expansion by mechanically limiting inner tissue elongation. Our analysis also reveals a form of mechanical memory and accounts for observed phenomena such as autotropism.","[{""name"":""Israel Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04sazxf24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2307/22;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101165101;""},{""name"":""Canada Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0517h6h17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRC-2024-00031;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3395/PR4B;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756678079329

A central challenge is to program their dynamic behaviors using heritable genetic information, which would grant them the capacity to evolve. Here, we create transiently active RNA droplets by integrating sites for ribozyme catalysis directly into the sequence of self-assembling, four-arm RNA nanostars. To enable perfusion and observe the resulting dynamics over time, we develop a method for trapping individual droplets in hydrogel cages by targeted in situ photopolymerization. This enables us to quantify the sequence-programmable droplet dissolution and to control the degradation kinetics by choosing between fast (hammerhead) and slow (hairpin) ribozymes. Furthermore, we trigger the segregation of mixed droplet populations via the sequence-specific cleavage of a chimeric linker RNA. The droplet-encapsulated DNA templates code for the regrowth of new droplets, establishing the proof-of-principle for a minimal, genetically encoded cycle of dissolution and regrowth. By directly linking RNA sequence to droplet stability, composition, and life-cycle dynamics, our work provides a robust platform for engineering evolvable materials and advancing the bottom-up construction of synthetic cells.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101076997;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRC 392;EXC-2082/1 - 390761711;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGP003/2023;""},{""name"":""Carl Zeiss Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03ng4kg22"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756678079329

Assays such as H3K27ac HiChIP have been used to map enhancer-enhancer interactions and define enhancer communities; however, their reliance on antibody-based enrichment restricts scalability and cross-cell-type applicability. In contrast, Hi-C provides an unbiased, genome-wide view of chromatin architecture but lacks direct annotation of regulatory elements, limiting its utility for enhancer-focused analyses. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hi-Cociety--a graph-based computational framework and accompanying R package that infers 3D enhancer communities directly from Hi-C data, without relying on histone modification or chromatin accessibility measurements. Hi-Cociety constructs a network of significant interactions and applies clustering algorithms to define chromatin interaction modules. Applying Hi-Cociety to Hi-C measurements in T lymphocytes, we identified highly connected modules enriched for active transcription, chromatin accessibility, and histone acetylation. Notably, modules identified in T cells pinpoint critical genes central to T cell biology. Hi-Cociety also detects cell-type-specific differences in chromatin organization, highlighting dynamic regulatory rewiring across T cell states. Our findings underscore the importance of network properties-- connectivity, transitivity, and centrality--in shaping gene regulation through 3D genome organization. Hi-Cociety provides a scalable and versatile tool for mapping enhancer communities at scale, advancing our understanding of immune cell identity and the regulatory logic encoded in 3D chromatin structure.","[{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01d35cw23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U01 DK112217;R01AI168240;U01 DK127768;U01 DA052715;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756678079329

RBC transfusion is a highly effective therapeutic option in SCD, particularly due to its capacity to improve oxygen delivery and reduce sickling by introducing healthy red blood cells, but it is associated with a significant risk of transfusion-related complications. Our study investigates the treatment potential of M101, a novel hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier derived from the marine worm Arenicola marina, in a mouse model of SCD. M101s unique properties, including its high oxygen-carrying capacity and indirect antioxidant outcome, make it a promising candidate for ameliorating SCD pathophysiology. The study demonstrates that M101 administration significantly reduces RBC sickling and hemolysis in SCD mice. Furthermore, M101 infusion significantly prevents microvascular occlusion in liver and lung and attenuates the inflammatory response after vaso-occlusion induction. These findings highlight M101 strong potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for managing or preventing painful vaso-occlusive crises in SCD.

Full articles, reviews, conference papers, books and book chapters were included. In 2024, countries characterized as full democracies produced only 22% of the Scopus-indexed publications, versus 66% in 2006. There was no correlation between the ratio of publications indexed in 2024 versus 2006 and the absolute or relative change in Democracy Index between 2006 and 2024 (r=0.02 and r=0.00, respectively). 78% of publications in 2024 came from countries with problematic (including USA) or worse (including China) freedom of press.

While most enterovirus infections are mild and self-limiting, severe complications ranging from meningitis, encephalitis, to acute flaccid paralysis can occur, especially in children and immunocompromised patients. Despite the global burden of neurological complications caused by EV-D68 and EV-A71, the underlying neuropathogenesis remains poorly understood. In particular, the impact of the infection on neural function has not been clearly elucidated. Here, we compare the replication kinetics, cellular tropism, and electrophysiological effects of EV-D68 and EV-A71 infection in a physiologically relevant human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural co-culture model, consisting of excitatory neurons and astrocytes. Inoculation with contemporary circulating EV-D68 strains and an EV-A71 strain resulted in decreased neural activity in the co-cultures, with EV-D68 A2/2018 inducing the most rapid and robust negative effect on neural co-cultures, followed by EV-D68 B3/2019. EV-D68 strains preferentially infected neurons, whereas EV-A71 infection was detected in both cell types to the same extent. Despite the lack of viral release of infectious virus particles of EV-D68 B3/2019 in the supernatant, the infection could spread in the cultures and reduce neurotransmission.

This raises the possibility that they produce a convergent effect on the dynamics or temporal evolution of neural population activity. To explore this, we analyzed intracortical electrophysiological recordings during infusions of propofol, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine, using a rigorous method to estimate dynamical stability. We found that all three anesthetics, despite their molecular differences, similarly affect cortical states by destabilizing their dynamics. This destabilization matched the slower recovery from sensory perturbations and longer stimulus-induced autocorrelation times observed during the anesthetic infusions. The destabilization was also reflected predominantly in lower-frequency ranges, linking it to the well-known increase in low-frequency power during anesthesia. Finally, destabilization closely tracked real-time fluctuations in consciousness. Together, these findings suggest that cortical destabilization may be a shared neural correlate of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, offering a mechanistic explanation for low-frequency oscillations observed during anesthesia.","[{""name"":""Office of Naval Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rk2pe57"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MURI N00014-23-1-2768;MURI W911NF2410228;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R01MH131715-01;R01MH11559;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R21AG077275-01A1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756678079329

Based on the number of formants, two different coda quality categories have been described: a-codas and i-codas. In the present paper, we demonstrate that sperm whale codas not only resemble human vowels acoustically, but also pattern like them across several dimensions. First, traditional count- and timing-based coda types interact with coda ""vowel"" quality (a vs. i). Second, a-codas are generally longer than i-codas. Third, the duration of i-codas has a bimodal distribution, showing a contrast between short i-codas and long[i] -codas. Fourth, the baseline coda length differs across whales. And fifth, edge clicks mismatching their coda often match an adjacent coda, a phenomenon that resembles human coarticulation. All five properties have close parallels in the phonetics and phonology of human languages. Sperm whale coda vocalizations thus represent one of the closest parallels to human phonology of any known animal communication system.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSperm whales communicate using series of clicks known as codas. The codas acoustically resemble human vowels. In addition, they pattern in ways similar to human sound systems. For example, different coda types are correlated with particular click qualities, and their durations are intentionally controlled. This shows that sperm whale vocalizations are highly complex and likely constitute one of the most sophisticated communication systems in the animal kingdom. By studying it, we may be able to gain a broader understanding of animal intelligence and social behaviors, determine the impact of human activities on whale habitat, develop strategies to protect whales from threats such as noise pollution and ship traffic, and advance legislation which facilitates that protection.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756678079329
"Sparkling Water Consumption Mitigates Cognitive Fatigue during Prolonged Esports Play","10.1101/2025.06.27.662064","biorxiv",12.1,0,0,5.8999999999999995,9.249999999999998,"Takahashi, S.; Kosugi, W.; Mizuno, S.; Matsui, T.","Takashi Matsui","University of Tsukuba","2025-07-02","1","new results","cc_by","neuroscience","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2025/07/02/2025.06.27.662064.source.xml","Prolonged esports play induces cognitive fatigue, characterized by diminished executive function with pupil constriction. Players often rely on caffeinated or sugary drinks to combat fatigue, but regular use poses health risks. Sparkling water, a sugar- and caffeine-free beverage, stimulates brainstem and prefrontal activity via sensory pathways mediated by transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in the throat. We here tested the hypothesis that sparkling water mitigates cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play. Fifteen young adult players participated in a randomized crossover trial, each completing two 3-hour sessions of a virtual football game while consuming either sparkling water or plain water. Subjective fatigue, enjoyment, and executive function (via a flanker task) were measured at baseline and hourly, while pupil diameter and heart rate were monitored continuously. Blood glucose and salivary cortisol were also assessed periodically.

Compared to plain water, sparkling water significantly attenuated increases in subjective fatigue, enhanced enjoyment, and preserved executive function, along with preventing pupil constriction. Heart rate, blood glucose, and salivary cortisol levels did not differ between conditions. Notably, players committed fewer in-game fouls with sparkling water, while offensive and defensive performance remained unchanged. These findings demonstrate that sparkling water alleviates both subjective and objective signs of cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play, supporting our hypothesis. This non-caffeinated intervention may help sustain inhibitory control and promote fair behavior, offering a safe and sustainable strategy for managing mental fatigue in modern life.

Here, we connect cell state dynamics of type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2) in cholangitis with site-specific{gamma}{delta} T17 responses in liver and draining lymph nodes (LN).

MethodsThe 0.1% Diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-Dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet was used to generate an immunobiliary DC- and{gamma}{delta} T-enriched mouse liver and LN single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas covering temporal disease dynamics, resolution and cDC2B depletion. cDC2 trajectories were inferred using VarID2 and{gamma}{delta} T cell transcription factor (TF) regulon activity was predicted by SCENIC. The human biliary niche was resolved by integrating human liver scRNA-seq data with available spatial transcriptomics data. Functional studies were conducted using Tcrd knockout, Il17a/f knockout and Tcrd reporter mice.

ResultsA disease trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B was identified connecting DC maturation, homing and the expression of Il17-inducing genes. Disease progression was associated with numeric exhaustion of mature cDC2B and recruitment of DC precursors.{gamma}{delta} T cells were the main Il17 producers and were subtyped into Il17ahigh Scart1+ V{gamma}6+ and Il17low Scart2+ V{gamma}4+ populations exhibiting cDC2-directed communication and divergent TF regulon activity. Spatial proximity and conserved molecular interactions of cDC2 and{gamma}{delta} T cells were confirmed in human cholangitis. Il17-deficiency resulted in reduced liver fibrosis in mice, while cDC2B depletion attenuated{gamma}{delta} T17 cell states.

ConclusionsIn cholangitis, a profibrogenic function of{gamma}{delta} T cells is contingent on the induction by peribiliary cDC2B, thereby highlighting relevant disease determinants within the immunobiliary and liver-draining LN niche.

Impact and ImplicationsThe immunobiliary niche contains rare immune cells such as conventional dendritic cells and unconventional T cells, however, the function of these cell types in liver inflammation remains poorly understood. Mirroring human biliary diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, we induced experimental cholangitis in a mouse model to generate a site-specific single-cell sequencing atlas resource resolving underexplored cell populations. Our data capture a profibrotic hepatic disease state trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B inducing a{gamma}{delta} T cell-specific Il17-response, which is attenuated upon cDC2B depletion and in DC precursors, which are characterized by reduced genomic accessibility of{gamma}{delta} T cell-interacting genes.

These results highlight the importance of portal niche residing underexplored immune cell populations and the necessity to further resolve immunobiliary niche responses and crosstalk in inflammatory settings such as in cholangitis.
