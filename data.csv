G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are central to cellular signalling and represent one of the largest classes of therapeutic targets, yet their functional modulation remains challenging. Here, we present RareFoldGPCR (RFG), a GPCR-specialised AI model for structure prediction and design that supports NCAAs. By applying transfer learning on high-resolution GPCR structures, RFG accurately models and rationally designs both linear and cyclic peptides that incorporate NCAAs and modulate GPCR activity. This is achieved without the model ever being trained on NCAA-based GPCR modulators. We showcase the capability of RFG by designing peptide agonists for the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) and validating their functional activity experimentally in cell-based assays. We investigate the precise capabilities of generating active agonists by expanding different regions of the native GLP-1 hormone, and further demonstrate the design of cyclic peptide agonists with entirely novel sequences and topologies, creating new agonist modes. We analyse how design metrics relate to pathway specificity, enabling precise modulation of pathway activity, such as activating the cAMP response without recruiting {beta}-arrestin to reduce receptor desensitisation. RFG shows how transfer learning on specific target classes enables generalisation to new chemistry and molecular topology, providing a broadly applicable strategy for designing functional ligands beyond the constraints of natural amino acid chemistry.

Studies of West African arthropod diversity can therefore help address important questions regarding conservation, ecosystem services, and insecticide use and other species-control interventions in agriculture and disease management. We intensively sampled arthropods in Ghana using complementary trapping methods, generated DNA barcodes, and classified sequences by Barcode Index Numbers (BINs, a species proxy). Using this dataset, we investigate assemblage composition, temporal activity patterns, and the state of regional biodiversity sampling. Results: Sequencing DNA from 95,996 individuals captured using Malaise, yellow pan, pitfall, Heath and Centre for Disease Control (CDC) traps, we identified 10,120 unique BINs. The rate of species accumulation did not approach an asymptote for any taxonomic group or trap type, indicating high biodiversity. The different trap types sampled different subsets of the local community, with greatest similarity between yellow pan and pitfall traps. More insects and species (BINs) were trapped during the day than at night. Our dataset shared more BINs in the Barcode of Life Database with South Africa than with any other country, although this predominantly reflects the limited sampling and DNA sequencing campaigns in Africa. Conclusions: This study more than doubles the published BINs for West Africa, offering insights into the biodiversity of an ecologically important but understudied taxon and region. Using multiple trap types allowed a more complete assessment of the local arthropod assemblage. The public release of these data will support and stimulate further taxonomic and ecological work in the region.","[{""name"":""Open Philanthropy Project"",""id"":""https://ror.org/004d1k391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Yet, the mechanisms by which lipid imbalances are sensed and corrected to establish and maintain homeostasis are, in most cases, unknown. Here we present an expanded view of plasma membrane (PM) phosphoinositide metabolism by revealing an unexpected metabolic connection between two key anionic lipids in this membrane, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and phosphatidic acid (PA). PM pools of PI4P are generated by PI 4-kinase Type III (PI4KIII/PI4KA), an essential enzyme whose partial dysfunction leads to numerous hereditary human diseases. We find that depletion of PI4P by pharmacological inhibition of PI4KA increases the activity of phospholipase Ds (PLDs) and the levels of their lipid product, PA, in the PM. Guided by RNA-seq analysis and proximity labeling proteomics, we elucidate how cells connect this PI4P decrease to a compensatory increase in PA levels. Loss of PM PI4P induces a concomitant decrease of phosphatidylserine (PS) levels, and this metabolic rewiring activates a reciprocal relationship between PS synthesis and PLD-mediated PA generation. These metabolic changes also lead to transcriptional and translational upregulation of the small GTPase RhoB, which enhances PLD-mediated PA synthesis and subsequent actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Our study reveals how disease-relevant perturbation of phosphoinositide synthesis induces an integrated response that ultimately boosts levels of PA, a key anionic lipid and metabolic intermediate in phosphoinositide resynthesis.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM151682;DP1GM142101;Intramural Research Program;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

We design RNA structures with novel folds and experimentally validate them using a combination of chemical footprinting (SHAPE-seq) and electron microscopy. We further use this approach to design protein-nucleic acid assemblies; the crystal structure of one such design is nearly identical to the design model.

Mathematical modeling provides a powerful approach to bridge this gap by linking viral dynamics with immune interactions. In this work, we develop a mechanistic within-host model, formulated in a system of coupled ordinary and delayed differential equations, to investigate the contributions of NK cell activity, interferon signaling, and pro-inflammatory cytokines to viral clearance and disease outcome. Model parameters are estimated from experimental data, and computational simulations are used to explore how dysregulated NK responses and cytokine feedback loops may drive divergent clinical outcomes. Local sensitivity analysis identifies the most influential parameters shaping host-pathogen dynamics, highlighting potential control points for intervention. In addition, knockdown simulations are performed to mimic potential therapeutic interventions, allowing us to evaluate their advantages and limitations in silico.

While plant cell-surface receptors initiate this process, the link between receptors and cytoplasmic signaling components remains unclear. Here we identify Early Phosphorylated Protein 1 (EPP1) as a central mediator of this pathway. EPP1 is recruited to the activated SYMRK receptor, where it is phosphorylated on a key serine residue, an event essential and sufficient to propagate symbiotic signaling. We provide structural and functional validation of the SYMRK-EPP1 signaling complex and demonstrate that EPP1 is required for root nodule formation. Synthetic engineering of the SYMRK-EPP1 interaction bypasses the need for symbiotic bacteria to initiate the pathway and triggers nodule organogenesis. These findings establish EPP1 as a crucial cytoplasmic component between receptor activation and intracellular signaling, advancing our understanding of nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

A crucial step in the development of computational tools for the objective and quantitative analysis of tissue sections has been color deconvolution. Color deconvolution functions by separating the absorption of colors corresponding to stained molecular or tissue compartments. The most widely used color deconvolution method in digital pathology, linear color deconvolution as described in Ruifrok 2001 et al., decomposes color images according to the absorbance values for individual stains. However, linear color deconvolution assumes that stains are linearly decomposable, and it relies heavily upon identifying optimal color vectors of stains, which is often challenging. Furthermore, linear deconvolution methods cannot deconvolve the image with more than three stains, further limiting their broader applicability. To combat the limitations of previous methods, we developed an intuitive and robust color deconvolution method that effectively and accurately separates more than three stain signals, does not rely on predetermined color vectors, and does not rely on identifying optimal stain vectors. The proposed method, NLTD 2.0, presents a robust and efficient solution to tackle color variations in histopathology images, enhancing the reliability and precision of computational pathology. Additionally, incorporating the method as an ImageJ plugin amplifies accessibility and usability, enabling researchers and pathologists to leverage its capabilities without specialized programming skills. The intuitive interface streamlines the application, fostering broader acceptance within the computational pathology community.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3CA275681;UH3CA275681;U54CA268083;R01CA300052;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM157099;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

By systematically dissecting one such genomic locus, the COL1A1-SGCA locus, we identified redundant NS-targeting cis regulatory elements, including a ~600 bp fragment with 17 binding motifs for 8 transcription factors (TFs). Four NS-targeting TFs within this fragment contain acidic activation domains (AADs) that provide both chromatin-context and transcription-dependent NS-targeting, a property that appears common among several other tested AADs. A subset of acidic activator TFs contain an additional, transcription-independent NS-targeting activity.

These microbiota contribute to plant performance and health, in part by providing a microbial barrier against invading plant pathogens. To colonize plant hosts, pathogens not only have to overcome host immune responses, but also breach the microbial barrier, for which they secrete so-called effector proteins. Accordingly, the soil-borne fungal plant pathogen Verticillium dahliae secretes the antimicrobial effector Ave1 to suppress antagonistic microbes and facilitate host colonization. Notably, many pathogens, including V. dahliae, have life stages outside their host plants, for instance in soil, where they encounter diverse microbial communities. Yet, how antimicrobial effectors support establishment across these environments remains poorly understood. To address this, we established a collection of natural soil samples with diverse physicochemical properties and microbiota compositions. Using this collection, we show for three plant species, barley, tomato and cotton, that root-associated bacterial and fungal communities are primarily shaped by the type of soil, whereas the phyllosphere microbiota is mainly determined by plant species. On tomato, we furthermore show that Ave1 differentially contributes to virulence on diverse soils, as Ave1 altered the tomato microbiota on all soils tested, but the taxa affected by these shifts varied depending on the specific soils. Our findings suggest that while Ave1-mediated microbiota manipulation occurs across soils, its impact on fungal virulence is influenced by the specific composition of the soil-derived microbiota assembled by the host.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Here we describe two complementary principles and associated computational methods for designing pH-dependent binders: (i) introducing histidine residues adjacent to positively charged residues at binder-target interfaces to induce electrostatic repulsion and weaken binding at low pH, and (ii) introducing buried histidine-containing charged hydrogen-bonding networks in the binder core such that the protein is destabilized under acidic conditions. Using these methods, we designed binders that dissociate at acidic pH against ephrin type-A receptor 2, tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, interleukin-6, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, and the interleukin-2 mimic Neo2. Fusions of the designs to pH-independent binders of lysosomal trafficking receptors function as catalytic degraders, inducing target degradation at substoichiometric levels.

We demonstrate the power and versatility of this method by designing binders for four critical phosphotyrosine sites on three clinically relevant targets: Cluster of Differentiation 3 (CD3{varepsilon}), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Insulin Receptor (INSR). Experimental characterization shows that the designs bind their phospho-tyrosine containing targets with affinities comparable to native binding sites and have negligible binding to non-phosphorylated targets or phosphopeptides with different sequences. X-ray crystal structures of generated binders to CD3{varepsilon} and EGFR are very close to the design models, demonstrating the accuracy of the design approach. RFD2-MI provides a generalizable all-atom diffusion framework for probing and modulating phosphorylation-dependent signaling, and more generally, for developing research tools and targeted therapeutics against post-translationally modified proteins.","[{""name"":""NIH NCI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1K99CA293001;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

This coordination is inherently challenging for the brain. Effective coordination of multiple joints relies on intact feedforward control to predict movement dynamics in the initial phase of the movement, and on feedback control to fine-tune the execution in the final phase. However, the effect of aging on these specific control mechanisms remains controversial. In our experiment we investigated a pure elbow motion task using the KINARM exoskeleton. A group of 50 young (20-35 years old), 80 old (55-70 years old) and 30 older-old (80+ years old) healthy participants were recruited. Each participant performed 30deg elbow rotations while stabilizing the shoulder joint. Movements were directed toward two distinct targets in both flexion and extension directions. The task was performed under two controlled speed conditions to maximally challenge the motor system, as higher elbow velocities increase interaction torques at the shoulder, demanding greater neuromuscular effort for stabilization. The timing and magnitude of anticipatory EMG activity of the agonist shoulder muscle, necessary to counteract interaction torques, were preserved across all age groups. Moreover, increasing elbow velocity did not result in any performance differences between young and older old adults, indicating that shoulder stabilization during movement initiation remained intact with age. However, older adults exhibited reduced ability to stabilize the shoulder position until the end of the movement, leading to decreased reaching accuracy with older age. These results suggest that feedforward control, essential for movement planning, which is essential for shoulder stabilization during initiation, is preserved during healthy aging and remains resilient to increased motor demands, even in older old adults. In contrast, feedback control appears to deteriorate with age, potentially contributing to reduced movement precision in the final phase of the multi-joint movement.","[{""name"":""Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Vlaanderen (FWO)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""G095121N;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Better understanding of how this immunosurveillance operates could improve the treatment of neurological diseases. Here, using a novel genetically engineered mouse model of ZFTA-RELA ependymoma4-a childhood brain tumour-we characterised an immune circuit between the tumour and antigen presenting, haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the skull bone marrow. The presentation of antigens in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by HSPCs to CD4+ T cells, biased HSPC lineages toward myelopoiesis and polarised CD4+ T-cells to regulatory T cells (T- regs), culminating in tumour immunotolerance. Remarkably, a single infusion of antibodies directed against cytokines enriched in the CSF of mice bearing ZFTA-RELA ependymomas, choroid plexus carcinomas or Group-3 medulloblastoma-all aggressive childhood brain tumours-disrupted this process and caused profound tumour regression. These data unmask a mechanism by which skull bone marrow-derived HSPCs and CD4+ T cells cooperate to promote the immunotolerance of childhood brain tumours.

Behavioral Time-Scale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP), identified in vivo, holds a great potential for explaining instantaneous hippocampal selectivity emergence by long-term potentiation (LTP), yet the cellular and endogenous mechanisms are unknown, impeding broader conceptualization of this novel rule for its algorithmic, systems-level and theoretical implications. Here, we addressed this gap by in-vivo, ex-vivo, in-silico and computational approaches to seek neurophysiologically inspired protocols for synaptically evoking Ca2+ plateau potentials and inducing potentiation in the CA1. We found induction of BTSP-LTP is best explained by a theta-oscillation-paced, gradually developed cellular state being supported with precisely timed weak ramping inputs. Remarkably, the previously presumed one-shot LTP for in-vivo place-field formation is possible under the influence of muscarinic activation. Through modeling, the notion of acetylcholine-gated BTSP gave rise to a computational advantage for low-interference continual learning. We further demonstrated that biophysics of Transient Receptor Potential (TRPM) and NMDA receptor (NMDAR) channels powerfully shapes the cross-theta dynamics underlying BTSP. These results which cover pre-, post-synaptic and neuromodulatory factors and their timing suggest fundamental principles for graded plateau potentials and hippocampal LTP induction. Overall, our work dissects cellular mechanisms potentially important for a prominent in-vivo hippocampal plasticity phenomenon, and offers a biological basis for framing BTSP as an input-dynamics-aware, neuromodulation-tuned synaptic algorithm.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Here, we investigate for the first time the role of the double-stranded RBP Staufen2 (STAU2) in human neurogenesis. Characterization of STAU2 knockout iPSC derived cells using scRNA-seq shows that loss of STAU2 disrupts neuroepithelial cell identity and accelerates neural differentiation by altering the activity of key transcription factors and driving early metabolic transitions. Additionally, STAU2 regulates the expression of miRNA host genes and alters miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional control in progenitor cells, which exerts additional effects on STAU2 regulated gene regulatory networks. These changes result in neural progenitor exhaustion, unstructured neural rosettes, and reduced organoid size. Together, our work uncovers a previously unrecognized role for STAU2 as a central regulator of early human neurogenesis, acting through both miRNA-mediated and transcriptional pathways to coordinate progenitor maintenance and neuronal fate specification.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Here, we present chromosome-level genomes for the two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus) and the southern anteater (Tamandua tetradactyla), and investigate how retrotransposon-mediated gene duplications (retrocopies) have shaped xenarthran genome evolution. Comparative analyses revealed that xenarthran genomes harbor the highest number of retrocopies reported among mammals, with lineage-specific insertion dynamics. Anteater and armadillo genomes contain older LINE1 repertoires and species-specific older retrocopy insertions. In contrast, sloths retain both an abundance of young LINE1s and thousands of young retrocopies, alongside a large shared set that originated from an evolutionary burst of retroduplication in the branch leading to their last common ancestor ([~]30 Mya). In C. didactylus, approximately 50% of retrocopies are expressed, compared with 24% in Dasypus novemcinctus. Evolutionary analyses identified 38 retrocopies with strong hallmarks of domestication in C. didactylus. Many of these retrocopies derive from parental genes involved in mitochondrial and metabolic processes, suggesting a genomic mechanism underlying the physiological specialisations of sloths. Altogether, our findings identify retrotransposition as a major contributor to the genomic architecture of Xenarthra and highlight retrocopy origination as a mechanism for generating lineage-specific novelty and distinctive biological specialisations.","[{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020, Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""750747;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Grant 220540/Z/20/A, Wellcome Sanger Institute Quinquennial Review 2021–2026;""},{""name"":""São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) awarded to PAFG, HBC, and RLVM"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2018/15579-8;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Because of their intracellular nature, the establishment of these interactions requires tight regulation by the host plants. In particular, three genes (SYMRK, CCaMK and CYCLOPS) form the core of an ancestral common symbiosis pathway (CSP) for intracellular symbioses, and are conserved since the most recent common ancestor of land plants (Radhakrishnan et al. 2020; Delaux et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2010; Parniske 2008). Here, we describe EPP1 as a fourth gene committed to the CSP. Among land plants, EPP1 is conserved only in species able to associate with at least one type of intracellular symbiont. We found that loss-of-function epp1 mutants or EPP1 knock down lines in four clades of land plants are all impaired in their ability to associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We discovered that the plasma membrane-localized receptor-like SYMRK phosphorylates EPP1 on a conserved serine residue and that this phosphorylation is essential for symbiosis. Using a gain of-function approach, we demonstrate that EPP1 is upstream of the nuclear kinase CCaMK. We propose that EPP1 is an ancestral component of the essential pathway that has regulated plant symbiosis for half a billion years.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-10-LABX-41;ANR-18-EURE-0019;""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OPP1172165;""},{""name"":""Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office"",""id"":""https://ror.org/037wke960"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OPP1172165;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001675;""},{""name"":""European Union's Horizon 2020"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101105838;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bj3aw27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""#DE-SC0018247;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Agriculture"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01na82s61"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""#WIS05052;""},{""name"":""Secretaría de Ciencia, Humanidades, Tecnología e Innovación"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CBF-2025-I-12;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

The hydroxycarboxylic acid receptors for lactate (HCAR1), {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (HCAR2), and octanoate (HCAR3) are encoded by three closely homologous GPCR genes co-located in a region where common genetic variation has been reportedly associated with lipid levels and body fat distribution. By resolving sequence homology in this region, we were able to refine this signal to a coding variant (R311C) in HCAR2. Using corrected genotypes from [~]500K participants from UK Biobank and direct genotyping of four other studies, we found that carriage of the HCAR2 p.R311C variant was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes risk, reduced gynoid fat mass, increased waist-hip ratio, higher circulating triglycerides, glucose and alanine aminotransferase levels, lower levels of HDL cholesterol and adiponectin and impaired suppression of circulating levels of non-esterified fatty acids after oral glucose. Adipose tissue explants from mice engineered to express the equivalent mutation variant (p.R308C) in the mouse ortholog showed increased lipolytic activity, basally and after {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) treatment. In vivo, the mice were insulin resistant and had increased liver fat and impaired post-prandial suppression of NEFAs. The variant alters an amino acid located in the intracellular C-terminal tail of HCAR2, increasing recruitment of {beta}-arrestin and resulting in enhanced internalisation and reduced cell surface expression. In conclusion, a common variant in the human ketone body receptor results in impaired control of adipocyte lipolysis and adversely impacts systemic lipid and glucose metabolism. These findings highlight the importance of anti-lipolytic ketone body signalling in adipocytes for the maintenance of metabolic health

Much progress has been achieved in recent years toward the development of innovative systems for artificial lighting, automated irrigation, plant handling, environment control and space use optimization in VF systems. Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing approach to generate mutant lines of transient protein expression host Nicotiana benthamiana presenting a compact, space-efficient phenotype compared to the so-called LAB strain commonly used for protein production. Our strategy consisted of altering apical dominance by suppressing the biosynthesis of strigolactone, a negative regulator of axillary bud outgrowth-promoting cytokinins. Strigolactone-depleted lines were generated by knocking-down the expression of either Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 7 (CCD7) or Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8 (CCD8), two key enzymes of the metabolic pathway leading to strigolactone synthesis. Knocking-down the genes of either enzyme had no impact on the overall growth rate of the plant but drastically influenced its leaf proteome, auxin/cytokinin ratio and overall architecture. More specifically, the {Delta}CCD mutants exhibited altered glycolytic and malate-processing enzyme fluxes driving the production of pyruvate and cytokinins in leaf tissue, an axillary growth-oriented development pattern and, most importantly, a spatial footprint reduced by 45% to 50% compared to the LAB strain. Most importantly, recombinant protein yields per plant were maintained in the mutant lines, as here illustrated for the model protein GFP and for rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody of confirmed clinical value in humans. Our data demonstrate the usefulness of {Delta}CCD7 and {Delta}CCD8 knockout leading to strigolactone depletion for the generation of compact, space-efficient N. benthamiana lines well suited to VF systems intended for biopharmaceutical production.","[{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

A central challenge for this technique comprises the identification and classification of the imaged cells, as sample heterogeneity and differences in cell types and functional states can significantly impact the data. Currently, tools to determine a cells identity or state are limited to fluorescent labeling or subtomogram averaging, which require genetic modifications or rely on the availability of suitable dyes or identifiable and informative macromolecules. Here we present an integrated pipeline combining MALDI-MS Imaging (MSI) and in situ cryo-ET for single-cell identification and classification. Our approach enables MSI data acquisition directly from EM grids that were previously analyzed using cryo-ET, and allows unambiguous identification and classification of cell species and type. The method can be used on any eukaryotic single-cell cryo-ET sample without prior modification and takes less than 36 h for the entire workflow per grid, with significant potential for parallelization. We anticipate that this approach will transform the way that structural biologists approach cellular heterogeneity in cryo-ET, as cells can be identified and classified reliably post acquisition.","[{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALT 836-2020;""},{""name"":""Peter und Traudl Engelhorn Stiftung"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Max Planck Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01hhn8329"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Answering this question is a central goal of consciousness research. Due to their subjective and ineffable nature, finding a quantitative way to characterise qualia from verbal description has thus far proven elusive. To overcome the challenge of expressing subjective experience, recent structural and relational approaches have been proposed from mathematics. Yet, as far as we know, no attempts have been made to evaluate the relationship between a certain structure of qualia and a structure of its possible underlying physical substrate. Towards this ambitious goal of linking qualia and the physical, we set out to make an empirical first step by focusing on qualia of visual motion in human participants and their possible neural substrate recorded in mouse primary visual cortex. From human participants (N=171), we obtained dissimilarity ratings of visual motion experiences induced by 48 stimuli, spanning across 8 directions and 6 spatial frequencies. Analysis revealed similarity structures of visual motion qualia that were disassociated from similarity structures purely expected from physical parameters or their combinations. From nine individual mice, we recorded single-neuron activity (n=751) with optical imaging in both awake and lightly anaesthetised conditions (isoflurane 0.6-0.8%, which retains neural responses and renders mice unresponsive to sensory stimulation). From neuron population responses to a similar set of motion stimuli, we computed a distance matrix that is comparable to our human dissimilarity matrix. Quantitative analyses show structural commonalities between human qualia structure and mouse neural structure, where a categorical organisation of stimulus direction best explains human qualia structure and mice neural activity. Interestingly, these commonalities held true for both awake and lightly anaesthetised conditions, leaving a possibility that mice may have been unresponsive but conscious of visual motion under light anaesthesia. Finally, we list several empirical factors that can be improved to promote our qualia structure approach in the future.","[{""name"":""National Health and Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/011kf5r70"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GNT1183280;GNT2037172;""},{""name"":""Australian Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mmh0f86"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP240102680;""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas (A)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""23H04829;23H04830;""},{""name"":""Japan Science and Technology (JST) Moonshot R&D Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JPMJMS2295-14;""},{""name"":""Theoretical Sciences Visiting Program, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""21H026000;24K02140;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Animal studies reveal that in individual neurons of the primary visual cortex (V1), anesthesia modulates the gain of neural responses while leaving orientation and direction tuning unaltered. However, the impact of anesthesia on spatial frequency (SF) tuning is largely unexplored despite it being a fundamental characteristic of visual perception. Furthermore, compared to excitatory neurons, the effects of anesthesia on the visual responsiveness of specific inhibitory neuron subtypes are poorly understood. Here, we directly compared visual responses from the same V1 neurons in mice under both anesthetized and awake states. We found that isoflurane anesthesia significantly shifts the preferred SFs of excitatory neurons to lower values. This downward shift was even more pronounced in inhibitory neurons. These downshifts selectively impaired the neural coding of high-SF information while leaving low-SF coding unaffected. We observed distinct patterns of anesthesia-induced downward shifts of preferred SFs between two major cortical inhibitory neuron subtypes: somatostatin-expressing (SOM) and parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons. Furthermore, anesthesia-induced changes in response gain and tuning sharpness were evident in SOM neurons but not in PV neurons. These results highlight the diverse effects of anesthesia on sensory responses, varying significantly based on both the visual feature processed and the specific neuron subtype involved. The consistent decrease in preferred SFs during anesthesia not only suggests a potential mechanism for anesthesia-induced alterations in sensory experience but also emphasizes the critical role of heightened SF preference during wakefulness for fine object perception.","[{""name"":""JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""21H026000;24K02140;""},{""name"":""JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Research (Pioneering)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""23K17409;""},{""name"":""National Health Medical Research Council"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GNT1183280;GNT2037172;""},{""name"":""Australian Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mmh0f86"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP240102680;""},{""name"":""JSPS of Science Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas (A)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""23H04829;23H04830;""},{""name"":""JST Moonshot R&D Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JPMJMS2295-14;""},{""name"":""Theoretical Sciences Visiting Program, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology."",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Intracellular Ca2+ signaling mediates a variety of macrophage functions. While diverse, ontogeny, transcriptional profiles, and phenotypes of meningeal macrophages have been described, little is known about their spatiotemporal Ca2+ signal dynamics in healthy and diseased states. Using two-photon functional Ca2+ imaging in a novel transgenic reporter mouse line, combined with an event-based Ca2+ signaling analysis pipeline, we comprehensively characterized the Ca2+ activity of meningeal macrophages both at steady-state and in response to cortical spreading depolarization (CSD), a pathophysiological brain hyperexcitability event, implicated in migraine, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. In homeostatic meninges of behaving mice, perivascular macrophages exhibit several Ca2+ activity features, including event duration and signal frequency spectrum, distinct from those of interstitial non-perivascular macrophages. The Ca2+ activity of dural perivascular macrophages is uniquely coupled to behaviorally driven diameter fluctuation of their associated vessels. Most perivascular and non-perivascular meningeal macrophages displayed propagating intracellular Ca2+ activity. Both macrophage subtypes also exhibit synchronized intercellular Ca2+ elevations, likely driven by an external factor. In response to CSD, the majority of perivascular and non-perivascular meningeal macrophages show a persistent decrease in their Ca2+ activity. Smaller subsets of both macrophage subtypes display either acute or persistent increases in Ca2+ activity, with the latter response mediated by CGRP/RAMP1 signaling. Collectively, our results highlight a previously unknown diversity of meningeal macrophage Ca2+ signaling at steady-state and in response to an aberrant brain hyperexcitability event.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R21NS130561;R01NS115972;R01NS133625;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Acoel worms, the sister lineage to all other animals with brains, offer a window into this transition. We studied the three-banded panther worm Hofstenia miamia, whose brain is diffuse and unlike any previously described: it shows little anatomical or functional regionalization or stereotypy. Worms forage successfully even after large portions of the brain are removed, suggesting most regions can perform most computations. Neural cell type markers are also distributed across the brain with little regionalization. High-resolution studies of hunting reveal that more brain tissue improves performance, but no specific brain region is required. These results lead us to propose that H. miamia's brain is built from computationally pluripotent 'tiles', whose interactions generate coherent behavior. This architecture suggests that early brains arose by condensation of diffuse nerve nets into unregionalized brains, with regionalization evolving secondarily.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R34DA061984-01;""},{""name"":""Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04yhme281"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

They facilitate the regulation of viral RNA (vRNA) turnover by recognizing and forming complexes with the vRNA structure via specific RNA motifs-RNA binding domain interaction. However, due to consistent evolving nature of viruses, silent mutations in the viral genome can impact RBP-vRNA binding thereby altering the RNA processing. While efforts have been made in characterizing other forms of mutations leading to changes in amino acid sequences in SARS-CoV-2 variants, details on how silent mutations impact RBP-vRNA interaction remain limited. Here, we use extensive in silico mutagenesis to introduce silent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome to generate four different synthetic variants and map the interaction of the variants and the wild-type with a catalogue of human RBPs. Our result shows variation in accumulation and reduction of the RBPs binding motifs in the variants compared to the virus reference sequence on a global scale and at the UTRs. The majority of the RBPs with AU-rich binding motifs are reduced in the variants, while RBPs with mostly GC-rich motifs accumulate more binding positions, suggesting that a single change from U/A to G/C and vice versa can impact RBP-viral interactions. Furthermore, we use structural analysis to show the interaction of the vRNA with PUF60 and KHDRBS3 proteins, two RBPs that have not been previously implicated in SARS-CoV-2 interactome. Our findings show that loss to the conserved poly(U) in PUF60 binding motifs in some of the variants affects its interaction with the protein at the 5' end, which may disrupt the function of the protein as an anti-viral RNA regulator. We also predicted the key residues in KHDRBS3 interacting with its binding motif in the wild-type at the 3' end, while noting that the vRNA structural changes in the variants may contribute to the loss of this interaction. Overall, our predictions contribute to the insights into virus evolution and pathogenicity of potential new variants due to the impact of synonymous changes in the nucleotide sequences on protein-RNA interaction.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Recently, it was shown that some DNA lesions generated by a pulse of damage-inducing mutagen persist over multiple rounds of replication. Segregation of DNA lesions in the early genealogy of an expanding clone leaves a statistically interpretable footprint of cancer initiating events. Specifically, it allows for estimating the number of cell divisions between the initiating DNA lesion and the most recent common ancestor of the tumor. Here, we analyze footprints of segregating lesions from a previously published experimental mouse system, as well as post-chemotherapy human metastatic tumors and the blood of chemotherapy treated patients. In all contexts, clones tend to start early, usually within the span of 4 cell generations from mutagen exposure. Using a branching process model, we show that fitness advantage of early cancer drivers exceeds 30%, with each early division leading to at least 1.3 self-renewing cells. We highlight an example of a blood-derived single cell phylogeny with major subclones separated by just two cell divisions. Broadly, our approach allows inference of tumor initiation and growth parameters based on events preceding the most recent common ancestor of the initiating clone as opposed to characteristics of fully grown tumors.","[{""name"":""NIH National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""NIH National Institute of Medical Sciences"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

While NAD+ restoration holds therapeutic promise, its long term, tissue-specific consequences remain poorly understood. We investigated effects of nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation for mutator mice manifesting mitochondrial progeria. Our results reveal strikingly divergent outcomes: in proliferative bone marrow, NR-treated mutators show reductive stress with accumulation of NADH/NADPH, altered amino acid, nucleotide, folate levels and impaired heme biosynthesis. In blood, erythrocyte maturation defects are aggravated, exacerbating anemia. Conversely, in postmitotic cardiac tissue, NR enhanced contractility, reduces stress response markers and normalized metabolic profile. These findings indicate that while being beneficial for heart, chronic NAD+ boosting can compromise erythrocyte maturation in the context of mitochondrial disease. The data emphasize importance of evaluating systemic effects of NAD+ boosting therapies beyond the primary affected tissues and development of tissue-specific metabolic interventions for degenerative diseases.","[{""name"":""Research Council of Finland"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05k73zm37"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""#355637;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

However, vividness is ill-defined as it lacks an objective reference. Here, we present survey results that suggest vividness is nevertheless a robust trait. It explains individual differences of a broad range of subjective experiences, from the detail of mental imagery, the propensity to report having other internally generated visual experiences, and the vividness of visual dreams. Critically, simple vividness ratings can replace the protracted questionnaires commonly used for this purpose and reduce methodological issues with these instruments. We further find that vividness is closely linked with the experience of ""seeing"" mental images or projecting them into the external world. People who report seeing mental images with their eyes shut are also more likely to experience externally projected imagery. Nevertheless, many people report having mental depictions but without seeing. Overall, our results indicate we should redefine visual aphantasia to distinguish individuals with faint or unseen visual images from those completely lacking a pictorial representation.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

In this work, we present mBER, an open-source protein binder design system capable of designing antibody-format binders with state-of-the-art experimental success rates. mBER builds on the ColabDesign framework, achieving successful antibody design primarily through the inclusion of informative sequence and structure conditioning information. Using mBER, we designed two libraries comprising over 1 million VHH binders against 436 diverse targets. We experimentally screened the two libraries against 145 of these targets, resulting in a dataset of over 100 million binding interactions. We achieved specific and significant design success against 45% of targets. In a filtered set of designs, we detect binding rates to specific epitopes as high as 38%. Through mBER, we demonstrate that format-specific binder design is possible with no additional training of underlying folding and language models.

Processes that govern species-specific aspects of human postnatal brain development are difficult to study in animal models. While human brain organoids offer a promising in vitro model, they have thus far been shown to largely mimic early stages of brain development. Here, we developed human brain organoids for an unprecedented 5 years in culture, optimizing growth conditions able to extend excitatory neuron viability beyond previously-known limits. Using module scores of maturation-associated genes derived from a time course of endogenous human brain maturation, we show that brain organoids transcriptionally age with cell type-specificity through these many years in culture. Whole-genome methylation profiling reveals that the predicted epigenomic age of organoids sampled between 3 months and 5 years correlates precisely with time spent in vitro, and parallels epigenomic aging in vivo. Notably, we show that in chimeric organoids generated by mixing neural progenitors derived from 'old' organoids with progenitors from 'young' organoids, old progenitors rapidly produce late neuronal fates, skipping the production of earlier neuronal progeny that are instead produced by their young counterparts in the same co-cultures. The data indicate that human brain organoids can mature and record the passage of time over many years in culture. Progenitors that age in organoids retain a memory of the time spent in culture reflected in their ability to execute age-appropriate, late developmental programs.","[{""name"":""Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01tm9b530"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Klarman Cell Observatory"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Structural analyses reveal that constitutive Leucine Rich Repeat-malectin interactions preconfigure IGP1 for ligand recognition and that the receptor features a highly specific sugar-binding pocket in the LRR domain capable of distinguishing fine variations in glycan structures. By directly sensing cello-oligomers, IGP1 acts as a cell wall sentinel that links pathogen-induced wall degradation to immune alerting, equipping plants to mount rapid and robust defense responses.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Laboratory studies indicate rapid degradation of FPB in water, but sediment persistence in aquatic systems remains poorly understood, creating uncertainty in ecological risk assessments. We evaluated the environmental fate and transport of FPB and its degradants in water, plants, and sediment following application of the herbicide to two bays of Lake George, NY. FPB was rapidly lost from the water column within 72 hours, consistent with prior studies, but persisted in sediments for at least one year. Sediment cores revealed vertical migration of FPB, which may contribute to frequent non-detects in surface sediments and potentially explain why US EPA was unable to establish sediment half-lives in aquatic systems. Measured concentrations exceeded the 28-day no observable adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) for chironomids for at least a year, highlighting the potential for long-term chronic exposure to benthic organisms. Modeled sorption and dilution scenarios aligned with field observations and indicated that circulation dynamics expanded the affected area beyond the direct treatment zones. These results demonstrate that FPB and its degradants persist longer in sediments than suggested by laboratory studies, raising important questions about long-term ecological risks, effects of repeated applications, and underestimation of sediment persistence. Long-term studies such as this are essential for understanding the fate of these compounds and for guiding informed decisions about future herbicide applications.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

In each case, the same gene was independently duplicated and co-opted, yet the resulting genomic architectures differed, ranging from hemizygous (present on one chromosome copy) to heterozygous (on both copies).

However, due to the challenges of differentiating goat remains from that of sheep using traditional archaeozoological approaches, there are few specimens specifically identified as goat. To address this we employed genetic, proteomics, and archaeozoological techniques to assess faunal remains from the Late Bronze assemblage of Haugheys Fort (Armagh) and medieval assemblage of Carrickfergus (Antrim). We identify these specimens as goats using proteomics and genetics, and additionally determine their molecular sex.

Genomic data recovered from a Haugheys Fort goat reveals a three-millenia genetic connection between herds in the Late Bronze Age, medieval period, and the indigenous Irish breed extant today, the Old Irish Goat. We additionally find varying levels of inbreeding within goats from the settlement of Carrickfergus, suggesting possible mixed use of herds within medieval Irish society. Our results demonstrate the continuing potential of combining archaeological and biomolecular techniques to clarify existing ambiguities and at the same time reveal new facets of the past.","[{""name"":""EPSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/K039660/1; EP/M028127/1;""},{""name"":""Northern Way Initiative"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""885729-AncestralWeave;101055195-ANSOC;""},{""name"":""Taighde Éireann – Research Ireland"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""21/PATH-S/9515(T);GOIPG/2023/4390;""},{""name"":""AHRC Northern Bridge Doctoral Training Partnership"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Today, images of biological structures can be acquired using different imaging technologies and at increasing resolutions. However, identifying relevant structural features in three-dimensional (3D) images remains a significant challenge. 3D image segmentation is usually performed using deep-learning segmentation models. Such models are trained on manually annotated and segmented, dataset-specific images. Consequently, they rarely generalize across datasets. Here, we overcome these limitations with TopoTome, an unsupervised 3D image segmentation and analysis algorithm. TopoTome is based on topological data analysis, and conceptually distinct from standard clustering and deep learning image analysis models. It encodes the 3D image directly in topological space. Then, it performs unsupervised clustering to detect and segment features represented by salient and spatially coherent voxel intensity gradients. We demonstrate on simple, complex, synthetic and real-world 3D image data that it outperforms all 3D clustering algorithms. Its segmentation ranks with or outperforms best-in-class deep learning 3D image segmentation software. Beyond image segmentation, it provides streamlined topological data analysis of 3D images, advancing 3D image analysis from conventional mesh volumetry to structural topology. Owing to its conceptually different topological data analysis core, TopoTome does not need prior information and tuning to generalize across different imaging modalities, including fluorescence microscopy and X-ray computed tomography. We show it also readily generalizes across biological subjects, such as different species, organs and cells. TopoTome is thus one of the most versatile and accurate unsupervised 3D image segmentation algorithms.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Our findings revealed gross vascular and lymphatic rarefaction in BRONJ, along with 4 endothelial subtypes uniformly exhibiting aberrant upregulation of Col2a1. Moreover, fibroblasts and macrophages emerged as key endothelial interactors, collectively underscoring dysregulation of the endothelium-matrix-immune axis. Unlike homeostatic Dmp1/Tfap2a fibroblasts and Stab1 macrophages, BRONJ lesions featured pathological Lrrc15/Chad fibroblasts and Il6 macrophages, which promote ectopic chondrogenesis and inflammation. Mechanistically, BRONJ activated the COL2A1-CD44 axis (EC-to-fibroblast/macrophage signaling) and COL2A1-SDC4 axis (EC-to-fibroblast signaling), whereas lineage tracing excluded endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), implicating extracellular matrix remodeling as the driver of dysfunction. Cross-species validation in human mandibles further confirmed vascular-lymphatic dysregulation, inflammatory activation, and aberrant chondrogenesis.

Understanding the mechanism behind OMV biogenesis in Bacteroides spp. is necessary to determine their role in the gut. Recent studies showed that mutation of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factor 1 increased OMV production in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt) by regulating members of its downstream regulon. Additional members of the Dma family have been identified, but very little is known regarding their roles in Bt. Here, we investigate the role of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factor 2 (Dma2) in controlling OMV biogenesis in Bt. We employ biochemical and proteomic analyses to show that mutation of dma2 increases OMV production in a manner that is dependent on the expression of its cognate sigma factor, das2. The precise mechanism by which dma2 increases OMV biogenesis remains elusive. However, transcriptome analyses revealed that{Delta} dma2 has decreased expression of select polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that primarily target host-associated glycans. Follow-up comparative proteomics showed that the PUL repertoire was most impacted in the OMV fraction. In vitro growth assessments showed that{Delta} dma2 exhibits delayed growth in the presence of select host-associated glycans. Colonization studies in mice revealed that{Delta} dma2 is outcompeted by the wild-type in the gut, which indicates that dma2 is a key determinant of colonization fitness in Bt. Altogether, these findings expand our knowledge of the Dma familys role in OMV biogenesis and demonstrates their importance in Bacteroides physiology.

ImportanceDual membrane-spanning anti-sigma factors (Dma) are a novel class of regulatory system found solely amongst Bacteroidota. Previous studies have demonstrated the role of Dma1 in vesiculation, but the overall role of the Dma family in Bacteroides physiology remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Dma2 modulates vesiculation and regulates the expression of select polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that target host-associated glycans. In vivo studies revealed that Dma2 is an important fitness determinant when competing against kin bacteria. This work begins characterizing the multifaceted involvement of Dma2 in OMV biogenesis, PUL regulation, and colonization fitness.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Testing the rhythmic properties of the adult visual system with periodic or broadband visual stimulation elicited neural resonance phenomena at [~]10Hz alpha rhythm. Here, we extend this approach to reveal the inherent rhythmic properties of the infant brain. Eight-month-olds (N = 42) were presented with visual stimuli flickering at discrete frequencies (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, and 30Hz) and broadband (i.e., aperiodic) stimulation, while recording a high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). As predicted, infants visual system entrained to the harmonics of the periodic stimulation frequencies (first to third). In addition, a 4Hz rhythm emerged independent of stimulation frequency. Critically, the impulse response function (IRF) of the broadband sequence revealed a perceptual echo of visual information at 4Hz. This echo lasted for about 1 second (i.e. four cycles), extended into frontal sensors, and selectively resonated the 4Hz component of the input signal. In a complementary adult assessment, we confirm an alpha response upon periodic and broadband stimulation in the present paradigm for the mature visual system. To conclude, perturbing the infant visual system elicited a neural response and resonant activity at the 4Hz theta rhythm, which contrasts with the 10Hz alpha rhythm found in the adult visual system. Neural processing dynamics are thus essential to understand early brain development in full.

Significance StatementThis study tested resonance properties of the infant visual system upon perturbation. For the visual stimulation at discrete frequencies between 2 and 30Hz, the infant brain responded at 4Hz independent of the stimulation frequency. Following broadband stimulation, a perceptual echo at 4Hz emerged - resonating the 4Hz component of visual information over several cycles. These findings reveal that the 4Hz theta rhythm is an inherent processing dynamic of the infant visual system, contrasting with the 10Hz rhythm found in adults. The processing dynamics of the human visual system undergo fundamental changes from infancy into adulthood.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""KO 6028/1-1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

We show that loop extrusion alters the force-extension behavior of DNA in a non-monotonic manner: extrusion stiffens the chain at low forces but softens it at intermediate and high forces. Our model predicts hysteresis in pulling-recoiling cycles and out-of-equilibrium responses, consistent with recent single-chromosome stretching experiments. We further find that loop extrusion provides mechanical robustness to chromatin by promoting compaction while enabling rapid structural recovery after stress.

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting  spacetime attractor excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219525/Z/19/Z;225926/Z/22/Z;219627/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3955;GAT3755;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0040/2024-L;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 651-2023;""},{""name"":""Fondation Fyssen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting.

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

However, this knowledge is fragmented across resources and often is not directly accessible for analytical methods. We developed OmniPath (https://omnipathdb.org/), a database combining diverse molecular knowledge from 168 resources. It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Using polymer simulations and high-resolution live-cell microscopy, we identify rare but long-lived chromatin encounters arising from cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. These events occur when cohesin loads near the midpoint between two loci and extrudes them through a defined spatial radius, producing encounter durations that exceed those of random collisions. We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors. Our findings support a time-gated model of distal enhancer-promoter communication in which only rare, long-lived and mostly extrusion-driven encounters are productive, offering a unifying framework for how chromosome dynamics control transcription in single cells.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_192642;TMCG-3_213782;320030-236070;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 1305-2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Here, we investigate the metabolic impact of the accessory protein ORF7a. Lentiviral expression of ORF7a in human lung epithelial (A549) and monocytic (THP1) cells, coupled with integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, revealed profound dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. ORF7a impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reducing basal and maximal respiration, inducing mitochondrial depolarization, and increasing reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, ORF7a upregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), promoting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex phosphorylation and suppressing pyruvate oxidation. However, pharmacological PDK4 inhibition did not restore respiration. High-resolution respirometry in frozen samples revealed impaired complex I function, while Blue Native-PAGE demonstrated defective respiratory supercomplex assembly. By linking enzymatic inhibition with structural destabilization, our study uncovers a functional vulnerability of the mitochondrial respiratory chain to viral manipulation.

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions.

Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid. These pathways have implications for essential chromatin-templated processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and gene silencing at replication forks.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""851564;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.233.038;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2-HG012442;""},{""name"":""W.

Here, we identify mechanically activated ion channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 as key mechanotransducers required for labor progression. Genetic deletion of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in mice resulted in weakened uterine contractions and severe parturition defects. Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either the uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects, whereas combined loss significantly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing showed that loss of PIEZO reduced expression of connexin43 (Gja1), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction. These findings highlight the critical role of PIEZO channels in mechanotransduction during parturition and suggest therapeutic targets for labor dysfunction.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 NS105067;R01AT012051;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-2405-20;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CMMI-2135428;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2DK128800;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Yet these transitions also involve coordinated shifts in cell morphology and behaviour, which remain poorly characterized in densely packed epithelia. We developed a quantitative live-imaging and computational framework to track thousands of individual cells over time in the rapidly differentiating Xenopus mucociliary epithelium (MCE). From segmentations and trajectories, we extracted dynamic features-cell and nuclear shape, movement, position-to create a time-resolved morphodynamic dataset spanning the full course of differentiation. While single features showed high noise and low separability of ground-truth cell types, supervised machine learning revealed that integrating time-resolved features robustly predicts final cell fate. Gradient-boosted trees and multinomial logistic regression achieved moderate but consistent accuracy, especially for abundant epithelial lineages. Key discriminants included normalized Z-position, membrane-nucleus offset, and absolute experimental time, whereas movement contributed minimally to the results. Our results show that morphodynamic signatures encode predictive information about cell identity and provide a framework linking physical dynamics with molecular state.","[{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04txyc737"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF21CC0073729;NNF19SA0035442;NNF22OC0076414;NNF19OC0056962;""},{""name"":""European Research Council CoG"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101125803 MechanoFate;""},{""name"":""LEO Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02rgsr590"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LF-OC-19-000219;""},{""name"":""GENCI-IDRIS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""A0161013396;AD011013695;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

Both lineages employ pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), yet plant mechanisms for sensing Gram-positive bacterial MAMPs remain poorly understood. Wall teichoic acids (WTAs), anionic glycopolymers unique to Gram-positive bacteria, are shown here to activate salicylic acid signaling, defense priming, and a non-canonical programmed cell death in Arabidopsis. We demonstrate that glycosylated WTAs from diverse Gram-positive species elicit these responses and provide genetic evidence that their recognition depends on two members of the plant-specific CYSTEINE-RICH RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (CRK) gene family, which is absent in animals and whose function remains elusive. These findings reveal WTAs as a novel class of MAMPs in plants and highlight CRKs as key components in their perception.","[{""name"":""DFG"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RI 2920/3-1;GRK 2172;INST 186/1277-1 FUGG;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

LP.8.1 was designated a Variant Under Monitoring by the WHO in January 2025 due to its potential to displace prior circulating variants. Informed by early growth modeling and antigenic analysis, we selected LP.8.1 as a candidate strain for the 2025-2026 vaccine season. Here, we describe the development of updated LP.8.1-matched mRNA vaccine compositions encoding either the full-length spike protein for mRNA-1273 (monovalent) or the membrane-anchored receptor-binding and N-terminal domains for the mRNA-1283 vaccine. Initial in vitro characterization, including structural analysis, demonstrated robust antigen expression and intact antigenic features. Immunogenicity of both vaccines were evaluated in murine models following immunization as either a primary series in naive animals or as a booster dose. LP.8.1-matched vaccines elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses against the homologous LP.8.1 strain and more recently emerging JN.1-lineage subvariants, including XFG and NB.1.8.1. Notably, the mRNA-1283 vaccine expressing LP.8.1 induced higher mean neutralization titers than the mRNA-1273 version across multiple variants. These data demonstrate the immunogenicity and breadth of both LP.8.1-based mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1283 vaccines in the context of ongoing JN.1 lineage evolution and support the selection of LP.8.1 as the updated vaccine antigen for the 2025-2026 season.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278

We developed highly efficient, in vivo RNA electroporation-based single-cell gene editing to investigate neuronal responses to loss of fast inhibition. Using CRISPR-Cas9 components delivered as RNA, we knocked out GABA-A receptor {beta} subunits in individual layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mouse visual cortex, eliminating fast inhibition. In vivo patch-clamp recordings revealed that cortical neurons adapted to inhibition loss through two sequential mechanisms: a transient reduction of excitatory synaptic input, followed by intrinsic membrane property changes that decreased input resistance. This sequential adaptation program ultimately prevented target neurons from contributing spikes to the cortical network. Our RNA-based single-cell gene editing approach enables investigation of cellular responses independent of network effects, providing new insights into neuronal homeostasis and gene function in individual cells in vivo.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759615694278
