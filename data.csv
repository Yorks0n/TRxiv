Yet our understanding of value-based decision-making comes primarily from studying individuals in isolation, leaving open fundamental questions about how animals adapt their strategies during social competition. Here, we developed an ethologically relevant multi-player game, in which freely-moving mice make value-based decisions in a competitive spatial foraging task. We found that mice integrate real-time spatial information about 'self' and the opponent to flexibly shift their preference towards safer, low-payout options when appropriate. Analyses of mice and reinforcement learning agents reveal that these behavioural adaptations cannot be explained by simple reward learning, but are instead consistent with optimal decision strategies guided by opponent features. Using a dynamical model of neural activity, we found that in addition to opponent effects, decisions under competition were also noisier and more sensitive to initial conditions, generating testable predictions for neural recordings and perturbations. Together, this work reveals a fundamental mechanism for competitive foraging, and proposes novel quantitative frameworks towards understanding value-based decision-making in a fast-changing social environment.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093912

Using the extensive COVID-19 surveillance database in Denmark, comprising over 700,000 genomes, we identified 303 persistent infections and, critically, linked them to health and sociodemographic data. Our analysis confirms the hypothesis that immunocompromised individuals are at the highest risk of experiencing persistent infections. Other disease groups associated with mortality, such as diabetes, showed no such associations. Among these persistent infections, the viral sequences exhibited signs of diversifying selection, with recurrent mutations linked to treatment resistance. Our findings suggest that immunosuppression plays a key role in the emergence of novelty in persistent infections.","NA","medrxiv",1739830093912

The expression of conserved bilaterian patterning genes in echinoderms provides a molecular framework for resolving this puzzle. Recent studies in juvenile asteroids suggest that the bilaterian antero-posterior axis maps onto the medio-lateral axis that is perpendicular to each of the five rays of the pentaradial body plan. Here we test this hypothesis in another echinoderm class, the ophiuroids, using the cosmopolitan brittle star Amphipholis squamata. Our results show that the general principles of axial patterning are similar to those described in asteroids, and comparisons with existing molecular data from other echinoderm taxa support the idea that medio-lateral deployment of the AP patterning program across the rays predates the evolution of the asterozoan and likely the echinoderm crown-groups. Our data also reveal expression differences between A. squamata and asteroids, which we attribute to secondary modifications specific to ophiuroids. Together, this work provides important comparative data to reconstruct the evolution of axial properties in echinoderm body plans.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093912

Through systematic comparison of transcriptomes from fresh-collected, silica-dried, and archival specimens, we demonstrate the suitability of herbarium-derived RNA for transcriptomics. The practical applicability of archival mRNA was further illustrated by the functional validation of a plant immune receptor synthesized from a specimen collected in 1956.

Using a transgenic parasite line with a domain 13 to 14 deletion, we show that these domains are essential for Pfs230 localization on the gamete surface. Nanobodies against domains 13 and 14 inhibit Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex formation, reduce transmission and structural analyses reveal their binding epitopes.

Currently, drugs and drug candidates against AR target the steroid-binding domain to antagonize or degrade AR. However, these compounds cannot therapeutically access largely intrinsically disordered truncated splice variants of AR, such as AR-V7, that only possess the DNA binding domain and are missing the ligand binding domain. Targeting intrinsically disordered regions within transcription factors has remained challenging and is considered undruggable. Herein, we leveraged a cysteine-reactive covalent ligand library in a cellular screen to identify degraders of AR and AR-V7 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. We identified a covalent compound EN1441 that selectively degrades AR and AR-V7 in a proteasome-dependent manner through direct covalent targeting of an intrinsically disordered cysteine C125 in AR and AR-V7. EN1441 causes significant and selective destabilization of AR and AR-V7, leading to aggregation of AR/AR-V7 and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Consistent with targeting both AR and AR-V7, we find that EN1441 completely inhibits total AR transcriptional activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells expressing both AR and AR-V7 compared to AR antagonists or degraders that only target the ligand binding domain of full-length AR, such as enzalutamide and ARV-110. Our results put forth a pathfinder molecule EN1441 that targets an intrinsically disordered cysteine within AR to destabilize, degrade, and inhibit both AR and AR-V7 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and highlights the utility of covalent ligand discovery approaches in directly targeting, destabilizing, inhibiting, and degrading classically undruggable transcription factor targets.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

The simultaneous in vitro synthesis of minimal yet sufficient tRNA species (at least 21) poses a challenge for constructing a self-reproducible artificial cell. A key obstacle is the processing of the 5' and 3' ends, which requires a multi-step reaction in natural cells. In this study, we developed a simplified processing method that allows simultaneous expression of all 21 tRNAs in a reconstituted transcription/translation system (PURE system). We tested three available methods (leader, 5'-G variants, and HDVR attachment methods) and one new method (direct tRNA linkage method). Using these methods, we succeeded in simultaneous expression of six non-G-start tRNA from monocistronic six DNA templates in the PURE system. Furthermore, we developed a method that combines the direct tRNA linkage and HDVR attachment methods (termed tRNA array method). Using this method, we succeeded in simultaneous expression of all 21 tRNAs from a single polycistronic DNA template in the PURE system. The tRNA mixture produced by the tRNA array method supported a similar level of translation to the individually synthesized tRNA mixture. Additionally, we demonstrated that the minimal tRNA sets prepared by the tRNA array method can be used for genetic code engineering. This study represents a step toward the realization of self-reproducible artificial cells and also provides an easy method for preparing all tRNAs useful for genetic code engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

Despite intrinsic links to their oncogenic potential, the fidelity and mechanisms of ecDNA inheritance are poorly understood. Here, we show that ecDNA are protected against cytosolic mis-segregation through mitotic clustering and by tethering to the telomeric and subtelomeric regions of mitotic chromosomes. ecDNA-chromosome tethering depends on BRD4 transcriptional co-activation and mitotic transcription of the long non-coding RNA PVT1, which is co-amplified with MYC in colorectal and prostate cancer cell lines. Disruption of ecDNA-chromosome tethering through BRD4 inhibition, PVT1 depletion, or inhibiting mitotic transcription results in cytosolic mis-segregation, ecDNA reintegration, and the formation of homogeneously staining regions (HSRs). We propose that nuclear inheritance of ecDNA is facilitated by an RNA-mediated physical tether that links ecDNA to mitotic chromosomes and thus protects against cytosolic mis-segregation and chromosomal integration.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

Here, to explore hyperparasitism in Archaea, we focused on ultra-small archaea of the phylum Nanohaloarchaeota, a distinct lineage within the DPANN superphylum, which establish obligate symbiotic interactions with extreme halophiles of the class Halobacteria. We assembled five metagenomes originating from geothermally influenced salt lakes in the Danakil Depression, Ethiopia, and reconstructed the viromes associated with both haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea. Both archaeal lineages were associated with viruses from four distinct groups, including head-tailed viruses (class Caudoviricetes), tailless icosahedral viruses, pleomorphic viruses and spindle-shaped viruses, which represent 12 previously undescribed families. The haloarchaeal viruses (HVs) and nanohaloarchaeal viruses (NHVs) are only distantly related, suggesting that viruses from the four groups co-evolved with their respective hosts for an extended period, likely since the divergence of the two archaeal lineages from their last common ancestor. Consistently, our results show that HVs and NHVs are well-adapted to replicate in their respective hosts and to thrive in hypersaline environments. No evidence of host switching between haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea was obtained, but multiple horizontal transfers of genes implicated in virion structure and morphogenesis between HVs and NHVs were detected. We also identified several NHVs-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes implicated in nucleotide and amino acid metabolisms, which could enhance the metabolic capabilities of the nanohaloarchaeal hosts that have highly reduced genomes. Finally, in addition to HVs and NHVs, we describe plasmid-derived virus satellites that appear to have originated convergently to parasitize spindle-shaped viruses of both haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea, uncovering an additional layer of parasitism. Collectively, our findings fill the knowledge gap on the diversity of HVs and NHVs, highlight the complexity of virus-host and virus-virus interactions in hypersaline environments, and open doors for further mining of the virosphere of the globally distributed DPANN archaea.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1), with its high case fatality rate and potential for adaptation in avian reservoirs, is a prime candidate for triggering such a pandemic. We applied the Viral Trait Assessment for Pandemics (ViTAP) model, a quantitative framework, to assess the pandemic potential of H5N1 strains currently circulating in the United States. Through a systematic literature review and structured expert elicitation involving virologists and epidemiologists, we refined and validated ViTAP scores across 11 key viral traits. The resulting assessment yielded a final ViTAP score of 3.28 out of 5, placing the U.S. H5N1 strains in the moderate-to-high risk category. This elevated risk is driven by the viruss high human fatality rate, its segmented RNA genome enabling reassortment, and its propensity for mutation. Sensitivity analyses highlight the transmission mode of the virus as a critical factor, with even minor increases in human-to-human spread dramatically escalating the pandemic threat. Comparisons with historical pandemics underscore the potential for H5N1 to rival the devastating impact of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for enhanced surveillance in avian and mammalian hosts, targeted vaccine development, and comprehensive pandemic preparedness efforts. By demonstrating the utility of the ViTAP model for pandemic risk assessment, we provide a valuable tool to guide policy and interventions in the face of emerging zoonotic threats.","NA","medrxiv",1739830093913

ARGs can be specified in terms of topologies and coalescence times. The coalescence times are usually estimated using an informative prior derived from coalescent theory, but this may generate biased estimates and can also complicate downstream inferences based on ARGs. Here we introduce, POLEGON, a novel approach for estimating branch lengths for ARGs which uses an uninformative prior. Using extensive simulations, we show that this method provides improved estimates of coalescence times and lead to more accurate inferences of effective population sizes under a wide range of demographic assumptions. It also improves other downstream inferences including estimates of mutation rates. We apply the method to data from the 1000 Genomes Project to investigate population size histories and differential mutation signatures across populations. We also estimate coalescence times in the HLA region, and show that they exceed 30 million years in multiple segments.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mrx6 belongs to the Pet20-domain-containing protein family, consisting of Mrx6, Pet20, and Sue1. Notably, absence of Mrx6 leads to increased mtDNA copy number. Here, we identify the C-terminus of Mrx6 as essential for its stability and interaction with the mitochondrial matrix protein Mam33. Deletion of Mam33 mimics the effect of Mrx6 loss, resulting in elevated mtDNA copy number. Bioinformatics, mutational analyses, and immunoprecipitation studies reveal that a subcomplex of Mam33 and Mrx6 trimers interacts with the substrate recognition domain of the conserved mitochondrial Lon protease Pim1 through a bipartite motif in the Pet20 domain of Mrx6. Loss of Mrx6, its paralog Pet20, Mam33, or mutations disrupting the interaction between Mrx6 and Pim1 stabilize key proteins required for mtDNA maintenance, the RNA polymerase Rpo41 and the HMG-box-containing protein Cim1. We propose that Mrx6, alongside Pet20 and Mam33, regulates mtDNA copy number by modulating substrate degradation through Pim1. Additionally, Mrx6 loss alters Cim1's function, preventing the detrimental effect on mtDNA maintenance observed upon Cim1 overexpression. The presence of three Pet20-domain proteins in yeast implies broader roles of Lon protease substrate recognition beyond mtDNA regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

Acute cholesterol depletion increases the synthesis of very-long-chain (VLC) sphingomyelin, but a link between lipid sensing and sphingolipid synthesis is lacking. Using sphingolipid metabolic flux analysis, we observed that VLC-ceramide, the precursor to VLC complex sphingolipids that are produced in the Golgi apparatus, was rapidly consumed after cholesterol depletion, while synthesis of long-chain sphingolipids was unaffected. Sphingolipid trafficking assays showed that cholesterol depletion enhances VLC-Ceramide trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Changes in the sizes of coatomer II ER exit sites were correlated with increased VLC-Ceramide trafficking and concomitant increase in sphingomyelin. Depletion of Sec16A, a component of the COPII network, abolished VLC-SM synthesis. This study reveals ER-to-Golgi trafficking of VLC-Ceramide as a key regulatory node in organelle membrane homeostasis pathways.

SummaryIn cellular membranes, sphingomyelin is associated with cholesterol. Metabolic flux analysis of sphingolipid metabolism showed that synthesis rate of sphingomyelin, but not ceramide, was increased after depletion of cholesterol due increased rate of COPII-dependent ER-to-Golgi transport of ceramide.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

To address this, we performed genome-wide CRISPR knockout and focused base editor screens in PPP perturbed conditions to establish a high-resolution functional map of PPP regulation that pinpoints novel regulatory mechanisms. Through this, we identify the orphan reductase CYB5R4 as an evolutionarily conserved activator of PP4 and PP6, but not the closely related PP2A. Heme binding is essential for CYB5R4 function and mechanistically involves the reduction of the metal ions in the active site. Importantly, CYB5R4-mediated activation of PP4 is critical for cell viability when cells are treated with DNA damage-inducing agents known to cause oxidative stress. The discovery of a dedicated PPP reductase points to shared regulatory principles with protein tyrosine phosphatases, where specific enzymes dictate activity by regulating the active site redox state. In sum, our work provides a resource for understanding PPP function and the regulation of intracellular signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

However, the capacity of exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex), present during chronic antigen exposure, to form memory after antigen clearance remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal single cell RNA/T cell receptor sequencing and ATAC-sequencing on antigen-specific T cells after the clearance of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. These data revealed the formation of a robust population of memory CD8+ T cells that transcriptionally, epigenetically, and functionally resemble central memory T cells (Tcm) that form after clearance of acute infection. To lineage trace the origin and memory recall response of Tex-derived memory clones, we utilized T cell receptor sequencing over the course of primary infection and rechallenge. We show that chronic Tcm are a clonally distinct lineage of Tex derived from progenitor exhausted cells, persist long-term in the absence of antigen, and undergo rapid clonal expansion during rechallenge. Finally, we demonstrate that PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade after chronic LCMV infection preferentially expands clones which form Tcm after clearance. Together, these data support the concept that chronically stimulated T cells form bona fide functional memory T cells through an analogous differentiation pathway to acutely stimulated T cells, which may have significant implications for enhancing immune memory to cancer through checkpoint blockade and vaccination.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

Systemic inflammation in ACLF can occur without overt infection, indicating alternative pathways of immune activation and microbial translocation. Intestinal perturbations, bacterial translocation, and the resulting systemic inflammation and immune dysfunction are defining features of ACLF, yet the identification of specific microbial contributors remains poorly elucidated.

ObjectiveTo investigate the relationship between gut microbiome alterations, systemic inflammation, and clinical markers of disease severity across the cirrhosis spectrum.

DesignThis cross-sectional, prospective study analysed faecal microbiota, plasma bile acids, urinary and plasma metabolites, markers of gut and systemic inflammation and translocation, and monocyte dysfunction, in a well-phenotyped cohort of patients with ACLF, decompensated cirrhosis and stable cirrhosis, in comparison with healthy individuals.

ResultsAdvanced stages of cirrhosis were marked by a higher abundance of Enterococcus, which correlated with markers of systemic inflammation, particularly in ACLF patients. Concurrently, the abundance of anaerobic commensal genera such as Roseburia, Ruminococcus, and Faecalibacterium were significantly lower. Lower urinary hippurate and trimethylamine N-oxide TMAO levels, linked to reduced microbial metabolism and dietary fibre intake, paralleled these microbiome changes. While elevated plasma primary bile acids reflected hepatic dysfunction, systemic inflammatory markers suggested parallel gut barrier dysfunction and microbial translocation in advanced cirrhosis.

ConclusionThis study underscores a potential role of greater intestinal Enterococcus abundance, as cirrhosis severity increases and where clinically there is more antibiotic exposure, as a driver of gut barrier inflammation and dysfunction, and systemic immune dysfunction in advanced cirrhosis. Further research into tailored microbiome-targeted therapies, including prebiotics and probiotics, and more focused antibiotic use may prevent Enterococcus dominance and restore gut-liver axis homeostasis and mitigate disease progression in CLD.

Using the expression of Caenorhabditis elegans FAT-7, a stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase, as a proxy for lifespan modulation, we conduct a genome-wide bacterial mutant screen and identify 26 Escherichia coli mutants that enhance host lifespan. Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses reveal that these mutant diets induce oxidative stress and activate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Lifespan extension requires the oxidative stress response regulators SKN-1, SEK-1, and HLH-30. Mechanistically, these effects are linked to reduced iron availability, as iron supplementation restores FAT-7 expression, suppresses UPRmt activation, and abolishes lifespan extension. Iron chelation mimics the pro-longevity effects of the mutant diets, highlighting dietary iron as a key modulator of aging.

Sources of somatic mutations include imperfect DNA repair, replication errors, and exogenous damage such as ultraviolet radiation. A previous study estimated a surprisingly low number of somatic mutations in a 234-year-old individual of the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), known as the Napoleon Oak. It has been suggested that the true number of somatic mutations was underestimated due to gaps in the reference genome and too conservative filtering of potential mutations. We therefore generated new high-fidelity long-read data for the Napoleon Oak (n = 12) to produce both a pseudo-haploid genome assembly and a partially phased diploid assembly. The high heterozygosity allowed for complete reconstruction of phased and gapless centromeres for 22 of the 24 chromosomes. On the other hand, the high heterozygosity posed challenges for short-read alignments. Use of only the pseudo-haploid assembly as a reference led to potential misalignments, while use of only the diploid assembly reduced variant detection sensitivity. Since most somatic mutations are layer-specific, the observed frequency is expected relatively low, even where all cells in a single layer contain a specific mutation. To address this challenge, we employed a read assignment strategy, selecting the appropriate reference sequence (pseudo-haploid or diploid) based on alignment score and mapping quality. Ultimately, we identified 198 high-confidence somatic mutations, compared with 17 somatic mutations identified before with the same set of short reads. Our approach thus increased the total estimated annual mutation rate by a factor of five.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

Due to the importance of the Asgard archaea for our understanding of cellular evolution and eukaryotic complexity, recent efforts have focused on better characterizing the genomic diversity of this lineage and its relatives from the TACK archaea. Newly discovered lineages, the Njordarchaeales and Panguiarchaeales, are difficult to place, branching either with Korarchaeota or Asgard archaea. The phylogenetic position of these taxa is important because they include genome-reduced and potentially symbiotic lineages, which may help to inform our understanding of genome evolution and the evolution of symbiotic interactions within Asgard archaea and their relatives. To resolve the placement of Njordarchaeales and Panguiarchaeales in the archaeal tree, we performed a range of phylogenetic analyses revealing that the Njordarchaeales and Pangiuarchaeales constitute the newly-identified class Njordarchaeia within the Asgard archaea. Members of the Njordarchaeia exhibit hallmarks of adaptations to (hyper-) thermophilic lifestyles, which may contribute conflicting signals to phylogenetic analyses. Panguiarchaeum appears to be metabolically distinct from its relatives, displaying reduced metabolic potential and various auxotrophies. Gene tree-species tree reconciliation recovers a complex common ancestor of Asgard archaea that encoded the Wood Ljungdahl pathway, however the subsequent loss of this pathway during the reductive evolution of Panguiarchaeum may have been associated with the switch to a symbiotic lifestyle based on H2 syntrophy. Our analyses identify Panguiarchaeum as the first described Asgard archaea lineage with streamlined genomes that show indications for a symbiotic lifestyle.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

To detect C. auris we aimed to compare different culture-, and molecular-based methods.

MethodsRectal swabs routinely collected in clinical care were spiked with different concentrations of C. auris. Co-infection/colonization was mimicked by spiking part of these samples with other pathogenic Candida species. Spiked materials were cultured at 37{degrees}C or 42{degrees}C using CHROMagar Candida and CHROMagar CandidaPlus plates. In parallel, samples were incubated in a dulcitol salt enrichment broth. Additionally, we compared seven in-house and commercial molecular tests on the direct material and from the broth one day after inoculation.

ResultsCulture-based methods showed sensitivities up to 100% within 48 hours of incubation, although sensitivity decreased as low as 44% at lower concentrations ([&le;]50 CFU per inoculum), in the presence of an abundance of other species and at higher temperature (42{degrees}C). Incubation at 42{degrees}C made visual identification possible since other species with similar colony morphologies did not grow at this temperature. No added value of using the dulcitol salt enrichment broth was found. qPCR on direct materials was highly sensitive and specific (both up to 100%) but major differences between various molecular tests were observed.

ConclusionWe showed that both culture-based and molecular methods are sensitive for diagnosing C. auris. The clinical setting (routine screening versus an outbreak), local prevalence and the load in those that carry or are infected by C. auris are important factors to consider when determining which diagnostic tests should be employed.","NA","medrxiv",1739830093913

Sounds from multiple sources overlap in time and frequency. In particular, dynamic ""foreground"" sounds are often masked by more stationary ""background"" sounds. Human auditory cortex exhibits a hierarchical organization where background-invariant representations are progressively enhanced along the processing stream, from primary to non-primary regions. However, we do not know whether this organizational principle is conserved across species and which neural mechanisms drive this invariance. To address these questions, we investigated background invariance in ferret auditory cortex using functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI), which enables large-scale, high-resolution recordings of hemodynamic responses. We measured responses across primary, secondary, and tertiary auditory cortical regions as ferrets passively listened to mixtures of natural sounds and their components in isolation. We found a hierarchical gradient of background invariance, mirroring findings in humans: responses in primary auditory cortex reflected contributions from both foreground and background sounds, while background invariance increased in higher-order auditory regions. Using a spectrotemporal filter-bank model, we found that in ferrets, this hierarchical structure could be largely explained by tuning to low-order acoustic features. However, this model failed to fully account for background invariance in human non-primary auditory cortex, suggesting that additional, higher-order mechanisms are crucial for background segregation in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

It has been hypothesized that fixation of a single morph can result in character release, whereby the monomorphic form evolves without the constraint of accommodating multiple adaptive peaks. However, the rates of evolution between populations fixed for different morphs likely depend on the specific adaptive zones occupied by each morph. We studied the evolution of dorsal color polymorphism (striped and unstriped morphs) in woodland salamanders (Plethodon), a North American radiation in which the polymorphism can be found in even the most distantly related species (~44 Ma divergence). We estimated a phylogenomic tree of Plethodon, representing all extant taxa with multiple samples for most species. Morphometric data suggest that between-species variation exists predominantly along an axis of relative body elongation, likely corresponding to a terrestrial-fossorial continuum. Polymorphic species occupy an intermediate phenotypic space between the evolutionary optima of striped and unstriped species, although polymorphic species did not have elevated speciation rates. Faster rates of body shape evolution were observed in unstriped species, suggesting that body elongation, which is co-adapted with the unstriped morph, is constrained by the polymorphism. Striped species had slower rates of evolution than polymorphic species, despite lacking the genetic constraints often associated with polymorphism. Our results demonstrate that rates of phenotypic evolution and speciation following character release can be asymmetric and idiosyncratic depending on the alternative adaptations of each morph.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

It comprises several members, among which IFN-2 and IFN-{beta} are the most extensively studied, with important antiviral and immune-modulatory functions. Recent findings linking autoantibodies against type-I interferons to severe COVID-19 suggest a potential role for IFN-{omega} in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, little is known about human IFN-{omega}, as most research on this interferon has been conducted in feline models. Here, we demonstrate that human IFN-{omega} is secreted at levels comparable to those of IFN-2 or IFN-{beta} upon stimulation with inflammatory agonists and triggers a robust antiviral response, inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Moreover, IFN-{omega} enhances the effector functions of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells primed de novo from healthy donor cells, highlighting its capacity to promote strong cellular immunity. Our results position IFN-{omega} as a key member of the type-I interferon family, with promising potential for therapeutic and vaccine applications.

Author SummaryType-I interferons are pleiotropic cytokines, including IFN- and IFN-{beta}, which are well known for their antiviral activities. Here, we report on the functional characteristics of human IFN-{omega}, a neglected member of the type-I IFN family, which has primarily been studied in feline models. We show here that human IFN-{omega} induces intense downstream signaling in cells resulting in the upregulation of antiviral genes, and efficient restriction of SARS-CoV-2 replication. IFN-{omega} also promotes the acquisition of strong cytolytic functions by antigen primed CD8+ T cells. Overall, our findings portray human IFN-{omega} as a major antiviral molecule, similar to the well-studied and highly effective IFN-2. The secretion of IFN-{omega} upon infection is likely to be crucial for effective control of multiple viruses, advocating for its use in therapeutic approaches in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

Chromatin, particularly transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin, resists nuclear deformations through its mechanical response. However, chromatin also exhibits liquid-like properties, casting ambiguity on the physical mechanisms of chromatin-based nuclear elasticity. To determine how heterochromatin strengthens nuclear mechanical response, we performed polymer physics simulations of a nucleus model validated by micromechanical measurements and chromosome conformation capture data. The attachment of peripheral heterochromatin to the lamina is required to transmit forces directly to the chromatin and elicit its elastic response. Thus, increases in heterochromatin levels increase nuclear rigidity by increasing the linkages between chromatin and the lamina. Crosslinks within heterochromatin, such as HP1 proteins, can also stiffen nuclei, but only if chromatin is peripherally tethered. In contrast, heterochromatin affinity interactions that may drive liquid-liquid phase separation do not contribute to nuclear rigidity. When the nucleus is stretched, gel-like peripheral heterochromatin can bear stresses and deform, while the more fluid-like interior euchromatin is less perturbed. Thus, heterochromatin's internal structure and stiffness may regulate nuclear mechanics via peripheral attachment to the lamina, while also enabling nuclear mechanosensing of external forces and external measurement of the nucleus' internal architecture.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

RNA-seq and ATAC-seq revealed major transcriptional and chromatin changes between these stages and identified TGFB-Induced Homeobox Factor 2 (TGIF2) as a key candidate factor in neurogenic NSCs. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated a potent role of TGIF2 controlling NSC fate maintenance mediated by its interaction with the SIN3A/HDAC repressor complex suppressing neuronal differentiation genes.

We do this based on a series of piecemeal GWASs of segments of a target (continuous) trait distribution, and the genetic correlations between those GWASs and a second trait. Simulations confirm that we are able to retrieve the shape of the relationship given certain assumptions about the nature of the relationship between the traits. We applied the method to the genetic relationship between BMI, sleep duration, and height, and psychiatric disorders (ADHD, anorexia nervosa, and depression) using data from approximately 450K individuals from UK Biobank.

In the relationship between BMI and psychiatric traits, we found that the expected value of depression is a nonlinear function of BMI i.e. there is a nonlinear genetic relationship between both traits. We observed similar findings for the genetic relationship between BMI and anorexia, sleep duration and depression, and sleep duration and ADHD. We observed no underlying nonlinearity in the genetic relationship between height and psychiatric traits.

Using a novel statistical approach, we show that nonlinear genetic relationships between traits are detectable and genetic associations as quantified using global estimators like genetic correlations are not informative about underlying complexities in these relationships. Our findings challenge assumptions of linearity in genetic epidemiology and suggest that bivariate genetic associations are not uniform across the phenotypic spectrum, which may have implications for the development of targeted interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

This genetic variation is vital for populations to adapt to their environments, but it is also surprising given that nature (after all) ""selects"" the best genotypes at the expense of those that fall short. Explaining the extensive genetic variation of fitness-related traits is thus a longstanding puzzle in evolutionary biology, with cascading implications for ecology, conservation, and human health. Balancing selection--an umbrella term for scenarios of natural selection that maintain genetic variation-- is a century-old explanation to resolve this paradox that has gained recent momentum from genome-scale methods for detecting it. Yet evaluating whether balancing selection can, in fact, resolve the paradox is challenging, given the logistical constraints of distinguishing balancing selection from alternative hypotheses and the daunting collection of theoretical models that formally underpin this debate. Here, we track the development of balancing selection theory over the last century and provide an accessible review of this rich collection of models. We first outline the range of biological scenarios that can generate balancing selection. We then examine how fundamental features of genetic systems--including non-random mating between individuals, differences in ploidy, genetic drift, and different genetic architectures of traits-- have been progressively incorporated into the theory. We end by linking these theoretical predictions to ongoing empirical efforts to understand the evolutionary processes that explain genetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

Functional and gene regulatory differences drive phenotypic divergence, including the distinctive brain anatomy of humans compared to chimpanzees and other apes. However, little is known about species differences in gene expression, and how they relate to the evolution of neuroanatomy and cognition. This is primarily due to the limited availability of great ape brain samples and challenges in comparative spatial transcriptomic studies. Here, we present the first spatial transcriptomic data from a chimpanzee brain based on post mortem tissue from an adult female, who was euthanised due to poor health. We focus on the frontal pole, a brain region that has undergone significant evolutionary changes in size and organisation since the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees, and is considered critical for cognitive evolution. We examined the gene expression profiles and cell-type composition of the frontal pole on the left hemisphere, including both neuronal and non-neuronal cell types across cortical layers and white matter. By integrating our spatial transcriptomic data with a publicly available single-nucleus transcriptomic dataset of the chimpanzee dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, we mapped the spatial distribution of 29 chimpanzee brain cell types.

In this work, we compare and evaluate the annotation performance of the GPT-4 model against traditional methods on nine randomly selected public single cell RNA seq datasets from cellxgene, covering diverse tissue types. Our evaluation highlights the complexity of annotating cell types in single-cell data, revealing key differences between automated and manual approaches.

However, the drivers of these effects intracellularly remain unclear. Here, in Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that loss of coordinated inter-organelle dynamics causally initiates metabolic inflexibility with age. In young animals, peroxisomes emerge as the priming orchestrators of the fasting response, simultaneously governing lipid droplets (LDs) utilization and mitochondrial bioenergetics. With age, peroxisomal priming is lost, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired dynamic nutrient responses during fasting. Notably, dietary restriction (DR) exerts a rejuvenating effect on peroxisomal function, thereby preserving mitochondrial integrity and promoting longevity. Our study uncovers the expansive network of organelles enabling lipid mobilization during youth, providing critical context to the poorly understood role of peroxisomes in actively maintaining organelle homeodynamics and metabolic flexibility throughout the aging process.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

This unique structural plasticity facilitates diverse molecular recognition and function; thus, a convenient way to view IDRs is through their ensembles. Here, we combine advances in physics-based force fields for IDPs with the power of modern multi-scale generative modeling to develop STARLING, an approach for the rapid and accurate prediction of IDR ensembles directly from sequence. STARLING enables ensembles of hundreds of conformers to be generated in seconds and works on GPUs and CPUs. This, in turn, dramatically lowers the barrier to the computational interrogation of IDR function through the lens of emergent biophysical properties in addition to traditional bioinformatic approaches. We evaluate STARLINGs accuracy against experimental data and offer a series of vignettes illustrating how STARLING can enable rapid hypothesis generation for IDR function or the interpretation of experimental data.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

Although extensive literature exists on both neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), namely Alzheimers and Parkinsons, and COVID-19, their intersection remains underexplored. Co-morbidity modeling is essential, as patients, particularly those hospitalized, often present with multiple conditions. This study addresses this gap by investigating the crosstalk between COVID-19 and NDDs using a combination of knowledge graphs built from curated biomedical datasets and text mining tools. We conducted comprehensive graph analyses, including path analysis, phenotype coverage assessment, and mapping of cellular and genetic factors, to examine how various Knowledge Graphs (KGs)--such as PrimeKG, DrugBank, OpenTargets, and those generated from natural language processing (NLP) methodologies--illuminate molecular and phenotypic relationships between these diseases. Our findings reveal significant variability in graph density and connectivity across datasets, each offering unique insights into the landscape of COVID-19 and NDD co-morbidities. By integrating structured biological data with unstructured textual data, this study aimed to optimize co-morbidity modeling, maximize recall for identifying potential co-morbidity mechanisms, and consolidate this information in a dedicated co-morbidity hypothesis database. Key genetic and inflammatory markers, particularly immune response genes, emerged as consistent features across multiple KGs, reinforcing their potential role in COVID-19-NDD interactions.

In a previous study, we showed that oligomers of A{beta}1-42 (oA{beta}1-42) induced PM damage, resulting in PM repair cascade via lysosomal exocytosis coupled with endocytosis, and facilitation of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs)-like membrane protrusions to promote direct cell-to-cell transfer of aggregates. In this study, we demonstrated that PM damage induced by oligomers of the aggregation-prone peptide A{beta}1-42 significantly facilitates PM repair by enhancing phosphorylated p21-activated kinase 1 (pPAK1)-dependent endocytosis and Rab3a-dependent exocytosis in SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH neuronal cells compared to control and oA{beta}1-40 treated cells. We studied the kinetics of pPAK1-dependent endocytosis and the fusion of EGFP-Rab3a vesicles near the PM using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. IPA-3, a selective non-ATP competitive inhibitor of PAK1, inhibits endocytosis of oA{beta} peptides and Rab3a-dependent PM repair. Further, shRNA-mediated knockdown of the Rab3a gene inhibits pPAK1 and disrupts PM repair. Repair of damaged PM is a vital protective mechanism for non-proliferative cells like neurons, as disruption in PM repair leads to gradual neuronal cell death.

In cultured mouse cortical neurons, we detected effects of hydrocortisone on many PNN component genes, via diverse mechanisms. A rapid (<4h), glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated suppression of neurocan and hyaluronan synthase (Has) 1 and 3 mRNAs was observed at 7 days in vitro (DIV), whereas at 14DIV, brevican and versican expression was reduced by hydrocortisone without GR involvement, while GR inhibition elevated Has1 and Has2 mRNA levels and suppressed aggrecan mRNA levels. Tenascin R expression was rapidly suppressed by hydrocortisone at 7DIV but not at 14. At 21DIV, PNN component gene expression had become insensitive to hydrocortisone, although parvalbumin expression was reduced after 24h but not 4h exposure. Additionally, effects on protein levels were observed that were sometimes consistent with the mRNA changes (e.g. Has3, Gad1) and sometimes unrelated to them (e.g. elevated TnR levels at 14DIV after glucocorticoid receptor antagonism). We found that hydrocortisone could directly inhibit proteasome activity, potentially explaining the ability of hydrocortisone to increase Has2 levels. As expected from these results, the overall structure of the PNN was compromised by hydrocortisone exposure, with the length of proximal dendrite covered by PNN being reduced. Overall, the data demonstrate a complex and profound, but developmental stage-dependent, regulation of PNN component gene expression by glucocorticoids. This may contribute to the action of severe prenatal or perinatal stress to increase schizophrenia risk.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

Through a computational model, we hypothesized that oncolytic viruses encoding a T cell-stimulating signal like IFN-{gamma} can enhance efficacy regardless of macrophages. To test this, we engineered an alphavirus-based replicon expressing IFN-{gamma} and studied its effect in various tumor-immune coculture systems. While alphavirus replicons do not replicate in macrophages, macrophages readily take up the virus, limiting tumor infection in a frequency-dependent but phenotype-independent manner. However, virus uptake activates the pro-inflammatory responses, further enhanced by neighboring cancer cells expressing virus-encoded IFN-{gamma}. Consequently, T-cell activation was ensured even when a fraction of infected tumor cells expressed IFN-{gamma}, regardless of macrophage presence, frequency, or phenotype. These findings suggest a strategy for optimizing oncolytic virotherapy in tumors with high macrophage infiltration by designing viruses that can stimulate T-cell activation, ensuring therapeutic efficacy.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

This study systematically compares the lipidomes of five commonly used laboratory yeast strains: BY4741, W303, D273-10B, RM11-1a, and CEN.PK2-1c. Shotgun lipidomics reveals significant variations in lipid class and acyl chain composition down to the level of molecular species. Notably, the most abundant lipid class differed between the strains: phosphatidylinositol (PI) lipids are predominant in BY4741, while phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids are in D273. Ergosterol esters, which are the storage form of the major yeast sterol ergosterol, are at higher levels in all strains other than BY4741, correlating with a low gene expression of lipid metabolic enzymes Hmg1 and Are2 in BY4741. Despite these lipidomic differences, transcriptomic analysis did not show significant changes in most genes related to lipid metabolism, suggesting post-transcriptional modifications, protein abundance, and metabolic flux as potential regulatory mechanisms. This study underscores the complexity of lipidome regulation and the need for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

While the design and modeling of peptides in general has seen rapid advances since the advent of modern machine learning methods, existing deep learning models cannot effectively predict cyclic peptide structures containing non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs), which are often crucial for peptide therapeutics. To address this limitation, we here extend the recent AF3-style model Boltz to cyclic peptides with ncAAs. In addition to the positional encoding offset, we used a simple yet effective extension of the cyclic offset encoding based on AlphaFold3 tokenization scheme that allows the modeling of cyclic peptides with modified residues. On a test set of peptides with ncAAs, our approach outperforms HighFold2 on 13/17 cases, with an average C RMSD of 1.877[A] and an average all-atom RMSD of 3.361[A]. Our results show that the cyclic offset encoding shown for AlphaFold2 generalizes to AlphaFold3-based models and can be extended to incorporate ncAAs, showing potential in the design of novel cyclic peptides with ncAAs for therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

This toolset is complemented here by proposing a flexible method which allows to estimate origination and extinction times, as well as model preservation potential in flexible ways. A method is presented for representing the stratigraphic interval as a continuous distribution by integrating over parameter uncertainty through the use of the posterior predictive distribution. It is possible then to combine these distributions using conflation, to build a time probabilistic model for the co-occurrence of these intervals. Empirical examples using Palynomorphs and the origination time of the marine Barracudas are used for illustrating the potential of the method. The methods are implemented in the StratIntervals.jl Julia package, which allows a big amount of possible prior distributions, and MCMC samplers.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

Here we found that female hybrids between Mus musculus domesticus and Mus spicilegus mice are sterile due to the failure of homologous chromosome separation in oocyte meiosis I, producing aneuploid eggs. This non-separation phenotype was driven by the mis-localization of the cohesin protector, SGO2, along the chromosome arms instead of its typical centromeric enrichment, resulting in cohesin over-protection. The upstream kinase, BUB1, showed a significantly higher activity in hybrid oocytes, explaining SGO2 mis-targeting along the chromosome arm. Higher BUB1 activity was not observed in mitosis, consistent with viable hybrid mice. Cohesion defects were also evident in hybrid mice from another genus, Peromyscus, wherein cohesin protection is weakened. Defective chromosome cohesion in oocytes is a leading cause of reduced fertility especially with advanced maternal age. Our work provides evidence that a major cause of human infertility may play a positive role in promoting mammalian speciation.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

Adaptation is predicted to occur over long evolutionary timescales, but recent work suggests that interactions between the epigenome and transposable elements (TEs) could link environmental acclimation with rapid adaptation. Yet combining all these factors in a tractable model system remains challenging; consequently little is known about how these processes interact in natural genetic backgrounds or shape evolutionarily relevant phenotypes. To investigate these interactions, we carried out laboratory experiments measuring gene expression and chromatin accessibility responses to heat shock in female D. melanogaster from arid and temperate climates and their associations with population variation in TEs. The consequences for fitness-related phenotypes were characterised in the offspring, and we also measured expression, chromatin accessibility and phenotypic traits three generations later to explore transgenerational inheritance. Expression and accessibility responses to heat shock varied between populations and were influenced by the presence of TEs, with more upregulated responses in the arid population. Effects of heat shock on transcription were detected three generations later, especially in the arid population, with many epigenetic genes transgenerationally expressed, although this was not driven by chromatin accessibility. Heat shock negatively affected phenotypes in the initial offspring cohort, but later arid population cohorts developed quicker than controls, indicating hormesis, an effect still present in the great-great-grandoffspring. These results demonstrate the transgenerational inheritance of a potentially beneficial hormetic phenotype and associated patterns of gene expression in a natural insect population.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

We investigate the likelihood of evolutionary rescue on a mutator background that either emerges de novo or pre-exists in the population prior to a severe environmental change. If such an evolutionary rescue event occurs, the mutator lineage sweeps into the population, and thus the environmental stress has promoted mutators. Our findings indicate that mutation rate evolution can substantially boost rescue probabilities, but stronger mutators are most effective when the wildtype has a low mutation rate, while their advantage diminishes for higher wildtype mutation rates. Interestingly, at intermediate wildtype mutation rates, emerging mutators can be almost equally likely to sweep no matter how slowly or quickly the environment changes. However, at low wildtype mutation rates, mutators are only likely to sweep for very slow environmental changes due to the sequential nature of necessary mutations for such sweeps to occur. Finally, we show that pre-existing mutators can be significantly more likely to rescue the population compared to the wildtype, provided the wildtype's mutation rate is relatively low. This research opens new avenues for investigating mutator dynamics in response to environmental stress.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

An open question concerns the design of proteins that in addition to having the correct target structure also have precisely tuned kinetic properties, such as folding and unfolding rates. To address this problem, we formulate the inverse folding problem as a quest for a sequence with a target free energy landscape. To propose a procedure to address this problem, here we describe the Inverse Folding Molecular Dynamics (IF-MD) method, which combines inverse folding with enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and Bayesian optimization. IF-MD leverages ensemble averages from molecular dynamics simulations, reweighted according to a Bayesian framework, to guide the design of sequences exhibiting specific kinetic properties. We demonstrate the methodology by optisising the binding kinetics of H11, a nanobody against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), thus identifying nanobody variants with slower unbinding kinetics than H11. Mechanistic analysis reveals that this kinetic property arises from a shift towards configurations closer to the bound state and increased free energy barriers for dissociation. These findings highlight the power of IF-MD for efficiently navigating the vast sequence space to design proteins with a tailored free energy landscape.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

We introduce a simple fitness landscape model to predict hybrid fitness with arbitrary ploidy and an arbitrary number of hybridizing lineages. We test our model on published data from maize (Zea mays) and rye (Secale cereale), including hybrids between multiple inbred lines, both as diploids and synthetic tetraploids. Quantitative predictions for the effects of inbreeding, and the strength of progressive heterosis, are well supported. This suggests that the model captures the important properties of dosage and genetic interactions, and may help to unify theories of heterosis and reproductive isolation.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

Yet, there are several lines of evidence for strong but differential regulation of pattern separation by local circuit connectivity, even when feedforward connectivity is divergent. What are the relative contributions of divergent feedforward connectivity and local circuit interactions to pattern separation? How do we reconcile the contrasting lines of evidence on local circuit regulation of pattern separation in circuits endowed with divergent feedforward connectivity? In this study, we quantitatively address these questions in a population of heterogeneous dentate gyrus (DG) networks, where we enforced feedforward connectivity to be identically divergent. Methodology: We generated tens of thousands of random spiking neuronal models to arrive at thousands of non-repeating heterogeneous single-neuron models of four different DG neuronal subtypes, each satisfying their respective functional characteristics. We connected these heterogeneous populations of neurons with subtype proportions and local connectivity that reflected the DG microcircuit. In a second level of unbiased search, we generated 20,000 identical networks that differed from each other only in their synaptic weight values. Thus, within the Marr-Albus framework, these networks that were identical in terms of neuronal composition and divergent feedforward connectivity should all be capable of performing effective pattern separation. To test this, we fed these networks with morphed sets of input patterns, recorded granule cell outputs, and computed similarity metrics based on correlation measures across input or output patterns. We developed novel quantitative metrics for pattern separation from plots of output similarity vs. input similarity and validated each network with bounds on these metrics. Results: Despite being identical in terms of divergent feedforward connectivity, we found only a very small proportion (47 of 20,000 or 0.23%) of the randomly generated networks to manifest effective pattern separation. We tested the specific contributions of interneurons by assessing pattern separation in all pattern-separating networks after individually deleting each of the three interneuron subtypes. Strikingly, we found pronounced network-to-network variability in how each interneuron subtype contributed to granule cell sparsity and pattern separation. We traced this variability to differences in local synaptic connectivity, which also resulted in network-to-network variability in firing rates and sparsity of different interneurons. Finally, we found heterogeneous DG networks to be more resilient to synaptic jitter compared to their homogeneous counterparts, with specific reference to pattern separation computed through average firing rate correlations. Implications: Our population-of-networks approach clearly shows that divergent connectivity of afferent inputs does not guarantee pattern separation in DG networks. Instead, we demonstrate strong yet variable roles for interneurons and local connectivity in implementing pattern separation. Importantly, our analyses unveil degeneracy in DG circuits, whereby similar pattern separation efficacy was achieved through disparate local-circuit interactions. These observations, alongside network-to-network variability in dependencies on different interneurons, strongly advocate the complex adaptive systems approach as a unifying framework to study DG pattern separation.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

The mammalian small intestine, a vital digestive organ that absorbs nutrients, is maintained by rapidly renewing Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) at the intestinal crypt base. While Lgr5+ ISCs drive intestinal adaptation by altering self-renewal and differentiation divisions in response to diverse diets such as high-fat diets and fasting regimens, little is known about how micronutrients, particularly amino acids, instruct Lgr5+ ISC fate decisions to control intestinal homeostasis and repair after injury. Here, we demonstrate that cysteine, an essential amino acid, enhances the ability of Lgr5+ ISCs to repair intestinal injury. Cysteine metabolically contributes to the biosynthesis of Coenzyme A (CoA) in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), promoting the expansion of CD8{beta}+ T cells. The ISC-enhancing effects of cysteine can be recapitulated by Coenzyme A supplementation and blocked by loss of the IEC cystine transporter. Mechanistically, the effects of cysteine and CoA on ISC-driven repair are mediated by elevated IL-22 from intraepithelial CD8{beta}+ T cells. These findings highlight how coupled cysteine metabolism between ISCs and CD8+ T cells augments intestinal stemness, providing a dietary approach that exploits ISC and immune cell crosstalk for ameliorating intestinal damage.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093913

Thus, we hypothesized that sensitivity to CDK2 inhibition is linked to the absence of this CDK4/6-mediated compensatory mechanism. Here we show that Cyclin E1-driven ovarian cancers often co-express the tumor suppressor p16, which inhibits CDK4/6. We show that ovarian cancer cells expressing p16 exhibit heightened sensitivity to CDK2 inhibitors and that depletion of p16 renders them significantly more resistant. Multiplexed immunofluorescence of 225 ovarian patient tumors reveals that at least 18% of tumors express high Cyclin E1 and high p16, a group that we expect to be particularly sensitive to CDK2 inhibition.

To explore the potential for cross-tolerance, we first adapted Saccharomyces cerevisiae to high concentrations of six single metals in a short-term evolutionary rescue experiment. We then measured the cross-tolerance of each metal-adapted line in the other five metals. We generated and tested three predictors for the degree of cross-tolerance, based on the similarity between pairs of metal environments in (1) their physiochemical properties, (2) the overlap in genes known to impact tolerance to both metals, and (3) their co-occurrence in the environment. None of these predictors explained significant variation in cross-tolerance. Instead, we observed that adapted lines in one metal were frequently cross-tolerant to certain metals (manganese and nickel) and intolerant to others (cobalt and zinc). Furthermore, cross-tolerance between pairs of metals was not reciprocal, with mutations accumulating in one metal (e.g., copper) providing adaptation to another metal (e.g., manganese), but not vice versa. Evolved lines also differed in their degree of specialization, with lines evolved in manganese or copper more specialized to that metal, but lines evolved in cobalt or zinc more generally tolerant. To determine the genetic basis of these metal adaptations, we sequenced the genomes of 109 metal-adapted yeast lines. The SNP mutation spectrum was significantly different in cadmium, cobalt, and manganese than expected in a mutation accumulation experiment in S. cerevisiae. In addition, two lines were highly mutated, bearing defects in DNA repair genes (both in manganese). Thirteen genes exhibited parallel adaptation to different metals; three of these genes generated broad cross-tolerance. Several mutations were found in vacuolar transporter genes, suggesting an important role for vacuolar proteins in adapting to metal stress. Our results with these metal-adapted lines indicate that cross-tolerance is challenging to predict, depending on the combined stressors experienced and the nature of the mutations involved.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093914

Their model predicted 63.3 million cases and 364,000 deaths, with a claimed 95% confidence interval of less than 1% of the estimated values.

ObjectiveTo validate the transmission model used by Kayano et al. by simulating infection counts in Japan during 2020 and assessing the impact of errors in the reproduction number of the Delta variant on infection count estimates in the counterfactual scenario.

MethodsWe replicated the model used by Kayano et al. to simulate infection dynamics in Japan during 2020. We evaluated the models performance by comparing the simulated infection surges with actual data. Additionally, we analyzed the sensitivity of infection count estimates to {+/-}10% errors in the reproduction number of the Delta variant, corresponding to the 95% confidence interval reported in the cited study.

ResultsThe model successfully reproduced the first infection surge in early 2020, but it failed to replicate the second and third infection surges in the summer and winter of 2020. Sensitivity analysis revealed that a {+/-}10% error in the reproduction number led to an estimated infection count error range of -25% to +42%.

ConclusionThe results suggest potential limitations in the validity of the counterfactual simulation results presented by Kayano et al., particularly regarding the accuracy of infection count estimates and the confidence interval.","NA","medrxiv",1739830093914

We find rapid evolution of genome architecture, including [~]100 Mb variation in genome size driven by dynamic satellite landscapes with unexpectedly long (> 10 kb) repeat units and widespread variation in gene content, influencing gene expression. SVs exhibit slightly deleterious dynamics modulated by variant length and population size, with strong evidence of adaptive fixation only in large populations.

Here, we assess the neutralizing activity of the authorized antibody pemivibart and the candidate antibody SA55 against major historical and currently dominant viral variants, including the JN.1 subvariants KP.3.1.1 and XEC. Our findings show that SA55 demonstrates broad neutralizing potency while pemivibart exhibits reduced neutralizing activity against currently dominant variants. Then we employ replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus with the JN.1 spike (rVSV{Delta}G-JN.1) to select escape variants of SA55. Following this, we conduct a systematic comparison of escape profiles for these two antibodies, revealing that SA55 is remarkably resilient to escape mutations under antibody selection, which is consistent with our SPR data indicating that SA55 possesses a substantially stronger binding affinity. Moreover, an immunobridging analysis suggests that SA55 may have superior clinical efficacy to pemivibart in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection under the current variant landscape. Together, this work highlights the promise of SA55 as a potential therapeutic option in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, especially in immunocompromised populations.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093914

Interindividual variation in connectome architecture associates with disease status, cognition, lifestyle factors, and other personal attributes. While models to predict personal attributes from a persons connectome are abundant, the inverse task-- inferring connectome architecture from an individuals personal profile--has not been widely studied. Here, we introduce a deep model to generate a persons entire connectome exclusively based on their age, sex, body phenotypes, cognition, and lifestyle factors. Using the richly phenotyped UK Biobank connectome cohort (N=8,086), we demonstrate that our model can generate network architectures that closely recapitulate connectomes mapped empirically using diffusion MRI and tractography. We find that age, sex, and body phenotypes exert the strongest influence on the connectome generation process, with an impact approximately four times greater than that of cognition and lifestyle factors. Regional differences in the importance of measures were observed, including an increased importance of cognition in the association cortex relative to the visual system. We further show that generated connectomes can improve the training of machine learning models and reduce their predictive errors. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of inferring brain connectivity from an individuals personal data and enables future applications of connectome generation such as data augmentation and anonymous data sharing.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093914

Chronic- restraint stress (CRS) and ethanol intake are independently known to induce changes in brain structure and function, however, their combined effects on neurodevelopment over long periods of time remains largely unexplored. We conducted an in vivo longitudinal rat model with three main goals. 1) to determine if chronic stress increases ethanol intake; 2) to determine the effect of chronic- stress and ethanol intake in behavioral measures, brain structure, and function; and 3) to investigate the effect of sex. This observational study included Wistar rats assigned to four groups: 1) ethanol consumption (EtOH+/CRS-), 2) stress exposure (EtOH-/CRS+), 3) both ethanol and stress exposure (EtOH+/CRS+), and 4) control group (EtOH-/CRS-). Our results showed that chronic stress did not affect ethanol intake but led to reduced body weight gain, elevated corticosterone levels, and impaired recognition memory. Structural MRI revealed that both exposures produced additive brain volume changes in regions such as the olfactory bulb, orbitofrontal cortex, caudate-putamen, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Functional connectivity analysis using network-based statistics identified disrupted cortical-subcortical connections. Results found here were sex-dependent in terms of volumetric changes (higher effects on males) and functional connectivity (higher effects on females). Findings suggest sex-dependent mechanisms where both chronic- ethanol intake and stress affect brain plasticity during neurodevelopment. Understanding these region-specific vulnerabilities is crucial for addressing alcohol use disorders and stress-related neuropathology.

The potential neuroprotective effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination remain underexplored. Here, we demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of a psoralen-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a non-human primate model using resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG), a non-invasive neurophysiological recording technique with sub-millisecond temporal and submillimeter spatial resolution. MEG scans demonstrated substantial preservation of neural activity across multiple brain regions in vaccinated subjects compared to unvaccinated controls following viral challenge. This approach not only underscores the role of vaccination in mitigating severe neurological outcomes but also highlights the capability of MEG to detect subtle yet significant changes in brain function that may be overlooked by other imaging modalities. These findings advance our understanding of vaccine-induced neuroprotection and establish MEG as a powerful tool for monitoring brain function in the context of viral infections.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093914

Nascent proteins can begin to fold on their parent ribosome but formation of the native state is often inhibited well beyond the emergence of the necessary residues from the exit tunnel. The dominant forces driving this apparent destabilisation have remained unclear. We investigate this here, combining NMR experiments and atomistic simulations of a folded nascent chain on and off the ribosome. While its native structure and internal dynamics remain unaltered, co-translational folding is disfavoured due to intermolecular electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged ribosome surface and nascent protein. Partially folded intermediates are less destabilised, resulting in their high populations. Specifically, we show that the polypeptides net charge is the dominant factor determining nascent folding thermodynamics, with smaller contributions from charge distribution. Consequently, positively charged proteins can fold on the ribosome without populating stable intermediates. These findings reconcile conflicting observations of previous studies and establish the general physical principles underpinning de novo protein folding.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093914

Across protein-level, taxonomic composition-level, and ecosystem-level analyses, we simultaneously identified metaproteomic shifts in 47 compounds, a tri-stability taxonomic landscape, and, using our PhyloFunc beta-diversity metric, three distinct functional community state types with cross-individual ecological consistency. Notably, neuropharmaceuticals triggered profound metaproteomic alterations, marked by a decline in functional redundancy (FR) and an increase in antimicrobial resistance proteins (ARPs), shifting the community to alternative functional state on the functional landscape. We validated that enhancing FR maintained a microbiotas resilience against neuropharmaceutical-induced ARP increase. These findings establish a novel landscape-based framework for understanding microbiome resilience and advancing targeted therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093914

Similar to advancements in AI for other scientific fields, deeper research into biological LLMs has begun to focus on using these models to rediscover important existing biological laws or uncover entirely new patterns in biological sequences. This study leverages GPT-like LLMs to utilize language transfer capabilities to rediscover the genetic code rules of the central dogma. In our experimental design, we transformed the central dogma into a binary classification problem of aligning DNA sequences with protein sequences, where positive examples are matching DNA and protein sequences, and negative examples are non-matching pairs. We first trained a GPT-2 model from scratch using a dataset comprising protein sequences, DNA sequences, and sequences from languages such as English and Chinese. Subsequently, we fine-tuned the model using the natural language sentences similarity judgment dataset from PAWS-X. When tested on a dataset for DNA and protein sequence alignment judgment, the fine-tuned model achieved a classification accuracy of 81%. The study also analyzed factors contributing to this zero-shot capability, including model training stability and types of training data. This research demonstrates that LLMs can, through the transfer of natural language capabilities and solely relying on the analysis of sequences themselves, rediscover the central dogma without prior knowledge of it. This study bridges natural language and genetic language, opening a new door for AI-driven biological research.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093914

Understanding the neural mechanism of cognitive reserve could help assessing the therapeutic effectiveness of interventions in AD. To address this, here, 38 elderly participants performed a sustained attention task during high-density EEG while awake and during drowsiness. Operationally, the degree to which performance was impaired under drowsiness signalled the extent of cognitive reserve, with less impairment indicating a higher level of cognitive reserve. Investigating performance variations during the active management of neural challenges offers a novel approach to studying cognitive reserve, capturing dynamics that mirror everyday cognitive demand. We related cognitive reserve to various measures, including informational complexity using the Lempel-Ziv (LZSUM) algorithm. We found a significant interaction effect between arousal and performance, where LZSUM values increased in high performers when drowsy but decreased in low performers. This effect was most pronounced in the frontal and central areas. Our findings suggest LZSUM to be indicative of a compensatory mechanism and thus show potential for LZSUM as a neural marker in assessing cognitive reserve. However, we found no consistent relationship between performance and structural brain measures, and proxies of cognitive reserve. Critically, our findings present a counterexample to the prevailing view that informational complexity purely reflects conscious level. Further research, such as a study with the same paradigm in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, may lead to additional insights of whether we are truly measuring cognitive reserve.","NA","biorxiv",1739830093914

Despite numerous clinical observations and causality investigations, understanding of the diseases progression and recovery process following infection remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the causal connections between COVID-19 and various diseases using Mendelian randomization studies to provide robust theoretical underpinnings for the development of effective rehabilitation and intervention strategies.

MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies on Mendelian randomization related to COVID-19 published up to October 21, 2024. We used an extensive search strategy with the keywords ""Mendelian randomization"" and ""COVID-19"". Two pairs of coauthors independently extracted data on study characteristics, exposure, and outcomes, resolving discrepancies through discussion. We included studies that considered susceptibility to COVID-19, hospitalization, or severe infection as the exposure and disease-related effects or impacts on human health as outcomes. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the MR-STROBE criteria and extracted the relative risk (odds ratio [OR]) using a random-effects model for meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42025615426.

ResultsOf the 1654 studies identified, 87 met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis. The primary outcome suggests that COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of cardio-cerebral vascular diseases. Subgroup analyses identified an increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders, including optic nerve disorders, epilepsy, schizophrenia, generalized anxiety disorder, stroke, myocardial infarction with COVID-19. There is also a notable association between COVID-19 and the immune system, particularly neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and myasthenia gravis.

ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that COVID-19 infection has direct causal effects on human health or certain diseases at the genetic level, which may manifest as increased or decreased susceptibility to disease and changes in disease severity.","NA","medrxiv",1739830093914
