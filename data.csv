This assumption underpins predictions about evolutionary dynamics, epistatic interactions, and the maintenance of genetic diversity in populations. Here, we systematically test this assumption using beneficial mutations from early generations of the Escherichia coli Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE). Using flow cytometry-based competition assays, we find that frequency-dependent fitness effects are the norm rather than the exception, occurring in approximately 80\% of strain pairs tested. Most competitions exhibit negative frequency-dependence, where fitness advantages decline as mutant frequency increases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strength of frequency-dependence is predictable from invasion fitness measurements, with invasion fitness explaining approximately half of the biological variation in frequency-dependent slopes. Additionally, we observe violations of fitness transitivity in several strain combinations, indicating that competitive relationships cannot always be predicted from fitness relative to a single reference strain alone. Through high-resolution measurements of within-growth cycle dynamics, we show that simple resource competition explains a substantial portion of the frequency-dependence: when faster-growing genotypes dominate populations, they deplete shared resources more rapidly, reducing the time available for fitness differences to accumulate. Our results demonstrate that even in a simple model system designed to minimize ecological complexity, subtle ecological interactions between closely related genotypes create frequency-dependent selection that can fundamentally alter evolutionary dynamics.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755814134155

Yet, rest is not idle; it involves streams of thoughts. Are these ongoing thoughts reflected in rsFC? To test this question, we developed a novel annotated rest paradigm where participants rated and verbally described their thoughts after each rest period during functional MRI (N = 60). Our findings revealed rich and idiosyncratic thoughts across individuals. Similarity in thoughts was associated with more similar rsFC patterns within and across individuals. In addition, both thought ratings and topics could be decoded from rsFC. Furthermore, neuromarkers of these thoughts generalized to unseen individuals in the Human Connectome Project dataset (N = 908), where decoded thought patterns during rest predicted positive vs. negative trait-level individual differences. Together, our findings reveal that ongoing thoughts at rest are reflected in brain dynamics and these network patterns predict everyday cognition and experiences. Understanding subjective in-scanner experiences is thus crucial in characterizing the relationship between individual differences in functional brain organization and behavior.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BCS-2043740 (M.D.R.);""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755814134155

Despite the extensive literature investigating the nature of prediction error signalling, it is still unclear how this process interacts with the functionally segregated nature of the visual cortex, particularly within the temporal domain. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from humans whilst they viewed static image trajectories containing a bound object that sequentially changed along different visual attribute dimensions (shape and colour). Crucially, the context of this change was designed to appear random (and unsurprising) or violate the established trajectory (and cause a surprise). Event-related potential analysis found no effects of surprise after controlling for cortical adaptation. However, multivariate pattern analyses found whole-brain neural representations of visual surprise that overlapped between attributes, albeit at distinct, attribute-specific latencies.

Academic researchers often develop custom solutions for specific scientific needs, while industry offerings are typically proprietary and tied to specific hardware. This diversity, while fostering innovation, also creates major challenges in interoperability, reproducibility, and standardization, which slows progress and adaption. This article presents a collaborative effort between academic and industry leaders to survey the current state of smart microscopy, highlight representative implementations, and identify common technical and organizational barriers. We propose a framework for greater interoperability based on shared standards, modular software design, and community-driven development. Our goal is to support collaboration across the field and lay the groundwork for a more connected, reusable, and accessible smart microscopy ecosystem. We conclude with a call to action for researchers, hardware developers, and institutions to join in building an open, interoperable foundation that will unlock the full potential of smart microscopy in life science research.","[{""name"":""Uniscientia"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""187-2021;""},{""name"":""SNF Sinergia"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRSII5_183550;""},{""name"":""Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RIF-2;""},{""name"":""Swedish National Microscopy Infrastructure, NMI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VR-RFI 2023-00163;""},{""name"":""Marie Sklodowska-Curie"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Swedish Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03zttf063"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2023-05450;2019-02355;2023-02387;""},{""name"":""IngaBritt and Arne Lundberg foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Crafoord Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02hwwbr17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Seydlitz foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Magnus Bergvall foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Berta Kamprad Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Swedish Cancer Foundation (Cancerfonden)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/004hzzk67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755814134155

We identify obesity-associated transcriptional changes across multiple Endometrial Stromal Cell (ESC) states and innate immune populations, including uterine natural killer cells and macrophages.

Yet, the diversity of major plant-associated bacteria groups like Hyphomicrobiales (Alphaproteobacteria) remain largely uncharacterized in the phyllosphere, due to limitations of 16S rRNA metabarcoding and biases in reference databases toward model taxa and environments. Using a meta-analysis combining metabarcoding, metagenomics and phylogenomics, we explored the worldwide diversity of leaf-associated Hyphomicrobiales. We confirmed Methylobacterium was ubiquitous in the phyllosphere and revealed the dominance of two under-characterized Hyphomicrobiales taxa: Lichenibacterium, a recently described genus of lichen-associated bacteria previously identified as 1174-901-12 in taxonomic databases, and RH-AL1, an undescribed genus of bacteria related to Beijerinckiaceae, previously isolated from coal slag. Despite their abundance in the phyllosphere, Lichenibacterium and RH_AL1 could not be properly detected by classical 16S rRNA gene barcoding, underlining biases in reference databases and a lack of taxonomic resolution for this marker gene. As for Methylobacterium, a significant proportion of Lichenibacterium and RH-AL1 were also detected in association with lichens and in environments with harsh conditions like exposed surfaces, air and snow, suggesting airborne or waterborne dispersal and high resilience in harsh environments. Overall our study stresses the need to move toward metagenomics and culturomics to increase the representativeness of leaf-associated bacterial taxa in reference databases, and to improve our understanding of the evolutionary and functional mechanisms underpinning bacteria adaptations to living on plants.","[{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN-2024-05825;RGPIN-2025-05608;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755814134155

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2 based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database. We assessed the predicted interaction structures through different confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we examined annotated protein domains and found that 679 of the predicted structural complexes contained a variety of domains with putative interaction involvement on the basis of interaction interface proximity. Furthermore, our analyses revealed intricate interaction networks within the context of biological function and cancer. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, highlighting both strengths and limitations, while also providing a novel view of broad functional contextualization. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","[{""name"":""Levy-Longenbaugh Donor-Advised Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DBI-2321666;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bj3aw27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0019749;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM157729;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755814134155

Yet, most neurophysiological research on face processing relies on two-dimensional displays, potentially overlooking the role of stereoscopic depth information. Here, we combine immersive virtual reality (VR), electroencephalography (EEG), and eye tracking to examine the neural representation of faces under controlled manipulations of stereoscopic depth. Thirty-four participants viewed computer-generated faces with neutral, happy, angry, and surprised expressions in frontal view under monoscopic and stereoscopic viewing conditions. Using time-resolved multivariate decoding, we show that EEG signals in immersive VR conditions can reliably differentiate facial expressions. Stereoscopic depth cues elicited a distinct and decodable neural signature, confirming the sensitivity of our approach to depth-related processing. Yet, expression decoding remained robust across depth conditions, indicating that under controlled frontal viewing, the neural encoding of facial expressions is invariant to binocular depth cues. Eye tracking showed that expression-related gaze patterns contained comparable information but did not account for neural representations, while depth information was absent in gaze patterns--consistent with dissociable representational processes. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of EEG-based neural decoding in fully immersive VR as a tool for investigating face perception in naturalistic settings and provide new evidence for the stability of expression representations across depth variations in three-dimensional viewing conditions.","[{""name"":""Cooperation between the Max Planck Society and the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NEUROHUM;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755814134155

In humans, the cytosolic (hMDH1) and mitochondrial (hMDH2) isoforms operate in distinct compartments, suggesting potential differences in regulation. Here, we present a comparative analysis of hMDH1 and hMDH2 under physiologically relevant conditions, integrating enzymatic assays, ligand binding studies, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and molecular modeling. Our findings reveal that hMDH2 activity is inhibited by -ketoglutarate, glutamate, NAD+, ATP, and citrate at concentrations consistent with mitochondrial metabolic states characterized by elevated amino acid catabolism or redox stress. Conversely, hMDH1 exhibits minimal impact by these metabolites, with only modest inhibition observed in the presence of ATP and ADP. SAXS analyses confirm that both isoforms maintain stable dimeric structures upon ligand binding, indicating that regulation is not mediated by global conformational changes. Structural modeling and normal mode analyses identify increased flexibility in hMDH1, particularly within the active site loop, thumb loop, and a partially disordered C-terminal helix. In contrast, hMDH2 displays a more rigid architecture and a more electropositive active site environment, correlating with its heightened sensitivity to anionic metabolites. Fluorescence quenching experiments further support these distinctions, demonstrating stronger binding affinities for nucleotide-based ligands in hMDH2 compared to hMDH1. Collectively, these results suggest that isoform-specific regulation of human MDH arises from differences in local structural dynamics and electrostatics, rather than large-scale structural rearrangements. hMDH2 appears adapted to integrate mitochondrial metabolic signals, modulating malate oxidation in response to cellular conditions, while hMDH1 maintains consistent cytosolic function across diverse metabolic states.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MCB RUI-2322867;CHE REU-2150091;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755814134155

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B “Meiosis”;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755814134155

Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone. Because differentially prioritized variants are driven by Borzoi predictions, we leverage attribution techniques to characterize sequence features underlying fine mapping and generate mechanistic hypotheses for GWAS associations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755814134155

To address this question, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the inner kinetochore (CCAN) from the silkmoth Bombyx mori, an insect that lacks the canonical centromere-specifying histone variant CENP-A and exhibits chromosome-wide centromeric activity (holocentric). Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour l’Education et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755814134155

CF2H uses a dimerization-activated DNA binding domain (DBD) fused to prey and bait proteins to trigger transcription upon protein-protein interaction. We demonstrate that CF2H enables the detection of interactions between various types of target and binder proteins such as single-domain antibodies, DARPins and de novo designed binders. We benchmark CF2H as a screening platform by validating previously reported binders for Mdm2 and discover high-affinity binders targeting the checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1 in less than 24 hours. Finally, we show that CF2H can be used to characterize small-molecules modulators of PPI and detect protein biomarkers, opening the door for a new class of cell-free biosensors.","[{""name"":""Inserm"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02vjkv261"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""965018;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755814134155

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755814134155

The components differ in their representational attributes and plasticity, with evidence for sparser, more decorrelated activity and faster plasticity in regions higher up in the hierarchy. How and why did the brain arrive at this organization? We explore the principles that allow such an organization to emerge by simulating a hierarchy of learning subsystems in artificial neural networks (ANNs) using a meta-learning approach. As ANNs optimized weights for a series of tasks, they concurrently meta-learned layer-wise plasticity and sparsity parameters. This approach enhanced the computational efficiency of ANNs, promoting hidden activation sparsity while benefitting task performance. Meta-learning also gave rise to a brain-like hierarchical organization, with higher layers displaying faster plasticity and a sparser, more pattern-separated neural code than lower layers. Early layers peaked early in their plasticity and stabilized, whereas higher layers continued to develop and maintained elevated plasticity over time, mirroring empirical developmental trajectories. Moreover, when trained on dual tasks imposing competing demands for item discrimination and categorization, ANNs with parallel pathways developed distinct representational and plasticity profiles, convergent with the distinct properties observed empirically across intra-hippocampal pathways. These results suggest that the macroscale organization and development of heterogeneous learning subsystems in the brain may emerge in part from optimizing biological variables that govern plasticity and sparsity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755814134155

Upon activation, they oligomerize into inflammasome-like resistosomes to initiate immune signaling, yet the dynamics of resistosome assembly remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the virulence effector AVRcap1b from the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans suppresses immune activation by directly engaging oligomerization intermediates of the tomato helper NLR SlNRC3. Cryo-EM structures of SlNRC3 in AVRcap1b-bound and unbound states reveal that AVRcap1b bridges multiple protomers, stabilizing a stalled intermediate and preventing formation of a functional resistosome. Leveraging AVRcap1b as a molecular tool, we also capture an additional SlNRC3 resistosome intermediate showing that assembly proceeds in a stepwise manner from dissociated monomers. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized vulnerability in NLR activation and reveal a pathogen strategy that disrupts immune complex assembly.

Flowering shoot (inflorescence) architecture varies significantly across plant families and is a key target of genetic engineering efforts in many crops1-4. Asteraceae (sunflower family), comprising 10% of flowering plants, all have capitula, a novel inflorescence that mimics a single flower5,6. Asteraceae capitula are highly diverse but are thought to have evolved once via unknown mechanisms7,8. During capitulum development, shoot stem cells undergo prolonged proliferation to accommodate the formation of intersecting spirals of flowers (florets) along the disk-shaped head9,10. Here we show that capitulum evolution paralleled decreases in CLAVATA3 (CLV3) peptide signaling, a conserved repressor of stem cell proliferation. We trace this to novel amino acid changes in the mature CLV3 peptide which decrease receptor binding and downstream transcriptional outputs. Using genetically tractable Asteraceae models, we show that reversion of CLV3 to a more active form impairs Asteraceae stem cell regulation and capitulum development. Additionally, we trace the evolution of CLV3 and its receptors across the Asterales allowing inferences on capitulum evolution within this lineage.
