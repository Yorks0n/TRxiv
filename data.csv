These potent norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors promote wakefulness, suppress appetite, enhance physical performance, and are purported to increase attentional abilities. Prior functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have yielded conflicting results about the effects of stimulants on the brain's attention, action/motor, and salience regions that are difficult to reconcile with their proposed attentional effects. Here, we utilized resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from the large Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study to understand the effects of stimulants on brain functional connectivity (FC) in children (n = 11,875; 8-11 years old) using network level analysis (NLA). We validated these brain-wide association study (BWAS) findings in a controlled, precision imaging drug trial (PIDT) with highly-sampled (165-210 minutes) healthy adults receiving high-dose methylphenidate (Ritalin, 40 mg). In both studies, stimulants were associated with altered FC in action and motor regions, matching patterns of norepinephrine transporter expression. Connectivity was also changed in the salience (SAL) and parietal memory networks (PMN), which are important for reward-motivated learning and closely linked to dopamine, but not the brain's attention systems (e.g. dorsal attention network, DAN). Stimulant-related differences in FC closely matched the rs-fMRI pattern of getting enough sleep, as well as EEG- and respiration-derived brain maps of arousal. Taking stimulants rescued the effects of sleep deprivation on brain connectivity and school grades. The combined noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects of stimulants may drive brain organization towards a more wakeful and rewarded configuration, explaining improved task effort and persistence without direct effects on attention networks.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

While much research has focused on the spike (S) glycoproteins of zoonotic alpha- and betacoronaviruses, the S proteins of gamma- and deltacoronaviruses, which predominantly infect avian hosts, remain poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of S proteins from two distinct gammacoronaviruses (75.7% sequence identity) that atypically infect marine mammals and belong to the Gammacoronavirus delphinapteri species. The cryo-EM reconstructions reveal that the spikes exhibit a unique quaternary architecture that distinguishes them from other coronaviruses. The S protein features a previously unidentified, tripodal quaternary assembly of the S1 subunit, in which S1B domains are presented in an upright position while their putative receptor binding sites are shielded by extended loops from the S1A domain of the same protomers. Additionally, the CeCoV spike proteins have evolved an additional and unique ~200 residue N-terminal domain (S10). S10 lacks homology to known protein sequences but displays structural similarity to members of the cupin protein superfamily. This represents a remarkable case of coronaviral exaptation of a host protein integrated into the S glycoprotein. Moreover, glycoproteomic analyses reveal that CeCoV S proteins are extensively N-glycosylated (>100 N-glycans per trimer), with a notable abundance of high-mannose glycans on S10 and O-glycosylation sites within a mucin-like loop at the trimer apex, all contributing to a dense glycan shield and potentially masking immunogenic epitopes. These findings demonstrate the structural diversity and adaptability of CoV S proteins, including alternative quaternary assemblies, additional domains, and diverse glycosylation strategies, offering new insights into the evolutionary mechanisms that enable coronaviruses to expand their host range and establish infections in novel species.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

Further, the drivers of such changes are uncertain, and quantitative models of the respective contribution of different African regions are lacking. Here we provide a complete reconstruction of the meta-population dynamics over the last 200,000 years by quantitatively integrating an environmental niche model based on archaeological sites within a spatially explicit population genetic framework. The inferred metapopulation dynamics not only fully explains the divergence among all available contemporary and ancient genomes of African hunter-gatherers, which were used to calibrate the model, but also accurately predicts the patterns of craniometric diversification across the continent from the Middle Pleistocene to the present. Furthermore, we show how the climate-driven changes in population sizes and connectivity predict major patterns of archaeological and phenotypic diversification over the last 200,000 years across the African continent.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

However, evidence for prediction in sensory cortex largely comes from artificial experiments using simple, highly predictable stimuli, that arguably encourage prediction. Here, we test for sensory prediction during natural scene perception. Specifically, we use deep generative modelling to quantify the spatial predictability of receptive field (RF) patches in natural images, and compared those predictability estimates to brain responses in the mouse visual cortex - while rigorously accounting for established tuning to a rich set of low-level image features and their local statistical context -- in a large scale survey of high-density recordings from the Allen Institute Brain Observatory. This revealed four insights. First, cortical responses across the mouse visual system are shaped by sensory predictability, with more predictable image patches evoking weaker responses. Secondly, visual cortical neurons are primarily sensitive to the predictability of higher-level image features, even in neurons in the primary visual areas that are preferentially tuned to low-level visual features. Third, unpredictability sensitivity is stronger in the superficial layers of primary visual cortex, in line with predictive coding models. Finally, these spatial prediction effects are independent of recent experience, suggesting that they rely on long-term priors about the structure of the visual world. Together, these results suggest visual cortex might predominantly predict sensory information at higher levels of abstraction - a pattern bearing striking similarities to recent, successful techniques from artificial intelligence for predictive self-supervised learning.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

This involves cell-surface receptors that can detect conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) or endogenous immunogenic signals, initiating signaling pathways to induce broad-spectrum disease resistance, known as pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). In Arabidopsis thaliana, the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK) MIK2 is an exceptionally versatile receptor involved in the perception of the vast family of Brassicales-specific endogenous SCOOP peptides as well as potential MAMPs derived from Fusarium and related fungi. Although only plant species belonging to the order of Brassicales encode genes for SCOOP peptides and show SCOOP-responsiveness, the Fusarium-derived elicitor fraction also induces PTI responses in plants from other lineages. In this study, we demonstrate that Fusarium elicitor-responsiveness and proteins belonging to the MIK2-clade are widely conserved among seed plants. We identified a MIK2-clade protein from tomato, which shares properties of AtMIK2 in the perception of the Fusarium elicitor but not of SCOOP peptides. Tomato mutants lacking the receptor show compromised PTI responses to the fungal elicitor and enhanced susceptibility to infection by Fusarium oxysporum. Our data provide insights into the evolutionary trajectory of MIK2 as a multifunctional receptor involved in plant immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

Here, we present the deepest sequence coverage screen of the bacterial N-degron pathway using combinatorial site-saturation mutagenesis, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Our results reveal new categories of exceptions and nuance to the N-degron pathway observed in bulk and context-specific analyses. For example, we find cases where penultimate residues can reinforce or shift the stability expected based only on the identity of position 1 (P1). We observe lowered stability for P2-P5 motifs rich in bulky residues and Gln as well as heightened stability for P2-P5 motifs rich in negatively charged residues, Gly, and Pro, particularly when these residues are at P2. We find that P1 Cys can be a component of an N-degron in a sequence-specific manner. Furthermore, we employ machine learning to predict protein stability, identifying several motifs with unexpected fates. Our work expands the sequence determinants of the bacterial N-degron pathway with unprecedented granularity, providing a set of sequence guidelines for proteomic investigation and protein engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

Although the components involved in T4P assembly and dynamics are largely conserved across divergent clades of bacteria, the mechanisms underlying T4P function and regulation differ significantly and remain poorly characterized outside of a select few model organisms. One understudied characteristic of T4P includes the spatial organization of T4P envelope-spanning nanomachines and how organizational patterns contribute to single cell behaviors. The bacterial species Acinetobacter baylyi localizes its T4P nanomachines in a unique pattern along the long axis of the cell, making it a robust model to study the mechanisms underlying the regulation of intracellular organization in single cell organisms. In this work, we find that the T4P regulatory protein FimX has been co-opted away from regulating T4P dynamics to instead control T4P positioning through a chemosensory Pil-Chp pathway. We show FimX directly interacts with the Pil-Chp histidine kinase ChpA which likely influences Pil-Chp signaling and the subsequent positioning of T4P machines. These data contribute to our understanding of how bacterial regulatory systems can evolve to function in diverse biological processes.

These data provide insight into how signaling systems can evolve to regulate diverse processes, and they establish a direct connection between environmental signaling cascades and the regulation of bacterial cell biology.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses.

However, path integration is prone to cumulative error, which can be amplified when body-derived information is inconsistent between encoding and retrieval paths. Drawing on evidence from sensorimotor reactivation during memory retrieval, we hypothesized that re-enacting encoding-related movement patterns could serve as a body-derived mechanism to counteract such errors. In a novel virtual reality task with motion tracking, participants learned unique, irregular step sequences linked to specific target distances during an encoding phase. They later reproduced these distances in complete darkness under three conditions: self-paced free retrieval, retrieval with encoding-congruent movements, and retrieval with encoding-incongruent, regular gait. During free retrieval, participants naturally re-enacted encoding-related movements associated with improved distance reproduction. As predicted, distance estimation was significantly more accurate during congruent retrieval than during incongruent retrieval. These behavioral findings are consistent with a neural network model in which retrieved encoding-related motor patterns correct path integration errors in grid cells. Together, these results provide converging behavioral and computational evidence that body-derived, encoding-related motor patterns can enhance distance estimation, possibly by filtering grid cell error accumulation, offering new insights into embodied mechanisms of path integration.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

Previous work demonstrated that spike patterns in cerebellar nuclei neurons were distinct between different movement disorder mouse models. However, often these changes arise from neural dysfunction in the cerebellar cortex, through misfiring, miswiring, or degenerating Purkinje cells. Even though Purkinje cells form the sole output from the cerebellar cortex, their information is relayed to other regions of the motor network via cerebellar nuclei cells. Purkinje cells make GABAergic synapses onto cerebellar nuclei cells, and it is often assumed that changes in Purkinje cell spike patterns result in inverse changes in nuclei cell spike patterns. Here, we test this hypothesis by answering the question of whether a reliable relationship between Purkinje cell and nuclei cell spike patterns exists. Single-cell, in vivo electrophysiology recordings of both cell types from six mouse models for cerebellar movement disorders were analyzed according to parameters relating to spike rate and irregularity. We investigated whether Purkinje cell spike patterns correlated with nuclei cell spike patterns. We found that some parameters for firing irregularity were positively correlated between Purkinje and nuclei cells but no -- and particularly no inverse - relationship was observed between Purkinje and nuclei cell spike rate. Overall, this study begins to illuminate that the relationship between Purkinje cells and nuclei cell spike activity in a disease state is more complex and unpredictable. The data suggest Purkinje cell spike activity changes cannot accurately predict nuclei cell changes, which ultimately drive cerebellar disease states. Our findings underscore the importance of studying cerebellar nuclei cell function in cerebellar disease, as lack of changes in Purkinje cell firing patterns can mask disease-causing firing patterns in these cerebellar output cells.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

We show that gene have been lost gradually during ~263 my of host-symbiont co-diversification, with more dramatic changes promoted by co-infecting additional microbes and host ecological switches.

Many details of SARS-CoV-2 infection are not fully understood, including the cell biology and host-virus interactions involved in coronavirus assembly and release, in which the Envelope (E) structural protein is instrumental. Deletion of E in other coronaviruses has been shown previously to either attenuate or abrogate infection. To determine the role of E on SARS-CoV-2 virus production and infectivity, we produced reporter SARS-CoV-2 with or without the E gene deleted using a bacterial artificial chromosome. Replication of {Delta}E SARS-CoV-2 was attenuated in Vero E6 cells expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and in human epithelial cell lines. Electron and immunofluorescence microscopy and virology assays showed that {Delta}E SARS-CoV-2 increased cell surface expression of Spike (S) glycoprotein, leading to reduced S incorporation into {Delta}E SARS-CoV-2 particles and promotion of increased cell-to-cell transmission that evades neutralizing antibody inhibition. Trans-complementation of E partially rescued {Delta}E SARS-CoV-2 S incorporation and restored cell-free transmission. In addition to validating the role of E in retention of S in the ER-Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC), our results showed that a lack of E led to reorganization of the ERGIC during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Improved understanding of E in SARS-CoV-2 replication and host pathogenesis may help development of novel therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

This question has been challenged by the observation of emergent coexistence, where microbial communities contain species that cannot coexist in pairs, suggesting the presence of non-pairwise mechanisms. Instead, we show that emergent coexistence arises naturally in species-rich models with pairwise interactions. Strikingly, this phenomenon does not require additional mechanisms like intransitive or higher-order interactions; rather, coexistence arises from dense networks of indirect effects. As diversity increases, we show that indirect effects become so intricate that pairwise interactions no longer predict community composition, revealing a fundamental limit to reductionist explanations of coexistence.

Following mitotic stress, the ubiquitin-specific protease 28 (USP28) and the p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) form a stable, heritable complex to stabilize the tumor suppressor p53, triggering cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Here we determine the mechanism by which USP28 stabilizes p53 and show that USP28 is required not only for an efficient stress response but also for maintaining basal p53 levels in some cancer cells. Loss of functional USP28 allows cells to evade mitotic stress and DNA damage responses in a manner that is specific to cell type and cancer context. We identify a prevalent, shorter USP28 isoform critical for p53 stabilization. Its C-terminal domain mediates PLK1-dependent binding to 53BP1, a dimerization-driven interaction necessary for mitotic stress memory, p53 stabilization, and cell cycle arrest. Cancer-associated missense mutations in this domain disrupt 53BP1 binding, impair nuclear localization, and destabilize USP28, compromising p53 stabilization. Notably, mutations in the 53BP1-binding domain occur more frequently in tumors than those in the catalytic domain, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression and implications for therapeutic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

To address evidence gaps, we evaluated long COVID susceptibility in pwMSRD versus controls and its associations with multi-domain function and disability.

MethodsIn this multicenter cross-sectional study, participants completed a survey covering 71 post-infection symptoms, distinguishing new-onset from worsening symptoms. We defined long COVID using the 2024 NASEM criteria. Logistic regression assessed long COVID odds. Linear and Poisson regression evaluated associations with function and disability.

Results969 pwMSRD (82.5% female, mean age 51.8 years, 63.5% infected) and 1,003 controls (79.4% female, mean age 45.2 years, 61.2% infected) were included. PwMSRD had higher odds of long COVID (aOR=1.6 [1.2-2.1]), with a stronger association when restricting to worsening symptoms (aOR=2.3 [1.7-3.1]). Having long COVID was associated with worse physical function, cognition, and depression in both groups. PwMSRD with long COVID experienced greater physical function declines and more depression severity exacerbation than controls, and had faster disability progression compared to those without long COVID.

ConclusionPwMSRD show increased susceptibility to long COVID, primarily driven by worsening symptoms. Long COVID contributes to more functional decline and disability worsening. Recognizing and managing long COVID is essential in pwMSRD.","NA","medrxiv",1748038178578

We aimed to compare Germany-wide characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized adults with diabetes in diabetes certified vs. non-diabetes certified hospitals.

MethodsWe analyzed in the German Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) statistics for 2021-2023 all inpatient cases aged [&ge;] 20 years with and without diabetes (all types) as a main or secondary diagnosis based on ICD-10 codes. Using Wilcoxon and Chi2-tests, characteristics of inpatient cases with diabetes were compared between diabetes certified hospitals (n=300) and non-diabetes certified hospitals (n=1,103).

ResultsOf 43.4 million total inpatient cases in the period from 2021 to 2023, 8.1 million (18.5%) had a documented diabetes diagnosis (94% of the cases as secondary diagnosis). In certified hospitals, 19.0% of inpatient cases had diabetes compared to 18.3% in non-certified hospitals. Although inpatient cases with diabetes had more hospital-acquired and procedure-related complications (17.2% vs. 16.7%, p<0.001), as well as higher rates of hypoglycemia (3.2% vs. 2.1%, p<0.001) and metabolic disorder (diabetic ketoacidosis: 0,5% vs. 0,4%; acute metabolic disorder with multiple complications: 2.3% vs. 1.0%, p<0.001) in certified hospitals vs. non-certified hospitals, in-hospital mortality for all diabetes cases was similar (4.5% in both). However, among those with diabetes as the main diagnosis, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in diabetes certified hospitals (type 1 diabetes: 0.6% vs. 1.1% and type 2 diabetes: 2.3% vs. 2.9%, both p<0.001), despite a higher complication burden.

ConclusionsHospitalized people with diabetes as the main diagnosis had lower in-hospital mortality in diabetes-certified hospitals, even though they had a higher disease burden. These findings suggest that expanded use of DDG-certified departments, including consultation services for patients whose diabetes is a secondary diagnosis, may further improve clinical outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1748038178578

Successful closure requires elongation and apical constriction of neuroepithelial cells. These critical behaviours have not been studied in human, patient-specific models. We characterise a human iPSC-derived neuroepithelial morphogenesis model which is highly reproducible between lines. Differentiated neuroepithelial cells actively undergo ROCK-dependent apical constriction. ROCK acts downstream of planar cell polarity/VANGL2 in other species. We find that VANGL2 is up-regulated and phosphorylated during iPSCs-to-neuroepithelial differentiation. The patient-identified VANGL2-R353C mutation does not alter its expression, localisation or phosphorylation, but reduces myosin-II phosphorylation and apical constriction relative to congenic control iPSCs. Non-congenic comparisons and forward genetic testing are also informative in this reproducible model. We compare lines reprogrammed from amniocytes of two patients with spina bifida, versus two controls. One patient-derived line forms a morphologically normal neuroepithelium, but fails to differentiate into neurons. The second fails to undergo apicobasal elongation, and harbours compound heterozygous mutations in the MED24 gene previously implicated in neuroepithelial elongation in mice. Thus, iPSC-derived neuroepithelial modelling provides mechanistic insights into conserved cell behaviours, links genetically-impaired apical constriction with a human disease, and establishes patient-specific models which recapitulate failures of heterogenous neuroepithelial functions.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

Identification of the genes that comprise these biosynthetic pathways has been enabled by gene-to-metabolite networks that are generated from transcriptomic and metabolomic datasets. Recent advances in both single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-cell mass spectrometry metabolomics (scMS) have enabled the measurement of either gene expression or metabolite levels in individual cells. However, these individual datasets can only be used to indirectly correlate gene expression levels with metabolite concentrations at the single cell level.

Plastic responses vary as a result of genetic differentiation within and among species, so accurate rangewide predictions require characterization of genotype-specific reaction norms across the continuum of historic and future climate conditions comprising a species' range. Natural hybrid zones can give rise to novel recombinant genotypes associated with high phenotypic variability, further increasing the variance of plastic responses within the ranges of the hybridizing species. Experiments that plant replicated genotypes across a range of environments can characterize genotype-specific reaction norms; identify genetic, geographic, and climatic factors affecting variation in climate responses; and make predictions of climate responses across complex genetic and geographic landscapes. The North American hybrid zone of Populus trichocarpa and P. balsamifera represents a natural system in which reaction norms are likely to vary with underlying genetic variation that has been shaped by climate, geography, and introgression. Here, we leverage a dataset containing 45 clonal genotypes of varying ancestry from this natural hybrid zone, planted across 17 replicated common garden experiments spanning a broad climatic range, including sites warmer than the natural species ranges. Growth and mortality were measured over two years, enabling us to model reaction norms for each genotype across these tested environments. Genomic variation associated with species ancestry and northern/southern regions significantly influenced growth across environments, with genotypic variation in reaction norms reflecting a trade-off between cold tolerance and growth. Using modeled reaction norms for each genotype, we predicted that genotypes with more P. trichocarpa ancestry may gain an advantage under warmer climates. Spatial shifts of the hybrid zone could facilitate the spread of beneficial alleles into novel climates. These results highlight that genotypic variation in responses to temperature will have landscape-level effects.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

However, EHR data may be prone to misclassification and unmeasured confounding, requiring systematic mitigation to ensure robust findings.

MethodsIn VEBIS-EHR, a retrospective multi-country COVID-19 VE cohort study, we examined unmeasured confounding using a negative control outcome (death not related to COVID-19) and misclassification from varying data extraction intervals. The evaluation spanned two periods (November-December 2023, January-February 2024), encompassing up to 18.7 million individuals across six EU/EEA countries. Vaccine confounding-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.

ResultsaHRs against non-COVID-19 mortality ranged from 0.35 (95% CI: 0.28-0.44) to 0.70 (0.66-0.73) when comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated. Delaying EHR data extraction modestly increased the capture of outcome and exposure events, with some variation by vaccination status. Site-level fluctuations in aHRs did not meaningfully alter the overall pooled VE, suggesting stable estimates despite misclassification related to extraction timing.

ConclusionsWe observed some evidence of unmeasured confounding when using non-COVID-19 deaths as a negative outcome, though the specificity of our negative control must be considered. This result may suggest overestimation of VE, but also the need for further analysis with more specific negative control outcomes and confounding-adjustment techniques. Addressing such confounding using richer data sources and more refined approaches remains critical to ensure accurate, timely VE estimates when using real-world EHR-based data. Extending the delay between the end of observation and data extraction modestly improves the completeness of exposure and outcome data, with limited effect on pooled VE estimates.

Key MessagesA Key Messages section should be added after the keywords and before the articles introduction, with the key messages of the paper made in 3 bullet points that succinctly describe:

O_LIWhat your research question was: Whether vaccine effectiveness estimates based on EHR data are internally valid according to analyses focused on two topics of concern related to EHR-based observational research - unmeasured confounding and misclassification.
C_LIO_LIWhat you found: We observed unmeasured confounding in our estimates when using non-COVID19 deaths as negative outcome, and timing of data abstraction from source EHRs was found to have a small influence on the capture and classification of exposure and outcome.
C_LIO_LIWhy it is important: Our results reinforce earlier evidence of the healthy vaccinee phenomenon indicating possible biases in the estimates of vaccine effectiveness estimates obtained from EHR data and that there appears to be little influence of EHR extraction timing on data completeness.

While antibodies targeting the 65 kDa isoform of GAD are of high diagnostic value, T cell mediated cytotoxicity has been identified as a key component of disease pathogenesis. The precise pathophysiological mechanisms by which the disease is triggered and maintained, however, remain incompletely understood. Methods: We performed single-cell transcriptome and immune repertoire sequencing (sc-seq) in CSF and blood of 8 anti-GAD65 AINS patients compared to 8 non-inflammatory controls. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were synthesized from B cell receptor (BCR) data to evaluate the B cellular immune response. Findings: We identified an increase and expansion of activated CD4+ stem cell-like memory T cells (TSCM) in the CSF of anti-GAD65 AINS patients. Expanded T cells showed increased expression of proinflammatory genes. The mAb analysis revealed a high frequency of GAD65-reactive BCRs in the CSF of anti-GAD65 AINS patients with increased somatic hypermutations compared to non-GAD-reactive BCRs and BCRs from controls. Conclusions: Sc-seq identified clonally expanded CD4+ TSCM in the CSF of anti-GAD65 AINS patients harboring cytotoxic properties likely contributing to disease pathogenesis. GAD-reactive B cells circulate in the CSF of anti-GAD65 AINS patients further supporting the concept of an antigen-specific intrathecal immune response. Future studies need to clarify the actual pathogenicity of these immune cells and the link between T and B cellular immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of anti-GAD65 AINS.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

Their carbon lattice structure, denoted by chiral (n,m) indices, determines the wavelength of their near infrared fluorescence emission. Commercially available SWCNT are polydisperse, containing many (n,m) species with overlapping fluorescence peaks, leading to spectral congestion. Aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) has emerged as a valuable tool to sort SWCNT according to their chiral structure and promises improved nanosensor performance as well as unique opportunities for multiplexing. Previous applications of ATPE have enabled ratiometric sensors, but simultaneous detection of multiple analytes using distinct SWCNT chiralities has yet to be realized. This hurdle is largely due to the contrasting surface chemistries needed for ATPE sorting and those needed for biosensing applications. In this work, we introduce a method for purifying multiple chiralities of SWCNT which can be functionalized with molecularly specific antibodies to create a multiplexed sensor platform. We utilize aminated DNA (DNA-NH2), which serves as both a conduit for ATPE sorting and an intermediate linker for later antibody conjugation, to realize this goal. We demonstrate that chemically modified DNA enables ATPE sorting, supporting the broad future utility of the technique. We further show that chirality-sorted SWCNT-DNA-NH2 serve as excellent base constructs for antibody conjugation, forming highly specific sensors with enhanced optical properties (compared to unsorted SWCNT sensors). Importantly, one batch of monochiral base constructs can be functionalized with different antibodies towards different biological applications. Finally, we show that we can sort and functionalize two separate SWCNT chiralities and combine them together to create a multiplexed sensor platform where each peak responds distinctly to its target. There are vast opportunities for expansion of this work through the use of alternative DNA sequences to enable sorting, various SWCNT chiralities, and virtually any commercially available antibody for molecular recognition.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

However, the stereomicroscope transillumination design is suboptimal, as a single incident beam at the specimen plane is shared and transmitted via two laterally offset detection axes. This flaw limits life science applications due to the transparent nature of samples which results in poor contrast images. We use a single additional element in the illumination path to correct the illumination uniformity across the field of view and, by doing so, enhance image contrast and facilitate detection of refractive structures in transparent biological specimens. We designed and fabricated an integrated lens-biprism element using low-cost, consumer-grade 3D printing methods and consumables. This 3D printed lens-biprism distributed diverging rays from a single incandescent light source into two parallel beams that converged at the specimen plane and transmitted through the respective left and right detection axes of a stereomicroscope. This improved transillumination setup increased the image contrast by up to 67.62% compared to the conventional stereomicroscope setup. We demonstrated the benefit of the lens-biprism element by visualising dynamic cellular events in live tissue and discerning refractive structures more easily in transparent specimens.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

In particular, nanoUHPLC/High-Resolution nanoESI-MS/MS enables the characterization of proteins in complex biological samples due to its high sensitivity, accuracy, and scalability. However, LC-MS/MS proteomics might still be susceptible to laboratory and sample-associated contaminants, which can significantly compromise the quality and reliability of data. Therefore, an accurate identification and annotation of such contaminants is crucial for the development of robust proteomics databases and spectral-libraries related search engines. This approach is of special interest in the field of secretome and extracellular vesicles (EVs), membrane-enclosed nanostructures that contain a variety of proteins crucial for cell-to-cell communication and translational applications. Results When working in ex vivo/in vitro settings, proteins from fetal bovine serum (FBS), commonly employed in standard cell culture media, may interfere with the proteome analysis. To address this issue, we conceived and designed SPROUTS_DB, Serum Protein Repository Of Unwanted Target(ed) Sequences DataBase, a dedicated resource to catalog serum-derived contaminants. Starting from media supplemented with EV-depleted FBS, we simulated cell growth conditions - in the absence of cells - followed by ultracentrifugation. LC-MS/MS analysis of these samples resulted in the identification of a novel set of 1,288 contaminant proteins, which has been deposited in the ProteomeXchange repository (identifier PXD044137). SPROUTS_DB contains primarily soluble proteins, mainly related to the Gene Ontology categories Extracellular Region and Extracellular Space, in line with the nature of the starting sample. In contrast, only a small fraction of the contaminants is classified as membrane-associated proteins, supporting the limited vesicle contamination in the complete medium, due to the use of EV-depleted FBS. Of note, we demonstrated that SPROUTS_DB outperforms existing contaminants databases, ensuring that only peptide spectra relevant to the examined sample are retained and identified as true positive data. Conclusions Considering that even proteins from phylogenetically distant organisms share extensive stretches of sequences, SPROUTS_DB is designed to discern contaminants from real sample proteins of interest, minimizing false positive identifications. To the best of our knowledge, SPROUTS_DB is the most updated database of contaminants useful for proteomics investigations of cellular secretomes and EV-containing samples.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

Here, we introduce grid partitioning image analysis (GPIA), a simple workflow that quantifies the compositional heterogeneity of bacterial aggregates. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images of fluorescently labeled Acinetobacter sp. Tol 5, which exhibits a self-aggregative nature through its cell surface protein AtaA, were partitioned into 2-m square grids. Grids containing one or no cells were classified as dispersed, whereas those containing multiple cells were classified as aggregates, and the proportion of EGFP-labeled cells within each grid was recorded. Reference images representing dispersed cells, homo-aggregates, and hetero-aggregates produced characteristic EGFP-ratio histograms that matched binomial predictions. When AtaA production in one cell type was decreased, the histogram changed from a symmetric unimodal histogram with the peak at 40-60 % EGFP-ratio to a skewed distribution, indicating that GPIA can detect differences in cell-to-cell affinity. Using the same procedure, we examined six in-frame deletion variants of AtaA. The deletion of the N-terminal head domain alone prevented co-aggregation with full-length AtaA, suggesting that homophilic recognition by this domain mediated auto-aggregation, whereas deletions in all other regions had no measurable effect. GPIA, therefore, offers a simple and rapid approach for quantitative studies on bacterial cell aggregation, bridging the gap between qualitative microscopy and quantitative but technically demanding single-cell analysis. GPIA will accelerate research on cell-cell interactions, which are the foundational processes that drive biofilm formation and the assembly of microbial consortia.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

Here, we integrate deep learning-based analysis of 1,112 histological images with RNA-seq data from 659 samples across seven reproductive organs in 304 female donors aged 20-70 years. We show that female reproductive organs and tissues have asynchronous aging dynamics: while the ovary and vagina age gradually, the uterus undergoes an abrupt transcriptional and cellular transition around the age of menopause. Tissue segmentation highlights that the myometrium in the uterine wall is the most age-affected tissue, marked by extracellular matrix remodeling and immune activation. Across reproductive organs, the epithelial tissue is also strongly affected by age, with the vaginal epithelium showing a unique sharp menopausal transition. Integration via multi-omics factor analysis links these tissue-specific histological transformations to specific molecular shifts, many with nonlinear expression trajectories and enriched in heritable reproductive traits such as pelvic organ prolapse and age at menarche. These findings position menopause as a key inflection point in female aging and provide insights with tissue-specific focus to support healthier menopausal transitions and reduce age-related disease risk.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

These bacteria rapidly spread through the water-transporting xylem where they grow prolifically and produce abundant biofilm that clogs xylem vessels. To understand RSSC biofilm behavior in planta, we examined their complex fluid mechanics. Rheological analyses revealed that unlike all previously analyzed microbial biofilms, RSSC biofilms are shear-thinning, viscoelastic fluids at physiologically relevant shear forces. To determine which factors confer these unique mechanics, we analyzed biofilms of bacterial mutants with altered biofilm components. Genetic analysis demonstrated that development of the viscous-dominant biofilms required production of EPS-I, an amphiphilic exopolysaccharide that is a major virulence factor for all RSSC pathogens. We show that EPS-I confers <q>biofilm mobility</q>, which allows wildtype RSSC colonies to passively expand when deformed. Despite its high metabolic cost, bioassays demonstrated that EPS-I production conferred a net fitness benefit where biofilm mobility allowed the pathogen to spread and access more nutrients in complex environments like xylem vessels. The RSSC are a monophyletic lineage of aggressive plant wilt pathogens, and our evolutionary hypothesis testing suggests the origin of the eps biosynthetic gene cluster coincides with the emergence of wilt pathogenesis in the RSSC ancestor. Furthermore, comparative physiological assays demonstrated that biofilm mobility is unique to the RSSC within the genus Ralstonia. In summary, EPS-I production is a key evolutionary innovation that enables RSSC dispersal and virulence by conferring unique biofilm mechanics.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

Using whole-genome sequencing, chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C), RNA-seq, and single-cell spatial transcriptomics (Xenium), we defined how major driver mutations influence spatial tumor organization. We found that IDH-mutant gliomas frequently harbored inflammatory microglia expressing CX3CR1 specifically within their astrocyte-like malignant neighborhoods. In contrast, glioblastomas demonstrated relatively higher T-cell infiltration and enrichment of immunosuppressive myeloid cell populations. We further compared glioblastomas harboring EGFR amplifications due to extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) amplifications versus linear chromosomal 7 gains. Tumors with EGFR ecDNA displayed increased presence of mesenchymal-like malignant cells, and higher interactions between pericytes and mesenchymal-like malignant cells, likely driven by hypoxia-associated vascular proliferation.

Regulation of cell death is mostly orchestrated by the activation of Caspases, proteases which were long thought to trigger an irreversible engagement in cell death. However, recent data in vivo and in vitro outline numerous non-apoptotic functions of caspases as well as quite ubiquitous sublethal activation of effector caspases during development. Yet, it remains unclear in many instances what drives the bifurcation between cell death engagement and cell survival upon caspase activation. The existence of a caspase activity threshold was generally considered to underpin this binary decision, but this was never assessed quantitatively in vivo especially at the single cell level. Using quantitative live imaging combined with machine learning and optogenetics in the Drosophila pupal notum (a single layer epithelium), we reveal for the first time the existence of a large heterogeneity of caspase sensitivity between cells, as well as the existence of distinct spatial domains with low or high sensitivity to caspases. Using correlative and perturbative experiments, we outline the central role of past exposure to sublethal caspase activity which sensitises cells for apoptosis for several hours. Integrating information about past caspase activation is sufficient to explain most of the global pattern of caspase sensitivity and predict at the single cell level which cells will engage in apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrate that past sublethal caspase activation in a subset of cells is sufficient to bias cell elimination at the clonal and single cell level, thus revealing an alternative mechanism of physiological cell competition. Altogether, this work reveals for the first time the existence of a new layer of apoptosis regulation in vivo downstream of effector caspases which can be developmentally regulated and bias clonal selection and the spatial pattern of cell death.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

We identified 15 non-synonymous mutations within the envelope region and 22 non-synonymous mutations within the NS1 region, with 7 non-synonymous mutations within the E region (M6I, Q52H, E71A, V129I, N390S, I484V, T478S) and 10 non-synonymous mutations within the NS1 region (S80T, T117A, Q131H, K174R, F178S, N222S, L247F, I264T, T265A, K272R) seen in all sequenced samples. Some of these mutations were previously shown to be associated with increase in viral replication, NS1 secretion and immune evasion. Conclusions: Given the increase in dengue transmission in many countries, it is important to further strengthen DENV surveillance for studying the evolutionary patterns of the DENV to initiate timely and appropriate control measures.","NA","medrxiv",1748038178578

To understand how ancient metabolisms co-evolved with these environments, it is essential to identify the ecological and evolutionary processes that structured their underlying genetic networks. Here, we focus on nitrogen (N2) fixation, one of lifes most critical and ancient metabolisms, to investigate the drivers of complexity in its associated genetic network. We used a large-scale comparative genomics framework to construct a comprehensive catalog of todays N2 fixation-associated genes and assessed their distribution across diverse microbial genomes and environmental backgrounds. Genomes enriched in N2 fixation genes generally have larger genome sizes, broader metabolic capabilities, wider habitat ranges, and are predominantly associated with mesophilic and aerobic lifestyles. Evolutionary reconstructions reveal a pattern of early gene gains in ancestral diazotrophs followed by lineage specific gene losses in later diverging taxa, suggesting evolutionary trade-offs shaped by changing environments. These findings demonstrate that the evolution of N2 fixation has been intertwined with the restructuring of its genetic network, driven by feedbacks between microbial evolution and changing environmental and ecological conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

Different anti-amyloid antibodies have different in vitro binding characteristics to different synthetic A{beta} aggregates, leading to the assumption that they bind different species in the human brain. Lecanemab is hypothesized to bind ""protofibrils,"" but these are not well-characterized in human brain. It is also unknown how binding differences correlate with ARIA-E rates. The APOE {varepsilon}4 allele increases ARIA-E risk, but how it affects antibody binding characteristics is unknown.

ObjectivesTo determine whether anti-amyloid antibodies bind different species of human brain A{beta} and whether these binding properties to human brain A{beta} explains ARIA-E rates.

DesignCross-sectional study of 18 postmortem human brains.

SettingSingle tertiary care hospital.

ParticipantsDeceased patients with AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresEquilibrium binding constants (KD) and total A{beta} binding (Bmax) of recombinant aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab equivalents to human brain soluble and insoluble amyloid plaque-enriched and CAA-enriched A{beta} aggregates.

ResultsLecanemab did not bind with greater affinity to the soluble fraction of A{beta} compared to aducanumab. All three antibodies were bound essentially identical quantities of A{beta} across the 18 cases and fractions (Pearsons r 0.84 - 0.97). Antibody preference for plaque vs CAA A{beta} did not differ in soluble fractions but differed slightly in insoluble extracts. The APOE {varepsilon}4 allele led to a more soluble antibody-accessible A{beta} pool in a dose-dependent manner for all three antibodies.

Conclusions and RelevanceThe lecanemab binding target in human brain is unlikely to be distinctly ""protofibrillar"" compared to other antibodies. Differences in antibody preference for plaque vs CAA A{beta} are unlikely to fully explain differences in ARIA-E rates. The APOE {varepsilon}4 allele may plausibly increase ARIA-E risk by making antibody-accessible A{beta} more soluble. These results have implications for improving the safety and efficacy of current and future anti-amyloid antibody therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

To date, no FDA-approved immunotherapies directly activate the innate anti-cancer immunity, an essential driver of lymphocyte recruitment and potentiator of responses to existing cancer immunotherapies. ENPP1, the dominant hydrolase that degrades extracellular cGAMP and suppresses downstream STING-mediated innate immune signaling, has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. However, existing ENPP1 inhibitors have been optimized for prolonged systemic residence time rather than effective target inhibition within tumors. Here, we report the characterization of STF-1623, a highly potent ENPP1 inhibitor with an exceptionally long tumor residence time despite rapid systemic clearance, enabled by its high ENPP1 binding affinity and slow dissociation rate. We show that membrane-bound ENPP1 on tumor cells, not the abundant soluble ENPP1 in serum, drives tumor progression. Consequently, STF-1623 unleashes anti-tumor immunity and synergizes with ionizing radiation, anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1, and a DNA damaging agent to produce robust anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects across multiple syngeneic mouse tumor models, all without detectable toxicity. Conceptually, this work establishes that a noncovalent small molecule inhibitor of ENPP1 with ultralong drug-target engagement offers a safe and precise strategy to activate STING within tumors, fulfilling an unmet need of innate immunotherapies in cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

SARS-CoV-2 (a Sarbecovirus and member of the Betacoronavirus genus responsible for the pandemic) virus was first detected in Wuhan, China in late 2019. Effective mRNA vaccines based on the viral Spike protein were designed from the earliest isolates and available by December of 2020. SARS-CoV-2 has continued to evolve in the human population, accruing neutralizing antibody resistance mutations that have necessitated updating the vaccine periodically to better match contemporary variants. Neutralizing antibody cross-reactivity is generally very limited among the diverse members of the betacoronavirus genus that are of clinical importance in people. Here, we present an alternative vaccine strategy based on eliciting T-cell responses targeting four highly conserved regions shared across the betacoronavirus proteomes. We hypothesized that cross-reactive responses to these regions could temper disease severity. Focusing immune responses on highly conserved epitopes could be beneficial as SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, or if a novel betacoronavirus should enter the human population. Vaccination with these highly conserved regions induced robust T-cell responses in mice and rhesus macaques.

Results: We identified 12,918 TE-initiated transcripts across 40 human body sites and embryonic stem cells. Among TE-initiated transcripts, 80% were activated in a tissue-specific manner. TEs with tissue-specific transcription factor binding motifs were enriched in particular tissues. Additionally, approximately half of TE-derived TSSs were primates-specific. Notably, 375 primates-specific TE-derived TSSs were found to create novel tissue-specific gene expression patterns during evolution.

This study reveals that Spn-derived H2O2, primarily produced by pyruvate oxidase (SpxB), inhibits the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in lung epithelial cells by targeting aconitase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. This inhibition leads to citrate accumulation and reduced NADH production for oxidative phosphorylation, while RNA sequencing shows SpxB-dependent upregulation of glycolytic genes (e.g., HK2, PFKP), limiting pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle. Consequently, glucose consumption and lactate/acetate production increase, resembling a Warburg-like metabolic shift that supports bacterial survival. Despite TCA cycle suppression, mitochondrial membrane potential remains largely unaffected, with minimal apoptosis induced by Spn-mediated stress. These findings elucidate a novel mechanism by which Spn manipulates host metabolism to facilitate infection, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for pneumococcal diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

Since plant cells are encased in cell walls and thus immotile, their individual fate-specification program is dependent on their relative position within the organism. It is assumed that the cell wall and its mechanical properties are under surveillance, linking cell wall state to intracellular gene-regulatory networks. However, the role of these cell wall signalling pathways in plant development and the contribution of cell wall properties to cell behaviour and identity are unclear. Here, we show that control of cell wall properties is essential for the perpetuation of stem cell populations and pattering in the shoot apical meristems. The expression of pectin methylesterases (PMEs), which modify homogalacturonan methylesterification and thereby modulate cell wall mechanics, is maintained at low levels in stem cells by the stem cell specifying transcription factor WUS. Low PME expression is required for stemness, auxin patterning and stem cell-specific mechanical properties. Conversely, WUS depletion reduces wall stiffness in the meristem centre, reinforcing its role in maintaining mechanical homeostasis. Together, our findings show that WUS-mediated control of cell wall-modifying enzymes is essential for sustaining stem cell identity and SAM organization. These results demonstrat that the plant cell wall is not only involved in cell differentiation, but also exerts feedback control on developmental transitions, contributing to our understanding how the immediate physical environment is able to guide cell fate decisions in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

Evidence is provided that a subset of ZAD-ZnFs forms nuclear condensates through the stacking of the N-terminal ZAD dimerization surface. Disruption of condensation activity leads to misregulation of genome-wide binding profiles and lethality, underscoring its functional and physiological significance in development.

Previous work has uncovered significant genome-wide PGSxBMI signal for liver function, but there is an opportunity for additional and more interpretable discoveries. Here, we leverage pathway-specific polygenic scores (pPGS) to discover novel mechanism-specific gene-adiposity interactions. We tested for adiposity interactions impacting three liver-related biomarkers (ALT, AST and GGT) using (1) a standard, genome-wide PGS, (2) an array of pPGS containing variant subsets derived from KEGG pathways, and (3) a GWIS. For ALT, we identified 49 significant pPGSxBMI interactions at a Bonferroni corrected p < 2.7x10-4, 80% of which were not explained by genes close to the 8 loci found in the associated GWIS. Across all biomarkers, we found interactions of BMI with 83 unique pPGS-based on KEGG pathways.

Proteins are often optimized for single functions during design and engineering, without considering the countless other functionalities that may contribute to or interfere with the intended outcome. In this work, we apply deep learning to understand and design the multifunctional host-targeting landscape of the T7 bacteriophage receptor binding protein for enhanced infectivity, pre-defined specificity, and high generality in virulence toward unseen strains. We compare several different model architectures and design approaches and experimentally characterize designed phages optimized for 26 diverse tasks. We demonstrate that with multiobjective machine learning, it is possible to design complex specificities at success rates that can enable low-throughput validation of predicted hits. Our results show that the targeting capabilities of T7 are highly plastic, with opposite specificities often separated by only a few mutations. This level of tunability underscores how models trained on multifunctional data can uncover key principles of phage biology and specificity. The same modeling framework can be applied to guide the multiobjective design of other proteins or mutable biological systems, offering a general strategy for navigating multifunctional landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

We introduce BehaveAgent, an autonomous multimodal AI agent designed to automate behavior analysis from video input without retraining or manual intervention. Unlike conventional methods that require manual behavior annotation, video segmentation, task-specific model training, BehaveAgent leverages the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLM) to generalize across novel behavioral domains without need for additional training. It integrates LLMs, vision-language models (VLMs), and large-scale visual grounding modules, orchestrated through a multimodal context memory and goal-directed attention mechanism, to enable robust zero-shot visual reasoning across species and experimental paradigms, including plants, insects, rodents, primates, and humans. Upon receiving a video input, BehaveAgent autonomously identifies the correct analysis strategy and performs end-to-end behavior analysis and interpretation without human supervision. Leveraging vision-language representations, it performs general-purpose tracking, pose estimation and segmentation. We demonstrate BehaveAgents universal applicability to autonomously (1) identify the behavioral paradigm and develop an action plan specialized for the identified paradigm, (2) identify relevant subjects and objects, (3) track those features, (4) identify behavioral sequences with explicit reasoning, (5) generate and execute code for targeted analysis and (6) generate comprehensive research reports that integrate behavioral findings with relevant scientific literature. Through interpretable agentic reasoning, BehaveAgent makes its internal decision-making process transparent, clarifying why particular features are tracked or behaviors inferred. By reducing the time and expertise required for behavior analysis, BehaveAgent introduces a scalable, generalizable, and explainable paradigm for advancing biological and behavioral research.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

The bacteria releases effector proteins some of which remodel the host autophagic-lysosomal pathways. One effector is RavZ, which delipidates ATG8 proteins, making Legionella-infected cells deficient in autophagy. Here we show that SidE effectors mediate the phosphoribosyl ubiquitination (PR-Ub) of autophagic SNARE proteins STX17 and SNAP29. STX17 modification induces recruitment of STX17+ membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum to Legionella-containing phagosomes to form replicative vacuoles. Using proximity labeling, biochemistry and Legionella infection studies, we have discovered a mechanism by which autophagy is hijacked by bacteria to recruit ER membranes to the bacterial vacuole which has autophagy markers but do not fuse with lysosomes. Mass spectrometric identification of PR-Ub sites and mutational studies show that PR-Ub modification of STX17 alters its interaction with ATG14L, which drives the recruitment of ER membranes to the bacterial vacuole in a PI3K dependent manner. On the other hand, PR-Ub of SNAP29 inhibits the formation of the autophagosomal SNARE complex (STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8) by steric hindrance, thereby preventing the fusion of bacterial vacuoles with lysosomes.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

This process has been interpreted as a form of active sensing and is associated with faster responses and improved perceptual accuracy. While converging evidence suggests that respiration also shapes interoceptive processing at both neural and behavioural levels, it remains unclear whether individuals actively adjust their breathing to optimize interoceptive performance. In this study, we examined whether healthy participants modulated their respiration during an interoceptive (heartbeat discrimination) and an exteroceptive (tactile detection) task. We analysed respiration both in terms of time-locked activity and inter-trial phase coherence relative to stimulus onset and assessed their relationship with perceptual accuracy. Our results demonstrated that participants systematically adjust their breathing in both amplitude and phase, synchronizing respiration to the anticipated (i.e., cued) onset of stimuli in both tasks. Crucially, task performance was enhanced during exhalation compared to inhalation, suggesting that respiratory modulation supports the perception of both interoceptive and exteroceptive signals.

Significance statementThis study reveals that humans not only synchronize their breathing to anticipated external and internal stimuli, but also perform better when perceiving them during exhalation. By showing that respiration is modulated in both interoceptive and exteroceptive contexts, our findings extend the concept of active sensing to internal bodily awareness. This has important implications for understanding the dynamic interplay between physiology and perception and may guide interventions aimed at improving clinical outcomes in conditions where interoception is disrupted.","NA","biorxiv",1748038178578

We consider the approximate version of this problem, that is, the result set is allowed to contain some false positive matches (but no false negatives), and focus on the specific case where the indexed documents are DNA strings. In this setting, state-of-the-art solutions rely on Bloom filters as a way to index all k-mers (substrings of length k) in the documents. To answer a query, the k-mers of the query string are tested for membership against the index and documents that contain at least a user-prescribed fraction of them (e.g., 75-80%) are returned. Methods and results: Here, we explore an alternative index design based on k-mer minimizers and integer compression methods. We show that a careful implementation of this design outperforms previous solutions based on Bloom filters by a wide margin: the index has lower memory footprint and faster query times, while false positive matches have only a minor impact on the ranking of the documents reported. This trend is robust across genomic datasets of different complexity and query workloads.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1748038178578

In 2023, external funding accounted for 21% of total TB expenditures, with the U.S. contributing over 55% of these funds. The withdrawal of U.S. support threatens essential TB services, including diagnostics, treatment, TB-HIV co-infection interventions, and research initiatives critical to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for TB eradication.

MethodsThis study analyses the dependency of 26 high-burden TB countries (HBCs) on U.S. funding and models the potential impact of funding cuts on TB incidence and mortality. Countries were classified into low (0-22%), moderate (23-37%), and high (>37%) dependency groups based on three-year expenditure data. A deterministic compartmental model simulated service disruptions under three recovery scenarios: (1) minimal impact (services recover within three months), (2) moderate impact (recovery within one year), and (3) worst-case scenario (permanent service reduction). Extrapolations were made for all 26 HBCs based on representative countries from each dependency category.

FindingsFunding cuts are projected to result in substantial increases in TB cases and deaths across the three scenarios. In a high-dependency country, cumulative TB cases could rise by 2.1% (CI 1.5 - 2.5), 5.4% (CI4 - 6.5), or 36% (CI 25 - 47), and TB deaths by 2.9%(CI 2.2 - 3.5), 7.8%(CI 5.9 - 9.2), 68%(CI 45 - 86), depending on the severity of service disruptions. Across all 26 HBCs, additional TB cases are estimated at 0.63 million (CI 0.45 - 0.81) (minimal impact), 1.66 million (CI 1.2 - 2.1) (moderate impact), and 10.67 million (CI 7.85 - 13.19) (worst-case). Corresponding TB deaths are projected to increase by 99,800 (CI 65,200-130,000), 268,600 (CI 185,800-337,900), and 2,243,700 (CI 1,570,800-2,807,300), respectively. The findings underscore the catastrophic consequences of the funding cut, particularly in countries highly reliant on U.S. support.

InterpretationThe loss of U.S. funding endangers global TB control, jeopardizing End TB and SDG targets. While some nations may adapt, short-term disruptions will severely impact vulnerable populations. Urgent alternative funding is needed to sustain TB prevention and treatment efforts and mitigate the effects of aid withdrawal.
