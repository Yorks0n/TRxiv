Whether super-enhancers constitute a separate regulatory paradigm remains unclear, largely due to the difficulty of dissecting the contributions and interactions of individual elements within their natural chromosomal context. To address this challenge, we developed enhancer scrambling, a high-throughput strategy to generate stochastic inversions and deletions of targeted enhancer regions by combining CRISPR prime editing insertion of symmetrical loxP sites with Cre recombinase-induced rearrangements. We applied our approach to dissect a distal super-enhancer of the OTX2 gene, generating up to 134 alternative regulatory configurations in a single experiment, and establishing how they drive gene expression and chromatin accessibility, as well as the individual contributions of its elements to this activity. Surprisingly, the presence of the sequence containing a single DNase I hypersensitive site predominantly controls OTX2 expression. Our findings highlight that enhancer-driven regulation of some highly expressed, cell-type-specific genes can rely on an individual element within a cluster of non-interacting, dispensable components, and suggest a simple functional core to a subset of super-enhancers. The targeted randomisation method to scramble enhancers can scale to resolve many super-enhancers and human gene regulatory landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320804

Here, we overcome this limitation by using live imaging data to calibrate Micro-C in mouse embryonic stem cells, thus obtaining absolute looping probabilities for 36,804 chromatin loops across the genome. We find that the looped state is generally rare, with a mean probability of 2.3% and a maximum of 26% across the quantified loops. On average, CTCF-CTCF loops are stronger than loops between cis-regulatory elements (3.2% vs. 1.1%). Our findings can be extended to human stem cells and differentiated cells under certain assumptions. Overall, we establish an approach for genome-wide absolute loop quantification and report that loops generally occur with low probabilities, generalizing recent live imaging results to the whole genome.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320804

Researchers often optimize task designs by assessing collinearity between task regressors to minimize downstream effects. However, some methods intended to reduce collinearity during optimization and data analysis may fail, in some cases introducing unintended bias into the parameter estimates. Although relevant to all task-based fMRI studies, we describe these issues and illustrate them using the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task fMRI data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD(R)) study. Specifically, we show that omitting regressors for certain task components, using impulse regressors for extended activations, and ignoring response time adjustments can bias common contrast estimates. We present a ""Saturated"" model that models all stimuli and response times, which minimizes bias in MID task simulations and validly estimates task-relevant whole brain activity, offering greater flexibility in studying contrasts that might otherwise be avoided due to potential biases.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320804

While tissue patterning has been viewed as the transition from initially identical un-patterned cells to an arrangement of different cell types, recent evidence suggests that initial heterogeneities between cells modulate tissue-scale pattern formation. Yet, how such heterogeneities arise and, thereafter, regulate cell type emergence in a population of cells is poorly understood. Using in vivo and in vitro mouse regenerative systems, we identify a critical tissue density that is required to induce heterogeneous inactivation of the mechanosensor YAP1. Experimental and biophysical approaches demonstrate that YAP1 cell-to-cell heterogeneity pre-patterns the first cell fate decision, via both chromatin remodelling and a supracellular feedback between FOXA1 and Delta-Notch signalling. This feedback motif induces cell fate bistability endowing memory to the system and the maintenance of patterns during homeostasis. These findings reveal a generalisable framework in which transient cell-to-cell heterogeneity, regulated by tissue-scale properties, serves as a critical control parameter for the emergence of cell fate and stable patterning during regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320804

Hence, cryo-EM holds the potential of one of the most sensitive analytical methods that deliver a high-resolution protein structure as a readout. In practice, more than a million times more starting biological material is required to prepare cryo-EM grids. To close the gap, we developed a micro isolation (MISO) method that combines microfluidics-based protein purification with cryo-EM grid preparation. We validated the method on soluble bacterial and eukaryotic membrane proteins. We showed that MISO enables protein structure determination starting from below one microgram of a target protein and going from cells to cryo-EM grids within a few hours. This scales down the purification by a factor of a few hundred to a few thousand and opens possibilities for the structural characterization of hitherto inaccessible proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320804

Their genomes evolve from genetically diverse germlines in complex and dynamic environments, including exposure to potential carcinogens. This heterogeneity of humans, our environmental exposures, and subsequent tumours makes it challenging to understand the extent to which cancer evolution is predictable. Addressing this limitation, we re-ran early tumour evolution hundreds of times in diverse, inbred mouse strains, capturing genetic variation comparable to and beyond that found in human populations. The sex, environment, and carcinogenic exposures were all controlled and tumours comprehensively profiled with whole genome and transcriptome sequencing. Within a strain, there was a high degree of consistency in the mutational landscape, a limited range of driver mutations, and all strains converged on the acquisition of a MAPK activating mutation with similar transcriptional disruption of that pathway. Despite these similarities in the phenotypic state of tumours, different strains took markedly divergent paths to reach that state. This included pronounced biases in the precise driver mutations, the strain specific occurrence of whole genome duplication, and differences in subclonal selection that reflected both cancer susceptibility and tumour growth rate. These results show that interactions between the germline genome and the environment are highly deterministic for the trajectory of tumour genome evolution, and even modest genetic divergence can substantially alter selection pressures during cancer development, influencing both cancer risk and the biology of the tumour that develops.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320804

Processing bodies (P-bodies) are dynamic ribonucleoprotein condensates formed by phase separation in the cytosol. P-bodies are involved in translational arrest and mRNA decay and regulate several developmental processes and stress responses. Pathogens have evolved strategies to exploit host degradation pathways for their own benefit, however little is known about how they impact translation. Here we show that upon infection with pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato (Pst), P-body assembly is enhanced in an effector-dependent manner. Moreover, a P-body-defective mutant is more tolerant to bacterial infection due to altered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses, suggesting a role of P-bodies as novel susceptibility hubs. Pst infection is accompanied by a general host translation attenuation, which is both effector-dependent, and deregulated in the P-body-defective mutant. This indicates that P-bodies are required for the bacterial modulation of the plant translation, probably to hinder the defense responses. Additionally, host autophagy is also exploited by the bacteria to modulate P-body dynamics and its subsequent translation attenuation, revealing a complex interplay between P-body formation and disassembly during infection. Altogether, our discoveries provide novel insights on how host translation is targeted by bacteria via effector-triggered P-body formation to promote disease and uncover unknown connections between ER stress responses and autophagy with P-body dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320804

However, the mechanisms underlying ENS plasticity and resilience remain poorly understood. Organoid technology has revolutionized in vitro modeling by accurately replicating epithelial structures and enabling significant advancements in understanding gastrointestinal biology. However, traditional organoids are limited in their ability to study the ENS, as they lack the multicellular composition and functional architecture necessary to model complex interactions between neurons, glia, mesenchymal, smooth muscle, and epithelial cells. To address these limitations, we developed murine ENS-Rich Assembloids (ERAs) that self-organize to replicate the cellular diversity, including the epithelial structure, and functional architecture of native colonic tissue. These assembloids recreate neuron-glia interactions, reflect regenerative processes, and provide a novel platform for studying ENS dynamics under controlled conditions. Integrating findings from assembloids and an in vivo murine model, we demonstrate that inflammation induces coordinated reorganization of S100b+ glial cells, TUJ1+ neurons, PDGFRA+ mesenchymal cells, and epithelial cells, revealing conserved mechanisms of ENS plasticity. We identify pleiotrophin (PTN) signaling via Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type Z1 (PTPRZ1) as a key pathway facilitating neural elongation and enhancing neuron-glia interactions. Moreover, we show that activated neurons transfer lipids to glial cells, revealing a novel support mechanism during inflammation. These findings position enteric glia as protective hubs for neurons, fostering ENS adaptability and tissue regeneration. By building on the foundational success of organoid technology and addressing its limitations for studying the ENS, ENS-rich assembloids establish a transformative tool for investigating ENS responses in health, disease, and tissue repair.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320804

However, the ubiquity of this trend over geological timescales remains unclear. One reason for this uncertainty is that palaeobiologists need Global Plate Models (GPMs) to estimate the latitudinal position of organisms' remains at time of deposition. However, as GPMs constitute hypotheses for how tectonic plates have moved over Earth's history, reconstructions of the latitudinal biodiversity gradient (LBG) might also vary based on the GPM used. Here, using the fossil record of five major marine invertebrate groups, we evaluate the impact of GPM choice on reconstructions of the LBG over the Phanerozoic. Our results show that GPM choice can lead to different conclusions about the shape and strength of LBGs in deep time, even at a coarse spatial scale. These findings suggest additional caution is needed when reconstructing deep-time biogeographic patterns and macroevolutionary events, such as the origin of the present-day LBG. We therefore advocate for future palaeobiogeographic studies to conduct sensitivity analyses investigating the impact of GPM choice on their conclusions, and for greater interdisciplinary collaboration between palaeobiologists and palaeogeographic modellers to avoid common issues in the use of GPMs.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320804

The OT-I mouse TCR is widely used to study antigen discrimination utilising many pMHCs, including foreign and self antigens. Previous studies suggested that OT-I T cells achieve near-perfect discrimination between higher and lower affinity antigens. Moreover, these 3D affinities measured in solution did not correlate with the 2D membrane affinities, suggesting a complex relationship between 3D and 2D affinities. In contrast, other TCRs have shown imperfect antigen discrimination and strong correlations between 3D and 2D affinities. To resolve these discrepancies, we extended a protocol for measuring ultra-low TCR/pMHC affinities to accurately determine the 3D affinities of the OT-I TCR binding 19 pMHC complexes. These revised 3D affinities now strongly correlate with the 2D affinities, and accurately predict functional responses. Importantly, we now find that the OT-I TCR exhibits enhanced yet imperfect antigen discrimination, similar to other TCRs, allowing it to detect abnormally high levels of low-affinity self-antigens. Finally, we show that discrimination is highest with low-affinity pMHC ligands, a finding predicted by the kinetic-proofreading model of antigen discrimination. This work underscores the ability of T cells to effectively gauge proxies for 3D affinity within the 2D cell-cell interface, with significant implications for the mechanisms underlying antigen discrimination.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320804

Exchanges are formed via tightly-regulated repair of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). However, since repair intermediates are mostly quantified in fixed images, our understanding of the mechanisms that control the progression of repair remains limited. Here, we study meiotic repair kinetics in Caenorhabditis elegans by extinguishing new DSBs and following the disappearance of a crucial intermediate - strand invasion mediated by the conserved RecA-family recombinase RAD-51. We find that RAD-51 foci have a half-life of 42-132 minutes for both endogenous and exogenous DSBs. Surprisingly, we find that repair templated by the sister chromatid is not slower than repair templated by the homolog. This suggests that differential kinetics are unlikely to underlie homolog bias: the preferential use of the homolog as a repair template. We also use our kinetic information to revisit the total number of DSBs per nucleus - the  substrate for the formation of exchanges - and find an average of 40 DSBs in wild-type meiosis and >50 DSBs when homolog pairing is perturbed. Our work opens the door for analysis of the interplay between meiotic repair kinetics and the fidelity of genome inheritance.

Antibodies often originate in the lymph node (LN), specifically at the extrafollicular border of B cell follicles, where T and B lymphocytes physically interact to drive B cell maturation into antibody-secreting plasmablasts. In vitro models of this process are sorely needed to predict aspects of the human immune response. Microphysiological systems (MPSs) offer the opportunity to approximate the lymphoid environment, but so far have focused primarily on memory recall responses to antigens previously encountered by donor cells. To date, no 3D culture system has replicated the engagement between T cells and B cells (T--B interaction) that leads to antibody production when starting with naive cells. Here, we developed a LN-MPS to model early T--B interactions at the extrafollicular border built from primary, naive human lymphocytes encapsulated within a collagen-based 3D matrix. Within the MPS, naive T cells exhibited CCL21-dependent chemotaxis and chemokinesis as predicted. Naive T and B cells were successfully skewed on chip to an early T follicular helper (pre-Tfh) and activated state, respectively, and co-culture of the latter cells led to CD38+ plasmablast cells and T cell dependent production of IgM. These responses required differentiation of the T cells into pre-Tfhs, physical cell-cell contact, and were sensitive to the ratio at which pre-Tfh and activated B cells were seeded on-chip. Dependence on T cell engagement was greatest at a 1:5 T:B ratio, while cell proliferation and CD38+ signal was greatest at a 1:1 T:B ratio. Furthermore, plasmablast formation was established starting from naive T and B cells on-chip. We envision that this MPS model of primary lymphocyte physiology will enable new mechanistic analyses of human humoral immunity in vitro.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320804

Genomic defenses have evolved to counteract TE proliferation through silencing mechanisms operating at the epigenetic or transcript level. In fungi, repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) targets TEs by recognizing repetitive sequences and inducing mutagenesis. However, the prevalence of RIP across the fungal kingdom and the fidelity of the canonical C-to-T mutation signatures remain unclear. In this study, we address these gaps by tracking shifts in genome architecture across the fungal kingdom. We show that the loss of RIP components is associated with an 80% ([~]30 Mb) increase in genome size in ascomycetes (class of Leotiomycetes). To track the impact of genome defenses, we designed a quantitative screen for RIP-like mutation signatures. The phylum of ascomycetes was unique in showing enrichment in mutation signatures in non-coding and repetitive sequences, consistent with a phylogenetically restricted occurrence of RIP-like genome defense systems. Then, we gene functions associated in a phylogenetic context with RIP-like mutation signatures. We identified a zinc-finger protein as the strongest candidate underpinning a novel mechanism of genome defenses. Our findings reveal the multifaceted drivers of genome defense systems and their close ties to genome size evolution in fungi, highlighting how proximate molecular mechanisms can shape genome evolution on deep phylogenetic scales.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320804

Male-killing is a convergently evolved trait, with microbes evolving diverse male-killing mechanisms across host species with widely divergent sex determination pathways. A common evolutionary response to MK presence is the spread of suppressor mutations that restore male survival. In this study, we demonstrate evolution of a novel male-killing mechanism that is insensitive to an existing male-killing suppressor. Hypolimnas bolina butterflies from Yogyakarta, Indonesia, showed extreme female biased population sex ratio associated with high prevalence of a male-killing Wolbachia. This strain, wBol1Y, shared a very recent common ancestor with the previously characterized suppressed male-killing strain in the species, wBol1, but retained its male-killing ability in the presence of the male-killing suppressor. The genome of wBol1Y differed from the suppressed wBol1 in carrying an additional prophage that included strong candidate genes for male-killing. In vitro and in vivo data demonstrated that wBol1Y feminized splicing and expression of lepidopteran sex determination pathway genes, and that the gene Hb-oscar - present on wBol1Y's unique prophage insert - was sufficient to disrupt the male sex determination pathway. Our study demonstrates the diversity of male-killing mechanisms is a product both of interaction with varying insect sex determination systems and evolution of male-killing within a host species. Our data indicate male-killer and host may be involved in escalating arms races, where spread male-killing suppression drives evolution of additional systems that reestablish male killing by the symbiont.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320804

We quantified the asynchronous progression of phage infection in single bacterial cells and reconstructed the infection timeline, characterizing both host and phage transcriptomic changes as infection unfolded. We discovered a subpopulation of bacteria that remained uninfected and determined the heterogeneously expressed host factors associated with protection. Each cell's vulnerability to phage infection was defined by combinatorial phase-variable expression of multiple genetic loci, including capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis pathways, restriction-modification systems (RM), and a previously uncharacterized operon likely encoding fimbrial genes. By acting together, these heterogeneously expressed phase-variable systems and anti-phage defense mechanisms create a phenotypic landscape where distinct protective combinations enable the survival and re-growth of bacteria expressing these phenotypes without acquiring additional mutations. The emerging model of complementary action of multiple protective mechanisms heterogeneously expressed across an isogenic bacterial population showcases the potent role of phase variation and stochasticity in bacterial anti-phage defenses.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320804

The lack of data on disease burden poses a significant barrier to adopting effective interventions such as vaccination programs. We developed a novel colorimetric assay for the detection of S. Typhi-specific bacteriophages (phages) in environmental water samples, providing an indirect indicator of S. Typhi contamination and insights into typhoid burden. We collected surface water samples from Brazil, Cote dIvoire, Nepal, and Niger, covering urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. We evaluated the colorimetric assay efficiency against agar overlay plaque assay. Isolated phages were tested against various bacteria to assess their host range. The colorimetric assay demonstrated high sensitivity (100% concordance with double agar overlay) with a detection limit of 28 plaque-forming units per milliliter (PFU/mL), and results were obtained in 5.5 hours. Phage detection rates were highest in densely populated areas with poor sanitation, particularly in Kathmandu, Nepal (96.6% positivity in river samples) and Abidjan, Cote dIvoire (35.1% positivity in drainage samples). The detection of S. Typhi phages in Cote dIvoire is particularly important, as the burden of typhoid in the region was previously undocumented. Phages were not detected in rural and drinking water sources. Host range analyses demonstrated that the isolated phages were specific to S. Typhi, with a small minority of phages (4/30) isolated also capable of infecting S. Paratyphi A. The novel colorimetric assay offers a rapid and sensitive method for detecting S. Typhi bacteriophages in environmental water. The scalability, low cost ([~]$2.40 USD per sample), and minimal equipment requirements, suggest that this could be effective tool for typhoid surveillance in resource-limited settings.

IMPORTANCETyphoid fever, caused by Salmonella Typhi, remains a significant global health threat, particularly in low-resource settings with inadequate sanitation. Effective control measures, such as vaccines, require precise data on where typhoid is most prevalent, yet current surveillance methods are expensive and limited in scope. This study introduces a rapid, low-cost, and scalable colorimetric assay for detecting S. Typhi bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) in environmental water samples. Unlike traditional methods, this test detects the presence of S. Typhi indirectly by identifying associated phages, offering a specific and sensitive approach for monitoring typhoid fever circulation. The assay was validated in diverse settings across four countries and demonstrated high accuracy and cost efficiency. By reducing reliance on expensive laboratory equipment and complex procedures, this tool makes typhoid surveillance more accessible, especially in low-income regions, helping prioritize vaccination campaigns and improve public health interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1737065320804

There is substantial evidence that AMF support plant and crop growth in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Fine root endophytes (FRE) also co-occur in plant roots with AMF in all but tropical environments. However, their presence remains poorly recognized, and their lifestyle and functionality remain largely unknown. Our analysis demonstrates that, in contrast to AMF, FRE colonize plants during the winter season, when photosynthesis is more challenging. It is also noteworthy that FRE was unable to colonize the roots of spring-sown crops. The results of our laboratory pot experiments demonstrated that low temperatures are not sufficient for FRE colonization. Furthermore, we observed that FRE, in contrast to AMF, exhibited increased colonization in soils containing metabolically inactive plants. Our results suggest that FRE does not contribute to the increase of ecosystem biomass through direct photosynthesis in summer, but may play an overlooked role in the formation of mycorrhiza-based soil ecosystems in winter. However, this winter ecosystem can be disrupted by conventional bare fallow management of the field, interrupting the annual cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320804

Fluorescence sensors currently used to monitor such signals in vivo are typically optimized to detect fast, relative changes in concentration of the target molecule. They are less well suited to detect slowly-changing signals and rarely provide absolute measurements of either fast and slow signaling components. Here, we developed a system for fluorescence lifetime photometry at high temporal resolution (FLIPR) that utilizes frequency-domain analog processing to measure the absolute fluorescence lifetime of genetically-encoded sensors at high speed but with long-term stability and picosecond precision in freely moving mice. We applied FLIPR to investigate dopamine signaling in two functionally distinct regions in the striatum, the nucleus accumbens core (NAC) and the tail of striatum (TOS). We observed higher tonic dopamine levels at baseline in the TOS compared to the NAC and detected differential and dynamic responses in phasic and tonic dopamine to appetitive and aversive stimuli. Thus, FLIPR enables simple monitoring of fast and slow time-scale neuronal signaling in absolute units, revealing previously unappreciated spatial and temporal variation even in well-studied signaling systems.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320804

Despite their potential synergy, these methods have rarely been combined to explore the interplay between molecular tension and cellular tractions. Here, we introduce a framework integrating TFM and VinTS to investigate FA mechanics across scales. At cell level, tractions and vinculin tension increased with substrate stiffness. At FA level, vinculin tension correlated with vinculin density, while tractions scaled with FA area, total vinculin content and vinculin density. Direct comparison of tractions to tension revealed a complex, heterogenous relationship between these forces, possibly linked to diverse cell and FA maturation states. Sub-FA analysis revealed conserved spatial patterns, with tension and traction increasing towards the cell periphery. This multiscale approach provides insights into the multiscale dynamics of FA mechanotransduction, bridging the gap between molecular forces and cellular mechanics.j","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

Here, we provide evidence that INOSITOL PHOSPHORYLCERAMIDE SYNTHASE 2 (IPCS2)-dependent sphingolipid production contributes to the role of the trans-Golgi network as a multi-domain sorting compartment, and mediates proper delivery of an ATP-binding cassette transporter to polarized plasma membrane domains at plant-microbe interaction sites.

INOSITOL PHOSPHORYLCERAMIDE SYNTHASE 2 (IPCS2) is involved in the biosynthesis of complex sphingolipids at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Here, we demonstrate a role of IPCS2 in penetration resistance against non-adapted powdery mildew fungi. A novel ipcs2W205* mutant was recovered from a forward genetic screen for Arabidopsis plants with enhanced epidermal cell entry success of the non-adapted barley fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh). A yeast complementation assay and a sphingolipidomic approach revealed that the ipcs2W205* mutant represents a knock-out and lacks IPCS2-specific enzymatic activity. Further mutant analyses suggested that IPCS2-derived glycosyl inositol phosphorylceramides (GIPCs) are required for cell entry control of non-adapted fungal intruders. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) studies indicated that upon pathogen attack, IPCS2 remains at the TGN to produce GIPCs, while focal accumulation of the defense cargo PENETRATION 3 (PEN3) at Bgh penetration sites was reduced in the ipcs2W205* mutant background. Thus, we propose a model in which sorting events at the TGN are facilitated by complex sphingolipids, regulating polar secretion of PEN3 to host-pathogen contact sites to terminate fungal ingress.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

In plants, different types of ROS perform useful biological functions in the extracellular space (apoplast) supporting processes such as polymerisation and cell wall remodelling. In addition, increased formation of extracellular superoxide and hydrogen peroxide occurs during immune responses. Our current knowledge of apoplastic ROS dynamics is based on luminescence assays, ROS staining methods and indirect evidence via changes to intracellular redox balance. However, dynamic monitoring of extracellular redox processes in vivo remains difficult. Using two evolutionary distant land plant model species, the moss Physcomitrium patens and the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we test whether the genetically encoded redox biosensor roGFP-Orp1 can be used to assess extracellular redox dynamics. We found that secreted roGFP-Orp1 can inform about local diffusion barriers, as well as protein cysteinyl oxidation rate in the apoplast after pre-reduction. Observed re-oxidation rates were surprisingly slow within the range of hours. Comparing A. thaliana to P. patens, we found faster sensor re-oxidation that increased after triggering an immune response. Our data indicate differences in extracellular oxidative processes between species and within a species, depending on immune signalling.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

Rust fungi of the order Pucciniales (Subphylum Pucciniomycotina) are the largest group of obligate biotrophic plant pathogens and harbor some of the largest and most TE-rich genomes - up to 1.2Gb - compared to other fungi. This global genomic expansion contrasts with the smaller genomes and minimal mobilome found in other Pucciniomycotina species. Despite the availability of high-quality genome assemblies, our understanding of TE dynamics in Pucciniales remains limited due to inconsistent and incomplete TE annotations.

ResultsWe analyzed the mobilomes of 13 Pucciniomycotina species, producing a manually curated TE library for each genome. In Pucciniales, TEs occupy 47-92% of the genome, whereas 2- 36% of TEs are detected in other Pucciniomycotina genomes. The comparison of gene and TE repertoires indicates that TEs, particularly LTR-retrotransposons and TIR-DNA transposons, are the primary contributors to the genome expansion of the Pucciniales. We reconstructed the proliferation histories of TEs in the Pucciniales, combining sequence similarity, clustering, and molecular clock approaches. We highlight recent and ancient TE invasions with some LTR-Gypsy elements predating the divergence of Pucciniomycotina ([~]176 Mya), while most TE accumulation in Pucciniales occurred within the last 50 Mya. However, the TE invasions in the Pucciniales genomes do not seem to result from specific deficiencies in known TE-control mechanisms.

ConclusionOur findings uncover extensive TE proliferation in Pucciniales, predominantly driven by recent LTR-Gypsy expansions. The retention of ancestral TEs and the consistently TE-rich genomes observed in Pucciniales highlight TE proliferation as an ancestral genomic feature in rust fungi.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

We genotyped 3,352 individuals and identified twelve genetic sub-clusters that corresponded to the geographical distribution of different tribal regions, differentiated by distinct components of ancestry based on comparisons to modern and ancient DNA references. These sub-clusters also showed variation across ranges of the genome covered in runs of homozygosity, as well as differences in population size changes over time. Using 25,488,981 variants found in whole genome sequencing data (WGS) from 302 individuals, we found that the Saudi tend to show proportionally more deleterious alleles than neutral alleles when compared to Africans/African Americans from gnomAD (e.g. a 13% increase of deleterious alleles annotated by AlphaMissense between 0.5 -5% frequency in Saudi, compared to 7% decrease of the benign alleles; P < 0.001). Saudi sub-clusters with greater inbreeding and lower effective population sizes showed greater enrichment of deleterious alleles as well. Additionally, we found that approximately 10% of the variants discovered in our WGS data are not observed in gnomAD; these variants are also enriched with deleterious annotations. To accelerate studying the population-enriched deleterious alleles and their health consequences in this population, we made available the allele frequency estimates of 25,488,981 variants discovered in our samples.

Current dogma holds that bone fracture causes severe hypoxia at the fracture site, due to vascular rupture, and that this hypoxia must be overcome for regeneration. Here, we show that the early fracture site is not hypoxic, but instead exhibits high oxygen tension (> 55 mmHg, or 8%), similar to the red blood cell reservoir, the spleen. This elevated oxygen stems not from angiogenesis but from activated erythropoiesis in the adjacent bone marrow. Fracture-activated erythroid progenitor cells concentrate oxygen through haemoglobin formation. Blocking transferrin receptor 1 (CD71)-mediated iron uptake prevents oxygen binding by these cells, induces fracture site hypoxia, and enhances bone repair through increased angiogenesis and osteogenesis. These findings upend our current understanding of the early phase of bone fracture repair, provide a mechanism for high oxygen tension in the bone marrow after injury, and reveal an unexpected and targetable role of erythroid progenitors in fracture repair.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

As a sister group of seed plants (including flowering plants) they are also of great evolutionary interest. Compared to flowering plants, however, much less is known about the developmental and molecular biology of ferns. Among the most important reasons have been the huge genome sizes of ferns and technical obstacles such as the lack of an efficient transformation system. In recent years the situation has improved considerably, however. For the fern model system Ceratopteris richardii a whole genome sequence has been published, and an efficient transformation system has been developed. To further facilitate studies on fern biology we aim at simplifying genome engineering of C. richardii with the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We report C. richardii plants that express Cas9 nuclease under control of the strong CaMV 35S promoter. For efficient expression of single guide RNA (sgRNA) by RNA polymerase III we identified C. richardii U6 promoters. These technical improvements may foster many fields of fern physiology, development and evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

We used SC-specific reconstitution of the essential clock gene Bmal1 to elucidate the role of the local SC clock and its interplay with the central clock in the mouse brain and found that daily transcriptional control of metabolic processes in SCs depend on central clock input, independent of the SC clock. Central clock-driven genes were involved in lipid metabolism, functionally important for SC-mediated muscle repair, and autophagy was required for their oscillation. In summary, we provide the first evidence of circadian coordination of central and local clocks for control of rhythmic gene expression in quiescent stem cells.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

Although the organellar genomes are considerably smaller compared to the nuclear genome, they are nonetheless essential for survival of the organism. A common feature of many chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes is the presence of large repeated sequences longer than 1 kb. These can be either in inverted or direct orientation, and recombination between them leads to structural heteroplasmy. To understand the intraspecific evolution of organellar genomes, we assembled chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of 143 A. thaliana accessions from PacBio HiFi sequencing data. We find large repeats to be associated with heteroplasmy and structural variation. Our extensive genome annotation identifies novel open reading frames (ORFs) in those accessions that lost large repeats, potentially introduced via horizontal gene transfer, illuminating additional paths for diversification of plant organelles. The loss of large repeats correlates with geography and phenotypes, pointing to their adaptive importance. The assembled and annotated organellar genomes constitute a rich source for future functional studies of the interaction between the three genomes of a plant.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

Furthermore, its aberrant activity enhances glioblastoma cell motility. Our results show that the weak adhesion-clutch is well-suited for rapid cell migration, without forming strong adhesions that impede cell motility, and provides a potential target for inhibiting abnormal cell motility.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

Wilt pathogens that colonize water-conducting plant tissues can aggravate the problem and affect a wide range of agricultural crops4,5. However, whilst fungal infections with the vascular pathogen Verticillium dahliae are typically associated with wilt symptoms due to occlusion of xylem tissues, the related V. longisporum induces de novo formation of tracheary elements6,7. This promotes not only its virulence but also enables elevated water storage capacity of the infected host plant and resilience against drought stress conditions6,7.

We developed a Millifluidic Continuous Culture Device (MCCD) to culture bacteria under precisely controlled nutrient conditions, including very low concentrations, in a manner suitable for proteomic analysis. Using the MCCD, we cultured Escherichia coli with a mixture of amino acids as the sole carbon source at three concentrations supporting growth rates spanning a fivefold range. Surprisingly, at the lowest concentration, cells exhibited proteomic signatures of iron shortage despite constant iron levels across conditions. Uptake of labeled iron-histidine and iron-cysteine complexes demonstrated that amino-acid-bound iron is bioavailable to E. coli. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of bacterial iron acquisition that emerged under the flow imposed by the MCCD, which diluted the siderophore pool and reduced their efficacy.

There are multiple factors affecting the extent of load such as population size and breeding system, yet other potential determinants remain unexplored. A common macromutation, whole-genome duplication (WGD) occurs broadly across Eukaryotes, yet we lack a clear understanding of how WGD impacts neutral and selective processes within a population. Using forward simulations and empirical analysis of 632 short- and 16 long-read sequenced individuals of Arabidopsis arenosa (23 diploid and 42 natural autotetraploid populations), we test for the effects of WGD on genome-wide diversity and mutation load. Our simulations show how genetic variation gradually rises in autotetraploids due to increase of mutational target size. Moreover, mutation load increases due to relaxed purifying selection when deleterious mutations are masked by additional chromosome copies. Empirical data confirm these patterns, showing significant increase in nucleotide diversity, ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous SNPs, and number of indels and large structural variants in A. arenosa autotetraploids. However, a rather modest increase in load proxies together with a broad distribution and niche of autotetraploids suggests load accumulation has not (yet) limited their successful expansion. Overall, we demonstrate a complex interplay between neutral processes and purifying selection in shaping genetic variation following WGD and highlight ploidy as an important determinant of genetic diversity and mutation load in natural populations.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

Existing methods for elucidating the ancestry-specific structures generally rely on frequency-based estimates of genetic relationship matrix (GRM) among admixed individuals after masking segments from ancestry components not being targeted for investigation. However, these approaches disregard linkage information between markers, potentially limiting their resolution in revealing structure within an ancestry component. We introduce ancestry-specific expected GRM (as-eGRM), a novel framework for elucidating the relatedness within ancestry components between admixed individuals. The key design of as-eGRM consists of defining ancestry-specific pairwise relatedness between individuals based on genealogical trees encoded in the Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG) and local ancestry calls and computing the expectation of the ancestry-specific relatedness across the genome. Comprehensive evaluations using both simulated stepping-stone models of population structure and empirical datasets based on three-way admixed Latino cohorts showed that analysis based on as-eGRM robustly outperforms existing methods in revealing the structure in admixed populations with diverse demographic histories. Taken together, as-eGRM has the promise to better reveal the fine-scale structure within an ancestry component of admixed individuals, which can help improve the robustness and interpretation of findings from association studies of disease or complex traits for these understudied populations.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

Since drifts during the acquisition adversely affect data quality, active sample stabilization is commonly used for some of these techniques to reach their full potential. While drifts in the lateral plane can often be corrected after acquisition, this is not always possible or may come with drawbacks. Therefore, it is appealing to stabilize sample position in three dimensions during acquisition. Various schemes for active sample stabilization have been demonstrated previously, with some reaching sub-nm stability in three dimensions. However, these high-performance implementations significantly added to the complexity of the hardware and/or sample preparation. Here, we present a scheme for active drift correction that delivers the nm-scale 3D stability demanded by state-of-the-art super-resolution techniques and is straightforward to implement. Using a refined algorithm that does not depend on sparse peaks typically provided by fiducial markers added to the sample, we stabilized our sample position to ~1 nm in 3D using objective lenses both with high and low numerical aperture. Our implementation requires only the addition of a standard widefield imaging path and we provide an open-source control software with graphical user interface to facilitate easy adoption of the module. Finally, we demonstrate how this has the potential to enhance data collection for diffraction-limited and super-resolution imaging techniques using single-molecule localization microscopy and cryo-confocal imaging as showcases.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

To address this, we assess over 450 potential risk factors in one deeply clinically and demographically phenotyped cohort using random forest classifiers to determine predictive markers of poor cognitive function. This study aims to understand early risk factors for dementia by identifying predictors of poor cognitive performance amongst a comprehensive battery of imaging, blood, atmospheric pollutant and socio-economic measures.

MethodsRandom forest modelling was used to determine significant predictors of poor cognitive performance in a cohort of 324 individuals (age 61.6 {+/-} 4.8 years; 150 males, 174 females) without extant neurological disease. 457 features were assessed including brain imaging measures of volume and iron deposition, blood measures of anaemia, inflammation, and heavy metal levels, social deprivation indicators and atmospheric pollution exposure.

ResultsRoutinely assessed markers of anaemia including mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration were identified as robust predictors of poor general cognition, where both extremes (low and high) were associated with poor cognitive performance. The strongest, most consistent predictors of poor cognitive performance were environmental measures of atmospheric pollution, in particular, lead, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. Feature analysis demonstrated a significant negative relationship between low mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration and high levels of atmospheric pollutants highlighting the potential of routinely assessed blood tests as a predictive measure of pollution-dependent cognitive functioning, at an individual level.

ConclusionsTaken together, these data demonstrate how routine, inexpensive medical testing and local authority initiatives could help to identify and protect at-risk individuals. These findings highlight the potential to identify individuals for targeted, cost effective medical and social interventions to improve population cognitive health.

Such goal-directed behaviour - or model-based (MB) reinforcement learning (RL) - can flexibly adapt choice to changes, being thus distinct from simpler habitual - or model-free (MF) RL - strategies. Previous inactivation and neuroimaging work implicates prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the caudate striatal region in MB-RL; however, details are scarce about its implementation at the single-neuron level. Here, we recorded from two PFC regions - the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), and two striatal regions, caudate and putamen - while two rhesus macaques performed a sequential decision-making (two-step) task in which MB-RL involves knowledge about the statistics of reward and state transitions. All four regions, but particularly the ACC, encoded the rewards received and tracked the probabilistic state transitions that occurred. However, ACC (and to a lesser extent caudate) encoded the key variables of the task - namely the interaction between reward, transition and choice - which underlies MB decision-making. ACC and caudate neurons also encoded MB-derived estimates of choice values. Moreover, caudate value estimates of the choice options flipped when a rare transition occurred, demonstrating value update based on structural knowledge of the task. The striatal regions were unique (relative to PFC) in encoding the current and previous rewards with opposing polarities, reminiscent of dopaminergic neurons, and indicative of a MF prediction error. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of selective and temporally dissociable neural mechanisms underlying goal-directed behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

By integrating taxonomic, genomic and predicted functional annotations, we uncover how Bifidobacterium adapts to host-specific environments, shaped by vertical transmission, dietary influences, and host phylogeny. Our findings reveal that host phylogeny is a major determinant of gut microbiota composition. Distinct microbial networks in mammalian and avian hosts reflect evolutionary adaptations to dietary niches, such as carnivory, and ecological pressures. At a strain-resolved level, we identify strong co-phylogenetic associations between Bifidobacterium strains and their hosts, driven by vertical transmission and dietary selection, underscoring the intricate co-evolutionary dynamics between these microbes and their hosts. Functional analyses highlight striking host-specific metabolic adaptations in Bifidobacterium, particularly in carbohydrate metabolism and oxidative stress responses. In mammals, we observe an enrichment of glycoside hydrolases (GH) tailored to complex carbohydrate-rich diets, including multi-domain GH13_28 -amylases featuring diverse carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM25, CBM26, and the novel CBM74). These adaptations emphasise the ecological flexibility of Bifidobacterium in breaking down -linked glucose polysaccharides, such as resistant starch. Together, our study provides new insights into the evolutionary trajectories and ecological plasticity of Bifidobacterium, revealing how host phylogeny and dietary ecology drive microbial diversity and function. These findings deepen our understanding of host-microbe co-evolution and the critical role of microbiota in shaping animal health and adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

C_LIO_LIGene expression in several plant lines, anthocyanin quantification, bisulfite sequencing, and methylation analyses were used to demonstrate the presence of a single MYB gene responsible for pigment variation. We identified SiMYB2 as the cause of variations in tissue color patterning, and that two RNAs were generated from SiMYB2. SiMYB2-Long was expressed in colored tissues, while SiMYB2-Short was expressed only in non-colored tissues. Functional analyses revealed that SiMYB2-Long is an anthocyanin biosynthesis activator and SiMYB2-Short is non-functional. Exon 3 of SiMYB2 was generated by the insertion of a transposon-like sequence. A mutant lacking the element was obtained from cultivars with non-colored tissues. Anthocyanin content and SiMYB2-Long expression in the mutant were greatly increased compared to wild type.
C_LIO_LIOur results suggest that the white-striped petals of Saintpaulia are not formed by periclinal chimeras but thorough the transcriptional selectivity of epigenetically regulated SiMYB2.

Cardiovascular and renal consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have been studied intensively in high-risk groups, but the consequences of mild infection for the general population, particularly beyond the acute phase of infection, remain unclear. Objective. To examine long-term associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiovascular and kidney disease (CVD, KD) in the general population, with emphasis on age and vaccination status at the time of infection, mild infection, and SARS-CoV-2 variant. Design. Register-based cohort study. Setting. Denmark Participants. All Danish residents with [&ge;]1 PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, March 2020-December 2022. Exposure. Positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcomes. Hazard ratios for 15 CVD outcomes and six KD outcomes, comparing persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and persons who only ever tested negative for infection. Results. The cohort for CVD analyses included 4,508,489 persons without pre-existing CVD (median follow-up 25.2 months/person, interquartile range [IQR] 21.7-27.5 months); 2,698,261 persons (59.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period. The cohort for the KD analyses included 5,150,480 persons without pre-existing KD (median follow-up 25.1 months, IQR 21.7-27.4 months), 2,983,233 (57.9%) of whom tested positive for infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with slight increases in the risks of pulmonary embolism, venous embolism/thrombosis, arrhythmias, chronic renal failure, unspecified renal failure, and other/unspecified KD up to a year after infection; infection was not associated with the other disease groups tested. The strongest associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and CVD and KD were observed among unvaccinated persons and persons infected with earlier (pre-omicron) variants. Conclusions and Relevance. We found little evidence that infection with SARS-CoV-2 was associated with increased long-term risks of CVD or KD in the general population. Increased CVD risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared limited to three outcomes (pulmonary embolism, venous embolism/thrombosis, arrhythmias) and the potential increases in risk were small. Our KD results also suggested that any persistent risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were minimal; however, these findings need to be confirmed in other populations. Most importantly, in a largely vaccinated population, long-term CVD and KD risks differed little for omicron-infected and uninfected persons.","NA","medrxiv",1737065320805

Using single-cell RNA- and ATAC-sequencing, we analyzed mouse hypothalamic and prethalamic development from embryonic day 11 to postnatal day 8, profiling 660,000 cells in total. This identified key transcriptional and chromatin dynamics driving regionalization, neurogenesis, and differentiation. This identified multiple distinct neural progenitor populations, as well as gene regulatory networks that control their spatial and temporal identities, and their terminal differentiation into major neuronal subtypes. Integrating these results with large-scale genome-wide association study data, we identified a central role for transcription factors controlling supramammillary hypothalamic development in a broad range of metabolic and cognitive traits. Recurring cross-repressive regulatory relationships were observed between transcription factors that induced prethalamic and tuberal hypothalamic identity on the one hand and mammillary and supramammillary hypothalamic identity on the other. In postnatal animals, Dlx1/2 was found to severely disrupt GABAergic neuron specification in both the hypothalamus and prethalamus, resulting in a loss of inhibition of thalamic neurons, hypersensitivity to cold, and behavioral hyperactivity. By identifying core gene regulatory networks controlling the specification and differentiation of major hypothalamic and prethalamic neuronal cell types, this study provides a roadmap for future efforts aimed at preventing and treating a broad range of homeostatic and cognitive disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

Effective inhibition of target pathogenicity with blocking approaches, however, is often challenged by target parameters that lead to insufficient occupancy and/or incomplete pharmacology limited by only single site binding. Extracellular targeted protein degradation approaches, such as lysosomal targeting chimeras (LYTACs), offer an opportunity to minimize these challenges by an event-driven mechanism that selectively, thoroughly and irreversibly eliminates drivers of disease. First generation LYTACs, designed to traffic to the lysosome, show limited durability since the therapeutic is degraded along with the target protein of interest. Here we describe cataLYTACs, which overcome this limitation by combining stabilized asialoglycoprotein (ASGPR) ligands, pH-sensitive target binding and recycling via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). These cataLYTACs degraded superstoichiometric levels of a target protein, IgE, in vitro and demonstrated deep and sustained clearance of human IgE in mouse models. In non-human primates, cataLYTACs resulted in >98% clearance of circulating endogenous IgE for 2 weeks and outperformed the standard of care blocking antibody, omalizumab (Xolair(R)), in both free IgE elimination and duration of action. CataLYTACs represent a new therapeutic modality for a wide range of disease states driven by circulating factors, with the potential for superior efficacy and duration of action compared to traditional inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

Yet, mechanical stress can also contribute to the evolution of some pathologies, notably by accelerating pretumoural cell expansion through the process of mechanical cell competition2-5. Mechanical cell competition is a conserved process in which one cell population is preferentially eliminated when mixed with another cell population due to its higher sensitivity to mechanical stress2,3,5-8. Most of the recent theoretical and experimental explorations of mechanical cell competition focused so far on the contribution of growth and pressure to cell elimination and were limited to few genetic contexts, including the activation of Ras in vivo2,8, and the mutation of the polarity gene scribble in mammalian cell culture3,4,9. However, it remains unclear whether other oncogenes can trigger similar mechanisms and whether growth is generally the only central regulator of cell compaction and cell elimination. Using the Drosophila pupal notum (a single layer epithelium), quantitative live imaging and vertex modelling, we revisited the mechanisms contributing to cell compaction and cell elimination during mechanical cell competition. Doing so, we outlined the co-existence of two modes of wild type (WT) cell compaction near oncogenic cells, namely the compaction driven by growth versus local compaction driven by increased tension at tumoural/WT cell interfaces in zones of high curvature (similar to ""Laplace pressure""). We highlighted distinctive signatures in cell deformation and cell elimination distribution that can delineate these two modes of compaction, and we recapitulated them in silico and in vivo using genetic backgrounds affecting growth and/or interfacial tension independently. Altogether, this study reveals for the first time the contribution of interfacial tension-driven compaction to mechanical cell competition and outlines the co-existence of various modes of compaction during cell elimination and pretumoural clone expansion.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

ResultsWe performed genomic profiling of rosettes in two Arabidopsis accessions, Col-0 and Can-0, and assembled their genomes using long reads and chromatin interaction data. We measured gene and protein expression in biological replicates grown in a controlled environment, also measuring CpG methylation, ribosome-associated transcript levels and tRNA abundance. Each omic level is highly reproducible between biological replicates and between accessions despite their 0.5% sequence divergence; the single best predictor of any level in one accession is the corresponding level in the other. Within each accession, gene codon frequencies accurately model both mRNA and protein expression. The effects of a codon on mRNA and protein expression are highly correlated but are unrelated to genome-wide codon frequencies or to tRNA levels which instead match genome-wide amino acid frequencies. Ribosome-associated transcripts closely track mRNA levels.

ConclusionsIn the absence of environmental perturbation, neither methylation, tRNA nor ribosome-associated transcript levels add appreciable information about constitutive protein abundance beyond that in DNA codon frequencies and mRNA expression levels. The impact of constitutive gbM is mostly explained by gene codon composition. tRNA abundance tracks overall amino acid demand. However, genetic differences between accessions associate with differential gbM by inflating differential expression variation. Our data show that the Central Dogma holds only if both sequence and abundance information in mRNA are considered.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

Moreover, differences between systems are defined by a distance that is symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality, enabling downstream analyses such as clustering and nearest-neighbor regression.

While inversions have been found across a large number of taxa, mapping and characterizing inversion breakpoint regions remains challenging, often due to the presence of complex tandem repeats and transposable elements (TEs). Here, we identify and quantify TEs in the breakpoints of the four large-scale inversions previously reported in Atlantic cod, leveraging on three high-quality long-read-based reference genome assemblies for the Norwegian Coastal cod, the Northeast Arctic cod and Celtic cod ecotypes. We detected a significant enrichment of TE orders and superfamilies with terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) within the inversion breakpoints of chromosomes 1, 7 and 12. Notably, we discovered a tandem accumulation of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) belonging to a family of hAT transposons, exclusively residing in the breakpoints of the inverted haplotype on chromosomes 1 and 7 found in the Northeast Arctic cod. The accumulation of tandemly arranged TEs in breakpoint regions suggests that they have driven the appearance of inversions through ectopic recombination, further supporting the potential of TEs in facilitating chromosomal reorganizations with large evolutionary implications.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

By analyzing immune cells and secreted cytokines from 22 different mouse strains, we identified TNF-{beta} as a key T cell-derived cytokine associated with PCOS, regardless of genetic background. We confirmed elevated TNF-{beta} transcripts in immune cells from women with PCOS. Importantly, we used a knockout of TCR to show that functional T cells are a necessary component of driving PCOS features in letrozole-treated female mice. These findings implicate T cells and specifically TNF-{beta} production in the development of PCOS impairments.

While the literature suggests that these pathways cooperate to build the primitive streak, their individual contributions remain poorly understood, largely due to pleiotropic effects observed when key pathway components are knocked out in mouse embryos. In this study, we used gastruloids - a non-integrated stem cell model of mammalian gastrulation - to dissect the roles of Wnt and Nodal signalling. We found that Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling drives a genetic program characteristic of the late primitive streak, promoting the development of posterior body structures in a time and dose-dependent manner. Conversely, Nodal signalling activates a distinct developmental module resembling the early primitive streak. By engineering gastruloids with elevated Nodal signalling, we demonstrate that the decreasing temporal gradient of Nodal activity in the mouse primitive streak likely plays a pivotal role in establishing the anterior body plan, with higher Nodal levels producing more anterior structures in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that rather than cooperating, Nodal and Wnt signalling act antagonistically, initiating distinct developmental modules within the primitive streak. This antagonism is likely the core mechanism driving the early body plan in mammals. Additionally, our results also lead to the suggestion that the gastruloid system models the primitive streak and reveals its self-organizing potential.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

Epithelial tissues contact the external environment and are exposed to various stresses that are potentially deleterious for the epithelial barrier1. However, how focal epithelial barrier defects are detected and repaired to maintain epithelial barrier homeostasis remains poorly understood. We co-cultured ZO-1/ZO-2 double-knockout (DKO) MDCK II cells, which lack tight junctions, with wild-type MDCK II cells, to understand how epithelial cells respond to focal epithelial barrier defects. When co-cultured with wild-type cells, ZO-1/ZO-2 DKO cells were selectively eliminated by induction of apoptosis. The elimination depended on a purse-string-like contraction of supracellular actomyosin cables formed at the clone boundary, regulated by ROCK. Furthermore, Hippo signaling and adherens junctions in the surrounding wild-type cells were required to eliminate ZO-1/ZO-2 DKO cells. These results demonstrate that selective elimination of ZO-1/ZO-2-deficient cells by cell competition regulates epithelial barrier homeostasis.

In briefOtani et al. reveal that epithelial barrier homeostasis is regulated by cell competition-mediated elimination of ZO-1/ZO-2-deficient cells.

While cytoplasmic macromolecular crowding affects multiple cellular processes in single cells, its regulation in living animals remains poorly understood. Using genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles for in vivo rheology, we discovered that C. elegans tissues maintain distinct cytoplasmic biophysical properties that differ from those observed across diverse systems, including bacteria, yeast species, and cultured mammalian cells. We identified two conserved mechanisms controlling cytoplasmic macromolecular diffusion: ribosome concentration, a known regulator of cytoplasmic crowding, works in concert with a previously unknown function for the giant KASH protein ANC-1 scaffolding the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings reveal mechanisms by which tissues establish and maintain distinct cytoplasmic biophysical properties, with implications for understanding cellular organization across species.

A central strategy for genetic adaptation is epigenetic phase variation (ePV) mediated by bacterial DNA methylation, which can regulate gene expression, enhance clonal heterogeneity, and enable a single bacterial strain to exhibit variable phenotypic states. Genome-wide and site-specific ePV have been well characterized in human pathogens antigenic variation and virulence factor production. However, the role of ePV in facilitating adaptation within the human microbiome remains poorly understood. Here, we comprehensively cataloged genome-wide and site-specific ePV in human infant and adult gut microbiomes. First, using long-read metagenomic sequencing, we detected genome-wide ePV mediated by complex structural variations of DNA methyltransferases, highlighting the ones associated with antibiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation. Second, we analyzed an extensive collection of public short-read metagenomic sequencing datasets, uncovering a greater prevalence of genome-wide ePV in the human gut microbiome. Third, we quantitatively detected site-specific ePVs using single-molecule methylation analysis to identify dynamic variations associated with antibiotic treatment or probiotic engraftment. Finally, we performed an in-depth assessment of an Akkermansia muciniphila isolate from an infant, highlighting that ePV can regulate gene expression and enhance the bacterial adaptive capacity by employing a bet-hedging strategy to increase tolerance to differing antibiotics. Our findings indicate that epigenetic modifications are a common and broad strategy used by bacteria in the human gut to adapt to their environment.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

We therefore sought to determine what aspects of neural activity elicited in laboratory tasks are predictive of performance in neuropsychological instruments. We recorded neural activity from intracranial electrodes implanted in human epilepsy patients as they performed laboratory working memory tasks. These patients had completed neuropsychological instruments preoperatively, including the Weschler Adult Intelligent Scale and the Wisconsin Card Sorting test. Our results revealed that increased high-gamma (70-150 Hz) power in the prefrontal and parietal cortex after presentation of visual stimuli to be remembered was indicative of lower performance in the neuropsychological tasks. On the other hand, we observed a positive correlation between high-frequency power amplitude in the delay period of the laboratory tasks and neuropsychological performance. Our results demonstrate how neural activity around task events relates to executive function and may be associated with clinical diagnosis of specific cognitive deficits.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

Among 3,685 mutations detected at baseline (VAF [&ge;] 0.5%), 50% progressed to CHIP (VAF [&ge;] 2%) at follow-up. We confirmed that clonal expansion is highly dependent on initial clone size and CHIP driver gene, with SF3B1 and JAK2 mutations exhibiting the fastest growth rate. We identified germline variants in TERT, IL6R, TCL1A, and MSI2 that modulate clonal expansion rate. Measured baseline leukocyte telomere length showed differential effects on incident CHIP risk, with shorter baseline leukocyte telomere length predisposing to incident PPM1D mutations and longer baseline leukocyte telomere length favoring incident DNMT3A mutations. We discovered that the IL6R missense variant p.Asp358Ala specifically impairs TET2 clonal expansion, supported by direct measurements of soluble interleukin-6 receptor and interleukin-6.

While functional analysis has been instrumental in characterizing TUS effects, understanding the underlying mechanisms remains a challenge. Here, we developed a whole-brain model to represent functional changes as measured by fMRI, enabling us to investigate how TUS-induced effects propagate throughout the brain with increasing stimulus intensity. We implemented two mechanisms: one based on anatomical distance and another on broadcasting dynamics, to explore plasticity-driven changes in specific brain regions. Finally, we highlighted the role of higher-order functional interactions in localizing spatial effects of off-line TUS at two target areas--the right thalamus and inferior frontal cortex--revealing distinct patterns of functional reorganization.

Allele frequency clines along environmental gradients, known as genotype-environment associations (GEA), are often used to detect potential loci causing local adaptation, but GEA are rarely followed by experimental validation. Here, we tested loci identified in three different moisture-related GEA studies on Arabidopsis. We studied 44 GEA-identified genes using t-DNA knockout lines under drought and tested for effects on flowering time, an adaptive trait, and genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions on performance and fitness. We found that wrky38 mutants had significant GxE effects for fitness; lsd1 plants had a significant GxE effect for flowering time, while 11 genes showed flowering time effects with no drought interaction. However, most GEA candidates did not exhibit GxE. In the follow-up experiments we found wrky38 caused decreased stomatal conductance and specific leaf area under drought, indicating potentially adaptive drought avoidance. Additionally, we found that GEA identified natural putative LoF variants of WRKY38 associated with dry environments, as well as alleles associated with variation in LSD1 expression. While only a few GEA putative drought-adapted genes were validated for GxE interactions for fitness under drought, we likely overlooked some genes because experiments might not well represent natural environments and t-DNA insertions might not well represent natural alleles. Nevertheless, GEAs apparently identified some genes contributing to local adaptation. GEA and follow-up experiments are straightforward to implement in model systems and thus demonstrate prospects for GEA discovery of new local adaptations.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

To better constrain one set of microbe-metabolite interactions, we cultured the marine gammaproteobacterium Alteromonas macleodii MIT1002 on a range of compounds excreted by a sympatric cyanobacterium, Prochlorococcus. Alteromonas could assimilate the branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, as well as 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid (a branched chain ketoacid intermediate of valine metabolism), but not thymidine, kynurenine, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, or the other branched chain ketoacids. The assimilation of branched chain amino acids indicates that Alteromonas can metabolically process each corresponding ketoacid, suggesting that transporter specificity underlies the observed substrate specificity for 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid. These experiments show that even subtle changes in chemical structure can result in different microbial interactions and different fates for dissolved metabolites.

Significance StatementMicrobial interactions with dissolved organic matter are important controls on the marine carbon cycle. Dissolved organic matter is often considered in bulk, which leaves the specificity and nature of these interactions poorly constrained.

This implies that small changes in this pool of carbon could have large impacts for the overall system function, and that measuring this pool of carbon with molecular-level resolution is important to characterizing microbe-molecule interactions.

How both DNA ends, and the sister chromatid are held in close proximity during HR is unknown. Here we demonstrate that the PST repeat region of MDC1 is a mutlivalent nucleosome binding domain, sufficient to tether chromatin in multiple contexts. In mitotic cells the affinity of the PST repeats for chromatin is downregulated by phosphorylation to prevent chromosome missegregation, while still contributing to DNA break tethering by the MDC1-TOPBP1-CIP2A complex. In interphase, the PST repeat region is critical for RAD51 focus formation but not the recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA breaks, consistent with a chromatin tethering function.

While antibody titers incrementally increased and stabilized with each booster, T cell responses rapidly plateaued, maintaining remarkable stability across CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Notably, approximately 30% of participants showed CD4+ T cell reactivity to non-Spike antigens, consistent with asymptomatic infections.

The virus distinguishes itself by the ability to replicate to high titers and transmit efficiently in a wide variety of hosts in diverse climatic environments. Fortunately, transmission to and between humans is scarce. Yet, if such an event were to occur, it could spark a pandemic as humans are immunologically naive to H5 viruses. A significant determinant of transmission to and between humans is the ability of the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein to shift from an avian-type to a human-type receptor specificity.

Forty healthy participants were presented with unimodal (Auditory, Visual, Tactile) and bimodal (Audio-Tactile, Audio-Visual, Visuo-Tactile) stimuli while their respiratory activity was recorded. Results revealed that reaction times systematically varied with respiration, with faster responses during peak inspiration and early expiration but slower responses during the expiration-to-inspiration transition. Applying the race model inequality approach to quantify multisensory integration, we found that Audio-Tactile and Audio-Visual stimuli exhibited the highest integration during the expiration-to-inspiration phase. These findings conceivably reflect respiration phase-locked changes in cortical excitability which in turn, orchestrates multisensory integration. Interestingly, participants also tended to adapt their respiratory cycles, aligning response onsets preferentially with early expiration. This suggests that, rather than a mere bottom-up mechanism, respiration is actively adjusted to maximise the signal-to-noise balance between interoceptive and exteroceptive signals.","NA","biorxiv",1737065320805

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1737065320805

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1737065320805
