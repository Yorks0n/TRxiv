Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: In this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n=204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC). Results: Plasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma. Conclusion: These findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

Attention can also be seen as a solution to the binding problem: concurrent attention to all parts of an entity allows separating it from the rest. However, the rich models of attention in computational neuroscience are generally not scaled to real-world problems and there are thus many behavioral and neural phenomena that current models cannot explain. Here, we propose a bidirectional recurrent model of attention that is inspired by modern neural networks for image segmentation. It conceptualizes recurrent connections as a multi-stage internal gating process where bottom-up connections transmit features, while top-down and lateral connections transmit attentional gating signals. Our model can recognize and segment simple stimuli such as digits as well as objects in natural images and is able to be prompted with object labels, attributes or locations. It can learn to perform a range of behavioral findings, such as object binding, selective attention, inhibition of return, and visual search. It also replicates a variety of neural findings, including increased activity for attended objects, features, and locations, attention-invariant tuning, and relatively late onset attention. Most importantly, our proposed model unifies decades of cognitive and neurophysiological findings of visual attention into a single principled architecture. Our results highlight that the ability to selectively and dynamically focus on specific parts of stimulus streams can help artificial neural networks to better generalize and align with human brains.","NA","biorxiv",1726178963236

However, the impact of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 transmission is far less well-characterized, and has major implications for public health, because it informs the indirect effects of vaccination in addition to its direct effects. Analysing the effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on transmission is challenging, because they must be considered in tandem with the time-varying reproduction number (Rt), while also accounting for regional variability, for example due to the presence of more transmissible variants.

MethodsWe fitted a Bayesian hierarchical model to previously obtained estimates of Rt to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination with one, two and three doses on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK during 2021. Vaccine effectiveness is defined as the proportional reduction in the time-varying reproduction number Rt. The model accounts for transmission at national and Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA)-level, and uses vaccination data provided by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), detailing the LTLA-specific proportions of people who have received doses one, two and three. The model also incorporates data on the proportion of wild-type, Alpha and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants over time in each LTLA, obtained from UKHSA and the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium.

ResultsWe find that vaccination had moderate-to-large effectiveness against transmission for dose 1 (39.30%, 95% CrI 26.64% - 48.07%), and for dose 3 (48.69%, 95% CrI 27.97% - 71.30%), but negligible effects on dose 2, likely attributable to the coincident importation and dominance of the Delta variant in the UK. Nationally, our model fitted the previously estimated values of time-series of Rt values well, largely reproducing the reproduction number averaged across LTLAs for each timepoint. This lends support to our hypothesis that the extent of vaccination (or lack thereof) was a major determinant of transmission intensity. Our model fits further reproduced well the reproduction numbers at regional level, although outliers were less well captured, implying some degree of variation that is not explained by our model.

ConclusionsTo our knowledge, our analysis is the first evidence of the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination against its transmission at population level. We find that vaccination is an effective tool for the control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, in addition to its well-documented effects on disease burden and mortality. Our results allow future assessment of the impact of vaccination accounting for several circulating variants and sociodemographic factors.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

When self-testing policies are in place a decreased sensitivity of the virus to RDTs can give benefits for viral spread. However, to monitor for reduced sensitivity of RDTs we rely on the collection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from RDT negative patients. Infectieradar, a national participatory surveillance that registers influenza-like symptoms is used as a framework to study false-negative RDT results due to emergence of new virus variants.

MethodsParticipants report weekly on RDT use and symptoms linked to Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI). Each week, all RDT positive and a sample of 200 among RDT negative but symptomatic participants were invited to send in nose throat swabs (NTS). SARS-CoV-2 Ct-values are determined using RT-PCR on NTS samples for RDT positive and RDT (false) negative participants and compared. Sequencing is performed on all eligible samples for phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and the whole genome sequence. NTS samples of participants with discordant RT-PCR and RDT results are also analyzed using RDTs by professionals in the laboratory.

ResultsBetween October 2022 and October 2023, our study had 16,893 participants and we collected 1,757 self-test-positive/NTS PCR positive samples and 359 self-test-negative/NTS PCR positive samples (RDT-/PCR+). These participants were asked to take a SARS-CoV-2 RDT upon symptoms. Within SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive participants, we did not find characteristics that differ in SARS-CoV-2 RDT negative versus positive participants. There were no associations with specific changes in the N protein nor did our phylogenetic analysis show clustering of RDT negative samples.

ConclusionEvaluating brand-specific RDT performance in Dutch population and false-negative RDT analyses, led to no evidence for SARS-CoV-2 evolution affecting RDT sensitivity. The participatory surveillance program Infectieradar is a powerful tool for our national surveillance on acute respiratory illnesses, as well as for research purposes. Since this framework offered both self-testing and the gold standard of PCR testing results.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

DesignRetrospective cross-sectional study.

Participants5,351 patients (9,564 eyes) who underwent macular OCT imaging and Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) tests (24-2 or 10-2 test patterns) at a university hospital from 2006 to 2023. The dataset included 47,653 paired OCT-VF data points, including various ocular conditions.

MethodsWe trained a segmentation-free 3DCNN model based on the EfficientNet3D-b0 architecture on a comprehensive OCT dataset to estimate VF. We evaluated the models performance using Pearsons correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. We assessed residual variability using a jackknife resampling approach and compared OCT-VF and HFA datasets using generalized estimating equations (GEE), adjusting the number of VF tests, follow-up duration, age, and clustering by eye and patient.

Main Outcome MeasuresCorrelations between estimated and measured VF thresholds and mean deviations (MDs), and residual variability of OCT-VF and HFA.

ResultsWe observed strong correlations between the estimated and measured VF parameters (Pearsons r: 24-2 thresholds 0.893, MD 0.932; 10-2 thresholds 0.902, MD 0.945; all p < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between the estimated and measured MD, with a slight proportional bias. GEE analysis demonstrated significantly lower residual variability for OCT-VF than for HFA (24-2 thresholds: 1.10 vs. 2.48 dB; 10-2 thresholds: 1.20 vs. 2.48 dB; all p < 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected), with lower variability across all test points, severities, and ages, thus highlighting the robustness of the segmentation-free 3DCNN approach in a heterogeneous clinical sample.

ConclusionsA segmentation-free 3DCNN model objectively estimated VF from OCT images with high accuracy and significantly lower residual variability than subjective HFA measurements in a heterogeneous clinical sample, including patients with glaucoma and individuals with other ocular diseases. The improved reliability, lower variability, and objective nature of OCT-VF highlight its value for enhancing VF assessment and monitoring of various ocular conditions, potentially facilitating earlier detection of progression and more efficient disease management.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

These predictions are commonly performed using polygenic scores computed with DNA information from ancient humans along with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from present-day humans. However, numerous evolutionary processes could impact the prediction of phenotypes from ancient humans based on polygenic scores. In this work we investigate how natural selection impacts phenotypic predictions on ancient individuals using polygenic scores. We use simulations of an additive trait to analyze how natural selection impacts phenotypic predictions with polygenic scores. We simulate a trait evolving under neutrality, stabilizing selection and directional selection. We find that stabilizing and directional selection have contrasting effects on ancient phenotypic predictions. Stabilizing selection accelerates the loss of large-effect alleles contributing to trait variation. Conversely, directional selection accelerates the loss of small and large-effect alleles that drive individuals farther away from the optimal phenotypic value. These effects result in specific shared genetic variation patterns between ancient and modern populations which hamper the accuracy of polygenic scores to predict phenotypes. Furthermore, we conducted simulations that include realistic strengths of stabilizing selection and heritability estimates to show how natural selection could impact the predictive accuracy of ancient polygenic scores for two widely studied traits: height and body mass index. We emphasize the importance of considering how natural selection can decrease the reliability of ancient polygenic scores to perform phenotypic predictions on an ancient population.","NA","biorxiv",1726178963236

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of COVID-19 articles that had corrections made and reported in the NYT ""corrections page"". We categorized authors in a NYT COVID-19 article as a NYT reporter, NYT other, or independent author. We calculated the number and type of corrections by author type (NYT reporter, NYT other, and independent author) and number and percentage of corrections indicating an over- or under-statement of the COVID-19 situation.

ResultsThere were 576 total corrections for the included 486 articles. Forty-three percent (n=245) corrections specifically pertained to COVID-19. Compared to corrections not pertaining to COVID-19, corrections pertaining to COVID-19 were less likely to be about spelling (0% vs 23.6%), locations (1.2% vs 16.3%), or title/degree (0% vs 10.6%), and more likely to be about a vaccine/vaccination (21.2% vs 0.3%), incidence/cases of conditions (12.2% vs 0.3%), or disease testing (7.8% vs 0.3%; p<0.001).

Compared to corrections not pertaining to COVID-19, corrections pertaining to COVID-19 were less likely to result in an equivocal tone (16.7% vs 88.8%), but they were more likely to both overstate (54.7% vs 8.5%) and understate (23.7% vs 2.4%) the situation in the original text (p<0.001). Ten reporters (of 346) accounted for 24% of the corrections. The reporter with the single most corrections accounted for 7% of the corrections.

MethodsWe collected both symptom data and nose- and throat samples from symptomatic people during the 2022/2023 respiratory season in a large participatory surveillance study in the Netherlands, and tested these for 18 respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2. We compared reported health status, symptoms and odds of having a mono respiratory viral infection or co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and another respiratory virus.

ResultsIn total 4,655 samples were included with 22% (n=1,017) testing SARS-CoV-2 positive. Of these 11% (n=116) also tested positive for a second respiratory virus. The most frequently occurring co-infections in SARS-CoV-2 positive participants were with rhinovirus (59%; n=69), seasonal coronaviruses (15%; n=17) and adenovirus (7%; n=8). Participants with a co-infection with one of these three viruses did not report more severe disease compared to those with a SARS-CoV-2 mono-infection. The odds of experiencing SARS-CoV-2 co-infection with seasonal coronavirus or rhinovirus were lower compared to the odds of the respective non-SARS-CoV-2 mono-infection (OR: 0.16, CI 95%: 0.10 - 0.24; OR: 0.21 CI 95%: 0.17 - 0.26; respectively).

Presently, brain tumours are routinely classified based on their epigenetic signatures, leading to a paradigm shift in diagnostic pathways. Such testing can be performed so rapidly using nanopore sequencing that results can be provided intraoperatively. This information greatly improves upon the fidelity of smear diagnosis and can help surgeons tailor their approach, balancing the risks of surgery with the likely benefit. Nevertheless, full integrated diagnosis may require subsequent additional assays to detect pathognomonic somatic mutations and structural variants, thereby delaying the time to final diagnosis. Methods Here, we present ROBIN, a tool based upon PromethION nanopore sequencing technology that can provide both real-time, intraoperative methylome classification and next-day comprehensive molecular profiling within a single assay. ROBIN uniquely integrates three methylation classifiers to improve diagnostic performance in the intraoperative setting. Findings We demonstrate classifier performance on 50 prospective intraoperative cases, achieving a diagnostic turnaround time under 2 hours and generating robust tumour classifications within minutes of sequencing. Furthermore, ROBIN can detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variants (CNVs) and structural variants (SVs) in real-time, and is able to inform a complete integrated diagnosis within 24 hours. Classifier performance demonstrated concordance with final integrated diagnosis in 90% of prospective cases.

However, only a limited number of clade I MPXV genomes have been characterized so far, from a limited number of regions.

MethodsWe conducted whole genome sequencing of 603 mpox-positive samples that were collected from 581 patients between 2018-2024 in 17 of the 26 provinces of the DRC.

ResultsGenome coverage was at least 70% for 429/603 (71.1%) samples and near full-length MPXV genomes (>90% coverage) were obtained for 348/603 (57.7%) samples from 337 patients. All newly generated MPXV sequences belonged to clade I, among which 17 were clade Ib strains, all from patients infected in 2024 in the South-Kivu province. The large majority (>95%) of the new strains fall within previously described clade Ia groups and potential new groups have also been observed. The low number of APOBEC3 mutations found among clade Ia suggests that most human mpox cases are probably linked to zoonotic transmissions. Genetically diverse MPXV lineages co-circulate in small geographic areas during the same outbreak suggesting multiple zoonotic introductions over a short period from one or multiple reservoir species. Recent identification of mpox cases in Kinshasa shows that multiple lineages circulate in a large urban center, indicating separate introduction events.

ConclusionThe mpox epidemic in the DRC exhibits two distinct patterns. In traditional endemic regions, the epidemic is predominated by zoonotic spill-over events involving clade Ia. Conversely, in the eastern part of the country, the clade Ib outbreak is driven by human-to-human transmission highlighting the need for a coordinated response effort at the national, regional and international levels.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

Here, we demonstrate that the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi is capable of reversal from mature lobate to early cydippid when fed following a period of stress. Our findings illuminate central aspects of ctenophore development, ecology, and evolution, and show the high potential of M. leidyi as a new model system to study reverse development and rejuvenation.

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1726178963236

Recently, combining cryoET with subtomogram averaging has pushed the resolution to 3-4 A. However, one main challenge for cryoET is locating target proteins in live cells. Conventional methods such as fluorescent protein tagging and immunogold labeling are not entirely suitable to label small structures in live cells with molecular resolution in vitrified samples. If large proteins, which can be visually identified in cryoET, are directly linked to the target protein, the large tag may alter the target protein structure, localization and function. To address this challenge, we used the rapamycin-induced oligomer formation system, which involves two tags (FKBP and FRB) that can bind together within rapamycin. In our system, the FKBP tag is linked to target protein and the FRB tag is linked to a large protein to create a marker. We chose ferritin as the marker protein because it is a large complex (10-12 nm) and can bind iron to create strong contrast in cryoET. After adding rapamycin to the cell medium, the iron-loaded ferritin accurately indicates the location of the target protein. Recently, in-situ cryoET with subtomogram averaging has been rapidly developing. However, it is still challenging to locate target proteins in live cells, and this method provides a much-needed solution.","NA","biorxiv",1726178963236

DWV infects bees at all life stages, but is most noticeable in adult bees, where clinical symptoms include shriveled, non-functional wings, and a drastically shortened lifespan. DWV is recorded in upwards of 90% of honey bee colonies worldwide, and has been linked to colony loss in symptomatic hives. DWV is primarily spread by Varroa destructor mites, who feed on the fat bodies of honey bee adults and pupae. There is currently no direct treatment or preventative for DWV, with the primary method of reduction being vector control using acaracides. In this study, we tested the effect that vaccinating honey bee queens using killed Paenibacillus larvae bacterin, the causative agent of the honey bee disease American Foulbrood, had on deformed wing virus load in honey bee colonies. We placed vaccinated queens in 200 honey bee colonies, and unvaccinated queens in 200 colonies, and measured quantities of DWV-B in both groups immediately before, and 4 months after vaccination. We found that levels of DWV-B were identical before vaccination, but were significantly reduced in colonies 4 months post vaccination. This change was found despite no difference in mite quantities between groups. Overall, these data provide evidence that vaccination of queens with P. larvae bacterin is an effective method for reduction of DWV-B quantities in honey bee colonies in a commercially relevant field setting.","NA","biorxiv",1726178963236

Synthetic genetic constructs compete with a host cells native genes for expression resources, burdening the cell and impairing its growth. This creates a selective pressure favouring mutations which alleviate this growth defect by removing synthetic gene expression. Non-functional mutants thus spread in cell populations, eventually making them lose engineered functions. Past work has attempted to limit mutation spread by coupling synthetic gene expression to survival. However, these approaches are highly context-dependent and must be tailor-made for each particular synthetic gene circuit to be retained.

In contrast, we develop and analyse a biomolecular controller which depresses mutant cell growth independently of the mutated synthetic genes identity. Modelling shows how our design can be deployed alongside various synthetic circuits without any re-engineering of its genetic components, outperforming extant gene-specific mutation spread mitigation strategies. Our controllers performance is evaluated using a novel simulation approach which leverages resource-aware cell modelling to directly link a circuits design parameters to its population-level behaviour.

Our designs adaptability promises to mitigate mutation spread in an expanded range of applications, whilst our analyses provide a blueprint for using resource-aware cell models in circuit design.","NA","biorxiv",1726178963236

In addition, individual European countries developed their own risk classifications for severe COVID-19 to select individuals recommended for annual COVID-19 vaccination. We assessed the discordance between the European and respective national medical risk classifications in assigning children and adults to risk groups for developing severe COVID-19 in populations of the Netherlands and Norway.

MethodsThis multi-country, healthcare data-linkage study covered 17.4 million inhabitants of the Netherlands and 5.6 million inhabitants of Norway by 1 January 2020. Medical conditions were defined based on ICD-10 hospital discharge codes in the European and Dutch classifications, and on ICD-10 and ICPC-2 primary care codes in the Norwegian classification. Subjects were classified as high-, moderate-, or low-risk. Discordance was calculated as the proportion of the population with a different risk status in the respective national compared to the European classification.

FindingsThe overall discordance between European and national risk classification was 12.0% in the Dutch and 13.8% in the Norwegian population. The European classification assigns more individuals to high-risk (9.0% and 9.2% of the Dutch and Norwegian populations, respectively) than the national classifications (1.5% and 3.0%, respectively). National classifications define more individuals as moderate-risk (11.3% and 12.7%, respectively) than the European classification (1.0% and 1.3%, respectively). Classification discordances most frequently involved subjects with cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and diabetes mellitus.

InterpretationThe European classification defines a substantially larger percentage of the population as high-risk for severe COVID-19 than the national classifications. This may have implications for post-pandemic vaccination programs. Further research should assess to what extent the medical conditions responsible for the classification discordances determine the risk of developing severe COVID-19.

This search identified 64 studies, but none of them assessed the impact of different medical risk classifications for severe COVID-19 or compared them across countries or to the European classification.

Added value of this studyTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that compared the impact of European and national medical risk classifications for severe COVID-19 by assigning the populations of the Netherlands and Norway to medical risk groups using national healthcare registries. We demonstrated important discrepancies between the European and respective national schemes in classifying high- and moderate-risk individuals in both countries. The chronic conditions responsible for the classification discordances were lung disease, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and hypertension.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur comparative analysis suggests that the choice between the European and national classifications may have important consequences for public health interventions such as vaccination campaigns. The variability in risk assignment based on chronic medical conditions underscores the absence of an international uniform approach. More research is needed to determine the extent to which each chronic medical condition impacts COVID-19 severity in the post-pandemic period, facilitating the refinement of risk classifications and supporting targeted public health interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

In these non-recombining regions, recessive deleterious mutations are expected to occur, as i) they are predicted to accumulate as a result of lower efficacy of selection, and ii) they may even pre-exist and drive the evolution of recombination suppression. Multiple genomic analyses have indirectly inferred the presence of deleterious mutations in sex and mating-type chromosomes, but direct experimental evidence remains scarce. Here, we performed fitness assays in fungi with megabase-large and young non-recombining regions around the mating-type locus, using the Schizothecium tetrasporum and Podospora anserina species complexes, to test whether heterokaryons (diploid-like, heterozygous at the mating-type locus) exhibited a fitness advantage over homokaryons (haploid-like, with a single mating-type allele), in terms of spore germination dynamics or mycelium growth speed, under different conditions of light and temperature. We found a faster growth of heterokaryons compared to one of the homokaryons for P. anserina at 18 C, for S. tetrasporum and S. tritetrasporum at 22 C under light, and also at 22 C in the dark for S. tetrasporum. These findings suggest the presence of a sheltered load, i.e. recessive deleterious mutations at the heterozygous state in or near non-recombining regions, as these species are highly homozygous otherwise. Leveraging on the experimental assets of fungi, allowing cultivating separately haploid-like and diploid-like life stages, our experiments provided one of the rare direct experimental evidence of sheltered load around mating-compatibility loci, which is crucial for our understanding of sex-related chromosome evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1726178963236

Therefore, there is a need to quantify any damage that microelectrodes sustain when they are chronically implanted in the human cortex.

MethodsUsing scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we imaged 980 microelectrodes from Neuroport arrays chronically implanted in the cortex of three people with tetraplegia for 956-2246 days. We analyzed eleven multi-electrode arrays in total: eight arrays with platinum (Pt) electrode tips and three with sputtered iridium oxide tips (SIROF); one Pt array was left in sterile packaging, serving as a control. The arrays were implanted/explanted across three different clinical sites surgeries (Caltech/UCLA, Caltech/USC and APL/Johns Hopkins) in the anterior intraparietal area, Brodmanns area 5, motor cortex, and somatosensory cortex.

Human experts rated the electron micrographs of electrodes with respect to five damage metrics: the loss of metal at the electrode tip, the amount of separation between the silicon shank and tip metal, tissue adherence or bio-material to the electrode, damage to the shank insulation and silicone shaft. These metrics were compared to functional outcomes (recording quality, noise, impedance and stimulation ability).

ResultsDespite higher levels of physical degradation, SIROF electrodes were twice as likely to record neural activity than Pt electrodes (measured by SNR), at the time of explant. Additionally, 1 kHz impedance (measured in vivo prior to explant) significantly correlated with all physical damage metrics, recording, and stimulation performance for SIROF electrodes (but not Pt), suggesting a reliable measurement of in vivo degradation.

We observed a new degradation type, primarily occurring on stimulated electrodes (""pockmarked"" vs ""cracked"") electrodes; however, tip metalization damage was not significantly higher due to stimulation or amount of charge. Physical damage was centralized to specific regions of an array often with differences between outer and inner electrodes. This is consistent with degradation due to contact with the biologic milieu, influenced by variations in initial manufactured state. From our data, we hypothesize that erosion of the silicon shank often precedes damage to the tip metal, accelerating damage to the electrode / tissue interface.

ConclusionsThese findings link quantitative measurements, such as impedance, to the physical condition of the microelectrodes and their capacity to record and stimulate. These data could lead to improved manufacturing or novel electrode designs to improve long-term performance of BMIs making them are vitally important as multi-year clinical trials of BMIs are becoming more common.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

Here, we use a highly resolved dataset of 821 DOM samples covering the surface waters to the deep Atlantic, Southern, and Pacific oceans to examine molecular-level responses to warming water temperatures, i.e. their thermal responses. In general, the strength and diversity of thermal responses among individual molecules both decline towards the deep waters, but they show decreasing and increasing trends with more recalcitrant molecules in concentration, respectively. Their contrasting trends concur with the more important role of photochemical processes in explaining the diversity of thermal responses than the strength. By projecting global ocean thermal responses from 1950-2020, we predict increases in the diversity are unexpectedly largest at deeper depths (> 1,000 m). Such increases could elevate recalcitrant deep-ocean carbon sink by approximately 10 Tg C yr-1 which accounts for > 5% of the carbon flux survived to the deep ocean. Our findings highlight the importance of photochemical legacies in driving DOM thermal responses and further help predict the future oceanic carbon sink under global change.","NA","biorxiv",1726178963236

However, the prevalence of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs among Japanese has remained unclear. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and correlates of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs in Japan using a nationwide survey of 28,175 residents aged 16-81 years old.

MethodsA nationally representative, cross-sectional self-administered survey was conducted from September to October 2021. To assess the number of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, we used three questions from the Oxford Coronavirus Explanations, Attitudes, and Narratives Survey. Independent variables included general vaccine conspiracy beliefs, sociodemographic variables, information sources for COVID-19, trust in authorities, and fear of COVID-19.

ResultsAfter applying sampling weights and imputation, the estimated prevalence of holding at least one COVID-19 conspiracy belief was 24.4%. From a linear regression model, several factors were independently associated with conspiracy beliefs. Notably, people with the lowest level of education (lower secondary school) endorsed fewer COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs (B -0.089, vs. upper secondary school). Furthermore, higher socioeconomic backgrounds-such as higher income, higher wealth, and regular employment-were associated with endorsing conspiracy beliefs. Additionally, only 37.3% of respondents trusted the government of Japan, but paradoxically, trust in the government was positively associated with conspiracy beliefs (B 0.175, vs. distrust).

ConclusionsConspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 were prevalent in about a quarter of the Japanese population. Certain groups are more likely to endorse conspiracy beliefs, and targeting interventions towards these groups might be efficient in stemming the spread of conspiracy beliefs.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

Methods Diagnostic accuracy of both platforms was evaluated using 53 upper-respiratory swabs (URS) and 32 skin lesions swabs (SS) collected from mpox and COVID-19 patients in the UK against the Sansure (Sansure Biotech Inc.) and the CDC reference qPCR tests. The analytical sensitivity of both platforms was assessed using a viral isolate from the lineage II, B.1. Results The limit of detection was 1x101 pfu/ml for both tests. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert Mpox was 97.67% [95% CI 87.71-99.94%] and 88.57% [95% CI 73.26-96.80%] and 97.44% [95% CI 86.52-99.94%] and 74.42% [95% CI 58.83-86.48%] comparing the Sansure and CDC qPCR, respectively and for the M10 MPX/OPX was 87.80% [95% CI 73.80-95.92%] and 76.60% [95% CI 61.97-87.70%] and 94.29% [95% CI 80.84-99.30%] and 86.67% [95% CI 73.21-94.95%] with the Sansure and CDC qPCR. Conclusion The Xpert Mpox had good diagnostic accuracy for both sample types while the M10 MPX/OPX clinical accuracy was deficient with URS. Our data supports the use of URS during the first 3 days of symptoms onset for mpox diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

This is postulated to be due to delayed circadian timing increasing the likelihood of circadian misalignment in an early-oriented society. Circadian misalignment is known to heighten sleep inertia, the difficulty transitioning from sleep to wake characterized by low arousal and cognitive impairment, and evening chronotypes experience greater sleep inertia. Therefore, difficulty awakening may explain the relationship between evening chronotype and psychiatric disorders by acting as a biomarker of circadian misalignment. In analyzing the longitudinal incidence of psychiatric disorders in the UK Biobank (n = 496,820), we found that evening chronotype predicted increased incidence of major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, generalized anxiety disorder and bipolar disorder. Crucially, this effect was dependent on sleep inertia, which was a much stronger predictor of these disorders, such that evening types without sleep inertia were at no higher risk as compared to morning types. Longitudinal analyses of suicide and depressed mood (CES-D score) in the Older Finnish Twin Cohort (n = 23,854) replicated this pattern of results. Twin and genome-wide association analyses of difficulty awakening identified the trait to be heritable (Twin H2 = 0.40; SNP h2 = 0.08), enriched for circadian rhythms genes and have substantial shared genetic architecture with chronotype. Marginal and conditional Mendelian randomization analyses mirrored the epidemiological results, such that the causal effect of evening chronotype on psychiatric disorders was driven by shared genetic architecture with difficulty awakening. In contrast, difficult awakening was strongly causally associated with psychiatric disorders independently of chronotype. Psychiatric disorders were only weakly reverse causally linked to difficult awakening. Collectively, these results challenge the notion that evening chronotype is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders per se, suggesting instead that evening types are at greater risk for psychiatric disorders due to circadian misalignment, for which sleep inertia may be acting as a biomarker.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

In resource-constrained settings, such as Northeastern Nigeria, dementia management is challenged by delayed diagnosis and limited specialist care. This study evaluates the burden of dementia and its management at the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital Maiduguri (FNHM), the only neuropsychiatric facility in Northeastern Nigeria. The study aims to provide insights into current dementia trends and practices and identify key areas for improvement.

MethodsA retrospective analysis of patient records at FNPH Maiduguri was conducted, including patients aged 60 and above diagnosed with dementia between 1999 and 2023. Data on patient demographics, dementia subtypes, comorbidities, symptoms, diagnostic investigations, and treatment modalities were analysed.

ResultsThe Available record from the hospital health records register showed that the total number of diagnosed cases of dementia in the FNHM is 1,216 cases with a male predominance (56%). Alzheimers disease was the most common subtype (60.5%), followed by vascular dementia (24.5%). Hypertension was the most frequently reported comorbidity (41.6%). Cognitive symptoms, particularly memory loss, were reported in all cases, while behavioural symptoms, such as agitation and hallucinations, were reported in some cases. The most commonly administered treatments included cognitive enhancers (donepezil), supplements (gingko biloba), and non-drug therapies (psychoeducation). However, 70.9% of patients were lost to follow-up, highlighting a critical gap in long-term care.

ConclusionThe increasing burden of dementia at the only neuropsychiatric facility in Northeastern Nigeria highlights the urgent need for investments and targeted interventions. Enhancing patient engagement, strengthening follow-up systems, and expanding diagnostic and treatment capacities will improve care outcomes and address the growing demands for dementia management in this underserved region.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

In these patients, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is immunomodulatory, however increased infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs) may limit the antitumor immune effects of ADT. We designed a neoadjuvant clinical trial to test whether BMS-986218, a next-generation non-fucosylated anti-CTLA-4 antibody engineered for enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis (ADCC/P), depletes intratumoral Tregs and augments the response to ADT. In this single-center, two-arm, open-label study, 24 men with high-risk localized prostate cancer were randomized to receive a single dose of ADT with or without two pre-operative doses of BMS-986218 (anti-CTLA4-NF) prior to radical prostatectomy. Treatment was well tolerated and feasible in the neoadjuvant setting. A secondary clinical outcome was the rate of disease recurrence, which was lower than predicted in both arms. Mechanistically, anti-CTLA4-NF reduced ADT-induced Treg accumulation through engagement of CD16a/FCGR3A on tumor macrophages, and depth of Treg depletion was quantitatively associated with clinical outcome. Increased intratumoral dendritic cell (DC) frequencies also associated with lack of recurrence, and pre-clinical data suggest ADCC/P-competent anti-CTLA-4 antibodies elicit activation and expansion of tumor DCs. Patients receiving anti-CTLA4-NF also exhibited phenotypic signatures of enhanced antitumor T cell priming. In total, this study provides the first-in-human evidence of Treg depletion by glycoengineered antibodies targeting CTLA-4 in humans and their potential in combination with ADT in prostate cancer patients with high-risk of recurrence.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

However, prior studies are largely limited to European ancestry populations and differential risk by sex and ancestry has not been widely evaluated. We utilized a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach to explore APOE- associated phenotypes in the All of Us Research Program.

MethodsWe determined APOE alleles for 181,880 All of Us participants with whole genome sequencing and electronic health record (EHR) data, representing seven gnomAD ancestry groups. We tested association of APOE variants, ordered based on Alzheimers disease risk hierarchy ({varepsilon}2/{varepsilon}2<{varepsilon}2/{varepsilon}3<{varepsilon}3/{varepsilon}3<{varepsilon}2/{varepsilon}4<{varepsilon}3/{varepsilon}4<{varepsilon}4/{varepsilon}4), with 2,318 EHR-derived phenotypes. Bonferroni-adjusted analyses were performed overall, by ancestry, by sex, and with adjustment for social determinants of health (SDOH).

FindingsIn the overall cohort, PheWAS identified 17 significant associations, including an increased odds of hyperlipidemia (OR 1.15 [1.14-1.16] per APOE genotype group; P=1.8x10-129), dementia, and Alzheimers disease (OR 1.55 [1.40-1.70]; P=5x10-19), and a reduced odds of fatty liver disease (OR 0.93 [0.90-0.95]; P=1.6x10-9) and chronic liver disease. ORs were similar after SDOH adjustment and by sex, except for an increased number of cardiovascular associations in males, and decreased odds of noninflammatory disorders of vulva and perineum in females (OR 0.89 [0.84-0.94]; P=1.1x10-5). Significant heterogeneity was observed for hyperlipidemia and mild cognitive impairment across ancestry. Unique associations by ancestry included transient retinal arterial occlusion in the European ancestry group, and first-degree atrioventricular block in the American Admixed/Latino ancestry group.

InterpretationWe replicate extensive phenotypic associations with APOE alleles in a large, diverse cohort, despite limitations in accuracy for EHR-derived phenotypes. We provide a comprehensive catalog of APOE-associated phenotypes and present evidence of unique phenotypic associations by sex and ancestry, as well as heterogeneity in effect size across ancestry.

We investigated associations between having a FH diagnosis and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and between statin exposure in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes among women with FH.

MethodsThis registry-based study included 3869 pregnancies among 1869 women with FH and 68225 pregnancies among 33661 women from the general population. Data on adverse pregnancy outcomes were obtained from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway with data from 1967-2018. Data on pharmacy-dispensed statins were obtained from the Norwegian prescription database (2004-2018) in 1051 women with FH. Associations were presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI from logistic regression adjusted for mothers age, parity, and offsprings birth year.

ResultsWomen with FH had a higher risk of preeclampsia (OR 1.21 [1.00-1.46]), but lower risk for gestational diabetes (OR 0.58 [0.36-0.92]) and intrapartum hemorrhage during delivery (OR 0.81 [0.71-0.92]) compared to controls. No excess risk of adverse pregnancy outcome in offspring was observed for FH vs controls. Women with FH using statins in pregnancy (n=260) had a higher risk of having offspring with low (<2500 g) birth weight (OR 2.20 [1.11, 4.49]) compared to non-exposed women with FH (n=791).

ConclusionsWomen with FH had lower risk of gestational diabetes and intrapartum hemorrhage during delivery and non-significantly higher risk of preeclampsia compared to controls. No difference in adverse pregnancy outcomes in the offspring was observed. Statin exposure in pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of having offspring with low birth weight among women with FH, and this association warrants further investigations.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

By exploiting the mechanistic connection between the locus coeruleus (LC), a key regulator of central arousal, and pupil dynamics, we recently demonstrated that participants can gain volitional control over arousal-regulating centers including the LC using a pupil-based biofeedback approach. Here, we test whether pupil-based biofeedback modulates electrophysiological markers of cortical excitability, cortical arousal, and phasic LC activity. Combining pupil-based biofeedback with single-pulse TMS, EEG recordings, and an auditory oddball task revealed three main results: pupil self-regulation significantly modulates (i) cortical excitability, (ii) the EEG spectral slope, a marker of cortical arousal, and (iii) the P300 response to target tones, an event-related potential suggested to be tightly linked to phasic LC activity. Interestingly, pupil self-regulation strength was linearly linked to the modulation of the spectral slope, suggesting a common physiological mechanism. Here, we have shown that pupil-based biofeedback modulates fundamental aspects of brain function. Whether this method could further be used to modulate these aspects in case of disturbances associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders needs to be investigated in future studies.","NA","biorxiv",1726178963236

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

Moreover, variants associated with blood cell phenotypes are enriched in regulatory regions active during hematopoiesis. To systematically explore the nature of these regions, we developed a highly efficient strategy, Perturb-multiome, that makes it possible to simultaneously profile both chromatin accessibility and gene expression in single cells with CRISPR-mediated perturbation of a range of master transcription factors (TFs). This approach allowed us to examine the connection between TFs, accessible regions, and gene expression across the genome throughout hematopoietic differentiation. We discovered that variants within the TF-sensitive accessible chromatin regions, while representing less than 0.3% of the genome, show a [~]100-fold enrichment in heritability across certain blood cell phenotypes; this enrichment is strikingly higher than for other accessible chromatin regions. Our approach facilitates large-scale mechanistic understanding of phenotype-associated genetic variants by connecting key cis-regulatory elements and their target genes within gene regulatory networks.","NA","biorxiv",1726178963236

However, it is not well understood which mechanisms are driving changes in reward sensitivity, specifically regarding food. Here, we used a sample of 117 participants (54 patients with MDD; 63 healthy control participants, HCP) who completed a food cue reactivity (FCR) task with ratings of wanting and liking for 60 food and 20 non-food items. To evaluate which components of the food may contribute to altered ratings in depression, we tested for associations with macronutrients of the depicted items. In line with previous studies, we found reduced ratings of food wanting (p = .003), but not liking (p = .23) in patients with MDD compared to matched HCPs. Adding macronutrient composition to the models of wanting and liking substantially improved their fit (ps < .001). Compared to carbohydrate-rich foods, patients with MDD reported lower liking and wanting ratings for high-fat and high-protein foods. Moreover, patients with MDD showed weaker correlations in their preferences for carbohydrate-versus fat- or protein-rich foods (ps < .001), pointing to potential disturbances in metabolic signaling. To conclude, our results suggest that depression-related alterations in food reward ratings are more specific to the macronutrient composition of the food than previously anticipated, hinting at disturbances in gut-brain signaling. These findings raise the intriguing question whether interventions targeting the gut could help normalize aberrant reward signals for foods rich in fat or protein.

These tools, powered by advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, assist patients in quickly assessing their symptoms. Previous studies using clinical vignette approaches have evaluated SC accuracy, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement.

ObjectiveThis study aims to evaluate the performance of the Ubie Symptom Checker (Ubie SC) using an innovative large language model-assisted (LLM) simulation method.

MethodsThe study employed a three-phase methodology: gathering 400 publicly available clinical vignettes, medical entity linking these vignettes to the Ubie SC using large language models and physician supervision, and evaluation of accuracy metrics. The analysis focused on 328 vignettes that were within the scope of the Ubie SC with accuracy measured by Top-5 hit rates.

ResultsUbie achieved a Top-5 hit accuracy of 63.4% and a Top-10 hit accuracy of 71.6%, indicating its effectiveness in providing relevant information based on symptom input. The system performed particularly well in domains such as the nervous system and respiratory conditions, though variability in accuracy was observed across different ICD groupings, highlighting areas for further refinement. When compared to physicians and comparator SCs that used the same clinical vignettes set, Ubie compared favorably to the median physician hit accuracy.

ConclusionsThe Ubie Symptom Checker shows considerable promise as a supportive education tool in healthcare. While the study highlights the systems strengths, it also identifies areas for improvement suggesting continued refinement and real-world testing are essential to fully realize Ubies potential in AI-assisted healthcare.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

However, it remains uncertain whether such diverse tuning corresponds to distinct functions within the hippocampal network or if a more generic computation can account for these observations. To disentangle the contribution of externally driven cues versus internal computation, we developed a task in mice where space, auditory tones, rewards, and context were juxtaposed with changing relevance. High-density electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons were tuned to each of these modalities. By comparing movement paths and action sequences, we observed that external variables had limited direct influence on hippocampal firing. Instead, spiking was influenced by online action plans modulated by goal uncertainty. Our results suggest that internally generated cell assembly sequences are selected and updated by action plans toward deliberate goals. The apparent tuning of hippocampal neuronal spiking to different sensory modalities might emerge due to alignment to the afforded action progression within a task rather than representation of external cues.","NA","biorxiv",1726178963236

Traditional dynamic disease modeling is an essential tool for characterization and prediction, but often requires extensive expertise and specialized software, which may not be readily available in low-resource environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an AI-powered modeling assistant that utilizes advanced capabilities from OpenAIs latest models and functionality. This tool enhances the accessibility and usability of infectious disease models and simulation frameworks by allowing users to generate or modify model configurations through intuitive natural language inputs or by importing explicit model descriptions. Our prototype integrates with an established open-source disease simulation framework called the Compartmental Modeling Software (CMS) to provide a seamless modeling experience from setup to analysis. The AI assistant efficiently interprets disease model parameters, constructs accurate model files, executes simulations in a controlled environment, and assists in result interpretation using advanced analytics tools. It encapsulates expert knowledge and adheres to best practices to support users ranging from novices to expert modelers. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of this AI assistant, particularly its performance in complex scenarios where it might generate inaccurate specifications. By enhancing the ease of disease modeling and supporting ongoing capacity-building initiatives, we believe that AI assistants like this one could significantly contribute to global health efforts by empowering researchers, especially in regions with limited resources, to develop and refine their disease models independently. This innovative approach has the potential to democratize disease modeling in global health, offering a scalable solution that adapts to diverse needs across a wide-range of geographies, languages, and populations.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

However, the data acquisition is limited by low spatial frequency EPI artifacts; termed here as Fuzzy Ripples. These artifacts limit the practical applicability of acquisition protocols with higher spatial resolution, faster acquisition speed, and they challenge imaging in lower brain areas.

MethodsWe characterize Fuzzy Ripple artifacts across commonly used sequences and distinguish them from conventional EPI Nyquist ghosts, off-resonance effects, and GRAPPA artifacts. To investigate their origin, we employ dual polarity readouts.

ResultsOur findings indicate that Fuzzy Ripples are primarily caused by readout-specific imperfections in k-space trajectories, which can be exacerbated by inductive coupling between third-order shims and readout gradients. We also find that these artifacts can be mitigated through complex-valued averaging of dual polarity EPI or by disconnecting the third-order shim coils.

ConclusionThe proposed mitigation strategies allow overcoming current limitations in layer-fMRI protocols:

O_LIAchieving resolutions beyond 0.8mm is feasible, and even at 3T, we achieved 0.53mm voxel functional connectivity mapping.
C_LIO_LISub-millimeter sampling acceleration can be increased to allow sub-second TRs and laminar whole brain protocols with up to GRAPPA 8.
C_LIO_LISub-millimeter fMRI is achievable in lower brain areas, including the cerebellum.

The organelle was found to contain a dynamic lactate pool that leads to dose- and time-dependent protein lactylation. In neurons, mitochondrial lactate reported blood lactate levels with high fidelity. The exchange of lactate across the inner mitochondrial membrane was found to be mediated by a high affinity H+-coupled transport system involving the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier MPC. Assessment of electron transport chain activity and determination of lactate flux showed that mitochondria are tonic lactate producers, a phenomenon driven by energization and stimulated by hypoxia. We conclude that an overflow mechanism caps the redox level of mitochondria, while saving energy in the form of lactate.

The bacteria is known to establish direct physical contact with the host compartment prior to phagosome disruption. However, the impact of direct-physical contact on the phagosome remodeling and deformation remains elusive. To probe this, we first developed a method wherein we reconstitute a phagosome-like giant compartment encapsulating Mycobacterium smegmatis, a non-motile opportunistic bacterium. We discover that the direct contact between the bacteria and the encapsulating host membrane induces membrane bending, lipid wrapping, and local lipid phase separation at the contact site. The degree of phase separation is driven by the bacterial load leading to fluidization of the membrane, as evident from the decreased area stretch and bending modulus, making the host compartment more deformable. Surprisingly, for saturating bacterial load the fluid host membrane transforms into a scaffold-like rigid layer. We also find that the direct contact of the bacteria enhances the membranolytic potential of ESAT-6 thus contributing to its virulence. Together our findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of direct physical contact of the bacteria during phagosome disruption.","NA","biorxiv",1726178963236

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation.

The rapid evolution of H5 HPAIVs continues to raise concern with heightened zoonotic and pandemic risks. The immunodominant haemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA) is crucial for influenza virus receptor binding and pH-induced fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Mutations in HA are frequent due to polymerase error, immune pressure and host adaptation, resulting in antigenic modulation and/or an expansion of host tropism, respectively, ultimately hindering control strategies. We evaluated a comprehensive panel of H5 viruses representing prevalent genotypes from UK outbreaks spanning 2020 to 2022 for HA functionality. HA genes from each genotype were assessed through receptor binding, pH of fusion, thermostability and HA inhibition assays to evaluate factors contributing to zoonotic potential, stability, and antigenicity. The viruses only bound to avian receptors and exhibited fusion at a pH of 5.8, above the pH range (pH 5.0 to 5.5) associated with efficient human-to-human transmission. Therefore, these H5 viruses have low immediate zoonotic threat. Contemporary H5 viruses were more thermostable and showed antigenic drift compared to the earlier 2017-2018 clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 viruses, and N236D in HA was identified as a significant antigenic epitope. The findings of this study underscore the evolving nature of the HA of these viruses and highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance and characterisation efforts to identify factors that might contribute to zoonotic risk.","NA","biorxiv",1726178963236

Diet is a risk factor for inflammatory bowel diseases such as CD and represents a promising adjunctive treatment, yet there are few well-controlled dietary intervention studies in CD patients. Fiber may have beneficial effects; however, most CD patients are told to avoid high-fiber foods. We conducted a longitudinal patient-preference study to examine the effect of a catered low-fat, high- fiber diet (the Mi-IBD diet) on CD symptoms, inflammation, and the microbiome.

MethodsCD patients (n=73) received one-time diet counseling (Group 1, n=23), the Mi-IBD diet (Group 2, n=26), or the Mi-IBD diet along with a healthy household control (Group 3, n=24 patient- HHC dyads). The Mi-IBD diet was catered for 8 weeks, and CD symptoms were recorded. Serum samples were collected to measure inflammatory marker levels and evaluate systemic changes via proteomic analyses (SomaScan Discovery v4.1 assays). Stool samples were collected to perform metabolomic analyses.

ResultsAt baseline, CD patients had a low-fiber, high-fat diet. One-time diet counseling did not result in dietary changes. In contrast, catering led to marked dietary changes in CD patients (increased fiber intake, decreased fat intake; all ps < 0.001) and high adherence rates (96%). Group 3 exhibited improvements in CD symptoms (PRO2 and sCDAI scores). Proteomic analysis revealed higher baseline serum levels of proinflammatory proteins (SAA and CRP) in CD patients than in HHCs; these levels decreased with the catered diet. The diet also improved fecal metabolites related to protein and energy metabolism as well as markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in CD patients.

ConclusionA nonpharmacological approach involving a high-fiber, low-fat diet to manage CD was well tolerated, even by patients with fibrostenotic CD. These findings fill a gap in development of dietary recommendations for CD patients.

Predictive processing has been repeatedly demonstrated and seemingly explains expectation suppression (ES), or the attenuation of neural activity in response to expected stimuli. However, the mechanisms behind ES are unclear and various models of the mechanisms supporting ES have been suggested with conflicting evidence. Sharpening models propose that expectations suppress neurons that are not tuned to the expected stimulus, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio for expected stimuli. In contrast, dampening models posit that expectations suppress neurons that are tuned to the expected stimuli, increasing the relative response amplitude for unexpected stimuli. Previous studies have used decoding analyses to examine these effects, with increases in decoding accuracy interpreted in terms of sharpening and decreases related to dampening. The opposing process theory (OPT) has suggested that both processes may occur at different time points, namely that initial sharpening is followed by later dampening of the neural representations of the expected stimulus as learning progresses. In this study we aim to test this theory and shed light on the dynamics of expectation effects, both at single trial level and over time. Thirty-one participants completed a statistical learning task consisting of paired scene categories whereby a ""leading"" image from one category is quickly followed by a ""trailing"" image from a different category. Multivariate EEG analyses focussed on decoding stimulus information related to the trailing image category. Within-trial, decoding analyses showed that stimulus expectation increased decoding accuracy at early latencies and decreased decoding accuracy at later latencies, in line with OPT. However, across trials, stimulus expectation decreased decoding accuracy in initial trials and increased decoding accuracy in later trials. We theorise that these dissociable dynamics of expectation effects within and across trials can be explained in the context of hierarchical learning mechanisms. Our single trial results provide evidence for the OPT, while our results over time suggest that sharpening and dampening effects emerge at different stages of learning.","NA","biorxiv",1726178963236

Fragmented Y chromosome scaffolds (n=11 > 1 Mbp) were identified using Y-specific contigs generated by genome subtraction. We identified two novel alpha-satellite repeats of 187 bp and 199 bp in the putative centromeres that did not form higher order repeats. The genome assembly exceeds the standard recommended by the Earth Biogenome Project; 0.02% false expansions, 99.63% kmer completeness, 94.66% complete single copy BUSCO genes and an average 98.42% of transcriptome data mappable to the genome assembly.

ME diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME patients low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

We found that H5 from A/Texas/37/2024, an isolate from the dairy cow outbreak, has increased binding breadth to glycans bearing terminal 2,3 sialic acids, the avian receptor, compared to historical and recent 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses. We did not observe any binding to 2,6 sialic acids, the receptor used by human seasonal influenza viruses. We identified a single mutation outside of the receptor binding site, T199I, was responsible for increased binding breadth, as it increased receptor binding site flexibility. Together, these data show recent H5N1 viruses are evolving increased receptor binding breadth which could impact the host range and cell types infected with H5N1.","NA","biorxiv",1726178963236

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1726178963236

This study compared leading commercial blood tests for amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.

MethodsPlasma samples from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were assayed with AD blood tests from C2N Diagnostics, Fujirebio Diagnostics, ALZPath, Janssen, Roche Diagnostics, and Quanterix. Outcomes measures were amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, cortical thickness, and dementia severity. Logistic regression models assessed the classification accuracies of individual or combined plasma biomarkers for binarized outcomes, and Spearman correlations evaluated continuous relationships between individual plasma biomarkers and continuous outcomes.

ResultsMeasures of plasma p-tau217, either individually or in combination with other plasma biomarkers, had the strongest relationships with all AD outcomes.

DiscussionThis study identified the plasma biomarker analytes and assays that most accurately classified amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236

As IP occurs only in recall immune responses, we investigated the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of unvaccinated individual to determine whether their immune response aligned with the primary or recall immune response patterns.

Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases. The levels of antibodies correlated positively with the severity of the condition rather than a milder course. High-resolution flow cytometry of fresh PBMNCs showed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cell subsets, and cTfh, suggesting a recall response. The transcriptomic profile demonstrated that this group was directly comparable to other contemporary cohorts. Overall, these findings support the idea that the response to SARS-CoV-2 is, in most cases, a recall response, likely due to B and T memory cells to CCCV, and therefore susceptible to immune imprinting and antibody-dependent enhancement.","NA","medrxiv",1726178963236
