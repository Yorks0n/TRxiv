Here we describe a system, which we term SOS splicing, that protects C. elegans and human genes from DNA transposon-mediated disruption by excising these TEs from host mRNAs. SOS splicing, which operates independently of the spliceosome, is a pattern recognition system triggered by base-pairing of inverted terminal repeat elements, which are a defining feature of the DNA transposons. We identify three factors required for SOS splicing in both C. elegans and human cells; AKAP17A, which binds TE-containing mRNAs; the RNA ligase RTCB; and CAAP1, which bridges RTCB and AKAP17A, allowing RTCB to ligate mRNA fragments generated by TE excision. We propose that SOS splicing is a novel, conserved, and RNA structure-directed mode of mRNA splicing and that one function of SOS splicing is to genetically buffer animals from the deleterious effects of TE-mediated gene perturbation.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

The spatial organization of cell surface proteins is central to these processes. High-resolution fluorescence microscopy and proximity labeling have advanced studies of surface protein associations, but the spatial organization of the complete surface proteome remains uncharted. In this study, we systematically mapped the surface proteome of human T-lymphocytes and B-lymphoblasts using proximity labeling of 85 antigens, identified from over 100 antibodies tested for binding to surface-exposed proteins. These experiments were coupled with an optimized data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry workflow to generate a robust dataset. Unsupervised clustering of the resulting interactome revealed functional modules, including well-characterized complexes such as the T-cell receptor and HLA class I/II, alongside novel clusters. Notably, we identified mitochondrial proteins localized to the surface, including the transcription factor TFAM, suggesting previously unappreciated roles for mitochondrial proteins at the plasma membrane. A high-accuracy machine learning classifier predicted over 6,000 surface protein associations, highlighting functional associations such as IL10RBs role as a negative regulator of type I interferon signaling. Spatial modeling of the surface proteome provided insights into protein dispersion patterns, distinguishing widely distributed proteins, such as CD45, from localized antigens, such as CD226 pointing to active mechanisms of regulating surface organization. This work provides a comprehensive map of the human surfaceome and a resource for exploring the spatial and functional dynamics of the cell membrane proteome.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

The most popular ANI algorithms are available as command-line tools and/or web applications, making it inconvenient or impossible to incorporate them into bioinformatic workflows, which utilize the popular Python programming language. Here, we present PyOrthoANI, PyFastANI, and Pyskani, Python libraries for three popular ANI computation methods. ANI values produced by PyOrthoANI, PyFastANI, and Pyskani are virtually identical to those produced by OrthoANI, FastANI, and skani, respectively. All three libraries integrate seamlessly with BioPython, making it easy and convenient to use, compare, and benchmark popular ANI algorithms within Python-based workflows.

The expression of conserved bilaterian patterning genes in echinoderms provides a molecular framework for resolving this puzzle. Recent studies in juvenile asteroids suggest that the bilaterian antero-posterior axis maps onto the medio-lateral axis that is perpendicular to each of the five rays of the pentaradial body plan. Here we test this hypothesis in another echinoderm class, the ophiuroids, using the cosmopolitan brittle star Amphipholis squamata. Our results show that the general principles of axial patterning are similar to those described in asteroids, and comparisons with existing molecular data from other echinoderm taxa support the idea that medio-lateral deployment of the AP patterning program across the rays predates the evolution of the asterozoan and likely the echinoderm crown-groups. Our data also reveal expression differences between A. squamata and asteroids, which we attribute to secondary modifications specific to ophiuroids. Together, this work provides important comparative data to reconstruct the evolution of axial properties in echinoderm body plans.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

Instead, these models implicitly reason about crucial sidechain interactions based on backbone geometry and known amino acid sequence labels. To address this, we present FAMPNN (Full-Atom MPNN), a sequence design method that explicitly models both sequence identity and sidechain conformation for each residue, where the per-token distribution of a residue's discrete amino acid identity and its continuous sidechain conformation are learned with a combined categorical cross-entropy and diffusion loss objective. We demonstrate that learning these distributions jointly is a highly synergistic task that both improves sequence recovery while achieving state-of-the-art sidechain packing. Furthermore, benefits from explicit full-atom modeling generalize from sequence recovery to practical protein design applications, such as zero-shot prediction of experimental binding and stability measurements.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

Likely a consequence of the known instability of RNA relative to DNA, this has effectively nullified the use of herbaria for transcriptomics. Here, we challenge the assumption that herbaria cannot be used for transcriptomics by assembling transcriptomes from RNA extracted from herbarium specimens. Through systematic comparison of transcriptomes from fresh-collected, silica-dried, and archival specimens, we demonstrate the suitability of herbarium-derived RNA for transcriptomics. The practical applicability of archival mRNA was further illustrated by the functional validation of a plant immune receptor synthesized from a specimen collected in 1956. These results contradict the community consensus regarding archival RNA and open the door to subsequent transcriptomic explorations in rare and extinct species. Our findings highlight the importance of preserving and utilizing the diversity embedded within herbarium collections.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

Due to the importance of the Asgard archaea for our understanding of cellular evolution and eukaryotic complexity, recent efforts have focused on better characterizing the genomic diversity of this lineage and its relatives from the TACK archaea. Newly discovered lineages, the Njordarchaeales and Panguiarchaeales, are difficult to place, branching either with Korarchaeota or Asgard archaea. The phylogenetic position of these taxa is important because they include genome-reduced and potentially symbiotic lineages, which may help to inform our understanding of genome evolution and the evolution of symbiotic interactions within Asgard archaea and their relatives. To resolve the placement of Njordarchaeales and Panguiarchaeales in the archaeal tree, we performed a range of phylogenetic analyses revealing that the Njordarchaeales and Pangiuarchaeales constitute the newly-identified class Njordarchaeia within the Asgard archaea. Members of the Njordarchaeia exhibit hallmarks of adaptations to (hyper-) thermophilic lifestyles, which may contribute conflicting signals to phylogenetic analyses. Panguiarchaeum appears to be metabolically distinct from its relatives, displaying reduced metabolic potential and various auxotrophies. Gene tree-species tree reconciliation recovers a complex common ancestor of Asgard archaea that encoded the Wood Ljungdahl pathway, however the subsequent loss of this pathway during the reductive evolution of Panguiarchaeum may have been associated with the switch to a symbiotic lifestyle based on H2 syntrophy. Our analyses identify Panguiarchaeum as the first described Asgard archaea lineage with streamlined genomes that show indications for a symbiotic lifestyle.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

This toolset is complemented here by proposing a flexible method which allows to estimate origination and extinction times, as well as model preservation potential in flexible ways. A method is presented for representing the stratigraphic interval as a continuous distribution by integrating over parameter uncertainty through the use of the posterior predictive distribution. It is possible then to combine these distributions using conflation, to build a time probabilistic model for the co-occurrence of these intervals. Empirical examples using Palynomorphs and the origination time of the marine Barracudas are used for illustrating the potential of the method. The methods are implemented in the StratIntervals.jl Julia package, which allows a big amount of possible prior distributions, and MCMC samplers.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

However, the capacity of exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex), present during chronic antigen exposure, to form memory after antigen clearance remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal single cell RNA/T cell receptor sequencing and ATAC-sequencing on antigen-specific T cells after the clearance of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. These data revealed the formation of a robust population of memory CD8+ T cells that transcriptionally, epigenetically, and functionally resemble central memory T cells (Tcm) that form after clearance of acute infection. To lineage trace the origin and memory recall response of Tex-derived memory clones, we utilized T cell receptor sequencing over the course of primary infection and rechallenge. We show that chronic Tcm are a clonally distinct lineage of Tex derived from progenitor exhausted cells, persist long-term in the absence of antigen, and undergo rapid clonal expansion during rechallenge. Finally, we demonstrate that PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade after chronic LCMV infection preferentially expands clones which form Tcm after clearance. Together, these data support the concept that chronically stimulated T cells form bona fide functional memory T cells through an analogous differentiation pathway to acutely stimulated T cells, which may have significant implications for enhancing immune memory to cancer through checkpoint blockade and vaccination.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1), with its high case fatality rate and potential for adaptation in avian reservoirs, is a prime candidate for triggering such a pandemic. We applied the Viral Trait Assessment for Pandemics (ViTAP) model, a quantitative framework, to assess the pandemic potential of H5N1 strains currently circulating in the United States. Through a systematic literature review and structured expert elicitation involving virologists and epidemiologists, we refined and validated ViTAP scores across 11 key viral traits. The resulting assessment yielded a final ViTAP score of 3.28 out of 5, placing the U.S. H5N1 strains in the moderate-to-high risk category. This elevated risk is driven by the viruss high human fatality rate, its segmented RNA genome enabling reassortment, and its propensity for mutation. Sensitivity analyses highlight the transmission mode of the virus as a critical factor, with even minor increases in human-to-human spread dramatically escalating the pandemic threat. Comparisons with historical pandemics underscore the potential for H5N1 to rival the devastating impact of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for enhanced surveillance in avian and mammalian hosts, targeted vaccine development, and comprehensive pandemic preparedness efforts. By demonstrating the utility of the ViTAP model for pandemic risk assessment, we provide a valuable tool to guide policy and interventions in the face of emerging zoonotic threats.","NA","medrxiv",1739916494184

The manual quantification of the FI from 2D microscopy images is tedious and biased, thus several automated methods have been developed. However, they still face challenges such as efficient nucleus segmentation and classification of fused and isolated myoblast nuclei. Here, we developed a novel workflow entirely based on AI for fully automated and unbiased quantification of the FI. Results: Using current methods, we show that myoblast nuclei located above or below myotubes can significantly corrupt accurate FI computation. To circumvent this issue, we developed MyoFuse which enables an accurate and high-throughput segmentation and classification of myonuclei. It comprises a nuclei segmentation step using Cellpose, followed by a classification network trained with Svetlana. MyoFuse demonstrated strong accuracy when tested against manual annotation in mouse C2C12 and human primary myotubes. The trained classifier is able to differentiate myotube nuclei from myoblast nuclei based on myotube cytoplasm staining only. Experimental comparisons also highlighted that the previously developed methods lead to a significant overestimation of the FI. Conclusion: In summary, we underscore the lack of accuracy of traditional methods for automated FI quantification. MyoFuse enables a direct and accurate segmentation of nuclei even in nuclei clusters frequently observed in myotubes. This workflow thus offers a new and more reliable method to evaluate the FI. It also limits the selection bias by processing large images.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

While recent studies on GPT-like models have demonstrated annotation performance comparable to manual annotations, a significant gap remains in understanding their limitations and generalizability. In this work, we compare and evaluate the annotation performance of the GPT-4 model against traditional methods on nine randomly selected public single-cell RNA seq datasets from cellxgene, covering diverse tissue types. Our evaluation highlights the complexity of annotating cell types in single-cell data, revealing key differences between automated and manual approaches. We found specific cases where GPT-4 underperforms, demonstrating its limitations in certain contexts. We further introduce an automated approach to incorporate literature search using a RAG approach which enhances and outperforms GPT-4 cell type annotation when compared to traditional methods. We also introduce metrics based on taxonomic distance in the ontology tree to evaluate the granularity of the cell type annotations. To support future research, we also release an open-source Python package 1 that enables fully automated cell-type annotation of single-cell data using GPT-4 alongside other methods. The pipeline can take paper as an input and do cell type annotations on its own.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

Currently, drugs and drug candidates against AR target the steroid-binding domain to antagonize or degrade AR. However, these compounds cannot therapeutically access largely intrinsically disordered truncated splice variants of AR, such as AR-V7, that only possess the DNA binding domain and are missing the ligand binding domain. Targeting intrinsically disordered regions within transcription factors has remained challenging and is considered ""undruggable"". Herein, we leveraged a cysteine-reactive covalent ligand library in a cellular screen to identify degraders of AR and AR-V7 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. We identified a covalent compound EN1441 that selectively degrades AR and AR-V7 in a proteasome-dependent manner through direct covalent targeting of an intrinsically disordered cysteine C125 in AR and AR-V7. EN1441 causes significant and selective destabilization of AR and AR-V7, leading to aggregation of AR/AR-V7 and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Consistent with targeting both AR and AR-V7, we find that EN1441 completely inhibits total AR transcriptional activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells expressing both AR and AR-V7 compared to AR antagonists or degraders that only target the ligand binding domain of full-length AR, such as enzalutamide and ARV-110. Our results put forth a pathfinder molecule EN1441 that targets an intrinsically disordered cysteine within AR to destabilize, degrade, and inhibit both AR and AR-V7 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and highlights the utility of covalent ligand discovery approaches in directly targeting, destabilizing, inhibiting, and degrading classically undruggable transcription factor targets.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

ARGs can be specified in terms of topologies and coalescence times.

Here we introduce, POLEGON, a novel approach for estimating branch lengths for ARGs which uses an uninformative prior. Using extensive simulations, we show that this method provides improved estimates of coalescence times and lead to more accurate inferences of effective population sizes under a wide range of demographic assumptions. It also improves other downstream inferences including estimates of mutation rates. We apply the method to data from the 1000 Genomes Project to investigate population size histories and differential mutation signatures across populations. We also estimate coalescence times in the HLA region, and show that they exceed 30 million years in multiple segments.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mrx6 belongs to the Pet20-domain-containing protein family, consisting of Mrx6, Pet20, and Sue1. Notably, absence of Mrx6 leads to increased mtDNA copy number. Here, we identify the C-terminus of Mrx6 as essential for its stability and interaction with the mitochondrial matrix protein Mam33. Deletion of Mam33 mimics the effect of Mrx6 loss, resulting in elevated mtDNA copy number. Bioinformatics, mutational analyses, and immunoprecipitation studies reveal that a subcomplex of Mam33 and Mrx6 trimers interacts with the substrate recognition domain of the conserved mitochondrial Lon protease Pim1 through a bipartite motif in the Pet20 domain of Mrx6. Loss of Mrx6, its paralog Pet20, Mam33, or mutations disrupting the interaction between Mrx6 and Pim1 stabilize key proteins required for mtDNA maintenance, the RNA polymerase Rpo41 and the HMG-box-containing protein Cim1. We propose that Mrx6, alongside Pet20 and Mam33, regulates mtDNA copy number by modulating substrate degradation through Pim1. Additionally, Mrx6 loss alters Cim1's function, preventing the detrimental effect on mtDNA maintenance observed upon Cim1 overexpression. The presence of three Pet20-domain proteins in yeast implies broader roles of Lon protease substrate recognition beyond mtDNA regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

It has been hypothesized that fixation of a single morph can result in character release, whereby the monomorphic form evolves without the constraint of accommodating multiple adaptive peaks. However, the rates of evolution between populations fixed for different morphs likely depend on the specific adaptive zones occupied by each morph. We studied the evolution of dorsal color polymorphism (striped and unstriped morphs) in woodland salamanders (Plethodon), a North American radiation in which the polymorphism can be found in even the most distantly related species (~44 Ma divergence). We estimated a phylogenomic tree of Plethodon, representing all extant taxa with multiple samples for most species. Morphometric data suggest that between-species variation exists predominantly along an axis of relative body elongation, likely corresponding to a terrestrial-fossorial continuum. Polymorphic species occupy an intermediate phenotypic space between the evolutionary optima of striped and unstriped species, although polymorphic species did not have elevated speciation rates. Faster rates of body shape evolution were observed in unstriped species, suggesting that body elongation, which is co-adapted with the unstriped morph, is constrained by the polymorphism. Striped species had slower rates of evolution than polymorphic species, despite lacking the genetic constraints often associated with polymorphism. Our results demonstrate that rates of phenotypic evolution and speciation following character release can be asymmetric and idiosyncratic depending on the alternative adaptations of each morph.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

Acute cholesterol depletion increases the synthesis of very-long-chain (VLC) sphingomyelin, but a link between lipid sensing and sphingolipid synthesis is lacking. Using sphingolipid metabolic flux analysis, we observed that VLC-ceramide, the precursor to VLC complex sphingolipids that are produced in the Golgi apparatus, was rapidly consumed after cholesterol depletion, while synthesis of long-chain sphingolipids was unaffected. Sphingolipid trafficking assays showed that cholesterol depletion enhances VLC-Ceramide trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Changes in the sizes of coatomer II ER exit sites were correlated with increased VLC-Ceramide trafficking and concomitant increase in sphingomyelin. Depletion of Sec16A, a component of the COPII network, abolished VLC-SM synthesis. This study reveals ER-to-Golgi trafficking of VLC-Ceramide as a key regulatory node in organelle membrane homeostasis pathways.

Sounds from multiple sources overlap in time and frequency. In particular, dynamic ""fore-ground"" sounds are often masked by more stationary ""background"" sounds. Human auditory cortex exhibits a hierarchical organization where background-invariant representations are progressively enhanced along the processing stream, from primary to non-primary regions. However, we do not know whether this organizational principle is conserved across species and which neural mechanisms drive this invariance. To address these questions, we investigated background invariance in ferret auditory cortex using functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI), which enables large-scale, high-resolution recordings of hemodynamic responses. We measured responses across primary, secondary, and tertiary auditory cortical regions as ferrets passively listened to mixtures of natural sounds and their components in isolation. We found a hierarchical gradient of background invariance, mirroring findings in humans: responses in primary auditory cortex reflected contributions from both foreground and background sounds, while background invariance increased in higher-order auditory regions. Using a spectrotemporal filter-bank model, we found that in ferrets, this hierarchical structure could be largely explained by tuning to low-order acoustic features. However, this model failed to fully account for background invariance in human non-primary auditory cortex, suggesting that additional, higher-order mechanisms are crucial for background segregation in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

The considerable time and cost of training transformer models has motivated development of alternative approaches inspired by ideas from the signal-processing literature, such as state-space models (Mamba), Fourier transforms (Hyena), and wavelet transforms (MultiResNet). To evaluate these methods as potential replacements (or complements) for attention, we developed a software library bilby, implemented using Python and Jax/Flax, providing convolutional, attention, bidirectional Hyena, bidirectional Mamba, and striped-architecture models for supervised multi-task learning in functional genomics. We report a comparison of these architectures, testing several hyperparameters and variations, and reporting performance statistics for the withheld test set as well as downstream SNP classifiers. Relative to models comprising convolution and attention layers (implemented in Python and TensorFlow via the Baskerville library used by the Borzoi software), models comprising convolutional, bidirectional Mamba, and (optionally) attention layers achieve small but consistent improvements in prediction accuracy, for roughly comparable training times and parameter counts, when averaged across all output tracks and data splits (a proportional increase of 3-4% in Pearson R, and 1-2% in r2, with the highest gains achieved when Mamba and attention layers were combined in a striped architecture). In contrast, Hyena (when reimplemented as described in the literature) was not competitive with attention-based models at these tasks, while MultiResNet proved too slow to be practical. The gains in prediction accuracy of the Mamba-based models do not yet translate to significantly improved performance on downstream SNP classification tasks: benchmarks using a GTEx eQTL dataset yield roughly similar results for Mamba- and attention-based classifiers, with attention marginally outperforming Mamba in one metric (a difference of +0.007 in area under ROC) and slightly underperforming by another metric (a difference of -0.006 in Spearman rank correlation). We argue that these results suggest selective state-space models (such as Mamba and Striped Mamba) warrant further exploration for functional genomics tasks.

Sources of somatic mutations include imperfect DNA repair, replication errors, and exogenous damage such as ultraviolet radiation. A previous study estimated a surprisingly low number of somatic mutations in a 234-year-old individual of the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), known as the Napoleon Oak. It has been suggested that the true number of somatic mutations was underestimated due to gaps in the reference genome and too conservative filtering of potential mutations. We therefore generated new high-fidelity long-read data for the Napoleon Oak (n = 12) to produce both a pseudo-haploid genome assembly and a partially phased diploid assembly. The high heterozygosity allowed for complete reconstruction of phased and gapless centromeres for 22 of the 24 chromosomes. On the other hand, the high heterozygosity posed challenges for short-read alignments. Use of only the pseudo-haploid assembly as a reference led to potential misalignments, while use of only the diploid assembly reduced variant detection sensitivity. Since most somatic mutations are layer-specific, the observed frequency is expected relatively low, even where all cells in a single layer contain a specific mutation. To address this challenge, we employed a read assignment strategy, selecting the appropriate reference sequence (pseudo-haploid or diploid) based on alignment score and mapping quality. Ultimately, we identified 198 high-confidence somatic mutations, compared with 17 somatic mutations identified before with the same set of short reads. Our approach thus increased the total estimated annual mutation rate by a factor of five.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

Despite intrinsic links to their oncogenic potential, the fidelity and mechanisms of ecDNA inheritance are poorly understood. Here, we show that ecDNA are protected against cytosolic mis-segregation through mitotic clustering and by tethering to the telomeric and subtelomeric regions of mitotic chromosomes. ecDNA-chromosome tethering depends on BRD4 transcriptional co-activation and mitotic transcription of the long non-coding RNA PVT1, which is co-amplified with MYC in colorectal and prostate cancer cell lines. Disruption of ecDNA-chromosome tethering through BRD4 inhibition, PVT1 depletion, or inhibiting mitotic transcription results in cytosolic mis-segregation, ecDNA reintegration, and the formation of homogeneously staining regions (HSRs). We propose that nuclear inheritance of ecDNA is facilitated by an RNA-mediated physical tether that links ecDNA to mitotic chromosomes and thus protects against cytosolic mis-segregation and chromosomal integration.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

To detect C. auris we aimed to compare different culture-, and molecular-based methods.

MethodsRectal swabs routinely collected in clinical care were spiked with different concentrations of C. auris. Co-infection/colonization was mimicked by spiking part of these samples with other pathogenic Candida species. Spiked materials were cultured at 37{degrees}C or 42{degrees}C using CHROMagar Candida and CHROMagar CandidaPlus plates. In parallel, samples were incubated in a dulcitol salt enrichment broth. Additionally, we compared seven in-house and commercial molecular tests on the direct material and from the broth one day after inoculation.

ResultsCulture-based methods showed sensitivities up to 100% within 48 hours of incubation, although sensitivity decreased as low as 44% at lower concentrations ([&le;]50 CFU per inoculum), in the presence of an abundance of other species and at higher temperature (42{degrees}C). Incubation at 42{degrees}C made visual identification possible since other species with similar colony morphologies did not grow at this temperature. No added value of using the dulcitol salt enrichment broth was found. qPCR on direct materials was highly sensitive and specific (both up to 100%) but major differences between various molecular tests were observed.

ConclusionWe showed that both culture-based and molecular methods are sensitive for diagnosing C. auris. The clinical setting (routine screening versus an outbreak), local prevalence and the load in those that carry or are infected by C. auris are important factors to consider when determining which diagnostic tests should be employed.","NA","medrxiv",1739916494184

While stimulation of vagal efferent neurons has been previously demonstrated to reduce maladaptive host responses during endotoxemia, only selective stimulation of vagal afferent neurons was able to inhibit TLR7-induced macrophage activation and neutrophil recruitment in the lung. These anti-inflammatory actions are facilitated by systemic increases in epinephrine, as VNS significantly increased epinephrine in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and inhibition of epinephrine production eliminated the protection afforded by VNS. Selective afferent VNS induced activation in the nucleus tractus solitarius and the rostral ventrolateral medulla. Inhibition of neuronal activity in this brain region that controls peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity rendered VNS ineffective. Activation of the {beta}2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AR) is critical for innate immune cell suppression, as the anti-inflammatory effects of VNS were eliminated in {beta}2AR39 knock out mice, and with pharmacological inhibition of the {beta}2AR. Analysis of the immune cells responding to R848 critically identified that plasmacytoid dendritic cells were refractive to inhibition by VNS, and this corresponded to lack of {beta}2AR expression.

This poses the question of how the size and pattern of a regenerating limb is matched to a widely varying animal size. Two interacting signaling molecules, SHH and FGF8, are produced at opposite sides of the regenerating limb and sustain tissue growth through a pair of oppositely-oriented signaling gradients. As the size of the regrowing tissue can vary more than three-fold depending on the size of the animal, it is unclear how the activities of these mutually dependent morphogens are maintained and subsequently terminated to determine appropriate growth. Scaling of limb regeneration suggests a size-dependent adaptation of morphogen gradient parameters. Inspired by this biological example, we theoretically investigate general mechanisms of morphogen-controlled growth arrest and proportional growth. In the proposed mechanism, tissue growth increases the spatial distance between the two morphogen gradients, thus providing negative feedback that eventually arrests morphogen activity and growth. We put forward two distinct scaling scenarios of morphogen gradients: either dynamic scaling with blastema size, where morphogen gradient parameters change dynamically with the growing tissue, or static scaling with animal size, where morphogen gradient parameters stay constant during blastema growth and only depend on animal size. We show that static scaling ensures proportional growth, but dynamic scaling does not. We compare theory predictions to experimental quantification of SHH and FGF8 morphogen gradient parameters at different time-points of regeneration in different-sized animals, indicating static scaling for some morphogen parameters, which is sufficient to ensure proportional growth in our model.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

We use Distributed Lag Non-Linear Models (DLNM) to assess the relationship between different heat exposure metrics to mortality among the young (< 65) and elderly (>=65y), including a novel metric called Heat Area Above a Threshold (HAAT). In the study period, there were 466,121 deaths in the city from natural causes. Deaths due to diabetes, hypertensive diseases, Alzheimers/dementia, renal failure and even undetermined deaths were strongly associated with extreme heat episodes, especially among the elderly. The proposed HAAT metric showed better performance on explaining mortality for most causes (10 out of the 17), when compared to temperature or heat index, or commonly used heat wave definitions. The results dialogue with Rios heat protocol, evaluating the cut-off points defined and proposing simpler definitions using the HAAT metric. An exposure to a HAAT of 64{degrees}C*h increases mortality by natural causes by 50%, and 91.2{degrees}C*h already doubles the mortality risk. Main strengths of the study lie on the comparison of different heat exposure metrics and the investigation of cause-specific mortality in a period when recent and remarkable heat waves occurred. There is still fragility when considering a compound index such as the Heat Index, and social and spatial differences on heat-related mortality should also be considered in future models. The proposed metric, however, appears as a relevant indicator to distinguish unusually warm days that lead to elevated mortality, and could guide definitions for Heat Warning Systems.","NA","medrxiv",1739916494184

However, despite the potential benefits of blocking overactive signaling, no P2X7 receptor antagonists have been approved for clinical use. Interspecies variation among existing antagonists has proven challenging, in part due to the dearth of molecular information on different receptor orthologs. Here, to identify distinct molecular features in the human receptor, we determine high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the full-length wild-type human P2X7 receptor in apo closed and ATP-bound open state conformations and draw comparisons with new and existing structures of other orthologs. We also report a cryo-EM structure of the human receptor in complex with an adamantane-based inhibitor, which we leverage, in conjunction with functional data and molecular dynamics simulations, to design a potent and selective antagonist with a unique polycyclic scaffold. Functional and structural analysis reveal how this optimized ligand, UB-MBX-46, interacts with the classical allosteric pocket of the human P2X7 receptor with picomolar potency and high selectivity, revealing its significant therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

To investigate the involvement of the upper respiratory tract human airway epithelium (HAE) in this pattern, we established an in-house model of reconstituted HAE cultured in air-liquid interface from nasal swabs of children and adults and characterised it before and after ex vivo respiratory viral infections using focused and unbiased approaches. Fully differentiated paediatric HAE exhibited an increasing induction level of genes related to mucociliary clearance, while higher expression of innate immune pathways was found in the ones from adults. While similar viral replication kinetics in both age groups were shown for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A Virus (IAV), RSV and Rhinovirus (RV) infection, transcriptomic analysis showed stronger and earlier induction of IFN-related pathways in SARS-CoV-2-infected HAE from children compared to IAV, RSV and RV. IAV and RSV had the weakest innate immune response increase in HAE from children versus adults. RV infection showed an intermediate pattern, resembling SARS-CoV-2 more than RSV or IAV. Our work demonstrates a distinct sensing of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other respiratory viruses ex vivo, which may contribute to the milder course of disease in SARS-CoV-2 infected children and argues for a role of early virus-HAE interaction in shaping viral pathogenesis. Furthermore, we show that innate immune responses towards respiratory viruses are virus-specific and differ between age groups. Hence, findings on SARS-CoV-2 cannot be extrapolated to other respiratory viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

It has long been well documented that the microenvironment evolves over time, making it crucial to identify the optimal transplantation window to maximize therapeutic efficacy. However, it remains uncertain whether acute or delayed local cell transplantations better supports graft viability after stroke. Here, we show that delayed intracerebral transplantation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from human induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) at 7 days post stroke significantly enhances graft proliferation and survival, compared to acute transplantation at 1 day post stroke, in a mouse model of large cortical stroke. Using in vivo bioluminescence imaging over a 6-week period post-transplantation, we observe a more than 5-fold increase in bioluminescence signal in mice that received delayed NPC therapy, compared to those that underwent acute NPC transplantation. The increased number of cell grafts in mice receiving delayed NPC transplantation was driven by increased proliferation rates early after transplantation, which subsequently declined to similarly low levels in both groups. Notably, we found that the majority of transplanted NPCs differentiated into neurons after 6 weeks, with no significant differences in the neuron-to-glia ratio between acute and delayed transplantation groups. These findings suggest that delayed NPC transplantation improves early graft survival and proliferation, which could help identify the optimal therapeutic window for maximizing the effectiveness of NPC-based therapies in stroke.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

We introduce a simple fitness landscape model to predict hybrid fitness with arbitrary ploidy and an arbitrary number of hybridizing lineages. We test our model on published data from maize (Zea mays) and rye (Secale cereale), including hybrids between multiple inbred lines, both as diploids and synthetic tetraploids. Quantitative predictions for the effects of inbreeding, and the strength of progressive heterosis, are well supported.

As a result, a diverse array of protein variants can coexist within a single proteome, such as that of humans. However, until now, methods to detect, quantify, and evaluate the functional consequences of these variants have been lacking. Here we examined a large-scale proteogenomic dataset from 29 healthy human tissues and uncovered over 46,000 of unique single amino acid variants co-existing alongside their corresponding reference proteoforms. Our analysis reveals that substitutions preferentially occur in proteins with low expression levels and often affect less frequently encoded amino acids such as tryptophan, cysteine, histidine, or methionine. We found that the abundance of both genetic (SNPs, somatic mutations) and mistranslated protein variants mirror their allele frequencies in the human population. Moreover, we show that non-genetic substitutions provide a distinct route for exploring protein sequence space, circumventing the mutational constraints imposed by the genetic code. Further, we demonstrate that substitution prevalence correlates negatively with their predicted pathogenicity, particularly in proteins expressed at low levels. We identified hundreds of substituted non-genetic proteoforms that recur consistently in multiple individuals and map to annotated protein functional sites. We propose that these substitutions constitute a novel class of functional protein phenotypic variants. Finally, we illustrate the impact of active-site substitutions in genes such as GAPDH and hemoglobin and highlight potential non-genetic routes of immunoglobulin diversification. Collectively, our findings indicate that non-genetic amino acid substitutions in human proteins provide a recurring and specific route to expanding the functional proteome.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

Genomic methods have shown that even for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, two disorders long-thought to be etiologically distinct3, the majority of genetic signal is shared4. Furthermore, recent cross-disorder analyses have uncovered over a hundred pleiotropic loci shared across eight disorders5. However, the full scope of shared and disorder-specific genetic basis of psychopathology remains largely uncharted. Here, we address this gap by triangulating across a suite of cutting-edge statistical genetic and functional genomic analyses applied to 14 childhood- and adult-onset psychiatric disorders (1,056,201 cases). Our analyses identify and characterize five underlying genomic factors6 that explain the majority of the genetic variance of the individual disorders ([~]66% on average) and are associated with 268 pleiotropic loci. We observed particularly high levels of polygenic overlap7 and local genetic correlation8 and very few disorder-specific loci9 for two factors defined by: (i) schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (""SB factor""), and by (ii) major depression, PTSD, and anxiety (""internalizing factor""). At the functional level, we applied multiple methods10-12 which demonstrated that the shared genetic signal across the SB factor was substantially enriched in genes expressed in excitatory neurons, whereas the internalizing factor was associated with oligodendrocyte biology. By comparison, the genetic signal shared across all 14 disorders was enriched for broad biological processes (e.g., transcriptional regulation). These results indicate increasing differentiation of biological function at different levels of shared cross-disorder risk, from quite general vulnerability to more specific pathways associated with subsets of disorders. These observations may inform a more neurobiologically valid psychiatric nosology and implicate novel targets for therapeutic developments designed to treat commonly occurring comorbid presentations.","NA","medrxiv",1739916494184

However, the drivers of these effects intracellularly remain unclear. Here, in Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that loss of coordinated inter-organelle dynamics causally initiates metabolic inflexibility with age. In young animals, peroxisomes emerge as the priming orchestrators of the fasting response, simultaneously governing lipid droplets (LDs) utilization and mitochondrial bioenergetics. With age, peroxisomal priming is lost, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired dynamic nutrient responses during fasting. Notably, dietary restriction (DR) exerts a rejuvenating effect on peroxisomal function, thereby preserving mitochondrial integrity and promoting longevity. Our study uncovers the expansive network of organelles enabling lipid mobilization during youth, providing critical context to the poorly understood role of peroxisomes in actively maintaining organelle homeodynamics and metabolic flexibility throughout the aging process.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

We hypothesized that supplying accessibility as an input feature would allow a sequence-to-expression model to focus on important open regions of the genome. Using single-nucleus multiome RNA- and ATAC-sequencing data, we found that the predictive performance of such an augmented model was significantly greater than that of sequence-only or accessibility-only models with similar architectures. Specifically, its ability to predict the expression of highly variable genes and gene expression in other cell types improved, which we attribute to a reduction in bias originating from lowly variable genes. Moreover, post-hoc analyses revealed that higher attribution scores in the input DNA sequences of the augmented model conformed to accessibility, whereas those in the sequence-only model were scattered. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a pre-trained sequence-only model with both sequence and accessibility can boost performance even further. We also highlight the importance of sequencing depth in sequence-to-expression prediction. Altogether, the results of this study provide a compelling argument for the inclusion of chromatin accessibility in sequence-to-expression models, as this strategy can be implemented easily and may improve downstream applications.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

However, its application to genebank accessions is limited by missing geographic origin data. To address this limitation, we explored the use of neural networks to predict the geographic origins of barley accessions and integrate imputed environmental data into GEA. Neural networks demonstrated high accuracy in cross-validation but occasionally produced ecologically implausible predictions as models solely considered geographical proximity. For example, some predicted origins were located within non-arable regions, such as the Mediterranean Sea. Using barley flowering time genes as benchmarks, GEA integrating imputed environmental data (N=11,032) displayed partially concordant yet complementary detection of genomic regions near flowering time genes compared to regular GEA (N=1,626), highlighting the potential of GEA with imputed data to complement regular GEA in uncovering novel adaptive loci. Also, contrary to our initial hypothesis anticipating a significant improvement in GEA performance by increasing sample size, our simulations yield unexpected insights. Our study suggests potential limitations in the sensitivity of GEA approaches to the considerable expansion in sample size achieved through predicting missing geographical data. Overall, our study provides insights into leveraging incomplete geographical origin data by integrating deep learning with GEA. Our findings indicate the need for further development of GEA approaches to optimize the use of imputed environmental data, such as incorporating regional GEA patterns instead of solely focusing on global associations between allele frequencies and environmental gradients across large-scale landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

Disruption of this bond, particularly following offspring loss, can result in profound trauma with long-lasting consequences. While considerable research has focused on the impact of maternal separation on offspring development, the biological effects of offspring loss on the mother remain largely unexplored. In this study, we examined the long-term effects of offspring loss on neuroplasticity, the oxytocin (OXT) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) systems, and stress-coping behaviors in Sprague-Dawley rat mothers. We compared mothers that experienced one day of motherhood followed by 19 days of offspring loss, mothers that were with their pups throughout the 20 days, and naive virgin rats. Our results reveal that mothers who lost their pups expressed increased oxytocin receptor binding and decreased dendritic spine density in limbic brain regions, with no changes in estrogen receptor  or calbindin cells. Additionally, separated mothers showed increased passive stress-coping behaviors in the forced swim test and elevated plasma corticosterone levels. Remarkably, the passive stress-coping behavior was rescued by central CRF receptor blockade but not by oxytocin treatment, suggesting that the CRF system plays a key role in the grieving process following offspring loss, and highlights the suitability of the rat model for studying maternal grief. This research provides insights into the complex neurobiology of grief, and suggests potential directions for future studies.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

Yet our understanding of value-based decision-making comes primarily from studying individuals in isolation, leaving open fundamental questions about how animals adapt their strategies during social competition. Here, we developed an ethologically relevant multi-player game, in which freely-moving mice make value-based decisions in a competitive spatial foraging task. We found that mice integrate real-time spatial information about 'self' and the opponent to flexibly shift their preference towards safer, low-payout options when appropriate. Analyses of mice and reinforcement learning agents reveal that these behavioural adaptations cannot be explained by simple reward learning, but are instead consistent with optimal decision strategies guided by opponent features. Using a dynamical model of neural activity, we found that in addition to opponent effects, decisions under competition were also noisier and more sensitive to initial conditions, generating testable predictions for neural recordings and perturbations. Together, this work reveals a fundamental mechanism for competitive foraging, and proposes novel quantitative frameworks towards understanding value-based decision-making in a fast-changing social environment.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

Here, to explore hyperparasitism in Archaea, we focused on ultra-small archaea of the phylum Nanohaloarchaeota, a distinct lineage within the DPANN superphylum, which establish obligate symbiotic interactions with extreme halophiles of the class Halobacteria. We assembled five metagenomes originating from geothermally influenced salt lakes in the Danakil Depression, Ethiopia, and reconstructed the viromes associated with both haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea. Both archaeal lineages were associated with viruses from four distinct groups, including head-tailed viruses (class Caudoviricetes), tailless icosahedral viruses, pleomorphic viruses and spindle-shaped viruses, which represent 12 previously undescribed families. The haloarchaeal viruses (HVs) and nanohaloarchaeal viruses (NHVs) are only distantly related, suggesting that viruses from the four groups co-evolved with their respective hosts for an extended period, likely since the divergence of the two archaeal lineages from their last common ancestor. Consistently, our results show that HVs and NHVs are well-adapted to replicate in their respective hosts and to thrive in hypersaline environments. No evidence of host switching between haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea was obtained, but multiple horizontal transfers of genes implicated in virion structure and morphogenesis between HVs and NHVs were detected. We also identified several NHVs-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes implicated in nucleotide and amino acid metabolisms, which could enhance the metabolic capabilities of the nanohaloarchaeal hosts that have highly reduced genomes. Finally, in addition to HVs and NHVs, we describe plasmid-derived virus satellites that appear to have originated convergently to parasitize spindle-shaped viruses of both haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea, uncovering an additional layer of parasitism. Collectively, our findings fill the knowledge gap on the diversity of HVs and NHVs, highlight the complexity of virus-host and virus-virus interactions in hypersaline environments, and open doors for further mining of the virosphere of the globally distributed DPANN archaea.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

However, the fine-scale, complex decision-making of animals can pose challenges for the accurate prediction of trajectories. Step selection functions (SSFs), a common tool for inferring relationships between animal movement and the environment, are also increasingly used to simulate animal trajectories for prediction. Although admitting a lot of flexibility, the SSF framework is limited to its reliance on pre-defined functional forms for fitting to data, and SSFs that involve complex functional forms to model detailed processes can be prohibitively difficult to fit and interpret. Here, we present deepSSF, an approach to fit and predict animal movement data using deep learning. Whilst not specific to any particular model, we denote the deepSSF approach as building and training a neural network architecture that receives multiple environmental layers and scalar values as inputs, and outputs a single layer representing the next-step probability. To demonstrate a deepSSF model, we build a model in PyTorch that has distinct but interacting habitat selection and movement subnetworks, which allows for explicit representation of both processes and interpretable intermediate outputs. We apply our model to GPS data of introduced water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) in the tropical savannas of Northern Australia. Our deepSSF model was able to learn features that are present in the habitat covariate layers, such as linear features (rivers, forest edges), and the composition of certain habitat areas, without having to specify them pre-emptively within the SSF framework. It was also able to capture the complex interactions between the habitat covariates as well as temporal dynamics across time of day and year. We expect that the deepSSF approach will generate accurate and informative animal movement trajectories, which can be used for deepening our understanding of animal-environment systems and for the practical management of species. Considering the wide range of deep learning tools, the deepSSF approach could be extended to represent memory and social dynamic processes, with the potential for integrating non-spatial data sources such as accelerometers and physiological sensors","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

Here we found that female hybrids between Mus musculus domesticus and Mus spicilegus mice are sterile due to the failure of homologous chromosome separation in oocyte meiosis I, producing aneuploid eggs. This non-separation phenotype was driven by the mis-localization of the cohesin protector, SGO2, along the chromosome arms instead of its typical centromeric enrichment, resulting in cohesin over-protection. The upstream kinase, BUB1, showed a significantly higher activity in hybrid oocytes, explaining SGO2 mis-targeting along the chromosome arm. Higher BUB1 activity was not observed in mitosis, consistent with viable hybrid mice. Cohesion defects were also evident in hybrid mice from another genus, Peromyscus, wherein cohesin protection is weakened. Defective chromosome cohesion in oocytes is a leading cause of reduced fertility especially with advanced maternal age. Our work provides evidence that a major cause of human infertility may play a positive role in promoting mammalian speciation.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

Adaptation is predicted to occur over long evolutionary timescales, but recent work suggests that interactions between the epigenome and transposable elements (TEs) could link environmental acclimation with rapid adaptation. Yet combining all these factors in a tractable model system remains challenging; consequently little is known about how these processes interact in natural genetic backgrounds or shape evolutionarily relevant phenotypes. To investigate these interactions, we carried out laboratory experiments measuring gene expression and chromatin accessibility responses to heat shock in female D. melanogaster from arid and temperate climates and their associations with population variation in TEs. The consequences for fitness-related phenotypes were characterised in the offspring, and we also measured expression, chromatin accessibility and phenotypic traits three generations later to explore transgenerational inheritance. Expression and accessibility responses to heat shock varied between populations and were influenced by the presence of TEs, with more upregulated responses in the arid population. Effects of heat shock on transcription were detected three generations later, especially in the arid population, with many epigenetic genes transgenerationally expressed, although this was not driven by chromatin accessibility. Heat shock negatively affected phenotypes in the initial offspring cohort, but later arid population cohorts developed quicker than controls, indicating hormesis, an effect still present in the great-great-grandoffspring. These results demonstrate the transgenerational inheritance of a potentially beneficial hormetic phenotype and associated patterns of gene expression in a natural insect population.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

Females experience up to a 90% decrease in ovarian estradiol production after the menopausal transition. Postmenopausal women show lower cerebello-cortical and intracerebellar FC compared to reproductive aged females. Sex hormones are established modulators of both memory function and synaptic organization in the hippocampus in non-human animal studies. However, investigation of the cerebello-hippocampal (CB-HP) circuit has been limited to animal studies and small homogeneous samples of young adults as it relates to spatial navigation. Here, we investigate the CB-HP circuit in 138 adult humans (53% female) from 35-86 years of age, to define its FC patterns, and investigate its associations with behavior, hormone levels, and sex differences therein. We established robust FC patterns between the CB and HP in this sample. We predicted and found negative relationships between age and CB-HP FC. As expected, estradiol levels exhibited positive relationships with CB-HP. We found lower CB-HP FC with higher levels of progesterone.

This unique structural plasticity facilitates diverse molecular recognition and function; thus, a convenient way to view IDRs is through their ensembles. Here, we combine advances in physics-based force fields for IDPs with the power of modern multi-scale generative modeling to develop STARLING, an approach for the rapid and accurate prediction of IDR ensembles directly from sequence. STARLING enables ensembles of hundreds of conformers to be generated in seconds and works on GPUs and CPUs.

To address this limitation, we here extend the recent AF3-style model Boltz to cyclic peptides with ncAAs.

Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses reveal that these mutant diets induce oxidative stress and activate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Lifespan extension requires the oxidative stress response regulators SKN-1, SEK-1, and HLH-30.

Chromatin, particularly transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin, resists nuclear deformations through its mechanical response. However, chromatin also exhibits liquid-like properties, casting ambiguity on the physical mechanisms of chromatin-based nuclear elasticity. To determine how heterochromatin strengthens nuclear mechanical response, we performed polymer physics simulations of a nucleus model validated by micromechanical measurements and chromosome conformation capture data. The attachment of peripheral heterochromatin to the lamina is required to transmit forces directly to the chromatin and elicit its elastic response. Thus, increases in heterochromatin levels increase nuclear rigidity by increasing the linkages between chromatin and the lamina. Crosslinks within heterochromatin, such as HP1 proteins, can also stiffen nuclei, but only if chromatin is peripherally tethered. In contrast, heterochromatin affinity interactions that may drive liquid-liquid phase separation do not contribute to nuclear rigidity. When the nucleus is stretched, gel-like peripheral heterochromatin can bear stresses and deform, while the more fluid-like interior euchromatin is less perturbed. Thus, heterochromatin's internal structure and stiffness may regulate nuclear mechanics via peripheral attachment to the lamina, while also enabling nuclear mechanosensing of external forces and external measurement of the nucleus' internal architecture.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

Stinkbug symbiont Caballeronia insecticola navigates a narrow gut passage about one micrometer in diameter to reach the stinkbugs symbiotic organ. Here, we developed a microfluidic device mimicking the hosts sorting organ, wherein bacterial cells are confined in a quasi-one-dimensional fashion, and revealed that this bacterium wraps flagellar filaments around its cell body like a screw thread to control fluid flow and generate propulsion for smooth and directional movement in narrow passages. Physical simulations and genetic experiments revealed that hook flexibility is essential for this wrapping; increasing hook rigidity impaired both wrapping motility and infectivity. Thus, flagellar wrapping likely represents an evolutionary innovation, enabling bacteria to break through confined environments using their motility machinery.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

Herein, we propose gcSV, a read-length agnostic alignment-based approach to well-handle the issues of genome repeats, SV breakpoints and read alignments/assemblies for comprehensive, cost-effective and versatile SV calling. For long reads, its yield is 20-38% higher than state-of-the-art tools in HG002 benchmark. For hybrid sequencing, it provides a cost-effective solution (2-4x long plus 30-60x short reads) to achieve even higher yield than that of state-of-the-art tools using 30x long reads. For short reads, gcSV also achieves over 8% higher precision without any loss of sensitivity. Furthermore, gcSV confidently brings over 93,000 novel SVs comparing to the official callset of 1000 Genomes Project Phase4. The results suggest that gcSV is promising to make valuable SV discoveries in many cutting-edge studies.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184

To address this, we performed genome-wide CRISPR knockout and focused base editor screens in PPP perturbed conditions to establish a high-resolution functional map of PPP regulation that pinpoints novel regulatory mechanisms. Through this, we identify the orphan reductase CYB5R4 as an evolutionarily conserved activator of PP4 and PP6, but not the closely related PP2A. Heme binding is essential for CYB5R4 function and mechanistically involves the reduction of the metal ions in the active site. Importantly, CYB5R4-mediated activation of PP4 is critical for cell viability when cells are treated with DNA damage-inducing agents known to cause oxidative stress. The discovery of a dedicated PPP reductase points to shared regulatory principles with protein tyrosine phosphatases, where specific enzymes dictate activity by regulating the active site redox state. In sum, our work provides a resource for understanding PPP function and the regulation of intracellular signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1739916494184
