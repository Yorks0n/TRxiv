Studying nanodomain function requires the ability to measure protein and lipid localization at the nanoscale. Current methods for visualizing lipid localization do not meet this requirement. Here, we introduce a correlative light and electron microscopy workflow to image lipids (Lipid-CLEM), combining near-native lipid probes and on-section labeling by click chemistry. This approach enables the quantification of relative lipid densities in membrane nanodomains. We find differential partitioning of sphingomyelin into intraluminal vesicles, recycling tubules, and the boundary membrane of the early endosome, representing a degree of nanoscale organization previously observed only for proteins. We anticipate that our Lipid-CLEM workflow will greatly facilitate the mechanistic analysis of lipid functions in cell biology, allowing for the simultaneous investigation of proteins and lipids during membrane nanodomain assembly and function.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

However, excessive NET formation may damage organs during sepsis. We investigated the association between NETs and sepsis outcomes, including mortality and acute kidney injury (AKI).

MethodsWe analysed levels of H3.1 nucleosomes in 971 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock from the SISPCT trial (Effect of Sodium Selenite Administration and Procalcitonin-Guided Therapy on Mortality in Patients With Severe Sepsis or Septic Shock). We evaluated associations between H3.1 levels and mortality and the need for renal replacement therapy using multivariable Cox regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses.

ResultsWe analysed 971 critically ill patients with complete data including admission H3.1 levels. 443 patients (45.6%) presented with sepsis, 520 (53.6%) had septic shock, and eight patients had an unknown diagnosis as defined by Sepsis-3. Admission H3.1 levels were higher in patients with septic shock than with sepsis (median 921.84 vs 432.71 ng/mL; p<0.001). Admission H3.1 levels were higher in non-survivors, and in a univariate Cox analysis, each log-10 increase in H3.1 was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.86 (95% confidence interval 1.41-2.47, p<0.05). H3.1 was also higher in patients requiring renal replacement therapy with septic shock vs sepsis (1832 ng/mL vs 801.4 ng/mL, p=0.01) and demonstrated a dose-response relationship with the severity of AKI.

ConclusionElevated levels of H3.1 nucleosomes at admission are independently associated with mortality and severe kidney dysfunction requiring renal replacement therapy.

In previous work, we predicted a fourth RBD epitope based on allosteric conformational perturbations measured by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) upon complexation with the canonical spike protein target, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). We subsequently identified a pan-neutralizing antibody (ICO-hu104) with the predicted epitope, however, as the epitope was somewhat distant from the hACE2 binding interface, and our previous work limited to the spike RBD, the neutralization mechanism was unclear. Using HDX-MS, we investigated the binding of ICO-hu104 to the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from Wuhan, Delta and Omicron variants. We demonstrate that binding of ICO-hu104 at its epitope results in an increase in deuterium uptake in the distant HR1 domain for variants of concern, which in a biological context could be indicative of destabilisation of the helices within this region, promoting S1 shedding or failure of helical extension during S2-mediated fusion. This is supported by our computational modelling, highlighting propagation of allosteric effects to the S2 coiled-coil region. Collectively, this work demonstrates an alternative neutralization mechanism for ICO-hu104 which is distinct from its first-generation predecessors and thus opens alternative avenues targeting non-RBD epitopes through assessment of allosteric perturbations.

To resolve these questions for a human TF, erythroid Kruppel-like factor (eKLF/KLF1), we quantitatively compare, in high throughput, in vitro TF binding rates and affinities with in vivo single molecule TF and nucleosome occupancies across engineered DNA sequences. We find that 40-fold flanking sequence effects on affinity are consistent with distal flanks tuning TF search parameters and captured by a linear energy model. Motif recognition probability, rather than time in the bound state, drives affinity changes, and in vitro and in nuclei measurements exhibit consistent, minutes-long TF residence times. Finally, pairing in vitro biophysical parameters with thermodynamic models accurately predicts in vivo single-molecule chromatin states for unseen motif grammars.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

The helicase RECQL5 has been proposed as an important factor to help safeguard the genome, and is the only member of the human RecQ helicase family that directly binds to RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) and affects its progression. RECQL5 mitigates transcription stress and genome instability in cells, yet the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unclear. Here, we employ cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of stalled Pol II elongation complexes (ECs) bound to RECQL5. Our structures reveal the molecular interactions stabilizing RECQL5 binding to the Pol II EC and highlight its role as a transcriptional roadblock. Additionally, we find that RECQL5 can modulate the Pol II translocation state. In its nucleotide-free state, RECQL5 mechanically twists the downstream DNA in the EC, and upon nucleotide binding, it undergoes a conformational change that allosterically induces Pol II towards a post-translocation state. We propose this mechanism may help restart Pol II elongation and therefore contribute to reduction of transcription stress.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

We sought to investigate whether symptom severity is influenced by changes in sex hormones over the menstrual cycle, or by hormonal contraception.

MethodsWe carried out a retrospective analysis of menstrual and symptom data, prospectively collected via the Visible app from individuals with long COVID, ME/CFS, or both, who had regular menstrual cycles, between 7th September 2022 and 6th March 2024. Mixed-effects models were used to examine associations between symptom severity, menstrual cycle phase and contraception type.

Findings948 users were included; 100% of users were female and 92.6% identified as women. The most tracked symptoms were fatigue (99{middle dot}5% of users), brain fog (88{middle dot}3%), headaches (85{middle dot}1%) and muscle aches (78{middle dot}6%). All menstrual cycle phases showed a modest, but significant, improvement compared to the menstrual phase, most markedly the early luteal (IRR = 0{middle dot}963, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}958-0{middle dot}968), but also the follicular (IRR = 0{middle dot}985, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}981-0{middle dot}990) and late luteal phases (IRR = 0{middle dot}980, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}974- 0{middle dot}985). Crashes (sudden and severe worsening of symptoms following exertion) were significantly more frequent during menstruation than in other phases. Users of combined hormonal contraception (n=70) had a statistically significant reduction in overall symptom score (OR = 0{middle dot}827, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}690-0{middle dot}992) and crash incidence (OR = 0{middle dot}548, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}350-0{middle dot}856) compared to those not using contraception (n=786).

InterpretationMenstruation is associated with worsened symptoms in long COVID and ME/CFS. Users of combined hormonal contraception report a lower symptom burden than non-users, suggesting a modulatory role of ovarian hormones. These findings could empower menstruating people living with long COVID and ME/CFS to anticipate cyclical changes in symptoms and plan their activities accordingly, and could also inform their use of contraception.

Retrons typically comprise a reverse transcriptase, a template noncoding RNA that is partially reverse transcribed into RT-DNA, and a toxic effector. The reverse transcriptase, noncoding RNA, and RT-DNA complex sequester the toxic effector until triggered by phage infection, at which point the toxin is released to induce cell death. Due to their ability to produce single-stranded DNA in vivo, retrons have also been engineered to produce donor templates for genome editing in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the current repertoire of experimentally characterized retrons is limited, with most retrons sourced from clinical and laboratory strains of bacteria. To better understand retron biology and natural diversity, and to expand the current toolbox of retron-based genome editors, we developed a pipeline to isolate retrons and their bacterial hosts from a variety of environmental samples. Here, we present six of these novel retrons, each isolated from a different host bacterium. We characterize the full operon of these retrons and test their ability to defend against a panel of E. coli phages. For two of these retrons, we further unravel their mechanism of defense by identifying the phage genes responsible for triggering abortive infection. Finally, we engineer these retrons for genome editing in E. coli, demonstrating their potential use in a biotechnological application.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

We find that the growth of up to 50% of all community members depended essentially on supplementation with amino acids, vitamins, or nucleotides. In 73% of cases, supplementation with multiple amino acids was necessary. Genomic analysis of 62 strains revealed that accumulation of insertion sequences and specific gene loss was associated with the observed auxotrophies. Finally, genome-scale metabolic models, computational analyses, and cocultivation experiments demonstrated that other co-occurring genotypes complemented the metabolic needs of auxotrophs, thus facilitating their growth.

More education was associated with better memory, larger intracranial volume and slightly larger volume of memory-sensitive brain regions. However, education did not protect against age-related decline or weakened effects of brain decline on cognition.

Traditional methods include fluorescent protein fusion (e.g., GFP) or organic fluorophores linked to ligands targeting the protein of interest. However, these approaches often introduce functional disruptions or ligand-associated biological effects. Herein, we address these challenges by developing covalent fluorescent probes for endogenous tubulin, a critical cytoskeletal protein involved in processes such as cell movement, division, and biomolecule trafficking. Using well-known tubulin binder cabazitaxel and cell permeable fluorophore silicon-rhodamine--as a basis, we introduce a novel biocompatible cleavable linker containing a sulfonium center. This allowed the construction of the optimized probe, 6-SiR-o-C9-CTX, demonstrating excellent cell permeability, fluorogenic properties, and the ability to covalently label tubulin across various human cell lines. Importantly, the targeting moiety could be washed out while preserving tubulin staining, ensuring minimal disruption of tubulin function. This labeling technique is compatible with STED nanoscopy in both live and fixed cells, offering a powerful high-resolution imaging tool.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

Coinfection is restricted by a mechanism known as superinfection exclusion (SIE), which prohibits the infection of a previously infected cell by a related virus after a period of time. SIE regulates coinfection for many different viruses, but its relevance to the infection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was unknown. In this study, we investigated this using a pair of SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses encoding distinct fluorescent reporter proteins. We show for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 coinfection of individual cells is limited temporally by SIE. We defined the kinetics of the onset of SIE for SARS-CoV-2 in this system, showing that the potential for coinfection starts to diminish within the first hour of primary infection, and then falls exponentially as the time between the two infection events is increased. We then asked how these kinetics would affect the potential for coinfection with viruses during a spreading infection. We used plaque assays to model the localised spread of SARS-CoV-2 observed in infected tissue, and showed that the kinetics of SIE restrict coinfection, and therefore sites of possible genetic exchange, to a small interface of infected cells between spreading viral infections. This indicates that SIE, by reducing the likelihood of coinfection of cells, likely reduces the opportunities for genetic exchange between different strains of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is an underappreciated factor in shaping SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

We find that the previously identified open-interface trimer conformation is sampled in all eVLP-displayed spike variants studied including sequences from engineered vaccine constructs and native viral sequences. The D614G mutation, which arose early in the pandemic, favors the canonical  closed-interface prefusion conformation, potentially mitigating premature S1 shedding in the presence of a cleaved furin site and providing an evolutionary advantage to the virus.

Understanding the relationships and evolutionary histories of different limbs is a central task, but their sheer diversity makes this a daunting if not impossible task using morphology alone. Here, the in situ expression patterns and CRISPR-Cas9 phenotypes for the five best-studied leg-patterning genes - Distal-less, Sp6-9, dachshund, extradenticle, and homothorax - are described for all limbs of the crustacean Parhyale.

Crustaceans are well-suited for this task because their limbs are more diverse than those of other arthropods, and each individual possesses a wide range of limb types that are relevant to many other arthropods, living and extinct. These results will a) provide a template for understanding the genetic basis of limb construction in arthropods more generally based on the strong phenotypes that can be obtained with CRISPR-Cas9, and b) contribute to our understanding of the evolution and affinities of highly modified legs like mouthparts and genitalia using molecular methods to complement previous morphological and embryological approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

We found partial anatomical segregation between the LC->PRN and LC->BF circuits. Extracellular NE dynamics in BF and PRN exhibited distinct sound-evoked activation during sleep, including a fast sound-evoked NE peak specific to PRN.

Despite the high efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in preventing HIV, its accessibility and uptake remain uneven across countries. This study examines the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different PrEP policies across 20 EU countries. Methods We employed a stochastic agent-based model of HIV transmission among MSM. The model incorporated data on sexual behavior, PrEP adherence and healthcare costs to evaluate the impact of five distinct PrEP eligibility policies. Outcomes included HIV infections averted, HIV-related deaths prevented, PrEP coverage, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Findings Policies by the US CDC and Belgian authorities were the most effective in reducing HIV infections and deaths, driven by higher PrEP coverage. However, the WHO policy emerged as the most costeffective across the 20 countries, despite its current use being limited to Denmark. The European AIDS Clinical Society guidelines also showed potential, although not currently implemented. In countries without PrEP reimbursement, reducing drug costs would significantly expand the range of cost-effective policy options. Interpretation Optimizing PrEP policies is crucial for reducing HIV incidence among MSM in the EU. Broad eligibility criteria maximize effectiveness, while WHO guidelines offer a cost-effective alternative in constrained economic contexts. Our findings highlight the need for policy adjustments to enhance PrEP accessibility, inform national health strategies, and achieve sustainable HIV prevention across diverse settings.","NA","medrxiv",1738361285505

FastCCC relies on fast Fourier transformation-based convolution to compute p-values analytically without permutations, introduces a modular algebraic operation framework to capture a broad spectrum of CCC patterns, and can leverage atlas-scale single cell references to enhance CCC analysis on user-collected datasets. To support routine reference-based CCC analysis, we constructed the first human CCC reference panel, encompassing 19 distinct tissue types, over 450 unique cell types, and approximately 16 million cells. We demonstrate the advantages of FastCCC across multiple datasets, most of which exceed the analytical capabilities of existing CCC methods. In real datasets, FastCCC reliably captures biologically meaningful CCCs, even in highly complex tissue environments, including differential interactions between endothelial and immune cells linked to COVID-19 severity, dynamic communications in thymic tissue during T-cell development, as well as distinct interactions in reference-based CCC analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

Here, we present the discovery and engineering of NanoCas, an ultracompact CRISPR nuclease capable of extending CRISPR's reach in vivo beyond liver targets. We experimentally screened 176 ultracompact CRISPR systems found in metagenomic data and applied protein engineering approaches to enhance the editing efficiency of NanoCas. The optimized NanoCas exhibits potent editing capabilities across various cell systems and tissues in vivo when administered via adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. This is accomplished despite NanoCas being approximately one-third the size of conventional CRISPR nucleases. In proof-of-concept experiments, we observed robust editing with our optimized NanoCas in mouse models targeting Pcsk9, a gene involved in cholesterol regulation, and targeting exon splice sites in dystrophin to address Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mutations. We further tested the efficacy of our NanoCas system in vivo in non-human primates (NHPs) resulting in editing levels above 30% in muscle tissues. The compact size of NanoCas, in combination with robust nuclease editing, opens the door for single-AAV editing of non-liver tissues in vivo, including the use of newer editing modalities such as reverse transcriptase (RT) editing, base editing, and epigenetic editing.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

We identify the TNL-class nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) BURNOUT1 (BNT1) from Arabidopsis thaliana as localized to plastids, key organelles for plant immunity. Alternative transcription start site usage generates two isoforms of BNT1: BNT1.2, which is targeted to the plastid envelope via an N-terminal signal-anchored mechanism, and BNT1.1, which resides in the cytoplasm. Moreover, BNT1.2 is predominantly expressed in epidermal cells, where it localizes to the so-called sensory plastids. Functional analysis revealed that bnt1 mutants exhibit compromised PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) responses, including impaired callose deposition and reduced flg22-induced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, while flg22-induced apoplastic reactive oxygen species production remains unaffected. Notably, only the plastid-localized BNT1.2 isoform is required for these PTI responses.

By analyzing 142,492 fully sequenced plasmids from bacterial isolates and metagenomes, we offer a comprehensive representation of plasmid distribution in microbial communities. Our findings reveal that conjugative plasmids (pCONJ) are less common than previously estimated, comprising only 4.14% of the dataset. Mobilizable plasmids (pMOB) are the most prevalent (66.82%), followed by non-transmissible plasmids (pNT) at 29.04%. Although plasmids are recognized as key drivers of ARG dissemination, only 3.8% of plasmids encode ARGs. Among pCONJ plasmids, 6.9% harbor ARGs, and just 0.18% carry VGs. These findings contrast with earlier estimates, which overrepresented clinically associated plasmids. Interestingly, ARGs are more frequently associated with pMOB plasmids, which exhibit higher ARG density. In contrast, VGs are primarily found in pCONJ plasmids. This study highlights the significance of pMOB plasmids in ARG dissemination, emphasizing their role in resistance spread. Our results challenge prevailing assumptions about plasmid-mediated gene transfer and underscore the need to prioritize pMOB plasmids in future epidemiological studies.

Unexpectedly, we found that human SPIN90 is a dimer that can nucleate bidirectional actin filaments. To understand the basis for this, we determined a 3 [A] resolution structure of human SPIN90-Arp2/3 complex nucleating actin filaments. Our structure shows that SPIN90 dimerises via a 3-helix bundle and interacts with two Arp2/3 complexes. Each SPIN90 molecule binds both Arp2/3 complexes to promote their activation. Our analysis demonstrates that single filament nucleation by Arp2/3 is mechanistically more like branch formation than previously appreciated. The dimerisation domain in SPIN90 orthologues is conserved in metazoans, suggesting that this mode of bidirectional nucleation is a common strategy to generate anti-parallel actin filaments.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

Here, we leverage the well-characterized architecture of the cerebellar circuit to perform expert identification of neuron type from extracellular recordings in behaving non-human primates. Using deep-learning classifiers we evaluate the information contained in readily accessible extracellular features for neuron identification. Waveform, discharge statistics, anatomical layer, and functional interactions each can inform neuron labels for a sizable fraction of cerebellar units. Together, as inputs to a deep-learning classifier, the features perform even better.

They lay the groundwork for characterization of information processing in the cerebellar cortex.

RNA-free capsids exhibit remarkable stability at physiological salt concentrations, suggesting an evolutionary adaptation for capsid reuse during the viral life cycle. This observation challenges the notion that empty capsids are exclusively products of abortive assembly, positioning them instead as functional intermediates in viral reproduction. Additionally, RNA encapsidation creates electrostatic dependencies that magnesium ions mitigate, stabilizing both RNA and capsid through long-residence-time interactions with phosphate groups. Chloride ions further influence capsid permeability by modulating salt-bridge disruptions and interprotomeric interactions, with these effects being pH-dependent: enhanced at pH < 7, preserving nucleocapsid integrity, or weakened at pH = 7, facilitating disassembly and RNA release.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

FER is required for the perception of endogenous RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides to control various aspects of plant growth, development and immunity. RALFs are perceived by FER-LORELEI-LIKE GPI-ANCHORED PROTEIN (LLG) heterocomplexes to induce cellular responses and bind to LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT EXTENSIN (LRX) proteins as structural components of the cell wall. We show that FER`s RALF ligands are necessary for full success of powdery mildew colonization. Our data reveals that LLGs and LRXs are also powdery mildew susceptibility factors, and that the susceptibility function of RALFs is best explained by a combination of peptide signalling and cell wall-related effects. We further reveal that cell wall and apoplastic pH homeostasis, hallmark features of RALF function, support powdery mildew reproductive success. The function of host RALF peptides is underlined by the fact that, in contrast to previously described pathogens that hijack FER for colonization, powdery mildew fungi do not produce functional RALF mimics. Surprisingly, RALF-dependent powdery mildew pathogenesis is partially independent of FER. The resistance phenotype of ralf and fer mutants is not associated with de-regulated salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signalling, important defense-related phytohormones.

Here we examine these assumptions by using a moderate throughput expression CROPseq protocol in which Cas9 nuclease is used to induce small insertions and deletions across the credible set of SNPs that may account for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for genes associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Of the 4,384 SNPs targeted in 88 loci (an average of 50 per locus), 439 were significant and further examined for validation. From these, 98 significantly altered target gene expression in HL-60 myeloid cell line, 74 in induced macrophages from these HL-60 cells, and 78 in induced neutrophils for a total of 201 validated effects (46%), 43 of which were observed in at least two of the cell types. Considering the observed sensitivity and specificity of the controls, we estimate that there are at least 150 true positives per cell type, an average of almost 2.4 for each of the 64 eQTL for which putative causal variants have been fine-mapped. This implies that haplotype effects are likely to explain many of the associations. We also demonstrate that the same approach can be used to investigate the activity of very rare variants in regulatory regions for 89 genes, providing a rapid strategy for establishing clinical relevance of non-coding mutations.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

Long-lived, resident tissue macrophages concentrated in the trabecular meshwork and Schlemms canal, whereas short-lived monocyte-derived macrophages, instead, were abundant around distal vessels. Specific depletion of resident tissue macrophages triggered elevated intraocular pressure and outflow resistance, linked to aberrant extracellular matrix turnover in the resistance-generating tissues of the trabecular meshwork.

Efforts have been made to experimentally define the escape mutations from specific antibodies in specific viral strains, but it remains unclear how much the effects of mutations on neutralization differ among HIV strains. Here, we use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning to comprehensively map escape mutations from the V3 loop targeting antibody 10-1074 and the CD4-binding site targeting antibody 3BNC117 for both a clade A (BF520) and a clade B (TRO.11) HIV Envelope (Env). Mutations that escape neutralization by antibody 10-1074 are largely similar for the two Envs, but mutations that escape 3BNC117 differ greatly between Envs. Some differences in the effects of mutations on escape between Envs can be explained by strain-to-strain variation in mutational tolerance or glycosylation patterns, but other mutations have different effects on escape for unclear reasons. Overall, the extent that measurements of mutational effects on antibody neutralization can be generalized across HIV strain differs among antibodies.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

Despite their evolutionary importance, the drivers of their diversity dynamics remain poorly understood. This study investigates the diversification patterns of Demospongiae, the largest class of sponges with a well-documented fossil record throughout the Phanerozoic Eon (541-0 Ma). Using fossil occurrence data and a Bayesian framework, we modeled origination and extinction rates to understand their evolutionary history.

Our findings reveal key extinction events, including three previously unrecognized events in the Cambrian, Late Silurian, and Late Jurassic, alongside known events such as the Permian-Triassic and Triassic-Jurassic extinctions. Notably, there was no statistical evidence for mass extinction during the Late Ordovician or Late Devonian. Additionally, Demosponges underwent a significant decline prior to the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction.

To explore abiotic influences, we applied the Multivariate Birth-Death (MBD) model across all extinction events. This analysis identified correlations between major speciation and extinction events and key variables, including temperature, continental fragmentation, oxygen levels, and sea level, as well as geochemical proxies such as sulfur and strontium, which may reflect underlying drivers like anoxia, weathering, or tectonic activity. Temperature and oxygen levels, in particular, correlated with speciation and extinction during the Permian-Triassic extinction.

These findings underscore the role of environmental fluctuations in shaping demosponge diversity and highlight the complex interplay between changes in abiotic factors and sponge evolution. Our work provides critical insights into the factors driving sponge biodiversity and offers perspectives on how modern sponges might respond to ongoing climate change.

Significance StatementSponges are ancient and ecologically pivotal marine organisms that have persisted through Earths major environmental upheavals. Despite their resilience, the mechanisms driving their evolutionary responses to past climate shifts remain unclear. By leveraging the fossil record of Demospongiae, this study identifies previously unrecognized extinction events and elucidates how abiotic factors, including temperature and oxygen levels, shaped their diversity during these crises. These findings enhance our understanding of sponge evolutionary dynamics and resilience, offering critical insights into the vulnerability of marine ecosystems under current and future climate change scenarios.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

However, functional characterization of smRNAs remains limited by the scale and simplicity of phenotypic readouts. Recently, single-cell perturbation screening methods, which link CRISPR-mediated genetic perturbations to rich transcriptomic profiling, have emerged as foundational and scalable approaches for understanding gene functions, mapping regulatory networks, and revealing genetic interactions. However, a comparable approach for probing the regulatory consequences of smRNA perturbations is lacking. Here, we present Decoy-seq as an extension of this approach for high-content, single-cell perturbation screening of smRNAs. This method leverages U6-driven tough decoys (TuD), which form stable duplexes with their target smRNAs, for inhibition in the cell. Lentiviral-encoded TuDs are compatible with conventional single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, allowing joint identification of the smRNA perturbation in each cell and its associated transcriptomic profile. We applied Decoy-seq to 336 microRNAs (miRNAs) and 196 tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) in a human breast cancer cell line, demonstrating its ability to uncover complex regulatory pathways and novel functions of these smRNAs. Notably, we show that tRFs influence mRNA polyadenylation and regulate key cancer-associated processes, such as cell cycle progression and proliferation. Therefore, Decoy-seq provides a powerful framework for exploring the functional roles of smRNAs in normal physiology and disease, and holds promise for accelerating future discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

Here, we fine-tune the mechanical environment of murine gastruloids, three-dimensional in vitro models of early embryogenesis, by embedding them in bioinert hydrogels with precisely tunable stiffness and timing of application. This approach reveals that external constraints can selectively influence transcriptional profiles, patterning, or morphology, depending on the level and timing of mechanical modulation. Gastruloids embedded in ultra-soft hydrogels (< 30 Pa) elongate robustly, preserving both anteroposterior patterning and transcriptional profiles. In contrast, embedding at higher stiffness disrupts polarization while leaving gene expression largely unaffected. Conversely, earlier embedding significantly impacts transcriptional profiles independently of polarization defects, highlighting the uncoupling of patterning and transcription. These findings suggest that distinct cellular states respond differently to external constraints. Live imaging and cell tracking demonstrate that impaired cell motility underlies polarization defects, underscoring the role of mechanical forces in shaping morphogenesis independently of transcriptional changes. By allowing precise control over external mechanical boundaries, our approach provides a powerful platform to dissect how physical and biochemical factors interact to orchestrate early embryonic development.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

In areas with lower UV radiation, light pigmentation alleles increased in frequency because of their adaptive advantage and of other contingent factors such as migration and drift. However, the tempo and mode of their spread is not known. Phenotypic inference from ancient DNA is complicated, both because these traits are polygenic, and because of low sequence depth. We evaluated the effects of the latter by randomly removing reads in two high-coverage ancient samples, the Paleolithic Ust-Ishim from Russia and the Mesolithic SF12 from Sweden. We could thus compare three approaches to pigmentation inference, concluding that, for subop-timal levels of coverage (<8x), a probabilistic method estimating genotype likelihoods leads to the most robust predictions. We then applied that protocol to 348 ancient genomes from Eura-sia, describing how skin, eye and hair color evolved over the past 45,000 years. The shift to-wards lighter pigmentations turned out to be all but linear in time and place, and slower than ex-pected, with half of the individuals showing dark or intermediate skin colors well into the Copper and Iron ages. We also observed a peak of light eye pigmentation in Mesolithic times, and an accelerated change during the spread of Neolithic farmers over Western Eurasia, although local-ized processes of gene flow and admixture, or lack thereof, also played a significant role.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

Whilst aspects of quantitative agreement have been achieved for flat monolayers, the most striking features of tissue morphogenesis -- such as symmetry breaking, folding and invagination -- concern surfaces with complex curved geometries. As yet, however, characterizing such complex behaviors in three dimensions has been frustrated due to the absence of proper image analysis methods; current state-of-the-art methods almost exclusively rely on two-dimensional (2D) intensity projections of multiple image planes, which superimpose data and lose geometric information that can be crucial. Here, we describe an analysis pipeline that properly captures the nematic order of tissue surfaces of arbitrary geometry, which we demonstrate in the context of in vitro multicellular aggregates, and in vivo zebrafish hearts. For the former, we correlate the number of topological defects with the aggregates surface area and verify theoretical predictions, whilst for the latter, we link biological properties to physical concepts (Laplace pressure) through spatio-temporal correlations of the heart geometry with fluorescence signals of intracellular proteins.

The estrogen-related receptor (ERR) subfamily of orphan nuclear receptors are major transcriptional regulators of metabolism. In mammals, ERRs have roles in regulating mitochondrial biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, as well as stem cell maintenance. The sole Drosophila ERR ortholog promotes larval growth by establishing a metabolic state during the latter half of embryogenesis. In addition, ERR is required in adult Drosophila males to coordinate glycolytic metabolism with lipid synthesis and within the testis to regulate spermatogenesis gene expression and fertility. Despite extensive work characterizing of the role of ERR in Drosophila metabolism, whether ERR has a conserved requirement in regulating stem cell behavior has been understudied. To determine whether ERR regulates stem cell activity in Drosophila, we used the established adult female germline stem cell (GSC) lineage as a model. We found that whole-body ERR knockout in adult females using conditional heat shock-driven FLP-FRT recombination significantly reduces egg production and decreases GSC number. In addition, we found that ERR activity is required cell-autonomously in the adult female germline for maintenance of GSCs; whereas ERR regulation of GSCs is independent of its activity in adult female adipocytes. Our results highlight an ancient and conserved role for ERRs in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

We here developed an algorithm for automatic detection of micro-arousals based on EMG activity and used it to explore how micro-arousals modulate laminar neural activity in the motor cortex, and how this relationship is affected by sleep pressure in mice. Our analysis showed that micro-arousals were associated with a general suppression of local field potential (LFP) power across the cortical column.

A case in point is of the highly conserved SOS response thwat is regulated by the LexA repressor. Studies have proposed that affinity of LexA towards promoters of SOS response genes is the primary determinant of its expression dynamics. Here, we describe an additional level of regulation beyond LexA properties that modulates the SOS response gene expression pattern. Using transcriptomic analyses, we reveal a distinct temporal hierarchy in the induction of SOS-regulated genes in Caulobacter crescentus. We observe that LexA properties are insufficient in predicting the temporal hierarchy of these genes. Instead, we find that intrinsic promoter strength underlies the order of gene activation, with differential sigma factor association as a key factor in modulating gene expression timing. Our findings highlight a novel regulatory layer in SOS dynamics and underscore the importance of promoter properties in shaping bacterial stress responses.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

Understanding how distinct sensory cues elicit or modulate certain behaviour thus provides insights into the neuronal adaptations to rapid and continuous changes in the surrounding world. Intertidal ecosystems are a particularly exposed to environmental fluctuations. Due to changing exposure to seawater, animals are subjected to continuous fluctuations of temperature or salinity during the course of day-night and tidal cycles. Animals in the intertidal environment show physiological and behavioural adaptations to these changes. When the acoel Symsagittifera roscoffensis is exposed to daylight during the tidal cycle, these animals are found at the surface of sandy beaches, which enhance the exposure of their photosynthetic algal (Tetraselmis convolutae) symbionts to light. Moreover, S. roscoffensis shows a strong positive phototactic displacement as well as both positive and negative geotaxis, both being evolved behavioural adaptations to enhance light-exposure for its photosymbiont. Currently little is known about other sensory systems and their functions in S. roscoffensis. In this study, we probe sensory capabilities of S. roscoffensis focusing on chemical and temperature cues. Our findings support that S. roscoffensis shows avoidance behaviours to increased temperature and high salinity, preferring cooler environments with lower salinity.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

For staphylococcal pathogens such as S. aureus, QS regulates expression of major virulence factors and QS inhibition has been proposed as an alternative to antibiotics for treatment of infections with methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Here, we surveyed the interaction map between QS systems of the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus lugdunensis and the 36 currently known AIPs from 22 staphylococcal species. We identified seven of these ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) in this study and all synthetic peptides were assessed for their ability to modulate QS. The mapped interactions of >280 native QS pairings were divided into human- and animal-associated staphylococci showing substantial differences in inhibitory potencies between the groups. In particular, AIPs of the bovine-associated species S. simulans displayed potential as QS inhibitors in the strains investigated in this study and were therefore chosen as starting point for a structure-activity relationship study. This study provides insights into the requirements for QS interference, yielding the most potent inhibitors reported to date for S. epidermidis and S. lugdunensis. Further, we tested an S. simulans AIP as anti-virulence agent in an assay to assess risk of acquired suppression of the inhibitory effect, and we established an assay set-up to successfully monitor agr deactivation of virulent MRSA by the QS inhibitor. Finally, a peptide was shown to attenuate skin infection caused by MRSA in a mouse model. Our results reveal a complex network of staphylococcal interactions and provide further impetus for the development of therapeutic strategies, based on QS modulation to target antibiotic-resistant pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

Early-life stress can have severe and lifelong effects on Darwinian fitness. Indeed, it is well established that being reared in a larger brood impairs growth and fitness prospects of birds, but the mechanistic underpinnings of this effect are still largely unknown. Specifically, it is not well known to what extent the reduced growth and fitness prospects of nestlings reared in large broods is due to increased resource allocation to competition versus a per capita reduction in parental provisioning rate, or a combination of the two. We cross-fostered zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) chicks into small and large broods, and recorded their growth as well as the behavior of parents and offspring throughout the nestling period. As in previous experiments, growth rate was higher in small broods. In large broods, chicks begged more and parents invested more time feeding which more than compensated for the difference in brood size. We therefore conclude that the lower growth rate for nestlings raised in large broods must be attributed to increased energy expenditure on begging rather than a reduction in the amount of food received. These results suggest significant energetic costs associated with begging and raise the interesting possibility that brood size would not have negatively affected growth in large broods if chicks had not increased their begging effort due to increased levels of competition in nest.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

The mucosal layer that lines all epithelial cells organizes, cultivates, and regulates these bacterial inhabitants. Some commensal bacteria offer benefits, like improving gut barrier function, suppressing pathobiont growth, and modulating host immunity. These health benefits have fueled the popularity of probiotics, but their retention is often hindered by their low colonization efficiency and mucosal adhesion. Mucins, the primary structural components of the mucosal layer, are essential for the organization and regulation of microbial populations, promoting growth and offering sites for adhesion through their multivalent presentation of O-glycosylation. The molecular mechanisms of mucin- probiotic interactions remain understudied due, in part, to the inability to incisively manipulate native mucin sequences or the glycans they bear. In this investigation, we developed synthetic mucins with defined glycan presentations to interrogate glycan-dependent interactions between mucus and probiotic Lactobacillus species. Though synthetic mucins can dampen the effects of pathogens, toxins, and viruses, their impact on probiotic bacteria as prebiotics or binding sites is unclear. We synthesized mucin surrogates that bind to three investigated Lactobacillus species. The nutrient conditions under which bacteria were cultured influenced glycan binding preferences, suggesting mucin-probiotic interactions change with nutrient availability. The addition of synthetic mucins to native mucin increased Lactobacillus fermentum adherence. Additionally, an increase in Lactobacillus glycosidase activity indicated that native and synthetic mucins both function as prebiotics, as probiotic bacteria can cleave the displayed O-glycans. Thus, synthetic mucins can cultivate target probiotic bacteria and increase adhesion as binding sites, highlighting their value as tools for elucidating native mucin functions and as promising agents for promoting human health.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

Traditionally, research has largely focused on Radial Glial Cells (RGCs), which produce neurons and glia. However, recent findings revealed that the progenitor landscape is more complex and heterogeneous than previously understood. Emerging evidence indicates that NG2 glia, also known as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), may contribute to generating other cell types, including neurons and astrocytes. This suggests that NG2 glia, or a specific subset, may act as multipotent NPCs, expanding their role in brain development beyond their known lineage.

We explore the cellular, molecular, and functional differences between NG2- and GFAP- expressing progenitors (NG2-NPCs and GFAP-NPCs) across different developmental stages. Using in-utero electroporation and StarTrack technology, we examined whether these progenitors represent distinct populations and analyzed how their differences influence their functional roles based on cell fate decisions. Our findings uncover functional divergence between NG2-NPCs and GFAP-NPCs, particularly regarding their cell fate decisions. While both populations contribute to the formation of neurons and glial cells, the progeny of NG2-NPCs and GFAP-NPCs differ markedly in their contributions to neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Further, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of NG2-NPCs and GFAP-NPCs to elucidate the molecular basis for these functional differences. This study demonstrates distinct gene expression profiles. While NG2-NPCs show enrichment for genes associated with neurogenesis and synaptic transport, GFAP-NPCs displayed upregulation of genes involved in progenitor cell maintenance. This indicates that each progenitor type is governed by distinct molecular programs, shaping their contributions to brain architecture and function. In summary, our findings underscore the divergent roles of NG2-NPCs and GFAP-NPCs in driving cellular diversity and functional maturation in brain development, providing new insights into how these progenitor populations contribute to neural diversity and brain function.

However, existing methods to infer mutation ages and populations of origin do not explicitly consider population structure, migration rates, and divergence times, which may bias estimates, and it is unclear how to even apply single-population estimators to structured populations. We develop a method to jointly estimate the time and population of origin of a mutation (as well as the ancestral and derived states) in a structured population using population genomic data and examine its statistical performance using simulations. Results indicate that mutation age and population of origin can be quite uncertain, even with long sequences or many samples, but this uncertainty is accurately captured using credible intervals/sets. The ancestral nucleotide state is relatively easy to infer. We apply our method to whole genome data from the 1000 Genomes Project, analyzing seven SNP mutations from six genes associated with human skin pigmentation for populations from Great Britain, China, and Kenya. Our results partially support previous conclusions, with the putative ancestral alleles from the literature matching our inferences, while the mutation age estimates only overlap in some cases. Furthermore, there are non-trivial posterior probabilities of recurrence for three of the mutations.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

Conventional genetic and biochemical approaches aimed at identifying ligand-receptor pairs in plant immunity have been limited by the vast diversity of potential ligand molecules and functional redundancy of putative receptors. Here, we developed a high-throughput screening pipeline that simultaneously examines multiple interactions between plant cell wall-derived glycans and >350 extracellular domains (ECDs) of receptor kinases and receptor like proteins in Arabidopsis, resulting in the screening of >40,000 interactions. We discovered a group of leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases named ARMs (AWARENESS of RG-I MAINTENANCES) that interact with rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I), a major component of pectin. RG-I treatment induced pattern-triggered immunity responses, with distinct kinetics compared to oligogalacturonide responses.

We find that myelin matures along a deep-to-superficial axis in the PFC; this axis of maturational timing is expressed to a different extent in cytoarchitecturally distinct regions along the frontal cortical hierarchy. By integrating myelin mapping with electroencephalogram and cognitive phenotyping, we provide evidence that deep and superficial prefrontal myelin dissociably impact timescales of neural activity, task learning rates, and cognitive processing speed.

Bumble bees are particularly vulnerable to these shifts, with resource availability playing a significant role in colony establishment and success. Recently, we documented a mechanism whereby pollen-deprived bumble bees deliberately damaged plant leaves, speeding up the production of flowers in two different species. However, it is unknown whether bumble bees obtain a benefit through this behaviour, both on a spatial and temporal scale. In the current study, we evaluate the effects of pollen availability on colony development, behaviour and reproductive fitness in Bombus terrestris using semi-natural and laboratory experiments. We find that the close proximity of flowers has significant effects on reproductive investment and output of B. terrestris colonies in a small-scale rooftop experiment. Moreover, we find that small shifts in the timing of pollen availability (5 days) shape the behaviour and development of the first generation of offspring, with significant carry-over effects on reproductive fitness for B. terrestris microcolonies. This suggests that small changes in the distribution of food may have significant impacts on colony success that cannot be compensated for over the course of the season.

We used highly multiplexed imaging to quantify the subcellular localization of 37 proteins in each tumor. To extract meaningful information from the imaging data, we developed SpaceCat, a computational pipeline that quantifies features from imaging data such as cell density, cell diversity, spatial structure, and functional marker expression. We applied SpaceCat to 678 images from 294 tumors, generating more than 800 distinct features per tumor. Spatial features were more predictive of patient outcome, including features like the degree of mixing between cancer and immune cells, the diversity of the neighboring immune cells surrounding cancer cells, and the degree of T cell infiltration at the tumor border. Non-spatial features, including the ratio between T cell subsets and cancer cells and PD-L1 levels on myeloid cells, were also associated with patient outcome. Surprisingly, we did not identify robust predictors of response in the primary tumors. In contrast, the metastatic tumors had numerous features which predicted response. Some of these features, such as the cellular diversity at the tumor border, were shared across timepoints, but many of the features, such as T cell infiltration at the tumor border, were predictive of response at only a single timepoint. We trained multivariate models on all of the features in the dataset, finding that we could accurately predict patient outcome from the pre-treatment metastatic tumors, with improved performance using the on-treatment tumors. We validated our findings in matched bulk RNA-seq data, finding the most informative features from the on-treatment samples. Our study highlights the importance of profiling sequential tumor biopsies to understand the evolution of the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the temporal and spatial dynamics underlying patient responses and underscoring the need for further research on the prognostic role of metastatic tissue and its utility in stratifying patients for ICI.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

Although the corticospinal tract is critical for gait and postural control, its response to such instabilities remains unclear. To investigate if corticospinal excitability increases during unpredictable lateral destabilisations, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulations were delivered over the primary motor cortex of 15 healthy individuals during steady-state and randomly laterally destabilised treadmill gait. Full-body kinematics were recorded using an optoelectronic motion capture system. Stimulations where the coil was >5 mm from the target location on the head were excluded. Corticospinal excitability was quantified for four upper- and three lower-leg muscles as the amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP) and compared between steady-state and destabilised gait. Lateral destabilisation resulted in a wider step width and shorter stride duration with increased variability and greater dynamic instability. Foot placement control during laterally destabilised gait was increased at midstance and there was also an increased average foot placement error in this condition. No differences in corticospinal excitability were observed in the lower-leg muscles. All upper-leg muscles demonstrated greater absolute MEPs in destabilised relative to steady-state gait. After normalising to muscle activity these periods became less pronounced, however, increases in corticospinal excitability during destabilised gait were observed in all but the gastrocnemius muscles. These finding suggest a heightened readiness of the corticospinal tract projecting to upper-leg muscles during destabilised gait, which could reflect general stabilising strategies such as decreasing stride time and increasing step width. Increases in the relative contribution of the corticospinal tract (i.e. normalised MEPs) were primarily noted during periods of low muscle activity, possibly hinting towards greater motor planning.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

Although the primate lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in working memory and the neural representation of short-term memory has been reported, little is known about neuronal activity during memory updating. We trained macaque monkeys to perform an oculomotor version of the n-back task, in which the animals were required to remember the location of serially presented visual stimuli and generate a saccade to the location of the most recent or previous stimulus according to the instructions. We found that many neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex showed transient activity when the memory of a particular stimulus location was no longer needed, whereas other neurons showed sustained activity when the stimulus location was maintained in memory. Decoding analysis successfully predicted future target selection from neuronal activity, indicating that these neuronal populations contain sufficient information to guide behavior. Furthermore, electrical stimulation applied to recording sites during the task erased specific spatial memories, suggesting that these neurons are causally involved in the retention of short-term memories and their dynamic control.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

In cardiomyocytes, we previously showed that PIEZO1 decodes mechanical cues driving pressure-overload induced hypertrophy. However, conflicting reports exist on the influence of PIEZO1 on baseline cardiac function. Here we show that conditional deletion of Piezo1 from cardiomyocytes in adult mice results in premature mortality. The hearts from these mice exhibited signs of accelerated aging, including elevated markers of the senescence associated secretory phenotype, with significant blunting of the normal cardiac hypertrophic response to aging, associated with a reduction in the activation of the pro-hypertrophic Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Functionally, aged-Piezo1 KO mice exhibited impaired cardiac relaxation due to altered cellular Ca2+ handling kinetics. Young adult Piezo1 KO mice exhibited a normal resting heart rate but developed significant progressive sinus bradycardia and cardiac fibrotic remodelling with aging, which was most prominent in the right atrium, where Piezo1 expression is highest in the healthy heart. Mechanistically, loss of PIEZO1 was associated with a marked reduction in the anti-fibrotic molecule, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Moreover, in vivo, ANP release instigated by atrial stretch was markedly blunted in conditional Piezo1 KO mice, providing a plausible and long sought-after mechanism for the link between mechanical stretch and ANP release. Taken together, our data show that PIEZO1 is a crucial homeostatic molecule during cardiac aging, enabling adaptation to an aging tissue microenvironment.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

Atherosclerosis is driven by the accumulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the formation of foam cells, accompanied by oxidative stress and the deposition of oxidized LDL (OxLDL), a pro-inflammatory molecule. Lowering LDL is the mainstay of current medical treatment in addition to blood pressure control and lifestyle changes, but to date, specifically targeting the inflammatory pathways contributing to plaque development without significant systemic side effects has not been feasible. Over the past decade, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have treated cancer and restored immune imbalance in autoimmune diseases in patients and resolved cardiac fibrosis in preclinical models. Using an inducible T regulatory cell (Treg) platform, we created an anti-OxLDL-specific CAR Treg therapy that exerts cell- and cytokine-mediated immunosuppression to reduce macrophage-foam cell formation in vitro. Murine anti-OxLDL CAR Tregs inhibited 80% of atherosclerotic plaque formation in immunocompetent mouse models of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. These studies illustrate the potential of anti-OxLDL CAR Tregs to mitigate the inflammation and plaque deposition associated with OxLDL, potentially offering a new therapeutic option for atherosclerosis.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285505

Using high-throughput directed evolution, we engineered the rice immune receptor Pik-1 to bind and recognize the fungal proteins Avr-PikC and Avr-PikF, which evade detection by currently characterized Pik-1 alleles. A protein language model was fine-tuned on this data to correlate sequence variation with ligand binding behavior. This modeling was then used to characterize Pik-1 variants found in the 3,000 Rice Genomes Project dataset. Two variants scored highly for binding against Avr-PikC, and in vitro analyses confirmed their improved ligand binding over the wild-type Pik-1 receptor. Overall, this machine learning approach identified promising sources of disease resistance in rice and shows potential utility for exploring the phenotypic variation of other proteins of interest.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285506

While U. maydis induces tumors locally at sites of infection, S. reilianum systemically colonizes the host and causes symptoms in the inflorescences. To investigate the genetic basis of these differences, an interspecific recombinant hybrid (rUSH) with the mating type system of S. reilianum was generated. rUSH exhibited extensive in-planta proliferation, showing a S. reilianum-like phenotype at all developmental stages except teliospore formation. Transcriptome profiling revealed that expression of pathogenicity-related effector gene orthologs was induced in rUSH, but not in a wild-type hybrid control. Multiple transcriptome comparisons identified 253 differentially expressed one-to-one effector orthologs with distinct regulatory patterns, including cis-, trans-, and rUSH-specific regulation. Functional analysis via CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis uncovered three novel virulence factors among the rUSH-specific regulated effectors. Ultimately, rUSH facilitated to identify the transcription factor UmHdp2 as key regulator of U. maydis-induced tumorigenesis. Together, these findings highlight the utility of a recombinant, interspecific hybrid in unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenic differences in closely related fungal pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285506

By using a Nematostella transgenic reporter line expressing mCherry under the RLRb antiviral promoter we show that cells fluorescent upon stimulation with the viral mimic poly(I:C) are morphologically and transcriptomically distinct.

Cilia structures rely on intraflagellar transport (IFT), which involves dynein-2 for retrograde and kinesin-2 for anterograde movements along doublet microtubules. Unlike dynein-1, which works on singlet microtubules within the cytoplasm, dynein-2 specifically works on the doublet microtubules inside the cilia. Previous cryo-electron tomography studies have shown that retrograde IFT, driven by dynein-2, occurs on the A-tubule of the doublet, suggesting a specialized regulatory mechanism involving dynein-2. However, the molecular basis of this specificity remains unclear. Here, we investigated this mechanism using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) with Volta Phase Plate (VPP), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and biochemical analysis. Our biochemical assay revealed that the microtubule-binding domain of dynein-2 exhibits a higher affinity for the ciliary doublet microtubule compared to dynein-1. Cryo-ET with VPP further visualized the preferential binding of dynein-2 to the A-tubule of the doublet microtubule. MD simulations suggest that the preferential binding of dynein-2 is attributed to the tyrosinated tubulin in the A-tubule. These findings uncover a tyrosination-dependent regulatory mechanism that governs the bidirectional transport of IFT on doublet microtubules, providing new insights into the spatial and functional specialization of ciliary transport systems.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285506

The approach has been successful in pinpointing risk genes for various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and different types of cancers. TWAS typically involves two key steps: imputation and association analysis. In the imputation step, the original PrediXcan employs the elastic-net model, while subsequent research endeavors have delved into more intricate models such as FUSION and TIGAR. Despite these advancements, the existing individual methods may not capture the intricate genotype-expression relationships in a comprehensive way. Given the complexity of genetic contributions of genotypes to gene expression, sophisticated modeling techniques are imperative. In response to this, we have introduced Aggregated-TWAS (A-TWAS), a comprehensive tool that amalgamates multiple imputation models to accommodate diverse genetic architectures. A-TWAS utilizes several continuous shrinkage priors, including Laplace, Horseshoe, and Horseshoe+, to ensure precise imputation results while incorporating the benefits of Bayesian variable selection methods. In the association phase of TWAS, we employ the aggregated Cauchy association test (ACAT) to obtain an omnibus p-value. Result: We demonstrate the effectiveness of A-TWAS through comprehensive simulations and real data analyses. Simulation studies highlight that A-TWAS produces substantial improvements in predictive R^2 and statistical power, while maintaining the type error I at a low level. Furthermore, TWASs are conducted on schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive symptoms datasets. In comparison to standard methods, the Bayesian imputation model demonstrates superior accuracy, and A-TWAS, by integrating multiple Bayesian priors, identifies a notably greater number of disease-relevant genes.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285506

Ecdysone hormones play a crucial role in regulating the molting process of different ecdysozoan taxa. Interestingly, despite this highly conserved function of ecdysone, the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has lost the ecdysone receptor (ECR) genes and their molting appears to be ecdysone-independent. The loss of ecr has only been reported in Caenorhabditis within ecdysozoans, and the evolutionary background behind this loss has remained enigmatic. Here, we show that loss of ecr is not exceptional in Caenorhabditis, but has occurred at least three times in Rhabditina and Tylenchina nematodes. Our genome-wide analysis of 160 nematode species revealed the multiple losses of ecr and its typical heterodimer partner usp during nematode evolution. Furthermore, using genomic and transcriptomic analyses, we identified two factors that likely underlie and buffer the loss of ECR gene/function: molting regulation by an alternative nuclear receptor HR3 (NHR-23) and a lineage-specific expansion of nuclear receptors in the ecr-deficient taxa. Taken together, it is suggested that ecdysone/ECR function in nematodes is only minor or redundant. We propose a novel scenario for the evolution of molting regulation, highlighting the importance of HR3 as the potential core regulator.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285506

A total of 70 participants were included (35 patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders [DSM-IV F20-29], 35 age-and sex-matched controls).

Participants performed self-/other-touch-tasks and interoceptive assessments during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), evoked potentials (EP) measurements, and/or behavioral and psychophysical tests.

Primary outcomes included neural and behavioral responses to self-and externally-generated sensations (touch and heartbeat). Brain activation (fMRI), spinal responses (EPs), heartbeat perception and processing (EPs), and behavioral measures were analyzed, with preregistered hypotheses.

Patients demonstrated heightened neural activity during touch tasks, including increased right superior temporal gyrus activation during self-touch and heightened activity in a right temporoparietal cluster during social touch. Tactile self-other distinction impairments were evident at the spinal cord level (EPs). Behaviorally, patients showed reduced differentiation in tactile thresholds for self-vs. other-touch. Interoceptive impairments included diminished cortical responses to heartbeat signals (EPs), lower interoceptive accuracy (heartbeat detection), and reduced self-reported interoceptive sensitivity.

These findings reveal pervasive sensory and self-related disturbances in psychotic disorders. Impairments in differentiating self-and externally-evoked responses, detectable as early as the spinal cord level, may contribute to higher-order symptoms of psychosis.","NA","medrxiv",1738361285506

- With age, neural state duration increases in multiple brain regions
- This effect is strongest in the visual cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex
- The overlap between neural states and event boundaries does not decline with age
- This suggest that coarse event perception is relatively preserved with age


While life is experienced continuously, we tend to perceive it as a series of events. At a neural level, this event segmentation process has been linked to changes in neural states. An open question is whether these neural states differ with age. Participants (N = 577) from the CamCAN cohort viewed an 8-min movie during fMRI. A data-driven state segmentation method was used to identify neural state changes. To study the effects of age, participants were sorted into 34 age groups. We show that neural states become significantly longer with increasing age, particularly in visual and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. Perceived event boundaries overlapped with state changes in superior temporal and dorsomedial prefrontal regions, but there was no effect of age on this relationship. Our results suggest reduced temporal differentiation of successive neural states with increasing age. Nevertheless, preserved alignment between neural states and perceived events suggests that coarse event segmentation remains intact.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285506

The cell envelopes assembly and maintenance influence permeability, making it a key target against multidrug-resistant strains. Disulfide bond (DSB) formation is crucial for the folding of cell envelope proteins. The DSB pathway in mycobacteria includes two enzymes, DsbA and VKOR, required for survival. Using bioinformatics and cysteine profiling proteomics, we identified cell envelope proteins dependent on DSBs. We validated via in vivo alkylation that key proteins like LamA (MmpS3), PstP, LpqW, and EmbB rely on DSBs for stability. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of VKOR results in phenotypes similar to those of {Delta}vkor. Thus, targeting DsbA-VKOR systems could compromise both cell division and mycomembrane integrity. These findings emphasize the potential of DSB inhibition as a novel strategy to combat mycobacterial infections.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285506

OAS2 comprises two OAS domains, only one of which can synthesize 2-5-oligoadenylates for RNase L activation. Existing structures of OAS1 provide a model for enzyme activation, but do not explain how multiple OAS domains discriminate RNA length. Here, we discover that OAS2 exists in an autoinhibited state as a zinc-mediated dimer and present a mechanism for RNA length discrimination: the catalytically deficient domain acts as a molecular ruler that prevents autoreactivity to short RNAs. We demonstrate that dimerization and myristoylation localize OAS2 to Golgi membranes and that this is required for OAS2 activation and restriction of viruses that exploit the endomembrane system for replication, e.g. coronaviruses. Finally, our results highlight the non-redundant role of OAS proteins and emphasize the clinical relevance of OAS2 by identifying a patient with a loss-of-function mutation leading to autoimmune disease.","NA","biorxiv",1738361285506

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia. In the sotrovimab comparison, eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either usual care alone or usual care plus a single 1g dose of sotrovimab, using web-based unstratified randomisation. Participants were retrospectively categorised according to their baseline serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen concentration as  high-antigen or  low-antigen, using the median concentration as a cut-off. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed by intention to treat. Secondary outcomes were time to discharge alive from hospital, and, among those not on invasive ventilation at baseline, progression to invasive ventilation or death. Recruitment closed on 31 March 2024 when funding ended. ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsFrom 4 January 2022 to 19 March 2024, 1723 patients were recruited to the sotrovimab comparison. 720 (42%) were classified as high-antigen, 717 (42%) as low-antigen, and 286 (17%) had unknown antigen status. Over 80% of patients were vaccinated, over 80% had anti-spike antibodies at randomisation, and almost all were infected with Omicron variants. In the prespecified primary efficacy population of high-antigen patients, 82/355 (23%) allocated sotrovimab versus 106/365 (29%) allocated usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.75; 95% CI 0.56-0.99; p=0.046). In an analysis of all randomised patients (regardless of antigen status), 177/828 (21%) allocated sotrovimab versus 201/895 (22%) allocated usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.95; 95% CI 0.77-1.16; p=0.60).

InterpretationIn patients hospitalised with COVID-19, sotrovimab was associated with reduced mortality in the primary analysis population of patients with a high serum SARS-CoV-2 antigen concentration at baseline, but not in the overall population.

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1738361285506

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1738361285506
