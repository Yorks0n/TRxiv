H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b exhibits tropism for the mammary gland, with milk from infected cows containing high levels of viral RNA and infectious virus. The virus's ability to infect the mammary gland suggests potential risks of transmission to offspring through breastfeeding. Here, we show that mammary gland infection with bovine H5N1 influenza in lactating ferrets transmits virus and disease to suckling kits. Viral RNA titers significantly increased in milk over time and remained high in mammary gland tissue. Suckling kits had significantly increased viral RNA in the oral and nasal cavity, as well as in feces. However, viral detection in the dam nasal cavities was delayed, with only minimal virus present in the oral cavity. Lung viral RNA levels were low in dams but high in a sampled suckling kit. Additionally, we detected the expression of the H5N1 receptor, 2,3 sialic acid, in mammary tissue from both ferrets and humans. These data demonstrate that H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b infection in lactating dams leads to mastitis-related disease and transmits to suckling pups, resulting in 100% mortality among the neonates.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Designing the kinetics and dynamics of a system requires, in addition, the design of excited states that are traversed in transitions from one low-lying state to another. This is a challenging task as such states must be sufficiently strained to be poorly populated, but not so strained that they are not populated at all, and because protein design methods have generally focused on creating near-ideal structures. Here we describe a general approach for designing systems which use an induced-fit power stroke to generate a structurally frustrated and strained excited state, allosterically driving protein complex dissociation. X-ray crystallography, double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy, and kinetic binding measurements demonstrate that incorporating excited states enables design of effector-induced increases in dissociation rates as high as 6000-fold. We highlight the power of this approach by designing cytokine mimics which can be dissociated within seconds from their receptors.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

While human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived organoids are valuable models for studying human organ function, they often lack critical tissue-resident immune cells. Here, we introduce an advanced human heart assembloid model, termed hHMA (human heart-macrophage assembloid), which fully integrates autologous cardiac tissue-resident macrophages (MPs) with pre-existing human heart organoids (hHOs). Through multi-omic analyses, we confirmed that these MPs are phenotypically similar to embryonic cardiac tissue-resident MPs and remain viable in the assembloids over time. The inclusion of MPs significantly impacts hHMA development, influencing cardiac cellular composition, boosting cellular communication, remodeling the extracellular matrix, promoting ventricular morphogenesis, and enhancing sarcomeric maturation. Our findings indicate that MPs contribute to homeostasis via efferocytosis, integrate into the cardiomyocyte electrical system, and support catabolic metabolism. To demonstrate the versatility of this model, we developed a platform to study cardiac arrhythmias by chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory factors linked to arrhythmogenesis in clinical settings, successfully replicating key features of inflammasome-mediated atrial fibrillation. Overall, this work introduces a robust platform for examining the role of immune cells in cardiac development, disease mechanisms, and drug discovery, bridging the gap between in vitro models and human physiology. These findings offer insights into cardiogenesis and inflammation-driven heart disease, positioning the hHMA system as an invaluable tool for future cardiovascular research and therapeutic development.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Despite ongoing surveillance and control measures recommended by animal and public health authorities to limit viral spread, new herds continue to report infections. We show here that the continued spread between farms could be explained by the rapid pace of pathogen spread reported within farms, which greatly limits the potential effectiveness of these recommendations. Under reasonable surveillance strategies, we show that the time farms have to mobilize interventions is extremely limited, as few as a couple days and typically less than a week. Our findings suggest that passive surveillance measures, such as detection of H5N1 via weekly bulk milk testing, comes too late such that most infections have already occurred. For current interventions to be valuable, more sensitive and extensive surveillance is needed and an emphasis should be placed on biosecurity practices rather than reactive practices.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

To address this, we present a comprehensive assessment of tissue changes occurring during human aging, utilizing a vast array of whole slide histopathological images from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx). We analyzed 25,712 images from 40 distinct tissue types across 983 individuals, applying deep learning to quantify the nuanced morphological changes that tissues undergo with age. We developed 'tissue clocks' - predictors of biological age based on tissue images - which achieved a mean prediction error of 4.9 years and were associated with telomere attrition, the incidence of subclinical pathologies, and comorbidities. In a systematic assessment of biological age rates across organs, we identified pervasive non-uniform rates of aging across the human lifespan, with some organs exhibiting earlier changes (20-40 years old) and others showing bimodal patterns of age-related changes. We also uncovered several associations between demographic, lifestyle, and medical history factors and tissue-specific acceleration or deceleration of biological age, highlighting potential modifiable risk factors that influenced the aging process at the tissue level. Finally, by combining paired histological images and gene expression data, we developed a strategy to predict tissue-specific age gaps from blood samples. This approach was validated in external cohorts of both healthy individuals and those with chronic diseases, revealing the organs most differentially affected by aging in disease contexts. This work offers a new perspective on the aging process by positioning tissue structure as an integrator of cellular and molecular changes that reflect the physiological state of organs. These findings underscore the value of histopathological imaging as a tool for understanding human aging and provide a foundation for the exploration of tissue-specific aging processes in age-associated diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Oligodendrocyte maturation impacts the cell death mechanisms that occur in degenerative conditions, but it is unclear if and how the cell death machinery changes as OPCs transition into oligodendrocytes. Here, we discovered that differentiating oligodendrocytes transiently upregulate the zymogen procaspase-3, equipping these cells to make a survival decision during differentiation.

Acute inhibition of ATR with ATR inhibitor (ATRi) triggers a surge in origin firing, leading to increased levels of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that rapidly deplete all available RPA. This leaves ssDNA unprotected and susceptible to breakage, a phenomenon known as replication catastrophe. However, the mechanism by which unprotected ssDNA breaks remains unclear. Here, we reveal that APOBEC3B is the key enzyme targeting unprotected ssDNA at replication forks, triggering a reaction cascade that induces fork collapse and PARP1 hyperactivation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that uracils generated by APOBEC3B at replication forks are removed by UNG2, creating abasic sites that are subsequently cleaved by APE1 endonuclease. Moreover, we demonstrate that APE1-mediated DNA cleavage is the critical enzymatic step for PARP1 trapping and hyperactivation in cells, regardless of how abasic sites are generated on DNA. Finally, we show that APOBEC3B-induced toxic PARP1 trapping in response to ATRi drives cell sensitivity to ATR inhibition, creating to a context of synthetic lethality when combined with PARP inhibitors. Together, these findings reveal the mechanisms that cause replication forks to break during replication catastrophe and explain why ATRi-treated cells are particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Here, we present MinION sequence data, assembly and methylation analysis for the Columbia (Col-0) accession of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Further, we demonstrate the effect that recent developments (specifically the Q20+ chemistry and basecaller improvements) have had on read accuracy and assembly quality.

FindingsDNA extracted from leaves of A. thaliana Col-0 was sequenced on two MinION flow cells, together amounting to 115x coverage of the 135 Mb genome. Reads were assembled and polished using several bioinformatics pipelines for nanopore sequence data. We performed CpG methylation analysis directly from the nanopore data, and this correlated well with a previously published bisulfite dataset.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that a single MinION flow cell can generate sufficient data to assemble a genome of 135Mb, indicate functional elements, and unlock genomics for researchers of novel species from $600 in under 5 days. Here we release the full nanopore read sets for both flow cells, together with the nanopore-only assemblies.

So far, a well-known mammalian mutation PB2-E627K has not been maintained in AIV in poultry, which limits the spread of AIVs from avian to humans. Here, we discovered a variant, PB2-627V, which combines the properties of avian-like PB2-627E and human-like PB2-627K, overcoming host restrictions and posing a risk for human pandemics. Specifically, by screening the global PB2 sequences, we discovered a new independent cluster with PB2-627V emerged in the 2010s, which is prevalent in various avian, mammalian, and human isolates of AIVs, including H9N2, H7N9, H3N8, 2.3.4.4b H5N1, and other subtypes. And, the increasing prevalence of PB2-627V in poultry is accompanied by a rise in human infection cases with this variant. Then we systematically assessed its host adaptation, fitness, and transmissibility across three subtypes of AIVs (H9N2, H7N9, and H3N8) in different host models, including avian and human cells, chickens, mice, and ferrets where infections naturally occur. We found that PB2-627V facilitates AIVs to efficiently infect and replicate in chickens and mice by utilizing both avian- and human-origin ANP32A proteins. Importantly, and like PB2-627K, PB2-627V promotes efficient transmission between ferrets through respiratory droplets. Deep sequencing in passaged chicken samples and transmitted ferret samples indicates that PB2-627V remains stable across the two distinct hosts and has a high potential for long-term prevalence in avian species. Therefore, the mutation has the ability to continue spreading among poultry and can also overcome the barrier between birds and humans, greatly enhancing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, it is crucial to closely monitor influenza viruses carrying PB2-627V to prevent a pandemic.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Using direct long-read RNA sequencing on mouse tissue and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we demonstrate that the mitochondrial ribosomal gene cluster is not efficiently processed without mitochondrial SAM. This results in the accumulation of unprocessed ribosomal RNA precursors. Protein profiling of ribosome fractions revealed that these precursors are associated with processing and ribosome assembly factors, indicating stalling at an early stage.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes relevant to many physiological and pathological processes. As with all members of the steroid receptor family, GR forms condensates of unknown function. Here, we examine whether GR condensates are involved in transcription regulation using Airyscan super-resolution microscopy and nano-antibodies targeting initiation and elongating states of RNA polymerase II (Pol2). We observed subpopulations of GR condensates colocalizing with initiating and, surprisingly, elongating Pol2 foci. The analysis of GR mutants with different transcriptional outputs suggests a correlation between condensate formation capability and transcription initiation. Moreover, the number of GR molecules within initiation and elongation condensates appears to be linked to transcriptional activity. Taken together, our data suggests an involvement of GR condensates in transcription initiation and elongation.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Centrosomes consist of a pair of centrioles surrounded by the pericentriolar material (PCM). In Caenorhabditis elegans, interactions between the PCM scaffold protein SPD-5 and the regulatory kinase PLK-1 are essential for PCM formation and disassembly. However, how PCM stability is established and maintained remains an open question. Here, we address this question by analyzing the function of PCMD-1, a protein that predominantly localizes to centrioles. Mutations in the predicted PLK-1 binding sites of PCMD-1 result in a reduction of centrosomal PLK-1 and PCMD-1 levels, leading to severe distortion of the PCM scaffold. The disorganization of the PCM is already evident during its formation and results in the assembly of a structurally unstable mitotic centrosome, which is unable to resist the microtubule pulling forces exerted on the spindle pole. As a consequence of a weakened PCM scaffold, the pulling forces are not effectively relayed to the entrapped centriole pair, resulting in delayed centriole separation in late anaphase. Together, these findings show that PCMD-1, which predominantly localizes to centrioles and tethers the PCM scaffold to them, is essential for stabilizing the entire PCM scaffold and ensuring timely centriole separation during PCM disassembly. We propose a model in which PCMD-1 initiates the ordered assembly of the PCM scaffold by biasing the PCM core to a certain intrinsic order around the centrioles. This intrinsic order acts as a seed that propagates throughout the surrounding micron-scale PCM scaffold, providing the necessary strength and structural integrity for the centrosome.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

PSE feature densely packed elongated epithelial cells, with nuclei positioned along the apicobasal cell axis in a cell cycle-dependent manner. PSE serve as organ precursors in diverse developmental contexts across evolution. While the role of nuclear movements in PSE has been extensively studied, less is known about whether and how their nuclear packing arrangements and changes of packing state influence tissue morphogenesis. To address this, we analyzed nuclear shapes, sizes and neighborhood statistics by segmenting nuclei in 3D and over development in zebrafish retinal neuroepithelia (RNE). We find that in PSE nuclei exhibit orientational, nematic-like order but remain positionally disordered. This pattern is conserved in other, less packed, neuroepithelia, like the hindbrain, suggesting that nematic-like order is a hallmark of pseudostratification. Our analysis during retinal development also revealed that nuclear packing density increases, approaching theoretical packing limits for disordered monodisperse ellipsoids at stages when the tissue transitions to a laminated neuronal structure. As neurogenesis progresses, nuclear shapes are remodeled, enabling the RNE to shift to a crystalline, ordered structure, while maintaining orientational alignment. Failure to initiate neurogenesis results in severe tissue deformations due to increased buckling instability. Our results thus show an instance where nuclear shape and nuclear positioning and their changes are essential for proper retinal morphogenesis, a phenomenon most likely also found in other tissue arrangements.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

The role of T lymphocytes interactions with IECs in the physiopathology of CD remains in question. Here, we use a three-dimensional human autologous coculture model between purified intestinal organoids derived from primary tissues of CD and non-inflammatory control patients, and mucosal T lymphocytes extracted from the same location. We show that while in homeostatic context T cells support the proliferation and differentiation balance of organoids, mucosal T lymphocytes from CD patients present a high cytotoxicity against IECs. Importantly, this cytotoxicity is a persistent defect overtime in culture. Organoids also show defective intestinal stem cells (ISCs) proliferation and morphological changes.

COVID-19 vaccines that are more closely matched to circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages elicit more potent and relevant immune responses that translate to improved real-world vaccine effectiveness. The rise in prevalence of the Omicron JN.1 lineage, and subsequent derivative sublineages such as KP.2 and KP.3, coincided with reduced neutralizing activity and effectiveness of Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted vaccines. Here, we characterized the biophysical and immunologic attributes of BNT162b2 JN.1- and KP.2-adapted mRNA vaccine-encoded spike (S) protein immunogens. Biophysical interrogations of S revealed the structural consequences of hallmark amino acid substitutions and a potential molecular mechanism of immune escape employed by JN.1 and KP.2. The vaccine candidates were evaluated for their immunogenicity when administered as fourth or fifth doses in BNT162b2-experienced mice or as a primary series in naive mice. In both vaccine-experienced and naive settings, JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccines conferred improved neutralizing responses over the BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 vaccine against a broad panel of emerging JN.1 sublineages, including the predominant KP.3.1.1 and emerging XEC lineages. Antigenic mapping of neutralizing responses indicated greater antigenic overlap of JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccine responses with currently circulating sublineages compared to an XBB.1.5-adapted vaccine. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were generally conserved across all three vaccines. Together, the data support the selection of JN.1- or KP.2-adapted vaccines for the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine formula.

However, detection currently requires costly whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or labor-intensive cytogenetic or FISH imaging, limiting its application in routine clinical diagnosis. To overcome this, we developed ecPath (ecDNA from histopathology), a computational method for predicting ecDNA status from routinely available hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images. ecPath implements a deep-learning method we call transcriptomics-guided learning, which utilizes both transcriptomics and H&E images during the training phase to enable successful ecDNA prediction from H&E images alone, a task not achievable with models trained on H&E images only. It is trained on more than 6,000 tumor whole-slide images from the TCGA cohort with the best performance in predicting ecDNA status in brain and stomach tumors (average AUC=0.78). ecPath revealed that ecDNA-positive tumors are enriched with pleomorphic, larger and high-density nuclei. Testing in an independent cohort, ecPath predicted ecDNA status of 985 pediatric brain tumor patients with an AUC of 0.72. Finally, we applied ecPath to identify ecDNA-positive tumors in the TCGA cohort for which no WGS data were available. Like WGS-based ecDNA-positive labels, the predicted ecDNA-positive status also identify poor prognoses for low grade glioma patients. These results demonstrate that ecPath enables the detection of ecDNA from routinely available H&E imaging alone and help nominate aggressive tumors with ecDNA to study and target it.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

SOX2 is one of the key pluripotency transcription factors, expressed during embryonic development and active in adult stem cells. In cancer, SOX2 is frequently dysregulated and associated with tumor stemness and poor patient survival. SOX2 expression is suppressed in differentiated cells by tumor suppressor proteins that form a transcriptional repressive complex. We previously identified some of these proteins and found that their absence combined with deficiency in Trp53, leads to maximal dysregulated expression of Sox2. Using cancer cell lines of different origin and with different p53 status, we show here that manipulating TP53 to restore or decrease its activity results in repression or induction of SOX2, respectively. Mechanistically, we observed that the regulation of SOX2 expression by TP53 is transcriptional and identified Trp53 bound to the promoter region and the SRR2 enhancer of Sox2. Forcing high levels of SOX2 in cancer cells leads to morphological changes that molecularly correspond to the acquisition of a more mesenchymal phenotype correlating with an increased migratory capacity. Finally, the analysis of human breast cancer samples shows that this correlation between TP53 status, levels of expression of SOX2 and a more metastatic phenotype is also observed in cancer patients. Our results support the notion that lack of TP53 in tumor cells results in deregulated expression of developmental gene SOX2 with phenotypic consequences related with increased malignization.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Conditions that disrupt the immune balance in the male reproductive tract, such as vasectomy and infections, can expose sperm to the immune system, leading to increased production of anti-sperm antibodies (ASAs) and subsequent reproductive challenges. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) regulate inflammation and maintain sperm tolerance. In a murine model, we demonstrated that disrupting sperm immunotolerance induces chronic autoimmune responses characterized by antibody production targeting sperm and reproductive tissue autoantigens and unique tissue-specific immune cell signatures in the epididymis and testis. Such inflammatory features impair sperm function, contribute to epididymal damage, and drive sustained male subfertility. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) were formed within the epididymis after Treg depletion, defined by clusters of heterogenous B and T cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. These ectopic structures perpetuate inflammation and lower the activation threshold for future immune threats. Similar isotypes of autoantibodies were detected in the seminal plasma of infertile patients, suggesting shared mechanistic pathways between mice and humans. Overall, we provide an in-depth understanding of the diverse B- and T-cell dynamics and TLS formation during epididymitis to develop precision-targeted therapies for infertility and chronic inflammation. Additionally, this immunological characterization of the epididymal microenvironment has the potential to identify novel targets for the development of male contraceptives.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Yet, in situ peptide identification remains challenging. Therefore, this study aims to integrate the trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS)-based parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (PASEF) into MALDI imaging of peptides to enable multiplexed MS/MS imaging.

METHODSAn initial MALDI TIMS MS1 survey measurement is performed, followed by a manual generation of a precursor list containing mass over charge values and ion mobility windows. Inside the dual TIMS system, submitted precursors are trapped, separately eluted by their ion mobility and analyzed in a quadrupole time-of-flight device, thereby enabling multiplexed MALDI MS/MS imaging. Finally, precursors are identified by peptide to spectrum matching.

RESULTSThis study presents the first multiplexed MALDI TIMS MS/MS imaging (iprm-PASEF) of tryptic peptides. Its applicability is showcased on two histomorphologically distinct tissue specimens in a 4-plex and 5-plex setup. Precursors were successfully identified by the search engine MASCOT in one single MALDI imaging experiment for each respective tissue. Peptide identifications were corroborated by liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry experiments and fragment colocalization analyses.

CONCLUSIONSIn the present study, we demonstrate the feasibility of TIMS-based MALDI MS/MS imaging for the multiplexed and rapid identification of tryptic peptides in a spatial manner. Hence, it represents a first step in the integration of MALDI imaging into the emerging field of spatial proteomics.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Extreme precipitation events can promote the spread of mosquito-borne illnesses by creating vector habitat, destroying infrastructure, and impeding vector control. Here, we focus on Cyclone Yaku, which caused heavy rainfall in northwestern Peru from March 7th - 20th, 2023 and was followed by the worst dengue outbreak in Perus history. We apply generalized synthetic control methods to account for baseline climate variation and unobserved confounders when estimating the causal effect of Cyclone Yaku on dengue cases across the 56 districts with the greatest precipitation anomalies. We estimate that 67 (95% CI: 30 - 87) % of cases in cyclone-affected districts were attributable to Cyclone Yaku. The cyclone significantly increased cases for over six months, causing 38,209 (95% CI: 17,454 - 49,928) out of 57,246 cases. The largest increases in dengue incidence due to Cyclone Yaku occurred in districts with a large share of low-quality roofs and walls in residences, greater flood risk, and warmer temperatures above 24{degrees}C. Analyzing an ensemble of climate model simulations, we found that extremely intense March precipitation in northwestern Peru is 42% more likely in the current era compared to a preindustrial baseline due to climate forcing. In sum, extreme precipitation like that associated with Cyclone Yaku has become more likely with climate change, and Cyclone Yaku caused the majority of dengue cases across the cyclone-affected districts.

Significance StatementAnthropogenic climate change is increasing the risk of extreme events that can lead to infectious disease epidemics, but few studies have directly measured this health cost of climate change. We do so by focusing on Cyclone Yaku, which affected northwestern Peru in March 2023, and was immediately followed by a dengue epidemic. Cyclone Yaku caused 67% of cases reported over six months in the affected region. Industrial-era climate forcing has increased the likelihood of extreme March precipitation like that associated with Cyclone Yaku by 42%. Assessing the linkages between climate change, extreme weather, and outbreaks of dengue and other infectious diseases is crucial for understanding the impact that climate change has already had and preparing for future health risks.","NA","medrxiv",1731881326147

Human skin undergoes both chronological aging and environmental degradation, particularly UV-induced photoaging. Detrimental structural and physiological changes caused by aging include epidermal thinning due to stem cell depletion and dermal atrophy associated with decreased collagen production. Here, we present a comprehensive single-cell atlas of skin aging, analyzing samples from young, middle-aged, and elderly individuals, including both sun-exposed and sun-protected areas. This atlas reveals age-related cellular composition and function changes across various skin cell types, including epidermal stem cells, fibroblasts, hair follicles, and endothelial cells. Using our atlas, we have identified basal stem cells as a highly variable population across aging, more so than other skin cell populations such as fibroblasts. In basal stem cells, we identified ATF3 as a novel regulator of skin aging. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor for genes involved in the aging process, with its expression reduced by 20% during aging. Based on this discovery, we have developed an innovative mRNA-based treatment to mitigate the effects of skin aging. Cell senescence decreased 25% in skin cells treated with ATF3 mRNA, and we observed an over 20% increase in proliferation in treated basal stem cells. Importantly, we also found crosstalk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts as a critical component of therapeutic interventions, with ATF3 rescue of basal cells significantly enhancing fibroblast collagen production by approximately 200%. We conclude that ATF3-targeted mRNA treatment effectively reverses the effects of skin aging by modulating specific cellular mechanisms, offering a novel, targeted approach to human skin rejuvenation.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Advances in artificial intelligence enhance life sciences research by delivering critical insights and optimizing data analysis processes. However, inconsistent data processing quality and standards remain to be a major challenge. Here we propose scCompass, which provides a data quality solution to build a large-scale, cross-species and model-friendly single-cell data collection. By applying standardized data pre-processing, scCompass integrates and curates transcriptomic data from 13 species and nearly 105 million single cells. Using this extensive dataset, we are able to archieve stable expression genes (SEGs) and organ-specific expression genes (OSGs) in human and mouse. We provide different scalable datasets that can be easily adapted for AI model training and the pretrained checkpoints with state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-cell foundataion models. In summary, the AI-readiness of scCompass, which combined with user-friendly data sharing, visualization and online analysis, greatly simplifies data access and exploitation for researchers in single cell biology(http://www.bdbe.cn/kun).","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Here we developed IMMClock, a novel immune aging clock that uses gene expression data to predict the biological age of individual CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, and NK cells. The accuracy of IMMClock is first validated across multiple independent datasets, demonstrating its robustness. Second, utilizing the IMMClock, we find that intrinsic cellular aging processes are more strongly altered during immune aging than differentiation processes. Thirdly, our analysis confirms the strong associations between immune aging and established processes such as cellular senescence, exhaustion, and telomere length at the single cell level. Furthermore, immune aging is accelerated under several disease conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Finally, we apply IMMClock to analyze a perturb-seq gene activation screen of T cell functionality. We find that the post-perturbation immune age of individual T cells is strongly correlated with their pre-perturbation immune age. Furthermore, the immune age at resting state of individual T cells is strongly predictive of their post-stimulation activation state. Overall, IMMClock advances our understanding of immune aging by providing precise, single-cell level age estimations. Its future applications hold promise for identifying interventions that concomitantly rejuvenate and activate T cells, potentially enhancing efforts to counteract age-related immune decline.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Compared to existing methods, real-time detection and long-term monitoring are still required. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have excellent optical properties for sensing applications, which provide the possibility for designing a new generation of glucose sensors. In this study, we describe a method for covalently conjugate glucose oxidase (GOx) on SWCNTs as an optical glucose sensor. The functional groups are introduced by a photocatalytic reaction which acts as the handle for protein loading on SWCNTs. In this sp3 defect reaction, the optical properties of SWCNTs can be maintained. With a convenient bioconjugation reaction, the GOx could be covalently linked with SWCNTs. Compared to the non-covalent immobilization conjugates, the covalent conjugate sensor exhibits a much stronger optical response toward glucose, and the stability of the biosensor also increases in harsh conditions. At the same time, we also report the changing ratio of the original E11 and defected E11* peak during the bioconjugation reaction, which is also inspiring for reaction monitoring on SWCNTs.

However, long-term data on CMD following severe COVID-19 are lacking. Objective: To determine long-term left ventricular (LV) function and presence of CMD after severe COVID-19, utilizing cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and stress perfusion mapping. Methods: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients underwent CMR at 10 months follow-up (1.5T Aera, Siemens Healthineers) including cine imaging, native T1 and T2, extracellular volume, and adenosine stress perfusion mapping. Clinical data were obtained from patient records. Patients were compared to volunteers without symptomatic ischemic heart disease (IHD). Results: COVID-19 patients (n=37, age 56{+/-}12 years, 76% male) and volunteers (n=22, age 51{+/-}13 years, 55% male, p=ns for both) were included. COVID-19 patients demonstrated reduced stress perfusion (2.8{+/-}0.81 vs 3.4{+/-}0.69 ml/min/g, p=0.003), impaired global longitudinal strain (GLS, -17{+/-}2 vs -19{+/-}2 %, p=0.003) and global circumferential strain (GCS, -16{+/-}3 vs -19{+/-}3 %, p=0.001). There were no differences in stress perfusion or myocardial perfusion reserve between COVID-19 patients with or without cardiovascular risk factors or cardiac symptoms. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients exhibit long-term reduced stress perfusion indicating CMD, and impaired LV function by GLS and GCS. Lack of variation in stress perfusion between patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors suggests that CMD may be a consequence of severe COVID-19, warranting further investigation to elucidate mechanisms, and guide potential therapeutic interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1731881326147

However, metagenome-assembled genomes are often incomplete and have low contiguity due to challenges in assembling repeated genomic elements. Long-read sequencing approaches have successfully yielded circular bacterial genomes directly from metagenomes, but these approaches are low throughput, have high DNA input requirements, and can have high error rates. Illumina has recently launched the Illumina Complete Long Read (ICLR) assay, a new approach for generating kilobase-scale reads with low DNA input requirements and high accuracy. Here, we evaluate the performance of ICLR sequencing for gut metagenomics. We sequenced a microbial mock community and ten human gut microbiome samples with standard, shotgun 2x150 paired-end sequencing, ICLR sequencing, and nanopore long-read sequencing and compared performance in read lengths, assembly contiguity, and bin quality.

We used public RNA sequencing data and reconstructed T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires from blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples from patients with HP, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and healthy controls. After excluding TCR sequences likely to be related to common microbial exposures in patients with HP, we identified TCRs shared between patients with shared human leukocyte antigen alleles, indicating patients likely to have a common causative antigen. We also identified clusters of TCRs containing identical and similar TCR clones in individual patients that are plausibly related to the causative antigens in those patients.

OROV has not been studied in the context of pregnancy and has unknown ability to infect the relevant tissues of the maternal-fetal interface, which have anti-viral properties; therefore,the mechanisms of vertical transmission are unknown. We used polarized human trophoblast stem cell organoids and human placenta explants to demonstrate that OROV (BeAn19991) infects and replicates in human tissues of the maternal-fetal interface including chorionic villi and the microbial-resistant cell, syncytiotrophoblast. Viral replication is robust within the first 24 hours post infection, and tissues from earlier gestations may be more susceptible to infection. These data indicate tissues at the maternal-fetal interace are susceptible to OROV infection and may facilitate vertical transmission, leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

However, null space theory makes the counter-intuitive prediction that neurons often generate spikes not to cause behavior, but to prevent the effects that other neurons would have on behavior. What is missing is a direct way to test this theory in the brain. Here, we found that in the marmoset cerebellum, spike-triggered averaging identified a potent vector unique to each Purkinje cell (P-cell) along which the spikes of that cell displaced the eyes. Yet, the P-cells were active not just for saccades along their potent vector, but for all saccades. Simultaneous recordings revealed that two spikes in two different P-cells produced superposition of their potent vectors. The result was a population activity in which the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. But why was one neuron producing spikes that would be canceled by another neuron? To answer this question, we recorded from the mossy fiber inputs and the interneurons in the molecular layer. We found that the mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands as well as the sensory goal of the movement, then the interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P-cells as a population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped. Because this output had faster dynamics than was present in the individual neurons, the cerebellum placed the cells in subtractive competition with each other such that the downstream effects of spiking in one neuron were partially or completely eliminated because of the spiking in another neuron.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

With the emergence of subclade Ib and increasing reported human-to-human transmission of MPXV we sought to characterize both the epidemiologic and genomic characteristics of confirmed mpox cases in Kinshasa, DRC, following confirmed MPXV introduction in August 2023. Methods: This retrospective observational study leveraged demographic and case-investigation data, as well as biological samples, collected from suspected mpox cases in Kinshasa from January 2023 to September 2024 as part of routine national surveillance. Samples were tested at the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale first by qPCR to confirm MPXV, and subsequently sequenced for genomic analysis for those samples with a cycle threshold value <31. Findings: Epidemiological characterization of all confirmed mpox cases in Kinshasa indicated two distinct periods of MPXV introduction and circulation: first, following the initial case in August 2023, self-limiting transmission chains of subclade Ia primarily among men. Case investigations from this period suggest human human transmission. The second period is marked by the introduction of subclade Ib to the city and expanded co-circulation of both subclades with Limete health zone reporting the most cases of both subclades. Of those samples sequenced, genomic analysis indicated that greater than 60% of mutations in both subclades were consistent with APOBEC3-driven mutations. Interpretation: These data suggest that as of July 2024, MPXV in Kinshasa has undergone an epidemiological shift with sustained human-to-human transmission and co-circulation of two distinct subclades. Additionally, high rates of APOBEC3-driven changes further support this shift towards human-to-human transmission. While sexual-contact transmission cannot be confirmed without further case investigation, these data highlight important changes in mpox dynamics which may better guide mpox mitigation and containment strategies in Kinshasa.","NA","medrxiv",1731881326147

However, whether 2.3.4.4b H5N1 circulating in non-human mammals can establish human infections and spread among humans is unclear. Gain-of-function research restrictions preclude assessing human adapting mutations of 2.3.4.4b H5N1. Here, we tracked the evolution of 2.3.4.4b H5N1 that infected non-human mammals and evaluated their ability to gain human adaptations. The non-human mammal 2.3.4.4b H5N1 partly acquired classical human adapting mutations, which are identical to the residues of H1N1pdm09 and seasonal human H3N2 infections while showing a few species-specific adaptations that might be potential barriers for successful human adaptations. Despite minimal changes in Hemagglutinin (HA), A160T and T199I mutations near the receptor binding site of HA in dairy cattle viruses indicate the rapid HA glycan surface evolution affecting virus entry and immune evasion. The quantitative assessment indicated that 2.3.4.4b H5N1 circulating in bears, cattle, dolphins, and foxes show higher human adaptive potential than other hosts. Also, H5N1 infections in mammals across time showed a unique set of adaptations in the 2.3.4.4b clade compared to previously circulating strains, especially the acquisition of Q591 adaptation in PB2 that enables human adaptation. Thus, 2.3.4.4b H5N1 acquires human adaptations due to natural selection pressure in non-human mammals. Overall, our study delineates human adaptation and infection risk of specific non-human mammalian circulating HPAI 2.3.4.4b H5N1 strains.

In particular, plague has been linked to population declines in Late Neolithic Europe3,4. Although plague is amongst the most devastating diseases in human history, early strains of Yersinia pestis, the causal agent of plague, lack virulence factors required for the bubonic form5, and their severity remains unclear. Here, we describe the oldest strains of plague reported so far, associated with two early phases of outbreaks among prehistoric hunter-gatherers in the Lake Baikal region in East Siberia, beginning from [~]5600-5400 years ago (cal. BP). These outbreaks occur across four hunter-gatherer cemeteries; the largest of these (Ust-Ida I) has a 38.7% detection rate for plague infection (39% detection across all sites). By reconstructing kinship pedigrees, we show that small familial groups are affected, consistent with human-to-human spread of the disease, and the first outbreak occurred within a single generation. Intriguingly, the infections appear to have resulted in acute mortality events, especially among children. Zoonotic transmission is separately indicated by a Brucella infection in one of the children. Interestingly, we see differences in functional genomic variants in the prehistoric plague strains, including in the ypm superantigen known from Y. pseudotuberculosis today. The new strains diverge ancestrally to all known Y. pestis diversity and push back the Y. pestis divergence from Y. pseudotuberculosis by some 2000 years6. Our results show that plague outbreaks happen earlier than previously thought and that these early outbreaks were indeed lethal. The findings challenge the common notion that high population densities and lifestyle changes during the Neolithic transition were prerequisites for plague epidemics.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Overall, these findings show how language processing can be linked to neural dynamics, across multiple brain regions at various resolutions and down to the level of single neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

The recent development of wearable technology for infants enables the collection of large-scale multimodal data in the natural environment, including physiological signals. To capitalize on these new technologies, psychologists need methods to efficiently extract valid and robust SA measures from large datasets. In this study, we present an innovative automatic sustained attention prediction (ASAP) method that harnesses electrocardiogram (ECG) and accelerometer (Acc) signals recorded with wearable sensors from 75 infants (6-, 9-, 12-, 24- and 36-months). Infants undertook various naturalistic tasks similar to those encountered in their natural environment, including free play with their caregivers. Annotated SA was validated by fixation signals from eye-tracking. ASAP was trained on temporal and spectral features derived from the ECG and Acc signals to detect attention periods, and tested against human-coded SA. ASAP's performance is similar across all age groups, demonstrating its suitability for studying development. We also investigated the relationship between attention periods and low-level perceptual features (visual saliency, visual clutter) extracted from the egocentric videos recorded during caregiver-infant free play. Saliency increased during attention vs inattention periods and decreased with age for attention (but not inattention) periods. Crucially, there was no observable difference in results from ASAP attention detection relative to the human-coded attention. Our results demonstrate that ASAP is a powerful tool for detecting infant SA elicited in natural environments. Alongside the available wearable sensors, ASAP provides unprecedented opportunities for studying infant development in the ""wild"".","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

The use of sequence similarity networks (SSNs) is a standard method for exploring large sequence datasets, but is currently limited when scaling to very large datasets and when viewing more than one level (hierarchy) of homology. Here, we present a sequence analysis pipeline with a number of innovations that address some limitations of traditional SSNs. First, we develop a hierarchical visualization approach that captures the full range of homologies across protein superfamilies. Second, we leverage representations embedded by protein language models as an alternative homology metric to the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), showing that they produce comparable results when identifying isofunctional protein families. Finally, we demonstrate that unbiased representative sampling of sequences from genetic neighborhoods can be achieved through the use of hidden Markov models (HMMs) or vector representations. The utility of these methods is exemplified by updating the sequence-function analysis of the FMN/F420-binding split barrel superfamily and improving phylogenetic analyses. We provide our sequence exploration pipeline as publicly available code (ProteinClusterTools) and show it to be scalable to large datasets ([~]300k sequences) using desktop computers.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Here, we revisit an unresolved debate on whether browse is more nutritious than grasses for elephants, as browse is thought to have greater crude protein content. We first analyzed carbon isotopes in 102 fecal samples of Asian elephants to quantify the contribution of browsing and grazing to their diet in Nagarahole National Park, southern India. We show that elephants are predominantly browsers in the grass-scarce Nagarahole forests, in contrast with predominant grazing reported in the nearby grass-abundant savannas of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. We then compared the forage quality of high-browsing and high-grazing diets by analyzing these samples for two proxies of crude protein content (CP): nitrogen content (N%) and Carbon-to-Nitrogen ratio (C:N). Interestingly, high-browsing diets did not have higher N% or lower C:N (proxies for high CP) than low-browsing (high-grazing) diets. To explore the generality of this finding, we analyzed nutritional differences (i.e., CP and fibre content values) between browse and grass across 141 plant species consumed by Asian elephants. We show that woody browse and non-legume browse, which are major components of elephant browse, do not have appreciably higher CP than grasses. Our findings suggest that browsing and grazing broadly have similar nutritional value for such bulk-feeding mixed feeders. Finally, based on the observed habitat-wide variation in browsing, we provide a new framework for assessing how elephants shape woody vegetation across the forests and savannas of Asia, with important implications for conservation and carbon cycling.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

In the context of natural selection analyses, specifically codon evolutionary models, excessive rates of false positives result. A characteristic signature of error-driven findings is unrealistically high estimates of dN/dS (e.g., >100), affecting only a small fraction (e.g., ~0.1%) of the alignment. Despite the widespread use of codon models to assess alignment quality, their potential for error correction remains unexplored. We present BUSTED-E: a novel method designed to detect positive selection while concurrently identifying alignment errors. This method is a straightforward adaptation of the BUSTED flexible branch-site random effects model used to fit distributions of dN/dS, with an important modification: it integrates an ""error-sink"" component representing an abiological evolutionary regime (dN/dS > 100), and provides the option for masking errors in the MSA for downstream analyses. Statistical performance of BUSTED-E on data simulated without errors shows that there is a small loss of power, which can be mitigated by model averaged inference. Using four published empirical datasets, we show BUSTED-E reduces unrealistic rates of positive selection detection, often by an order of magnitude, and improves biological interpretability of results. BUSTED-E also detects errors that are largely distinct from other popular alignment cleaning tools (HMMCleaner and BMGE). Overall, BUSTED-E is a robust and scalable solution for improving the accuracy of evolutionary analyses in the presence of residual alignment errors, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of natural selection and adaptive evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Small molecules termed chemical chaperones can promote protein folding to alleviate ER stress. The bile acid tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), has been described as a chemical chaperone. While promising in models of protein folding diseases, TUDCA's mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we found TUDCA can rescue growth of yeast treated with the ER stressor tunicamycin (Tm), even in the absence of a functional UPR. In contrast, TUDCA failed to rescue growth on other ER stressors. Nor could TUDCA attenuate chronic UPR associated with specific gene deletions or over-expression of a misfolded mutant secretory protein. Neither pretreatment with or delayed addition of TUDCA conferred protection against Tm. Importantly, attenuation of Tm-induced toxicity required TUDCA's critical micelle forming concentration, suggesting a mechanism where TUDCA directly sequesters drugs. Indeed, in several assays, TUDCA treated cells closely resembled cells treated with lower doses of Tm. In addition, we found TUDCA can inhibit dyes from labeling intracellular compartments. Thus, our study challenges the model of TUDCA as a chemical chaperone and suggests that TUDCA decreases drug bioavailability, allowing cells to adapt to ER stress.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

In prostate cancer, indirect crosstalk between androgen receptor (AR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is well-documented, where GR replaces antiandrogen-inactivated AR becoming the disease driver. However, the existence and impact of direct chromatin crosstalk between AR and GR in prostate cancer have remained elusive. Our genome-wide investigations reveal that AR activation significantly expands GR chromatin binding. Mechanistically, AR induces remodeling of closed chromatin sites, facilitating GR binding to inaccessible sites. Importantly, coactivation of AR and GR results in distinct transcriptional responses at both the cell population and single-cell levels. Intriguingly, pathways affected by these transcriptional changes are generally associated with improved patient survival. Thus, the direct crosstalk between AR and GR yields markedly different outcomes from the known role of GR in circumventing AR blockade by antiandrogens.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

IGF-1 gene is highly conserved across species, with only few evolutionary changes identified in it. Despite its potential role in regulating life span, no coding variants in IGF-1 have been reported in human longevity cohorts to date. This study investigated the whole exome sequencing data from 2,487 individuals in a cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians, their offspring, and controls without familial longevity to identify functional IGF-1 coding variants. We identified two likely functional coding variants IGF-1:p.Ile91Leu and IGF-1:p.Ala118Thr in our longevity cohort. Notably, a centenarian specific novel variant IGF-1:p.Ile91Leu was located at the binding interface of IGF-1 - IGF-1R, whereas IGF-1:p.Ala118Thr was significantly associated with lower circulating levels of IGF-1. We performed extended all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the impact of Ile91Leu on stability, binding dynamics and energetics of IGF-1 bound to IGF-1R. The IGF-1:p.Ile91Leu formed less stable interactions with IGF-1Rs critical binding pocket residues and demonstrated lower binding affinity at the extracellular binding site compared to wild-type IGF-1. Our findings suggest that IGF-1:p.Ile91Leu and IGF-1:p.Ala118Thr variants attenuate IGF-1R activity by impairing IGF-1 binding and diminishing the circulatory levels of IGF-1, respectively. Consequently, diminished IGF-1 signaling resulting from these variants may contribute to exceptional longevity in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Unraveling these effects is vital for identifying potential targets to improve treatment outcomes. In this study, we devised an explainable machine learning (XML) pipeline to scrutinize the associations between TME cellular constituents and relapse-free survival (RFS). By applying our pipeline to estimated cell fractions in the METABRIC and TCGA datasets and comparing these results with associations to pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), we created a comprehensive catalog of the TMEs role based on 5000 patient samples. Our findings reveal an unexpected dichotomy in which macrophages correlate positively with pCR but negatively with RFS, particularly within estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and Luminal A and B (LumA/B) cancer subtypes. We show that this pattern is driven by heterogeneity in breast tumors characterized by increasing levels of macrophage infiltration. Through imaging mass cytometry (IMC) analysis, we discovered that macrophages tend to accumulate in the vicinity of HLA-ABChi epithelial cells as their frequency increases in tumor tissues and also express elevated levels of HLA-ABC protein. Combining IMC with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we uncovered a significant association between these HLA-ABChi macrophages and regulatory and exhausted T cells (TReg and TEx), suggesting their involvement in immune suppression, likely by creating a chronically activated immunosuppressive TME. Subsequent cell-cell communication analysis predicted interactions between HLA-ABChi macrophages and TEx cells via the ligands SIGLEC9, ALCAM, and CSF1, and with TReg cells through APP, ANGPTL4, and SIGLEC9 signaling. Considering the clinical relevance of macrophages in ER+ (LumA/B) subtypes, our research enhances the characterization of macrophage-driven immune suppression in these tumors and identifies potential targets for immunomodulatory strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

In this study, we investigated the role of autoD2R in regulating the activity of VTA DA-neurons in response to salient aversive stimuli. Using Drd2Slc6a3 mice, in which Drd2 is selectively deleted in DA-neurons, we observed enhanced excitatory and inhibitory responses of VTA DA-neurons to aversive stimuli, suggesting that autoD2R acts as a critical regulatory brake. Importantly, this modulation occurred independently of either the pacemaker activity of DA-neurons or their coupling to the non-selective sodium leak channel NALCN.

Based on thematic analysis of perspectives shared by stakeholders at national, regional, district and village levels through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and a public stakeholders meeting, the WMA was considered to have succeeded to only a very modest extent in achieving its intended goals. Essentially all participants narrated that the area is heavily encroached by human activities, including livestock grazing, agriculture, illegal fishing, meat poaching, deforestation, charcoal burning, timber harvesting and even permanent settlements. Contributing factors include a recently growing influx of agro-pastoralist immigrants, top-down political interference, financial constraints, financial mismanagement, limited resources for operations, lack of conservation education, investors or government support, and recent displacement of encroachment pressure from newly upgraded, centrally-managed protected areas nearby. To ensure future success and sustainability of the WMA, participants recommended enhancing stakeholder involvement and community participation in WMA management, improved collaboration with nearby centrally-managed protected areas for implementing operations, overhaul of the WMA constitution to reflect current best practices, building capacity among relevant village leaders and elected WMA representatives and initiating conservation education initiatives for the local community. Overall, the WMA should explore alternative income sources beyond tourism, to ensure direct benefits for the community member through sustainable, carefully-regulated access to natural resources, and resolve ongoing conflict over land use between the long-established villages that govern ILUMA and agro-pastoralists immigrants who have moved into the area more recently.

Having well-curated benchmarking datasets has allowed machine learning experts to enter and revolutionise various fields of bioinformatics, such as protein structure prediction. Here, we present a set of benchmarking datasets for the yet unsolved task of accurate microRNA (miRNA) binding site prediction. miRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. miRNAs are loaded onto Argonaute family proteins (AGO) and serve as guides to target specific binding sites on messenger RNA through partial sequence complementarity, the exact rules of which remain to be fully understood. The precise identification of miRNA binding sites is crucial for the further understanding of these master regulators of gene expression. Despite decades of attempts to accurately predict miRNA binding sites, the field has been unable to conclusively determine the exact rules of miRNA binding. An important issue is the relative paucity of unbiased experimental datasets that could be used to train more accurate machine learning models. In recent years, novel experimental approaches have revolutionised the field, producing thousands of unbiased miRNA-binding site sequence pairs. Recently, over one million such pairs were produced and made publicly available, posing the potential to revolutionise the field. In this manuscript, we process and produce several comprehensive, well-annotated, and easy-to-use benchmark datasets from these experimental approaches. We use these datasets to benchmark state-of-the-art methods.

However, following a more detailed protocol with additional tips kindly provided by Ou et al. (ref. 1), the abdominal skin became more transparent. It seems that mechanical damage to the SC barrier is critical for successful clearing.

However, the specific mechanisms by which viral proteins influence cholesterol remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cholesterol sequestration within lysosomes, with the viral protein ORF3a identified as the primary driver of this effect. Mechanistically, we found that ORF3a interacts directly with the HOPS complex subunit VPS39 through a hydrophobic interface formed by residues W193 and Y184. A W193A mutation in ORF3a significantly rescues cholesterol egress and corrects the mislocalization of the lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC2, which is caused by defective trafficking of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) sorting receptor, the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). We further observed a marked reduction in bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a lipid essential for lysosomal cholesterol egress, in both SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and ORF3a-expressing cells, suggesting BMP reduction as an additional mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-caused cholesterol sequestration. Inhibition of lysosomal cholesterol egress using the compound U18666A significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting a potential viral strategy of manipulating lysosomal cholesterol to modulate host cell susceptibility. Our findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a disrupts cellular cholesterol transport by altering lysosomal protein trafficking and BMP levels, providing new insights into virus-host interactions that contribute to lipid dysregulation in infected cells.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey. Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1731881326147

This extensive pleiotropy implies that multi-phenotype analyses are informative for characterizing genetic variation, as they facilitate the discovery of trait-specific and trait-shared variants and pathways ('genetic factors'). Previous efforts have estimated genetic factors using matrix factorization (MF) applied to numerous GWAS. However, existing methods are susceptible to spurious factors arising from residual confounding due to sample-sharing in biobank GWAS. Furthermore, MF approaches have historically estimated dense factors, loaded on most traits and variants, that are challenging to map onto interpretable biological pathways. To address these shortcomings, we introduce 'GWAS latent embeddings accounting for noise and regularization' (GLEANR), a MF method for detection of sparse genetic factors from summary statistics. GLEANR accounts for sample sharing between studies and uses regularization to estimate a data-driven number of interpretable factors. GLEANR is robust to confounding induced by shared samples and improves the replication of genetic factors derived from distinct biobanks. We used GLEANR to evaluate 137 diverse GWAS, identifying 58 factors that decompose the genetic architecture of input traits and have distinct signatures of negative selection and degrees of polygenicity. These sparse factors can be interpreted with respect to disease, cell-type, and pathway enrichment, such as three factors capturing platelet measure phenotypes enriched for disease-relevant markers corresponding to distinct stages of platelet differentiation. Overall, GLEANR is a powerful tool for discovering both trait-specific and shared pathways underlying complex traits from GWAS summary statistics.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

Each step of this complex process has received extensive attention in the literature, and has been significantly streamlined over the years. Given the volume of publicly available genetic data, obtaining genomes for a wide selection of known species is straightforward. However, analyzing that same data in order to generate a phylogenetic tree is a multi-step process with legitimate scientific and technical challenges, and often requires a significant input from a domain-area scientist.

ResultsWe present Poplar, a new, streamlined computational pipeline, to address the computational logistical issues that arise when constructing phylogenetic trees. It provides a framework that runs state-of-the-art software for essential steps in the phylogenetic pipeline, beginning from a genome with or without an annotation, and resulting in a species tree. Running Poplar requires no external databases. In the execution, it enables parallelism for execution for clusters and cloud computing. The trees generated by Poplar match closely with state-of-the-art published trees. The usage and performance of Poplar is far simpler and quicker than manually running a phylogenetic pipeline.

A subset meets diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Several studies have reported persistence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins or RNA in serum or tissues of both recovered individuals and PCS patients.

In this exploratory study, we investigated whether serum spike protein is associated with PCS and whether it correlates with symptom severity and laboratory biomarkers. We analyzed serum spike protein levels in 121 PCS patients following mild-to-moderate COVID-19, 72 of whom met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS (post-COVID ME/CFS, pcMECFS). Pre-pandemic seronegative healthy controls (ppHC, n = 32) and post-COVID recovered healthy controls (pcHC, n = 37) after SARS-CoV-2 infection were also included in the study.

We found persistent serum SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a subset of pcHC (11 %), PCS non-ME/CFS patients (2 %), and pcMECFS patients (14 %). There was no significant association with disease severity, symptoms, or laboratory markers. The spike protein concentration was independent of the time since last spike exposure (infection or vaccination). In five spike-positive out of a total of 22 patients who underwent immunoglobulin depletion via immunoadsorption (IA), spike protein was reduced or completely removed after treatment, indicating binding to immunoglobulins.

In summary, our study identified serum spike protein in a subset of patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection without evidence for a role in the pathogenesis of PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1731881326147

To identify RNA targets that bind directly with splice modulating compounds, we deployed a photoaffinity labeling (PAL)-based Chem-CLIP approach. Through this workflow, we identify the telomerase lncRNA (TERC) as a previously unknown target of this class of clinically relevant small molecules. Using cellular {triangleup} SHAPE-MaP, we orthogonally validate and further define the compound binding site as likely to be the conserved CR4/5 domain.

Here, we performed paired single nucleus gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiling from 44 human coronary arteries. To link disease variants to molecular traits, we developed a meta-map of 88 samples and discovered 11,182 single-cell chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTLs). Heritability enrichment analysis and disease variant mapping demonstrated that smooth muscle cells (SMCs) harbor the greatest genetic risk for CAD. To capture the continuum of SMC cell states in disease, we used dynamic single cell caQTL modeling for the first time in tissue to uncover QTLs whose effects are modified by cell state and expand our insight into genetic regulation of heterogenous cell populations. Notably, we identified a variant in the COL4A1/COL4A2 CAD GWAS locus which becomes a caQTL as SMCs de-differentiate by changing a transcription factor binding site for EGR1/2. To unbiasedly prioritize functional candidate genes, we built a genome-wide single cell variant to enhancer to gene (scV2E2G) map for human CAD to link disease variants to causal genes in cell types. Using this approach, we found several hundred genes predicted to be linked to disease variants in different cell types. Next, we performed genome-wide Hi-C in 16 human coronary arteries to build tissue specific maps of chromatin conformation and link disease variants to integrated chromatin hubs and distal target genes. Using this approach, we show that rs4887091 within the ADAMTS7 CAD GWAS locus modulates function of a super chromatin interactome through a change in a CTCF binding site. Finally, we used CRISPR interference to validate a distal gene, AMOTL2, liked to a CAD GWAS locus. Collectively we provide a disease-agnostic framework to translate human genetic findings to identify pathologic cell states and genes driving disease, producing a comprehensive scV2E2G map with genetic and tissue level convergence for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies.","NA","medrxiv",1731881326147

Early-life disruptions in these circuits are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting the importance of understanding their development. Our study uncovers that transcription factors SOX4, SOX11, and TFAP2D play a pivotal role in the development, identity, and PFC connectivity of these neurons. Using mouse models, we demonstrate that the absence of transcription factors SOX4 and SOX11 in post-mitotic ExNs dramatically reduces the size of the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC), claustrum, and PIR. SOX4 and SOX11 control BLC formation through direct regulation of Tfap2d expression. Cross-species analyses, including humans, identified conserved Tfap2d expression in developing ExNs of BLC, claustrum, paleocortex including PIR, and the associated transitional areas of the frontal, insular and temporal cortex. While the loss and haploinsufficiency of Tfap2d yield similar alterations in learned threat behaviors, differences emerge in the manifestation of Tfap2d dosage, particularly in terms of changes observed in BLC size and the connectivity pattern between the BLC and PFC. This underscores the significance of Tfap2d dosage in orchestrating developmental shifts in BLC-PFC connectivity and behavioral modifications reminiscent of symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Together, these findings reveal key elements of a conserved gene regulatory network that shapes the development and function of crucial ventropallial ExNs and their PFC connectivity and offer insights into their evolution and alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326147

One of the most striking and well-known phenomena bearing on this question is inattentional blindness (IB; Neisser & Becklen, 1975; Mack & Rock, 1998; Most et al., 2001, 2005). In IB, naive observers fail to report clearly visible stimuli when their attention is otherwise engaged--famously even missing a gorilla parading before their eyes (Simons & Chabris, 1999). This phenomenon and the research programs it has motivated carry tremendous theoretical significance, both as crucial evidence that awareness requires attention (Cohen et al., 2012; Prinz, 2012; Noah & Mangun, 2020) and as a key tool in seeking the neural correlates of consciousness (Rees et al., 1999; Pitts et al., 2014; Hutchinson, 2019). However, these and other implications critically rest on a notoriously biased measure: asking participants whether they noticed anything unusual (and interpreting negative answers as reflecting a complete lack of perception). Here, in the largest ever set of IB studies, we show that, as a group, inattentionally blind participants can successfully report the location, color and shape of the stimuli they deny noticing. This residual visual sensitivity shows that perceptual information remains accessible in IB. We further show that subjective reports in IB are conservative, by introducing absent trials where no IB stimulus is presented; this approach allows us to show for the first time that observers collectively show a systematic bias to report not noticing in IB--essentially  playing it safe in reporting their sensitivity. This pair of results is consistent with an alternative hypothesis about IB, namely that inattentionally blind subjects retain some degree of awareness of the stimuli they fail to report. Overall, these data provide the strongest evidence to date of significant residual visual sensitivity in IB. They also challenge the use of inattentional blindness to argue that awareness requires attention.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326148

The effect is significant, as demonstrated by a variety of statistical measures. As no definitive biophysical mechanism has been identified to account for its occurrence, this study raises the question of which mechanism provides the most plausible explanation. How that question is answered may have implications in a variety of fields, including human health, behavioral ecology, and space exploration.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326148

This problem often has multiple solutions that cannot be distinguished based on current maximum parsimony principles alone. Current algorithms use ad hoc criteria to select among these solutions, and decide, a priori, what patterns of metastatic spread are more likely, which is itself a key question posed by studies of metastasis seeking to use these tools. Here we introduce Metient, a freely available open-source tool which proposes multiple possible hypotheses of metastatic spread in a cohort of patients and rescores these hypotheses using independent data on genetic distance of metastasizing clones and organotropism. Metient is more accurate and is up to 50x faster than current state-of-the-art. Given a cohort of patients, Metient can calibrate its parsimony criteria, thereby identifying shared patterns of metastatic dissemination in the cohort. Reanalyzing metastasis in 169 patients based on 490 tumors, Metient automatically identifies cancer type-specific trends of metastatic dissemination in melanoma, high-risk neuroblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Metients reconstructions usually agree with semi-manual expert analysis, however, in many patients, Metient identifies more plausible migration histories than experts, and further finds that polyclonal seeding of metastases is more common than previously reported. By removing the need for hard constraints on what patterns of metastatic spread are most likely, Metient introduces a way to further our understanding of cancer type-specific metastatic spread.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326148

However, weight regain occurs when treatment is discontinued. An increase in skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) efficiency upon diet-mediated weight loss has been described, which may contribute to reduced systemic energy expenditure and weight regain. We set out to determine the unknown effect of semaglutide on muscle OXPHOS efficiency. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks before receiving semaglutide or vehicle for 1 or 3 weeks. The rate of ATP production and O2 consumption were measured by a high-resolution respirometry and fluorometry to determine OXPHOS efficiency in skeletal muscle at these 2 timepoints. Results: Semaglutide treatment led to significant reductions in fat and lean mass. Semaglutide improved skeletal muscle OXPHOS efficiency, measured as ATP produced per O2 consumed (P/O) in permeabilized muscle fibers. Mitochondrial proteomic analysis revealed changes restricted to two proteins linked to complex III assembly (Lyrm7 and Ttc1, p < 0.05 without multiple corrections) without substantial changes in the abundance of OXPHOS subunits. Conclusions: These data indicate that weight loss with semaglutide treatment increases skeletal muscle mitochondrial efficiency. Future studies could test whether it contributes to weight regain.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326148

Advanced spatial transcriptomics has enabled biologists to break new ground in studies of molecular dynamics and cellular patterning during embryonic development with spatiotemporal resolution. To construct a comprehensive developmental trajectory, current three-dimensional (3D) spatial transcriptomic profiling leverages mouse embryos from gastrulation (E5.5) to organogenesis (E13.5) in continuity. However, a crucial phase for early organogenesis between E9.5 and E11.5 was deficient. To unveil the mystery of this stage, we present the 3D transcriptomics of mouse embryos at E9.5 and E11.5, with a widely applicable reconstruction workflow that bypasses sophisticated bioinformatic calculations. As our 3D atlas is generated at single-cell resolution, we demonstrate how organogenetic processes can be interpreted at different levels of granularity, from local cellular interactions to whole embryonic regionalization.

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326148

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326148

Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326148

Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326148

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1731881326148

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.
