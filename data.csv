While previous studies have focused on characterizing PASC and identifying its subphenotypes in children and adolescents following an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, the risks of PASC with Omicron-variant reinfections remain unclear. Using a real-world data approach, this study investigates the risks of PASC following reinfections during the Omicron phase in the pediatric population. OBJECTIVE To investigate the risks of PASC diagnosis and 24 PASC symptoms and conditions after reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 during Omicron period in the pediatric population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 40 children's hospitals and health institutions in U.S. between January 2022 and October 2023. EXPOSURES A second SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) or antigen tests, or a diagnose of COVID-19, occurring at least 60 days after the initial infection, compared to the initial infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES PASC was identified using two approaches: (1) the ICD-10-CM diagnosis code U09.9 and (2) a symptom-based definition including 24 physician-identified symptoms and conditions. Absolute risks of incident PASC were reported, and relative risks (RRs) were calculated by comparing the second infection episode with the first infection episode groups using a modified Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through exact matching and propensity scoring matching. RESULTS A total of 465,717 individuals under 21 years old (mean [SD] age 8.17 [6.58] years; 52% male) were included. Compared to the first infection, a second infection was associated with significantly increased risk of an overall PASC diagnosis (RR, 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-2.59), and with many specific conditions including: myocarditis (RR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.46-8.86); changes in taste and smell (RR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.41-5.67); thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism (RR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.71-3.04); heart disease (RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.69 to 2.28); acute kidney injury (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.38 to 2.61); fluid and electrolyte (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.62 to 2.20); generalized pain (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.48 to 1.95); arrhythmias (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.45-1.74); abnormal liver enzyme (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.96); fatigue and malaise (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.64); musculoskeletal pain (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.37 to 1.54); abdominal pain (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.34 to 1.50); postural orthostatic tachycardia syndromes (POTS)/dysautonomia (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.51); cognitive functions (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.50); and respiratory signs and symptoms (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.33). The risks were consistent across various organ systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children and adolescents face significantly higher risk of various PASC outcomes after reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest a cumulative risk of PASC and highlight the urgent need for targeted prevention strategies to reduce reinfections, which includes an increased emphasis on initial or re-vaccination of children.","NA","medrxiv",1743458968043

Two factors that likely contribute to this situation include (a) conceptual disagreement about language and its component processes, and (b) intrinsic inter-individual variability in the topography of language areas. Recent functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) studies of small numbers of intensively scanned individuals have argued that a language-selective brain network emerges from correlations (individualized functional connectomics, iFC) in task-free (e.g., rest) or task-regressed activation timecourses. Here we test this hypothesis at scale and evaluate its practical utility for task-agnostic language localization: we apply iFC separately to each of 1,971 (fMRI) scanning sessions (1,199 unique brains), each consisting of diverse tasks. We find that iFC indeed reveals a left-lateralized frontotemporal network that is more stable within individuals than between them, robust to the granularity of the parcellation, and selective for language. These results support the hypothesis that this network is a key structure in the functional organization of the adult brain and show that it can be recovered retrospectively from arbitrary imaging data, with implications for neuroscience, neurosurgery, and neural engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

A common theme is generating a nucleotide-derived second messenger in response to phage that activates an effector protein to halt virion production. Phages respond with counter-defenses that deplete these second messengers, leading to an escalating arms race with the host. Here we discover a novel antiphage system we call Panoptes that detects phage infection by surveying the cytosol for phage proteins that antagonize the nucleotide-derived second messenger pool. Panoptes is a two-gene operon, optSE. OptS is predicted to synthesize a second messenger using a minimal CRISPR polymerase (mCpol) domain, a version of the polymerase domain found in Type III CRISPR systems (Cas10) that is distantly related to GGDEF and Thg1 tRNA repair polymerase domains. OptE is predicted to be a transmembrane effector protein that binds cyclic nucleotides. optSE potently restricted phage replication but mutant phages that had loss-of-function mutations in anti-CBASS protein 2 (Acb2) escaped defense. These findings were unexpected because Acb2 is a nucleotide sponge that antagonizes second messenger signaling. Using genetic and biochemical assays, we found that Acb2 bound the OptS-synthesized nucleotide, 2',3'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( 2',3'-c-di-AMP ); however, 2',3'-c-di-AMP was synthesized constitutively by OptS and inhibited OptE. Nucleotide depletion by Acb2 released OptE toxicity thereby initiating abortive infection to halt phage replication. These data demonstrate a sophisticated immune strategy that hosts use to guard their second messenger pool and turn immune evasion against the virus.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

In these pathways, including CBASS and type III CRISPR systems in bacteria and cGAS-STING in humans, oligonucleotide synthesis occurs upon detection of virus or foreign genetic material in the cell, triggering the antiviral response. In a surprising inversion of this process, we show here that the CRISPR-related enzyme mCpol synthesizes cyclic oligonucleotides constitutively as part of an active mechanism that maintains cell health. Cell-based experiments demonstrated that the absence or loss of mCpol-produced cyclic oligonucleotides triggers cell death, preventing spread of viruses that attempt immune evasion by depleting host cyclic nucleotides. Structural and mechanistic investigation revealed mCpol to be a di-adenylate cyclase whose product, c-di-AMP, prevents toxic oligomerization of the effector protein 2TM{beta}. Analysis of cells by fluorescence microscopy showed that lack of mCpol allows 2TM{beta} oligomerization and consequent cell death due to inner membrane collapse. These findings unveil a powerful new defense strategy against virus-mediated immune suppression, expanding our understanding of oligonucleotides in cell health and disease. These results raise the possibility of similar protective roles for cyclic oligonucleotides in other organisms including humans.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

This study presents the first comprehensive investigation of microbial communities inhabiting heritage artifacts from Argentina's Museum of Independence. By integrating advanced microscopy with phenotypic and genomic characterization, we analyzed samples collected from wooden objects, textiles, architectural elements, and exterior walls. Scanning electron microscopy revealed diverse and well-structured biofilms, with intricate three-dimensional arrangements embedded in extracellular polymeric substances. A total of 49 bacterial strains were isolated and identified via VITEK MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, with a predominance of Gram-positive genera such as Bacillus, Micrococcus, and Kocuria. Remarkably, the 19th-century albumen print photograph emerged as the most biodiverse artifact, yielding 21 distinct strains, including Streptomyces, Oceanobacillus, and thermophilic Caldibacillus thermoamylovorans. The protein-rich and halophilic environment of the albumen layer likely facilitated microbial colonization and persistence. Pseudomonas species were exclusively associated with this photographic substrate, further underscoring its niche specificity. Human-associated taxa like Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus equorum were prevalent in high-contact areas, while exterior surfaces displayed distinct microbial signatures, including potential pathogens linked to environmental exposure. These findings reveal a complex and artifact-specific microbial landscape, emphasizing the need for tailored, bio-informed conservation strategies. This work advances the field of heritage microbiology and supports efforts to safeguard culturally significant objects through a deeper understanding of their microbial ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

Understanding the functions of vocal mimicry can help to uncover the evolutionary drivers of vocal learning. Different adaptive functions like interspecific and intraspecific communication have been suggested, as well as the possibility of vocal mimicry to be a mistake during vocal learning. In the present study, we review the occurrence of mimicry in the family of corvids and investigate the socio -ecological factors driving the evolution of vocal mimicry in this group of birds. We recorded evidence of vocal mimicry from primary (xeno -canto recordings) as well as secondary sources (published literature) and found evidence for vocal mimicry in 31 out of 128 corvid species (24%). Smaller species were described as mimics more compared to larger species. Other socio-ecological factors like breeding status, habitat and trophic niche did not have a significant effect. More mimicry was recorded during the non-breeding season compared to the breeding season. We used Bayesian modelling based on existing data from primary and secondary sources to estimate the occurrence of mimicry, suggesting that vocal mimicry may be more widespread among corvids than currently documented, with many species potentially being 'hidden mimics'. Our study for the first time systematically reviews the occurrence of vocal mimicry across the family of corvids and investigates a range of socio-ecological factors driving the behaviour. Our analysis suggests many corvid species likely to be 'hidden' mimics and we provide specific suggestions for species which according to our statistical model are most likely mimicking corvid species, hopefully inspiring future field work on those species.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

Methods: Data were extracted from linked administrative healthcare claims and electronic health records (EHR) for vaccinations from 23 August 2024 through 24 December 2024 and followed through 31 December 2024. We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study with propensity score weighting to adjust for differences between groups to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 outcomes. VE was calculated as 1 minus the hazard ratio (HR) from Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Overall, 465,073 mRNA-1273 KP.2 vaccine recipients were matched 1:1 to unexposed adults. The mean (standard deviation) age was 63 (17) years, with more than half of the population being 65 years or older. Approximately 70% of individuals had an underlying medical condition making them high risk for severe outcomes for COVID-19. VE was 52.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.8%, 65.8%) against COVID-19-related hospitalization and 39.4% (35.0%, 43.5%) against medically attended COVID-19 over a median follow-up of 57 (interquartile range: 33 to 78) days. Conclusion: The mRNA-1273 KP.2 vaccine demonstrated significant incremental effectiveness in preventing hospitalization with COVID-19 and medically attended COVID-19 in adults during the 2024-2025 season to date.

We previously observed that during experimental evolution in the presence of abundant susceptible hosts, the AMR plasmid R1 rapidly evolves variants with increased horizontal transmission due to mutations causing increased plasmid copy number. Yet AMR was progressively lost from the evolving populations. Here, we show that AMR loss was associated with evolution of ""stealth"" plasmids in which the AMR region is spontaneously deleted, making plasmid carriage undetectable by plating on selective antibiotic-containing media. These plasmids transmit both vertically and horizontally more efficiently than the ancestral AMR plasmid, driving AMR extinction in bacterial populations and effectively acting as an intrinsic defence against AMR plasmids. Our results suggest that within-host plasmid evolution could be exploited to limit the spread of AMR in natural populations of bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

The etiology of PMDD, or more generally premenstrual syndrome (PMS) including subclinical forms, is not well understood and both biological and psychological models have been postulated. In the current manuscript we explore the role of emotion regulation ability for the emergence of premenstrual symptoms. Specifically, we were interested whether difficulties in emotion regulation in women with PMS/PMDD persisted as a trait across all cycle phases or were specific to the symptomatic premenstrual phase. We also explored for the first time, whether difficulties in emotion regulation already emerged during the high progesterone mid-luteal phase. 105 women aged 18 to 35 years completed a trait questionnaire on difficulties in emotion regulation, as well as two state measures of emotion regulation during three cycle phases (mid-follicular, mid-luteal, premenstrual). PMS/PMDD was prospectively confirmed across two menstrual cycles in 54 women, while the remaining 51 were assigned to the control group. Our results confirm previous findings that women with PMS/PMDD subjectively report more difficulties in emotion regulation on a trait scale. However, these difficulties were not confirmed in any of the state measures employed in the current study. Furthermore, difficulties in emotion regulation did not account for premenstrual symptom severity in a mediation analysis. This raises the question, whether difficulties in emotion regulation underly premenstrual symptoms or the perception of impaired emotion regulation arises as a consequence of untreated PMS/PMDD. Noteworthy, we were also able to demonstrate via Bayesian analyses, that mood worsening in the premenstrual phase is not a universal occurrence and absent in healthy controls. Taken together these findings highlight the importance of adequate diagnosis and treatment of PMDD.","NA","medrxiv",1743458968043

MethodsRetrospective spatial analysis. Distances between each inpatient facility and the nearest wildfire perimeter were computed on an annual basis using data from the California Department of Health Care Access and Information and CAL-FIREs Fire and Resource Assessment Program. Temporal changes were analyzed via Kruskal-Wallis and linear models.

ResultsThe distance from inpatient healthcare facilities in California to nearby wildfires is decreasing by an average of 628 feet per year, while close approaches are increasing; during 2017-2023, there was 53% increase in the number of inpatient beds within five miles of a wildfire as compared with 2001-2008.

ConclusionWildfires are occurring closer to inpatient healthcare facilities in California. An increasing proportion of Californias inpatient bed capacity is exposed to nearby wildfires. Policies to reduce risk posed by wildfires, prepare for evacuations, preserve access to healthcare, and ensure safe location of new facilities are urgently needed to ensure the safety of patients and the wellbeing of populations that depend on inpatient healthcare services.","NA","medrxiv",1743458968043

The estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene encodes the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) which plays a critical role in mediating estrogen signaling and regulates various physiological and psychological processes. In this study, we investigated the relationship between six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in intron 4 of the ESR1 gene and premenstrual symptom severity, emphasizing symptom- genotype associations and SNP interactions. Results demonstrated that specific SNPs were linked to distinct symptom profiles, such as anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances.

Both factors are associated with accelerated brain decline, yet it remains unclear whether memory loss is exacerbated beyond what atrophy alone would predict. Additionally, we assessed whether memory decline aligns with a global pattern of atrophy or stems from distinct regional contributions. Our mega-analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship between memory decline and brain atrophy, primarily affecting individuals with above-average brain structural decline. The associations were stronger in the hippocampus but also spread across diverse cortical and subcortical regions. The associations strengthened with age, reaching moderate associations in participants in their eighties. While APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers exhibited steeper brain and memory loss, genetic risk had no effect on the change-change associations. These findings support the presence of common biological macrostructural substrates underlying memory function in older age which are vulnerable to multiple age-related factors, even in the absence of overt pathological changes.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

However, the gut microbiome can interact with these parasites to influence infection outcomes, raising the possibility that its response to increasing temperatures may help buffer against increased infection burden. To evaluate this hypothesis, we sought to determine if the microbiome is resistant or resilient to the stressors of increased water temperature, helminth exposure, and their combination, and whether this variation linked to infection outcomes. We leveraged the zebrafish (Danio rerio) model organism to measure how these variables relate to the temporal dynamics of the gut microbiome. In particular, we exposed adult zebrafish to the parasitic whipworm Pseudocapillaria tomentosa across three different water temperatures (28oC, 32oC, 35oC), and analyzed fecal microbiome samples at five time points across 42 days. Our findings show that parasite exposure and water temperature independently alter gut microbiome diversity. Moreover, we find that water temperature moderates the association between parasite infection and the gut microbiome. Consistent with this observation, but at odds with current expectations, we find that increasing water temperature reduces parasitic infection in fish. Overall, our results indicate that water temperature alters the contextual landscape of the gut microbiome to impact its response to an exogenous stressor of an intestinal parasite in zebrafish. Furthermore, our findings represent the first report of the effects of elevated temperature on parasitic nematode development in a fish host. Importantly, our study demonstrates that climate change may have unanticipated and environmentally contingent impacts to vertebrate gut microbiomes and health outcomes in response to an exogenous stressor.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

However, the role of these proteins in archaea is currently unknown. Here, we describe a new class of archaeal OLD family ATPases and show that they are not involved in antiviral defense but play an essential role in cell cycle progression. We show that an OLD family enzyme of Saccharolobus islandicus REY15A (SisOLD) is essential for cell viability and exhibits cyclic expression patterns at both transcriptional and translational levels, displaying the peak expression during the genome synthesis (S) cell cycle phase. SisOLD overexpression or knockdown leads to significant growth retardation, cell size enlargement, and increased cellular DNA content. The ATPase activity but not the nickase activity of SisOLD is crucial for the normal cell cycle progression. Notably, SisOLD copurifies with chromatin-associated proteins, such as Cren7 and a histone deacetylase homolog, suggesting involvement in chromosome remodeling following its replication. Collectively our results suggest that SisOLD plays an important role in chromatin processing and remodeling, revealing a novel function of OLD family proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

Heterochromatin erosion is a hallmark of human ageing and H3K9me3 is lost globally in aged mammalian cells. However, the functional consequences of the loss of heterochromatin maintenance have been challenging to model. In this study, we used CRISPRi-mediated deletion of the H3K9me3 methyltransferase SETDB1 in human neural progenitor cells to model disruption of heterochromatin maintenance. Deletion of SETDB1 had a limited effect on cell viability, despite a global loss of H3K9me3 peaks resulting in genome-wide reorganization of heterochromatin domains, cells remained proliferative and expressed appropriate marker genes. We found that a key event following the loss of H3K9me3 maintenance was the expression of evolutionarily young L1 retrotransposons. Derepression of L1s was associated with a loss of CpG DNA methylation at their promoters, suggesting that deposition of H3K9me3 at the L1 promoter is required to maintain DNA methylation. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that loss of H3K9me3 in human neural somatic cells transcriptionally activates evolutionary young L1 retrotransposons, further implicating these elements in human ageing processes.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

To address the issue, we developed the restraint-guided inference method that applies stereochemical restraints during the reverse diffusion process. This approach perfectly reproduces the chirality specified in the input chemical structure and improves bond and angle geometries of ligands, while maintaining comparable performance in binding pose prediction.

Central laboratories, equipped with advanced real-time PCR equipment and highly skilled staff, worked long hours to produce test results for travellers, hospital patients, and the general public. We developed a SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic assay suitable for point-of-care testing to address this diagnostic challenge. Methods: Recombinase amplification coupled with fluorescent detection was chosen as the technology, as it was freely available. Using a mobile fluorescent detection device ensures foolproof results interpretation, point-of-care testing and minimal footprint in facilities. Designed as a one-step reverse transcriptase real-time isothermal assay utilising the FAM and ROX channels. Specimens were tested using commercially available real-time PCR assays to evaluate the performance characteristics of the assay. Results: The SARS-CoV-2 Isothermal Molecular Assay (SIMA) detects the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene and a human gene to differentiate poor specimen collection. SIMA runs at 40C for 36 minutes, with the first six minutes dedicated to reverse transcription. It has a detection limit of 555 RNA copies/mL. Highly positive specimens are detected within three minutes, but the 30-minute run time allows for detecting low-positive Specimens. Sensitivity was 95%, with 100% specificity, while precision ranged from 4% to 6% Conclusions: We report the performance characteristics of SIMA, the first molecular diagnostics developed in Nigeria for SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care diagnosis. Its performance and utility give hope for rapid diagnosis and treatment in resource-constrained settings.","NA","medrxiv",1743458968043

Despite advances in collagen extraction protocols, the process remains destructive, requiring sampling by sawing, drilling or crushing of dry bone, that can damage or destroy physical features and archaeological evidence, and often consumes the entire specimen. While non-destructive approaches have recently been applied in ancient genomics and palaeoproteomics, no equivalent approach has been established for radiocarbon dating of bone. Here, we outline a non-destructive collagen extraction workflow that avoids invasive sampling (cutting or drilling) and produces no visible damage to the bone. By heating the bone in hot water for several hours, collagen is solubilized, and the resulting collagenous solution can be purified and AMS dated. Here we show that the amino acid composition, C/N atomic ratios, {delta}13C and {delta}15N values of the hot-water-extracted collagen are comparable to collagen isolated from the same bones using classic decalcification methodologies. The hot water extraction method was tested on various bones, ranging from the Bronze Age to the Middle and Upper Paleolithic periods, which had been dated previously using routine destructive methods that involved acid demineralization. Our results show that non-destructive collagen extraction, coupled with an additional purification step e.g., ultrafiltration, yields identical radiocarbon ages to those obtained via the routine destructive methods.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

Given this importance, the rational design of microbiomes with targeted functional properties is an important objective. Designing microbial consortia with targeted functions is challenging due to complex community interactions and environmental heterogeneity. Community-function landscapes address this challenge by statistically inferring impacts of species presence or absence on function. Similar to fitness landscapes, community-function landscapes are shaped by both additive effects and interactions (epistasis) among species that influence function. Here, we apply the community-function landscape approach to design synthetic microbial consortia to degrade the toxic environmental contaminant bisphenol-A (BPA). Using synthetic communities of BPA-degrading isolates, we map community-function landscapes across increasing BPA concentrations, where higher BPA means greater toxicity. As toxicity increases, so does epistasis, indicating that collective effects become more important in degradation. Further, we leverage landscapes to rationally design communities with predictable BPA degradation dynamics in vitro. Remarkably, designed synthetic communities are able to remediate BPA in contaminated soils. Our results demonstrate that toxicity can drive epistatic interactions in community-function landscapes and that these landscapes can guide microbial consortia design for bioremediation.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

Although mouse models of AD have provided insight into neurobiological mechanisms contributing to impaired formation and retrieval of new memories, the process underlying the progressive loss of remote memories in AD has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate age-dependent remote memory decline in APP/PS1 mice, which coincides with progressive hyperexcitability of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Analysis of Fos expression showed that the remote memory deficit is not mirrored by changes in reactivation of memory-encoding neurons, so-called engram cells, nor PV interneuron (re)activation, in the mPFC. However, inhibitory input is enhanced onto engram cells compared to non-engram cells specifically in APP/PS1 mice. Our data indicate that age-dependent remote memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice is due to increased innervation of cortical engram cells by hyperexcitable PV interneurons, suggesting that dysfunctional inhibitory microcircuits in the neocortex mediate progressive retrograde amnesia in AD.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

While early visual areas are known to encode retinotopic positions, how these representations transform into invariant neural codes remains unclear. Building on a computational model of reading, we used 7T fMRI and MEG to reveal a cortical hierarchy in which early visual areas (V1-V4) predominantly encode retinotopic information, whereas higher-level regions, including the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), transition to an ordinal letter-position code. MEG analyses confirm that retinotopic encoding emerges early (60-200 ms), followed by a shift toward ordinal representations in later time windows (220-450 ms). Despite this transition, word position remained a dominant factor across all time points, suggesting a concurrent coding of both retinotopic and abstract positional information. These findings uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics by which the human brain transforms visual input into structured linguistic representations, shedding light on the cortical stages of reading and their developmental and clinical implications.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

Using single-cell hierarchical Poisson factorization (scHPF), we derived a 23-factor model for continuous gene expression signatures across microglia which capture specific biological processes (e.g., metabolism, phagocytosis, antigen presentation, inflammatory signaling, disease-associated states). Using external datasets, we evaluated the aspects of microglial phenotypes that are encapsulated in various in vitro and in vivo microglia models and identified and replicated the role of two factors in human postmortem tissue of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Further, we derived a complex network of transcriptional regulators for all factors, including regulators of an AD-related factor enriched for the mouse disease-associated microglia 2 (DAM2) signature: ARID5B, CEBPA, MITF, and PPARG. We replicated the role of these four regulators in the AD-related factor and then designed a multiplexed MERFISH panel to assess our microglial factors using spatial transcriptomics.

Domestication of its wild progenitor, the African wildcat (F. lybica), is widely attributed to the emergence of farming. Wildcats are said to have been attracted to settled communities by the rodent populations that were thriving within this new agricultural niche. Some claim the African wildcat even reached Europe during the Neolithic, though many credit the Romans with their dispersal. Through a program of zooarchaeological analysis, genetic identification and radiocarbon dating, we redefine the established chronology for the cat's domestication and dispersal across Europe. We argue that early human-cat relationships were more complex than the commensal and mutualistic pathways that have been proposed, and that both the domestication and translocation of cats were linked to its association with deities. Our results suggest domestic cats first arrived in Europe prior to Roman expansion during the early first millennium BCE, and that successive populations of domestic cats with unique mitochondrial signatures were introduced during the Roman, Late Antique and Viking periods. Lastly, by characterising the spatiotemporal representation of both domestic cats and the native European wildcat (F. silvestris), we argue that the introduction of domestic cats precipitated a decline in native European wildcat populations.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

Its global distribution alongside humans testifies to its successful adaptation to anthropogenic environments. Uncertainty remains regarding whether domestic cats originated in the Levant, Egypt or elsewhere in its natural range, and on the timing and circumstances of their dispersal into Europe. By analysing 87 ancient and modern cat genomes, we demonstrate that domestic cats did not spread to Europe with Neolithic farmers, as previously thought. Conversely, our results suggest that they were introduced to Europe over the last 2,000 years, most likely from North Africa. We also demonstrate that a separate earlier (1st millennium BCE) introduction of wildcats from Northwest Africa originated the present-day wild population in Sardinia.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

However, most available data on pathogen-host interactions are based on in vitro findings, neglecting the genetic complexity of the immune response. We conducted a comparative observational study of bacterial and viral meningitis to identify pathogen-specific and host-dependent inflammatory pathways that may predict the severity of infection by analysing 54 inflammatory factors using plexing technology. Infection severity and neurological disability were assessed using the modified RANKIN scale. To identify pathogen-specific and host-dependent pathways, plex data were entered into EMBiology(R) software and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. We also investigated pathogen- and host-dependent regulatory effects on blood-brain barrier function using human iPSC-derived endothelial cells as a model. BBB function was characterised at the level of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), endothelial apoptosis and drug transporter activity. We identified 36 factors that are highly differentially regulated in either bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis compared to healthy subjects, 15 of which have not been previously described. GSEA identified previously unknown pathogen-specific pathways including neurotrophin, NOTCH, immune tolerance, antiviral defence and tight junction signalling. As a key finding, we identified 15 host-dependent factors that correlated with the grade of disability and with blood-CSF barrier dysfunction. GSEA revealed stronger responses of neuroprotective (AKT/ERK), anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2/p53) and anti-inflammatory (JAK1/STAT1) pathways in patients with favourable course, whereas patients with severe infection show stronger pro-inflammatory STAT-activation, NKC/CTL-responses and NFk-B-associated neurotoxicity. BBB analysis supports these findings with dysregulation of TEER, drug transporter activity and induction of endothelial cell death in patients with severe infection. Our data highlight the need for future approaches to personalised medicine that go beyond traditional anti-infective therapy to target the individual immune response.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

The FDA-approved mKIs to date ablate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling but do not target the paradoxical WNT signaling which is a key survival driver for the self-renewing cancer stem cells. The WNT pathway enhances cancer plasticity and triggers relapse of highly heterogenous tumours. Using de novo synthesis and structure-activity-relationship (SAR) studies with blood-brain-barrier (BBB) penetrant mKI scaffolds, we designed a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of PI3K, PDGFR/KIT, and the WNT pathway denoted Dyr726. Dyr726 is superior to clinical mKIs and inhibits PI3K-AKT-mTOR and WNT-pathway signaling at multiple nodes thereby impeding proliferation, invasion, and tumour growth. Phospho-proteomic, structural, and target engagement analyses, combined with in vitro, in vivo efficacy, and pharmacokinetic studies reveal that Dyr726 is a brain-penetrant small molecule which effectively reduces tumour volume and extends survival of murine orthotopic models. Our current work establishes a first-in-class brain penetrant small molecule mKI which simultaneously antagonize the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and WNT pathways in preclinical cancer stem cell cultures, adult and pediatric primary organoids, and orthotopic murine models with positive efficacy in combination with clinical standard of care.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

However, the complexity of microbial communities and their interactions complicates mechanistic research on processes governing microbiota assembly and function. Gnotobiotic systems are valuable tools to study plant microbiota by reducing complexity and enabling controlled microbiota reconstitution experiments. Despite their utility, no gnotobiotic systems have been established to investigate the role of antimicrobial effector proteins in the interactions between plants, their microbiota, and fungal pathogens. Here, we present a refined gnotobiotic system designed to study these interactions, establishing protocols for infections with the fungal pathogen Verticillium dahliae across multiple host plants under sterile conditions. We demonstrate that a synthetic microbial community (SynCom) derived from a culture collection generated for this study can be applied in this system where it interferes with fungal infections. Additionally, using our gnotobiotic system we reveal that specific antimicrobial effectors of V. dahliae, like Ave1L2, contribute to fungal virulence in a microbiota-dependent manner, whereas other antimicrobial effectors, such as Ave1, seem to possess functions beyond microbiota manipulation.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

We have examined cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS), a preparation technique based on cutting thin sections with a knife, as an alternative to FIB-milling. CEMOVIS sections also sustain damage, including compression, shearing and cracks. However, samples can be sectioned in series, producing many orders of magnitude more imageable area compared to lamellae making CEMOVIS an alternative to FIB-milling with distinct advantages. Using 2-dimensional template matching on images of CEMOVIS sections of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, we reconstructed the 60S ribosomal subunit at near-atomic resolution, demonstrating that, in many regions of the sections, the molecular structure of these subunits is largely intact, comparable to FIB-milled lamellae.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

Yet how enhancers determine transcription of their target genes, and how this depends on their relative position inside a cis-regulatory landscape remains unclear. Here we use live-cell imaging to track the activity of a promoter under the control of the same enhancer, but inserted at different positions across a simplified regulatory landscape with minimal complexity. Combined with mathematical modeling, this reveals that RNA production from the promoter occurs in clusters of transcriptional bursts, with enhancer position controlling the frequency at which such clusters appear. This results in bursts being more frequent and occurring more uniformly across cells when the enhancer is genomically close to the promoter than when it is located at large genomic distance. Mathematical modeling further indicates that the enhancer modulates the promoter's ability to transition from its basal transcriptional state to a regime where clusters of bursts become more frequent. Our results challenge existing models of mammalian promoter operation, and reveal that enhancer position within a cis-regulatory landscape critically controls the timing and variability of transcriptional output in single cells.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

Upper cervical (C1-C2) DRGs are functionally unique as they receive input from the neck, head, and occipital cranial dura, the latter two of which are also innervated by the trigeminal ganglion (TG). The C2 DRG also plays an important role in neck pain, a common and disabling disorder that is poorly understood. Advanced transcriptomic approaches have significantly improved our ability to characterize RNA expression patterns at single-cell resolution in the DRG and TG, but no previous studies have characterized the C2 DRG. Our aim was to use single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic approaches to create a molecular map of C2 DRGs from patients undergoing arthrodesis surgery with ganglionectomy. Patients with acute (<3 months) or chronic ([&ge;]3 months) neck pain were enrolled and completed patient-reported outcomes and quantitative sensory testing prior to surgery. C2 DRGs were characterized with bulk, single nucleus, and spatial RNA sequencing technologies from 22 patients. Through a comparative analysis to published datasets of the lumbar DRG and TG, neuronal clusters identified in both TG and DRG were identified in the C2 DRG. Therefore, our study definitively characterizes the molecular composition of human C2 neurons and establishes their similarity with unique characteristics of subsets of TG neurons. We identified differentially expressed genes in endothelial, fibroblast and myelinating Schwann cells associated with chronic pain, including FGFBP2, C8orf34 and EFNA1 which have been identified in previous genome and transcriptome wide association studies (GWAS/TWAS). Our work establishes an atlas of the human C2 DRG and identifies altered gene expression patterns associated with chronic neck pain.

Herein, we report the clinical and genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infections from 179 individuals (total 185 positive samples) residing in the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance (KHDSS) area ([~]900 km2). Sixteen SARS-CoV-2 lineages within three sub-variants (XBB.2.3-like (58.4%), JN.1-like (40.5%) and XBB.1-like (1.1%)) were identified. Symptomatic infection rate was estimated at 16.0% (95% CI 11.1%-23.9%) based on community testing regardless of symptom status, and did not differ across the sub-variants (p = 0.13). The most common infection symptoms in community cases were cough (49.2%), fever (27.0%), sore throat (7.3%), headache (6.9%), and difficulty in breathing (5.5%) and one case succumbed to the infection. Genomic analysis of the virus from serial positives samples confirmed repeat infections among five participants under follow-up (median interval 21 days, range 16-95 days); in four participants, the same virus lineage was responsible in both the first and second infections, while one participant had a different lineage in the second infection compared to the first. Phylogenetic analysis including >18,000 contemporaneous global sequences estimated that at least 38 independent virus introduction events occurred into the KHDSS area during the wave, the majority likely originating in North America and Europe. Our study highlights coastal Kenya, like most other localities, continues to face new SARS-CoV-2 infection waves characterized by the circulation of new variants, multiple lineage importations and reinfections. Locally the virus may circulate unrecognized as most infections are asymptomatic in part due to high population immunity after several waves of infection. Our findings highlight the need for sustained SARS-CoV-2 surveillance to inform appropriate public health responses such as scheduled vaccination for risk populations.

Author summarySevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has transitioned to an endemic respiratory pathogen causing seasonal outbreaks. We examined the epidemiological and genomic patterns of a wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in coastal Kenya that occurred between November 2023 and March 2024. By analyzing genetic and epidemiological data from positive cases in Kilifi, we inferred the origins of the new strains, documented repeat infections and the virus ongoing evolution. Our data revealed several variants circulating in the community, indicating multiple new virus introductions probably before and during local outbreaks. Many infected individuals were asymptomatic, highlighting unnoticed transmission within the population. Despite low vaccination rates among the cases ([~]7.0%), high population immunity has previously been reported locally. The common symptoms among those who were symptomatic included cough, fever, and sore throat. A few participants experienced repeat infections during the wave, often involving closely related strains. The virus lineages detected were most closely related to those sampled in Europe. Our findings emphasize that, despite the end of the emergency phase, SARS-CoV-2 remains a significant public health issue, necessitating ongoing monitoring and responsive measures e.g. target vaccinations, masking and good hygiene practices to protect those at risk of severe infection.","NA","medrxiv",1743458968043

Cell migration is driven by the extension of actin-based lamellipodia protrusions, powered by actin polymerization, which is tightly regulated by signaling pathways, including Rho GTPases and Ca2+ signaling. While the importance of Ca2+ signaling in lamellipodia protrusions has been established, the molecular mechanisms linking Ca2+ to lamellipodia assembly are unknown. Here, we identify a novel Ca2+ signaling axis involving the mechano-gated channel TRPV4, which regulates lamellipodia protrusions in various cell types. Using Ca2+ and FRET imaging, we demonstrate that TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ influx upregulates RhoA activity within lamellipodia, which then facilitates formin-mediated actin assembly. Mechanistically, we identify CaMKII and TEM4 as key mediators relaying the TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ signal to RhoA. These data define a molecular pathway by which Ca2+ influx regulates small GTPase activity within a specific cellular domain - lamellipodia - and demonstrate the critical role in organizing the actin machinery and promoting cell migration in diverse biological contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has proven effective at biomonitoring aquatic systems but remains underexplored for terrestrial habitats, partly due to point-source sampling bias and difficulty in upscaling. Air has recently emerged as a promising substrate for terrestrial biomonitoring yet most studies use active samplers which tend to be expensive, bulky, and require power. We used a newly developed, inexpensive, reusable, and easy-to-use passive airborne eDNA sampler (DNAir Sampler) to capture eDNA suspended in air over 96 hours within Rotterdam Zoo, the Netherlands. Its performance was compared to two commonly used active airborne eDNA samplers for vertebrate diversity detection. In total, 88 species were detected, including 24 zoo residents. The DNAir Sampler was the most effective at detecting zoo residents, surpassing active samplers in species richness within 48 hours and continuing to accumulate new species beyond 96 hours. It also detected the furthest species signal (515m). Zoo airborne eDNA further demonstrated a positive correlation to species total biomass. Our findings indicate that for long, un-supervised biomonitoring, passive airborne eDNA sampling outperforms active sampling for assessing vertebrate communities and potentially reduces detection noise in stochastic air eDNA signals.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses.

In principle, these snapshots contain not only the main biomolecular conformations but also scarcely populated states and rare transitions between intermediates. This makes cryo-EM a powerful tool, not only for investigating the structure of biomolecules at high resolution but also for inferring the entire conformational ensemble distribution. Some recent works have reported conformational state populations by counting particle-images from cryo-EM. We wish to caution the community that these measurements are highly susceptible to noise and should not be relied upon as a precise estimate of the thermodynamic landscape of a biomolecule for understanding its biological function. Here, we demonstrate that the extremely noisy nature of cryo-EM images and uncertainty in the viewing orientations of biomolecules lead to ambiguities when assigning images to structures. If ignored, this ambiguity can introduce inherent bias when determining the populations of conformational states through individual particle assignment. We further show that modeling the conformational probability distribution using the entire image dataset mitigates these biases.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

As ZIKV spread into new geographic regions, it now has the potential to interact with many novel potential host species whose susceptibility to the virus has yet to be determined. Mathematical models predict a sylvatic reservoir host of ZIKV, with non-human primates (NHPs) as the likely candidates, though outbreaks in areas without NHPs suggest the presence of other unidentified sylvatic reservoir hosts. Bats, with their ability to fly and live in or near human structures, are plausible ZIKV reservoirs. However, their competence as hosts for ZIKV remains unresolved. In this study, we investigate the immune response of Old World and New World bats to ZIKV infection in vitro. Through comparative growth curves and transcriptomic analyses, we assess ZIKV susceptibility of cells derived from the Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) and the Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus). R. aegyptiacus cells were susceptible to both African and Asian ZIKV isolates, while we observed little to no ZIKV replication in A. jamaicensis cells. Notably, ZIKV elicited a strong anti-inflammatory response in the R. aegyptiacus cell line, in contrast to the dampened inflammatory response in these bats to other viruses including Marburg virus.

AUTHOR SUMMARYThis study investigates how different lineages of Zika virus (ZIKV) interact with bat cells, specifically examining the cellular inflammatory responses. We demonstrate that cells from Old World bats (R06E cells derived from an Egyptian rousette bat) are permissive to infection by both lineages, supporting viral replication. This permissiveness suggests these cells can support the virus lifecycle, potentially facilitating broader transmission. In contrast, cells from New World bats (Aji cells from Jamaican fruit bats) exhibit low susceptibility to ZIKV, with negligible viral replication observed, suggesting an inherent resistance or lack of necessary factors for ZIKV to effectively initiate its lifecycle in this cell culture model. Our findings highlight the critical role of specific host cell characteristics in ZIKV transmission and underscore the importance of cellular context in understanding the viruss capability to induce an inflammatory immune response. By exploring the interactions of ZIKV with different bat cells, our research provides insights into the ecological and epidemiological complexities of ZIKV and provides insights into the evolutionary history of this virus.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

Here, we systematically profile the localization of protein isoforms generated by alternate start codon selection during translation. We identify hundreds of pairs of differentially-localized protein isoforms, many of which affect mitochondrial targeting and are essential for mitochondrial function. The emergence of dual-localized mitochondrial protein isoforms coincides with mitochondrial acquisition during early eukaryotic evolution. We further reveal that eukaryotes use diverse mechanisms--such as leaky ribosome scanning, alternative transcription, and paralog duplication--to maintain the production of dual-localized isoforms. Finally, we identify multiple isoforms that are specifically dysregulated by rare disease patient mutations and demonstrate how these mutations can help explain unique clinical presentations. Together, our findings illuminate the evolutionary and pathological relevance of alternative translation initiation, offering new insights into the molecular underpinnings of mitochondrial biology.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

Most of these cell types are established early in embryogenesis and persist into adulthood. However, in indirectly developing sea urchins, the continuity between embryonic and adult stages is thus interrupted by a planktonic larval stage that undergoes complete metamorphosis. In addition, while the gene regulatory networks governing distinct embryonic and larval cell lineages are well studied, the molecular and morphological identities of post-metamorphic sea urchin cell types remain poorly understood. Here, we reconstructed the cell type atlas of post-metamorphic Paracentrotus lividus juveniles using single-nucleus transcriptomics, shedding light on the conservation of genetic regulatory mechanisms in post-metamorphic cell types. We identified cell signatures corresponding to eight distinct cell type groups and analyzed at least twenty-nine neuronal cell families, including fifteen unique photoreceptor cell signatures. By combining single cell transcriptomics with spatial gene expression analysis and high-resolution electron microscopy, we identified homologues of vertebrate neuronal genes and photoreceptive opsins expressed throughout the sea urchin body. These findings provide evidence that the echinoderm body plan is not only predominantly head-like, but also exhibits an ''all-brain'' organization in an animal previously considered to have a primitive nervous system.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

Objective To determine whether individuals hospitalized for severe COVID-19 exhibit a higher incidence of new onset cognitive impairment compared to those hospitalized for other conditions. Design A retrospective study emulating a target trial using Mass General Brigham electronic health records (March 2020-August 2024). The causal effect of COVID-19 hospitalization was estimated via cumulative incidence functions accounting for the competing risk of death. Setting Multicenter hospital-based study across the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. Participants A total of 221613 hospitalized patients met the eligibility criteria, including 6454 (2.0%) admitted due to COVID-19 and 215159 (98.0%) for all other conditions. Patients were excluded if they had less than three months of follow-up (due to censoring, cognitive impairment, or death), were younger than 55 years at baseline, or had no prior visit to Mass General Brigham in the year before baseline. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was new-onset cognitive impairment, identified via ICD codes and dementia medication prescriptions. The primary analysis estimated the hazard ratio for cognitive impairment with COVID-19 hospitalization relative to other hospitalizations, along with the risk difference at 4.5 years estimated via cumulative incidence functions. Inverse propensity score weighting was used to balance covariates (age, sex, comorbidities, hospitalization period). Results Among eligible patients (mean [SD] age, 69.55 [9.42] years, 55% female), those hospitalized for COVID-19 were significantly older and had more comorbidities (p < 0.05). COVID-19 hospitalization was associated with a higher risk of developing cognitive impairment (Hazard Ratio: 1.14 [95% CI: 1.02-1.30], P = 0.018). At 4.5 years, the cumulative incidence of cognitive impairment was 12.5% [95% CI: 11.3-13.5] in the COVID-19 group, compared to 11.6% [95% CI: 11.1-12.1] in the non-COVID-19 group. Conclusions and Relevance Severe COVID-19 infection was associated with an elevated risk of developing clinically recognized cognitive impairment. Future studies are needed to validate findings in other health care settings. Early screening and intervention for cognitive decline may help optimize long-term outcomes for COVID-19 patients.","NA","medrxiv",1743458968043

Here, we show that a specific isoform of RAB5 GTPases, the molecular switches controlling early endosome traffic, is necessary for LAP. We demonstrate that RAB5c regulates phagosome recruitment and function of complexes required for phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate [PI(3)P] and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by macrophages. RAB5c facilitates phagosome translocation of the V-ATPase transmembrane core, which is needed for ATG16L1 binding and consequent LC3 conjugation. RAB5c depletion impaired macrophage elimination of the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus and disruption of the V-ATPase-ATG16L1 axis increased susceptibility in vivo. Therefore, early endosome-to-phagosome traffic is differentially regulated to promote LAP and ROS contributes to resistance against A. fumigatus by effecting LAP.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

Here we use the sea star Patiria miniata as a non-chordate deuterostome representative to define the ovarian cell type toolkit in echinoderms. Sea stars continuously produce millions of new oocytes throughout their lifespan, making them a practical system to understand the mechanisms that drive oogenesis from a biomedical and evolutionary perspective. We performed scRNA-seq combined with high-resolution 3D-imaging to reveal the ovarian cell types and their spatial organization. Our data support the presence of actively dividing oogonial stem cells and granulosa-like and theca-like cells, which display similarities and possible homology with their mammalian counterparts. Lastly, our data support the existence of an endocrine signaling system between oogonial stem cells and intrinsic ovarian neurons with striking similarities to the vertebrate hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Overall, this study provides molecular evidence supporting the possible pre-chordate origins of conserved ovarian cell types, and the presence of an intrinsic neuroendocrine system which potentially controls oogenesis and predates the formation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

However, DR is implemented using different diets and methods across species, and evidence for conservation at the mechanistic level remains limited. Here we tested the longevity and fecundity response to DR across eight different species of Drosophila using the same diets in a reaction norm framework. We confirm that DR is phenotypically conserved across Drosophila. Next, we used comparative transcriptomics across six species and found strongly concordant differential expression in response to DR (rs > 0.28, < 0.72, P < 0.0001). We studied the evolutionary history of the top concordantly differentially expressed orthologous genes and identified that the large majority of these genes are young genes and are Diptera specific. Our results indicate that large parts of the DR response are likely to be taxonomic specific, suggesting that the genetic basis of DR is not widely conserved. To validate this hypothesis we tested whether the 15 most conserved genes that change in transcription in response to DR using conditional in vivo RNAi. Surprisingly, we found that 12 out of 15 genes tested had a lifespan phenotype, with 9 extending lifespan. Five of these genes are related to cysteine metabolism implicating it in the mechanisms of DR, further suggesting physiological compensation to DR is ubiquitous and providing a possible biomedical target. Our findings suggest that while large parts of the DR response are taxonomically specific, some core mechanisms are conserved across divergent species. The comparative approaches we used here hold promise to identify shared mechanisms relevant to our own species and therefore ultimately anti-ageing interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

However, cost and invasiveness preclude EGD in those who have no prior GERD symptoms, despite having other risk factors, representing missed opportunities for BE screening in individuals who account for approximately 40% of the patients who eventually develop esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

AimThe aim of this study was to evaluate if non-endoscopic methods can enable BE detection in an at-risk population without GERD symptoms.

MethodsPatients presenting for colonoscopy who had not undergone previous EGD plus had [&ge;]3 BE risk factors (from among age >50 years, male sex, white race, smoking history, family history of BE/EAC, or central obesity) without chronic GERD symptoms were prospectively recruited for non-endoscopic screening. Trained nurses administered the EsoCheck (Lucid Diagnostics) encapsulated balloon. Samples were assayed with the EsoGuard BE detection methylated DNA marker panel (Lucid Diagnostics). Patients with a positive result were offered standard-of-care EGD, while patients with a negative EG result were offered free of cost research EGD. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and BE prevalence were calculated.

ResultsThe mean age of the 132 study subjects was 60.7 years, 129 (98%) were white, 124 (94%) were male, 71 (54%) had a prior smoking history, 46 (35%) were centrally obese, and 5 (4%) reported a family history. EsoCheck was successfully administered in 124 (94%) and the EsoGuard methylated DNA marker panel could be assayed in 120 (97%) of the samples. Thirty-four assays were positive of which 27 underwent a follow-up EGD and BE was identified in 9, PPV = 33% [17%, 54%] subjects. EGD was also performed in 22 of the 86 subjects whose assays were negative and none of them had BE, NPV = 100% [85%, 100%]. A logistic regression model fitted to impute the presence of BE estimated the PPV as 27% [13%, 44%], NPV as 98% [92%, 100%], and BE prevalence as 8.4% [4.5%, 14.3%].

ConclusionPatients without chronic GERD who have [&ge;]3 BE risk factors have a moderately high prevalence of BE. Non-endoscopic detection can effectively identify BE, enabling expansion of screening to this larger at-risk population.

Tumor-associated macrophages and microglia (TAMs) drive immune suppression and tumor progression, making them a key therapeutic target for GBM. Enhancing TAM phagocytosis in GBM has shown promise, particularly with innate checkpoint inhibitors, such as CD47-blocking antibodies. However, small molecule approaches, which offer tunable and potentially synergistic mechanisms, remain underexplored in this context. In this study, we conducted the first large-scale chemical screen on primary TAMs from patients with GBM, identifying histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as potent inducers of phagocytosis. These compounds demonstrated phagocytosis-inducing effects across multiple GBM patient samples, with further amplification when combined with CD47 blockade. In a xenograft GBM model, HDAC inhibitors enhanced phagocytosis and suppressed tumor growth, with even greater efficacy in combination with CD47 antibodies. Our findings highlight HDAC inhibitors as promising agents to reprogram TAMs and synergize with immune checkpoint therapies, offering a novel strategy to bolster anti-tumor immunity in GBM.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

Although the mechanisms underlying the repair and autophagic elimination of damaged lysosomes have been elucidated, the early signal transduction pathways and genes induced in response to lysosomal damage remain elusive. We performed transcriptome and proteome analyses and found that the TAB-TAK1-IKK-NF-{kappa}B axis is activated by K63-linked ubiquitin chains that accumulate on damaged lysosomes. This activates the expression of various transcription factors and cytokines that promote anti-apoptosis and intercellular signaling. The findings highlight the crucial role of ubiquitin-regulated signal transduction and gene expression in cell survival and cell-cell communication in response to lysosomal damage. The results suggest that the ubiquitin system is not only involved in the removal of damaged lysosomes by lysophagy, but also functions in the activation of cellular signaling for cell survival.","NA","biorxiv",1743458968043

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1743458968043
