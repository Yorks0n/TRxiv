While scientific 3D rendering software is specifically designed for this purpose, it often lacks the flexibility found in non-scientific software like Blender, which is a free and open-source 3D graphics platform. However, loading microscopy data in Blender is not trivial. To bridge this gap, we introduce Microscopy Nodes, an extension for Blender that enables the seamless integration of large microscopy data. Microscopy Nodes provides efficient loading and visualization of up to 5D microscopy data from Tif and OME-Zarr files. Microscopy Nodes supports various visualization modes including volumetric, isosurface, and label-mask representations, and offers additional tools for slicing, annotation, and dynamic adjustments. By leveraging Blender's advanced rendering capabilities, users can create high-quality visualizations that accommodate both light and electron microscopy. Microscopy Nodes makes powerful, clear data visualization available to all researchers, regardless of their computational experience, and is available through the Blender extensions platform with comprehensive tutorials.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

This corresponds to picograms of purified protein, which can potentially be isolated from a few thousand cells. Hence, cryo-EM holds the potential of one of the most sensitive analytical methods that deliver a high-resolution protein structure as a readout. In practice, more than a million times more starting biological material is required to prepare cryo-EM grids. To close the gap, we developed a micro isolation (MISO) method that combines microfluidics-based protein purification with cryo-EM grid preparation. We validated the method on soluble bacterial and eukaryotic membrane proteins. We showed that MISO enables protein structure determination starting from below one microgram of a target protein and going from cells to cryo-EM grids within a few hours. This scales down the purification by a factor of a few hundred to a few thousand and opens possibilities for the structural characterization of hitherto inaccessible proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

While tissue patterning has been viewed as the transition from initially identical un-patterned cells to an arrangement of different cell types, recent evidence suggests that initial heterogeneities between cells modulate tissue-scale pattern formation. Yet, how such heterogeneities arise and, thereafter, regulate cell type emergence in a population of cells is poorly understood. Using in vivo and in vitro mouse regenerative systems, we identify a critical tissue density that is required to induce heterogeneous inactivation of the mechanosensor YAP1. Experimental and biophysical approaches demonstrate that YAP1 cell-to-cell heterogeneity pre-patterns the first cell fate decision, via both chromatin remodelling and a supracellular feedback between FOXA1 and Delta-Notch signalling. This feedback motif induces cell fate bistability endowing memory to the system and the maintenance of patterns during homeostasis. These findings reveal a generalisable framework in which transient cell-to-cell heterogeneity, regulated by tissue-scale properties, serves as a critical control parameter for the emergence of cell fate and stable patterning during regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

Processing bodies (P-bodies) are dynamic ribonucleoprotein condensates formed by phase separation in the cytosol. P-bodies are involved in translational arrest and mRNA decay and regulate several developmental processes and stress responses. Pathogens have evolved strategies to exploit host degradation pathways for their own benefit, however little is known about how they impact translation. Here we show that upon infection with pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato (Pst), P-body assembly is enhanced in an effector-dependent manner. Moreover, a P-body-defective mutant is more tolerant to bacterial infection due to altered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses, suggesting a role of P-bodies as novel susceptibility hubs. Pst infection is accompanied by a general host translation attenuation, which is both effector-dependent, and deregulated in the P-body-defective mutant. This indicates that P-bodies are required for the bacterial modulation of the plant translation, probably to hinder the defense responses. Additionally, host autophagy is also exploited by the bacteria to modulate P-body dynamics and its subsequent translation attenuation, revealing a complex interplay between P-body formation and disassembly during infection. Altogether, our discoveries provide novel insights on how host translation is targeted by bacteria via effector-triggered P-body formation to promote disease and uncover unknown connections between ER stress responses and autophagy with P-body dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

Whether super-enhancers constitute a separate regulatory paradigm remains unclear, largely due to the difficulty of dissecting the contributions and interactions of individual elements within their natural chromosomal context. To address this challenge, we developed enhancer scrambling, a high-throughput strategy to generate stochastic inversions and deletions of targeted enhancer regions by combining CRISPR prime editing insertion of symmetrical loxP sites with Cre recombinase-induced rearrangements. We applied our approach to dissect a distal super-enhancer of the OTX2 gene, generating up to 134 alternative regulatory configurations in a single experiment, and establishing how they drive gene expression and chromatin accessibility, as well as the individual contributions of its elements to this activity. Surprisingly, the presence of the sequence containing a single DNase I hypersensitive site predominantly controls OTX2 expression. Our findings highlight that enhancer-driven regulation of some highly expressed, cell-type-specific genes can rely on an individual element within a cluster of non-interacting, dispensable components, and suggest a simple functional core to a subset of super-enhancers. The targeted randomisation method to scramble enhancers can scale to resolve many super-enhancers and human gene regulatory landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

Although the organellar genomes are considerably smaller compared to the nuclear genome, they are nonetheless essential for survival of the organism. A common feature of many chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes is the presence of large repeated sequences longer than 1 kb. These can be either in inverted or direct orientation, and recombination between them leads to structural heteroplasmy. To understand the intraspecific evolution of organellar genomes, we assembled chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of 143 A. thaliana accessions from PacBio HiFi sequencing data. We find large repeats to be associated with heteroplasmy and structural variation. Our extensive genome annotation identifies novel open reading frames (ORFs) in those accessions that lost large repeats, potentially introduced via horizontal gene transfer, illuminating additional paths for diversification of plant organelles. The loss of large repeats correlates with geography and phenotypes, pointing to their adaptive importance. The assembled and annotated organellar genomes constitute a rich source for future functional studies of the interaction between the three genomes of a plant.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

There is substantial evidence that AMF support plant and crop growth in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Fine root endophytes (FRE) also co-occur in plant roots with AMF in all but tropical environments. However, their presence remains poorly recognized, and their lifestyle and functionality remain largely unknown. Our analysis demonstrates that, in contrast to AMF, FRE colonize plants during the winter season, when photosynthesis is more challenging. It is also noteworthy that FRE was unable to colonize the roots of spring-sown crops. The results of our laboratory pot experiments demonstrated that low temperatures are not sufficient for FRE colonization. Furthermore, we observed that FRE, in contrast to AMF, exhibited increased colonization in soils containing metabolically inactive plants. Our results suggest that FRE does not contribute to the increase of ecosystem biomass through direct photosynthesis in summer, but may play an overlooked role in the formation of mycorrhiza-based soil ecosystems in winter. However, this winter ecosystem can be disrupted by conventional bare fallow management of the field, interrupting the annual cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

Their genomes evolve from genetically diverse germlines in complex and dynamic environments, including exposure to potential carcinogens. This heterogeneity of humans, our environmental exposures, and subsequent tumours makes it challenging to understand the extent to which cancer evolution is predictable. Addressing this limitation, we re-ran early tumour evolution hundreds of times in diverse, inbred mouse strains, capturing genetic variation comparable to and beyond that found in human populations. The sex, environment, and carcinogenic exposures were all controlled and tumours comprehensively profiled with whole genome and transcriptome sequencing. Within a strain, there was a high degree of consistency in the mutational landscape, a limited range of driver mutations, and all strains converged on the acquisition of a MAPK activating mutation with similar transcriptional disruption of that pathway. Despite these similarities in the phenotypic state of tumours, different strains took markedly divergent paths to reach that state. This included pronounced biases in the precise driver mutations, the strain specific occurrence of whole genome duplication, and differences in subclonal selection that reflected both cancer susceptibility and tumour growth rate. These results show that interactions between the germline genome and the environment are highly deterministic for the trajectory of tumour genome evolution, and even modest genetic divergence can substantially alter selection pressures during cancer development, influencing both cancer risk and the biology of the tumour that develops.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

However, the mechanisms underlying ENS plasticity and resilience remain poorly understood. Organoid technology has revolutionized in vitro modeling by accurately replicating epithelial structures and enabling significant advancements in understanding gastrointestinal biology. However, traditional organoids are limited in their ability to study the ENS, as they lack the multicellular composition and functional architecture necessary to model complex interactions between neurons, glia, mesenchymal, smooth muscle, and epithelial cells. To address these limitations, we developed murine ENS-Rich Assembloids (ERAs) that self-organize to replicate the cellular diversity, including the epithelial structure, and functional architecture of native colonic tissue. These assembloids recreate neuron-glia interactions, reflect regenerative processes, and provide a novel platform for studying ENS dynamics under controlled conditions. Integrating findings from assembloids and an in vivo murine model, we demonstrate that inflammation induces coordinated reorganization of S100b+ glial cells, TUJ1+ neurons, PDGFRA+ mesenchymal cells, and epithelial cells, revealing conserved mechanisms of ENS plasticity. We identify pleiotrophin (PTN) signaling via Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type Z1 (PTPRZ1) as a key pathway facilitating neural elongation and enhancing neuron-glia interactions. Moreover, we show that activated neurons transfer lipids to glial cells, revealing a novel support mechanism during inflammation. These findings position enteric glia as protective hubs for neurons, fostering ENS adaptability and tissue regeneration. By building on the foundational success of organoid technology and addressing its limitations for studying the ENS, ENS-rich assembloids establish a transformative tool for investigating ENS responses in health, disease, and tissue repair.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

A subset of PCS patients develops severe myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (pcME/CFS).

As recently shown in autoimmune diseases, IgG fractions translate disease-specific pathways into various cells. Therefore, we asked whether IgG fractions from PCS patients could be applied in-vitro to identify specific cytokine responses for PCS patients without (nPCS) and with pcME/CSF. To assess this, we have stimulated monocyte cell lines with IgG fractions from PCS patients. Our findings reveal distinct cytokine responses induced by patient derived AABs which are suggested in vascular and immune dysfunction. In contrast to nPCS, pcME/CSF AABs induced enhanced neurotrophic responses, characterized by significant cytokine correlations involving brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 14 (LIGHT). Further, AAB-induced cytokine levels correlate with clinical symptoms. This study emphasizes a contribution of AABs in PCS, in mitigating long-term immune dysregulation, and a need for therapies modulating IgG-induced signaling pathways.","NA","medrxiv",1736978885076

In contrast, computerized tasks are used to test these cognitive functions in laboratory human and animal studies. Little is known of how neural activity captured by laboratory tasks relates to ability measured by clinical instruments and, by extension, clinical diagnoses of pathological conditions. We therefore sought to determine what aspects of neural activity elicited in laboratory tasks are predictive of performance in neuropsychological instruments. We recorded neural activity from intracranial electrodes implanted in human epilepsy patients as they performed laboratory working memory tasks. These patients had completed neuropsychological instruments preoperatively, including the Weschler Adult Intelligent Scale and the Wisconsin Card Sorting test. Our results revealed that increased high-gamma (70-150 Hz) power in the prefrontal and parietal cortex after presentation of visual stimuli to be remembered was indicative of lower performance in the neuropsychological tasks. On the other hand, we observed a positive correlation between high-frequency power amplitude in the delay period of the laboratory tasks and neuropsychological performance. Our results demonstrate how neural activity around task events relates to executive function and may be associated with clinical diagnosis of specific cognitive deficits.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

Here, we report cryo-EM structures of human 26S proteasome in a complex with a K11/K48-branched Ub chain. The structures revealed a multivalent substrate recognition mechanism involving a hitherto unknown K11-linked Ub binding site at the groove formed by RPN2 and RPN10 in addition to the canonical K48-linkage binding site formed by RPN10 and RPT4/5 coiled-coil. Additionally, RPN2 recognizes an alternating K11-K48 linkage through a conserved motif similar to the K48-specific T1 binding site of RPN1.

However, the ubiquity of this trend over geological timescales remains unclear. One reason for this uncertainty is that palaeobiologists need Global Plate Models (GPMs) to estimate the latitudinal position of organisms' remains at time of deposition. However, as GPMs constitute hypotheses for how tectonic plates have moved over Earth's history, reconstructions of the latitudinal biodiversity gradient (LBG) might also vary based on the GPM used. Here, using the fossil record of five major marine invertebrate groups, we evaluate the impact of GPM choice on reconstructions of the LBG over the Phanerozoic. Our results show that GPM choice can lead to different conclusions about the shape and strength of LBGs in deep time, even at a coarse spatial scale. These findings suggest additional caution is needed when reconstructing deep-time biogeographic patterns and macroevolutionary events, such as the origin of the present-day LBG. We therefore advocate for future palaeobiogeographic studies to conduct sensitivity analyses investigating the impact of GPM choice on their conclusions, and for greater interdisciplinary collaboration between palaeobiologists and palaeogeographic modellers to avoid common issues in the use of GPMs.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

Current dogma holds that bone fracture causes severe hypoxia at the fracture site, due to vascular rupture, and that this hypoxia must be overcome for regeneration. Here, we show that the early fracture site is not hypoxic, but instead exhibits high oxygen tension (> 55 mmHg, or 8%), similar to the red blood cell reservoir, the spleen. This elevated oxygen stems not from angiogenesis but from activated erythropoiesis in the adjacent bone marrow. Fracture-activated erythroid progenitor cells concentrate oxygen through haemoglobin formation. Blocking transferrin receptor 1 (CD71)-mediated iron uptake prevents oxygen binding by these cells, induces fracture site hypoxia, and enhances bone repair through increased angiogenesis and osteogenesis. These findings upend our current understanding of the early phase of bone fracture repair, provide a mechanism for high oxygen tension in the bone marrow after injury, and reveal an unexpected and targetable role of erythroid progenitors in fracture repair.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

The modern-day indigenous Arabians are believed to be the descendants who remained from the ancient split of the migrants into Eurasia. Here, we investigated how the population history and cultural practices such as endogamy have shaped the genetic variation of the Saudi Arabians. We genotyped 3,352 individuals and identified twelve genetic sub-clusters that corresponded to the geographical distribution of different tribal regions, differentiated by distinct components of ancestry based on comparisons to modern and ancient DNA references. These sub-clusters also showed variation across ranges of the genome covered in runs of homozygosity, as well as differences in population size changes over time. Using 25,488,981 variants found in whole genome sequencing data (WGS) from 302 individuals, we found that the Saudi tend to show proportionally more deleterious alleles than neutral alleles when compared to Africans/African Americans from gnomAD (e.g. a 13% increase of deleterious alleles annotated by AlphaMissense between 0.5 - 5% frequency in Saudi, compared to 7% decrease of the benign alleles; P < 0.001). Saudi sub-clusters with greater inbreeding and lower effective population sizes showed greater enrichment of deleterious alleles as well. Additionally, we found that approximately 10% of the variants discovered in our WGS data are not observed in gnomAD; these variants are also enriched with deleterious annotations. To accelerate studying the population-enriched deleterious alleles and their health consequences in this population, we made available the allele frequency estimates of 25,488,981 variants discovered in our samples. Taken together, our results suggest that Saudi's population history impacts its pattern of genetic variation with potential consequences to the population health. It further highlights the need to sequence diverse and unique populations so to provide a foundation on which to interpret medical- and pharmaco- genomic findings from these populations.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

A central strategy for genetic adaptation is epigenetic phase variation (ePV) mediated by bacterial DNA methylation, which can regulate gene expression, enhance clonal heterogeneity, and enable a single bacterial strain to exhibit variable phenotypic states. Genome-wide and site-specific ePV have been well characterized in human pathogens antigenic variation and virulence factor production. However, the role of ePV in facilitating adaptation within the human microbiome remains poorly understood. Here, we comprehensively cataloged genome-wide and site-specific ePV in human infant and adult gut microbiomes. First, using long-read metagenomic sequencing, we detected genome-wide ePV mediated by complex structural variations of DNA methyltransferases, highlighting the ones associated with antibiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation. Second, we analyzed an extensive collection of public short-read metagenomic sequencing datasets, uncovering a greater prevalence of genome-wide ePV in the human gut microbiome. Third, we quantitatively detected site-specific ePVs using single-molecule methylation analysis to identify dynamic variations associated with antibiotic treatment or probiotic engraftment. Finally, we performed an in-depth assessment of an Akkermansia muciniphila isolate from an infant, highlighting that ePV can regulate gene expression and enhance the bacterial adaptive capacity by employing a bet-hedging strategy to increase tolerance to differing antibiotics. Our findings indicate that epigenetic modifications are a common and broad strategy used by bacteria in the human gut to adapt to their environment.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

We identified two conserved mechanisms controlling cytoplasmic macromolecular diffusion: ribosome concentration, a known regulator of cytoplasmic crowding, works in concert with a previously unknown function for the giant KASH protein ANC-1 scaffolding the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings reveal mechanisms by which tissues establish and maintain distinct cytoplasmic biophysical properties, with implications for understanding cellular organization across species.

The virus distinguishes itself by the ability to replicate to high titers and transmit efficiently in a wide variety of hosts in diverse climatic environments. Fortunately, transmission to and between humans is scarce. Yet, if such an event were to occur, it could spark a pandemic as humans are immunologically naive to H5 viruses. A significant determinant of transmission to and between humans is the ability of the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein to shift from an avian-type to a human-type receptor specificity. Here, we demonstrate that a 2016 2.3.4.4e virus HA can convert to human-type receptor binding via a single Q226L mutation, in contrast to a cleavage-modified 2016 2.3.4.4b virus HA.

While inversions have been found across a large number of taxa, mapping and characterizing inversion breakpoint regions remains challenging, often due to the presence of complex tandem repeats and transposable elements (TEs). Here, we identify and quantify TEs in the breakpoints of the four large-scale inversions previously reported in Atlantic cod, leveraging on three high-quality long-read-based reference genome assemblies for the Norwegian Coastal cod, the Northeast Arctic cod and Celtic cod ecotypes. We detected a significant enrichment of TE orders and superfamilies with terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) within the inversion breakpoints of chromosomes 1, 7 and 12. Notably, we discovered a tandem accumulation of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) belonging to a family of hAT transposons, exclusively residing in the breakpoints of the inverted haplotype on chromosomes 1 and 7 found in the Northeast Arctic cod. The accumulation of tandemly arranged TEs in breakpoint regions suggests that they have driven the appearance of inversions through ectopic recombination, further supporting the potential of TEs in facilitating chromosomal reorganizations with large evolutionary implications.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

Allele frequency clines along environmental gradients, known as genotype-environment associations (GEA), are often used to detect potential loci causing local adaptation, but GEA are rarely followed by experimental validation. Here, we tested loci identified in three different moisture-related GEA studies on Arabidopsis. We studied 44 GEA-identified genes using t-DNA knockout lines under drought and tested for effects on flowering time, an adaptive trait, and genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions on performance and fitness. We found that wrky38 mutants had significant GxE effects for fitness; lsd1 plants had a significant GxE effect for flowering time, while 11 genes showed flowering time effects with no drought interaction. However, most GEA candidates did not exhibit GxE. In the follow-up experiments we found wrky38 caused decreased stomatal conductance and specific leaf area under drought, indicating potentially adaptive drought avoidance. Additionally, we found that GEA identified natural putative LoF variants of WRKY38 associated with dry environments, as well as alleles associated with variation in LSD1 expression. While only a few GEA putative drought-adapted genes were validated for GxE interactions for fitness under drought, we likely overlooked some genes because experiments might not well represent natural environments and t-DNA insertions might not well represent natural alleles. Nevertheless, GEAs apparently identified some genes contributing to local adaptation. GEA and follow-up experiments are straightforward to implement in model systems and thus demonstrate prospects for GEA discovery of new local adaptations.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

However, dynamic monitoring of extracellular redox processes in vivo remains difficult. Using two evolutionary distant land plant model species, the moss Physcomitrium patens and the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we test whether the genetically encoded redox biosensor roGFP-Orp1 can be used to assess extracellular redox dynamics.

Observed re-oxidation rates were surprisingly slow within the range of hours.

Phylogenetic distance between 6X (hexaploid) and 2X (diploid) genotypes revealed that a small repertoire of I. batatas CNLs diverged from the sweetpotato wild relatives. Finally, we obtained chromosome coordinates in hexaploid (Beauregard) and diploid (Ipomoea trifida) genomes and recorded clustering of NLRs on chromosomes arms. Our study provides a catalog of NLR genes that can be used to accelerate breeding and increase our understanding of evolutionary dynamics of sweetpotato NLRs.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

Fluorescence sensors currently used to monitor such signals in vivo are typically optimized to detect fast, relative changes in concentration of the target molecule. They are less well suited to detect slowly-changing signals and rarely provide absolute measurements of either fast and slow signaling components. Here, we developed a system for fluorescence lifetime photometry at high temporal resolution (FLIPR) that utilizes frequency-domain analog processing to measure the absolute fluorescence lifetime of genetically-encoded sensors at high speed but with long-term stability and picosecond precision in freely moving mice. We applied FLIPR to investigate dopamine signaling in two functionally distinct regions in the striatum, the nucleus accumbens core (NAC) and the tail of striatum (TOS). We observed higher tonic dopamine levels at baseline in the TOS compared to the NAC and detected differential and dynamic responses in phasic and tonic dopamine to appetitive and aversive stimuli. Thus, FLIPR enables simple monitoring of fast and slow time-scale neuronal signaling in absolute units, revealing previously unappreciated spatial and temporal variation even in well-studied signaling systems.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

While Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) quantifies cellular tractions exerted on deformable substrates, Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based tension probes, such as Vinculin Tension Sensors (VinTS), measure molecular-scale forces within FA proteins. Despite their potential synergy, these methods have rarely been combined to explore the interplay between molecular tension and cellular tractions. Here, we introduce a framework integrating TFM and VinTS to investigate FA mechanics across scales. At cell level, tractions and vinculin tension increased with substrate stiffness. At FA level, vinculin tension correlated with vinculin density, while tractions scaled with FA area, total vinculin content and vinculin density. Direct comparison of tractions to tension revealed a complex, heterogenous relationship between these forces, possibly linked to diverse cell and FA maturation states. Sub-FA analysis revealed conserved spatial patterns, with tension and traction increasing towards the cell periphery. This multiscale approach provides insights into the multiscale dynamics of FA mechanotransduction, bridging the gap between molecular forces and cellular mechanics.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

While functional analysis has been instrumental in characterizing TUS effects, understanding the underlying mechanisms remains a challenge. Here, we developed a whole-brain model to represent functional changes as measured by fMRI, enabling us to investigate how TUS-induced effects propagate throughout the brain with increasing stimulus intensity. We implemented two mechanisms: one based on anatomical distance and another on broadcasting dynamics, to explore plasticity-driven changes in specific brain regions. Finally, we highlighted the role of higher-order functional interactions in localizing spatial effects of off-line TUS at two target areas--the right thalamus and inferior frontal cortex--revealing distinct patterns of functional reorganization. This work lays the foundation for mechanistic insights and predictive models of TUS, advancing its potential clinical applications.

Significance StatementTranscranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) offers a non-invasive approach to modulating brain activity, holding promise for treating psychiatric and neurological disorders. Despite its potential, the mechanisms underlying its effects remain poorly understood. By integrating human fMRI data with whole-brain computational models, we identified how high-order functional interactions localize and propagate TUS-induced effects from local to global brain scales. This work introduces two mechanisms--distance-based propagation and diffusion-like broadcasting--that predict functional plasticity changes, providing a foundation for understanding and optimizing the biological and cognitive outcomes of TUS.

We investigated mechanisms of circuit remodeling underlying these restorative effects by leveraging the sensitivity of hippocampal neurogenesis to activity in middle-aged wild-type mice. AuViS increased progenitor cell proliferation, neuronal differentiation and morphological maturation of newborn granule cells, promoting their synaptic integration. While visual or auditory stimuli alone induced dendritic growth, axonal changes required combined audiovisual stimulation.

A novel ipcs2W205* mutant was recovered from a forward genetic screen for Arabidopsis plants with enhanced epidermal cell entry success of the non-adapted barley fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh). A yeast complementation assay and a sphingolipidomic approach revealed that the ipcs2W205* mutant represents a knock-out and lacks IPCS2-specific enzymatic activity. Further mutant analyses suggested that IPCS2-derived glycosyl inositol phosphorylceramides (GIPCs) are required for cell entry control of non-adapted fungal intruders. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) studies indicated that upon pathogen attack, IPCS2 remains at the TGN to produce GIPCs, while focal accumulation of the defense cargo PENETRATION 3 (PEN3) at Bgh penetration sites was reduced in the ipcs2W205* mutant background. Thus, we propose a model in which sorting events at the TGN are facilitated by complex sphingolipids, regulating polar secretion of PEN3 to host-pathogen contact sites to terminate fungal ingress.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

Such goal-directed behaviour - or model-based (MB) reinforcement learning (RL) - can flexibly adapt choice to changes, being thus distinct from simpler habitual - or model-free (MF) RL - strategies. Previous inactivation and neuroimaging work implicates prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the caudate striatal region in MB-RL; however, details are scarce about its implementation at the single-neuron level. Here, we recorded from two PFC regions - the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), and two striatal regions, caudate and putamen - while two rhesus macaques performed a sequential decision-making (two-step) task in which MB-RL involves knowledge about the statistics of reward and state transitions. All four regions, but particularly the ACC, encoded the rewards received and tracked the probabilistic state transitions that occurred. However, ACC (and to a lesser extent caudate) encoded the key variables of the task - namely the interaction between reward, transition and choice - which underlies MB decision-making. ACC and caudate neurons also encoded MB-derived estimates of choice values. Moreover, caudate value estimates of the choice options flipped when a rare transition occurred, demonstrating value update based on structural knowledge of the task. The striatal regions were unique (relative to PFC) in encoding the current and previous rewards with opposing polarities, reminiscent of dopaminergic neurons, and indicative of a MF prediction error. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of selective and temporally dissociable neural mechanisms underlying goal-directed behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

Pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for AI remains largely unknown, but increasing evidence suggest that genetic susceptibility plays a predominant role. We recently identified a rare nonsense variant in ANGPTL6 gene that prevented angiopoietin-like 6 (ANGPTL6) secretion and predisposed to IA. The aim of this study is now to understand why the ANGPTL6 variant predisposes to IA. Methods: Angptl6-knock in mice were generated by homologous recombination. Cerebral arteries of the circle of Willis have been analyzed under basal and hemodynamic overload conditions. Functional properties of cerebral arteries have been analyzed by pressure arteriography. Effect of recombinant ANGPTL6 have been assessed on vascular smooth muscle cells and ANGPTL6 partners have been analyzed by surface plasmon resonance. Results: Angptl6- knock in mice display endothelial dysfunction expressed by reduced NO production in response to flow in cerebral arteries. They present exaggerated dilatation of cerebral arteries under hypertensive stress, and aggravated wall damage and aneurysmal remodeling of the intima and media at arterial bifurcations of the circle of Willis under hemodynamic overload. Matrix bound ANGPTL6 decreased VSMC migration and increased adhesion and FAK signaling activation, without affecting VSMC phenotype. Surface plasmon resonance analyses identified v{beta}5 integrin as a new ANPTL6 receptor. Conclusions: Angptl6-knock in mice mimicked the main features of IA in humans. ANGPTL6 appears to be an extracellular matrix component regulating vascular cell function, which may be involved in mechanosensing and generating adapted vascular cell responses to hemodynamic stress. Non-secreted ANGPTL6 variants would result in the loss of this function, thus favoring IA under conditions of hemodynamic overload.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

They are derived from embryonic as well as hematopoietic progenitors. However, the functional impact of their diverse origin and the control networks defining different subsets remain unclear. Here, using multidimensional analysis of dermal macs, we reveal that the absence of circulating monocytes in interferon regulatory factor 8 (Irf8) deficient mice delays mac renewal during the steady state. Yet, the functional mosaic of dermal macs remains largely intact, i.e., major dermal mac subsets develop independently of monocyte replenishment. Thus, the tissue microenvironment is sufficient to induce alternative differentiation pathways and functional specialization of resident cells. Mycobacterial skin infection induces a steep increase in mac density due to monocyte-derived macs which execute urgent antibacterial functions and differentiate into site-adapted mac subsets in wildtype but not Irf8-/-mice, while long-term resident macs are required to initiate a tissue repair program already in early stages of infection.

In summary, we introduce a model, where an intricate network of specialized mac subsets develops to meet microanatomical needs and external cellular input is required only during immunological emergency situations.

Exchanges are formed via tightly-regulated repair of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). However, since repair intermediates are mostly quantified in fixed images, our understanding of the mechanisms that control the progression of repair remains limited. Here, we study meiotic repair kinetics in Caenorhabditis elegans by extinguishing new DSBs and following the disappearance of a crucial intermediate - strand invasion mediated by the conserved RecA-family recombinase RAD-51. We find that RAD-51 foci have a half-life of 42-132 minutes for both endogenous and exogenous DSBs. Surprisingly, we find that repair templated by the sister chromatid is not slower than repair templated by the homolog. This suggests that differential kinetics are unlikely to underlie homolog bias: the preferential use of the homolog as a repair template. We also use our kinetic information to revisit the total number of DSBs per nucleus - the  substrate for the formation of exchanges - and find an average of 40 DSBs in wild-type meiosis and >50 DSBs when homolog pairing is perturbed. Our work opens the door for analysis of the interplay between meiotic repair kinetics and the fidelity of genome inheritance.

Male-killing is a convergently evolved trait, with microbes evolving diverse male-killing mechanisms across host species with widely divergent sex determination pathways. A common evolutionary response to MK presence is the spread of suppressor mutations that restore male survival. In this study, we demonstrate evolution of a novel male-killing mechanism that is insensitive to an existing male-killing suppressor. Hypolimnas bolina butterflies from Yogyakarta, Indonesia, showed extreme female biased population sex ratio associated with high prevalence of a male-killing Wolbachia. This strain, wBol1Y, shared a very recent common ancestor with the previously characterized suppressed male-killing strain in the species, wBol1, but retained its male-killing ability in the presence of the male-killing suppressor. The genome of wBol1Y differed from the suppressed wBol1 in carrying an additional prophage that included strong candidate genes for male-killing. In vitro and in vivo data demonstrated that wBol1Y feminized splicing and expression of lepidopteran sex determination pathway genes, and that the gene Hb-oscar - present on wBol1Y's unique prophage insert - was sufficient to disrupt the male sex determination pathway. Our study demonstrates the diversity of male-killing mechanisms is a product both of interaction with varying insect sex determination systems and evolution of male-killing within a host species. Our data indicate male-killer and host may be involved in escalating arms races, where spread male-killing suppression drives evolution of additional systems that reestablish male killing by the symbiont.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

Previous studies have used the assumption that the linear momentum of the body center of mass (CoM) is controlled to analyze how gait is stabilized. In these studies, the position of the center of pressure (CoP) or of the foot relative to the COM is often used as an indicator of corrections of the CoM state. Mechanically, neither of these variables is directly related to changes in linear momentum, whereas they do directly affect whole-body angular momentum (WBAM), which has also been suggested to be a controlled variable. We show that, in human walking, linear and angular momentum follow quasi-periodic functions with similar periodicity and phase. Combining the equations of linear and rotational motion for a system of linked rigid segments shows that, in this case, the horizontal distance between CoP and CoM is a good predictor of horizontal forces in the corresponding direction. This suggests that linear and angular momentum are simultaneously controlled to follow similar quasi-periodic functions and may explain the success of preceding studies that correlated CoM states to CoP or foot locations. We developed feedback models to predict the ground reaction force and its moments along the sagittal and transverse axes from the preceding CoM state and WBAM respectively. These models were fitted to experimental data of participants walking at normal and slow speeds. The consistent, good fit of both models supports that linear and angular momentum are controlled simultaneously in human walking.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

Simultaneous detection of chromatin accessibility and histone modifications in spinal cord nuclei reveals previously unobserved cell-type specific cryptic enhancer activity, in which transcriptional activation is uncoupled from chromatin accessibility. Such cryptic enhancers define both stable cell type identity and transitions between cells undergoing differentiation. We also define glial cell gene regulatory networks that reorganize along the rostrocaudal axis, revealing anatomical differences in gene regulation. Finally, we identify the spatial organization of cells into distinct cellular organizations and address the functional significance of this observation in the context of paracrine signaling. We conclude that cellular diversity is best captured through the lens of enhancer state and intercellular interactions that drive transitions in cellular state.

Here, by determining the structure of human BASIC in the presence and absence of Ca2+ using single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we reveal Ca2+-dependent conformational changes in the transmembrane domain and {beta}-linkers. Electrophysiological experiments further show that a glutamate residue in the extracellular vestibule of the pore underpins the Ca2+-binding site, whose occupancy determines the conformation of the pore and therefore ion flow through the channel. These results reveal the molecular principles governing gating of BASIC and its regulation by Ca2+ ions, demonstrating that Ca2+ ions modulate BASIC function via changes in protein conformation rather than solely from pore-block, as proposed for other members of this superfamily.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

White-striped petals were thought to be due to epigenetics, but the genes involved are unknown. We confirmed that white stripes result from epigenetic regulation based on the flower color traits of plants obtained from tissue culture. Gene expression in several plant lines, anthocyanin quantification, bisulfite sequencing, and methylation analyses were used to demonstrate the presence of a single MYB gene responsible for pigment variation. We identified SiMYB2 as the cause of variations in tissue color patterning, and that two RNAs were generated from SiMYB2. SiMYB2-Long was expressed in colored tissues, while SiMYB2-Short was expressed only in non-colored tissues. Functional analyses revealed that SiMYB2-Long is an anthocyanin biosynthesis activator and SiMYB2-Short is non-functional. Exon 3 of SiMYB2 was generated by the insertion of a transposon-like sequence. A mutant lacking the element was obtained from cultivars with non-colored tissues. Anthocyanin content and SiMYB2-Long expression in the mutant were greatly increased compared to wild type.

In this study, we deciphered FaRIF's transcriptional regulatory network by combining ChIP-seq-based identification of its direct targets with an analysis of FaRIF-RNAi transcriptome data.

The lack of data on disease burden poses a significant barrier to adopting effective interventions such as vaccination. We developed a novel colorimetric assay for the detection of S. Typhi-specific bacteriophages in environmental water samples, providing an indirect indicator of S. Typhi contamination and insights into typhoid burden. We collected water samples from Brazil, Cote d'Ivoire, Nepal, and Niger, covering urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. We evaluated the colorimetric assay efficiency against agar overlay assay. Isolated phages were tested against various bacteria to assess host range. The colorimetric assay demonstrated high sensitivity (100% concordance with double agar overlay) with a detection limit of 28 PFU/mL, and results were obtained in 5.5 hours. Phage detection rates were highest in densely populated areas with poor sanitation, particularly in Nepal (96.6%) and Cote dIvoire (35.1%). The detection of S. Typhi phages in Cote dIvoire is particularly important, as the burden of typhoid in the region was previously undocumented. Host range analyses demonstrated that the isolated phages were specific to S. Typhi, with a small minority of phages isolated also capable of infecting S. Paratyphi A. The novel colorimetric assay offers a rapid and sensitive method for detecting S. Typhi bacteriophages in environmental water. The scalability, low cost (~$2.40 USD per sample), and minimal equipment requirements, suggest that this could be effective tool for typhoid surveillance in resource-limited settings.","NA","medrxiv",1736978885076

This identified key transcriptional and chromatin dynamics driving regionalization, neurogenesis, and differentiation. This identified multiple distinct neural progenitor populations, as well as gene regulatory networks that control their spatial and temporal identities, and their terminal differentiation into major neuronal subtypes. Integrating these results with large-scale genome-wide association study data, we identified a central role for transcription factors controlling supramammillary hypothalamic development in a broad range of metabolic and cognitive traits. Recurring cross-repressive regulatory relationships were observed between transcription factors that induced prethalamic and tuberal hypothalamic identity on the one hand and mammillary and supramammillary hypothalamic identity on the other. In postnatal animals, Dlx1/2 was found to severely disrupt GABAergic neuron specification in both the hypothalamus and prethalamus, resulting in a loss of inhibition of thalamic neurons, hypersensitivity to cold, and behavioral hyperactivity.

While the literature suggests that these pathways cooperate to build the primitive streak, their individual contributions remain poorly understood, largely due to pleiotropic effects observed when key pathway components are knocked out in mouse embryos. In this study, we used gastruloids - a non-integrated stem cell model of mammalian gastrulation - to dissect the roles of Wnt and Nodal signalling. We found that Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling drives a genetic program characteristic of the late primitive streak, promoting the development of posterior body structures in a time and dose-dependent manner. Conversely, Nodal signalling activates a distinct developmental module resembling the early primitive streak. By engineering gastruloids with elevated Nodal signalling, we demonstrate that the decreasing temporal gradient of Nodal activity in the mouse primitive streak likely plays a pivotal role in establishing the anterior body plan, with higher Nodal levels producing more anterior structures in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that rather than cooperating, Nodal and Wnt signalling act antagonistically, initiating distinct developmental modules within the primitive streak. This antagonism is likely the core mechanism driving the early body plan in mammals. Additionally, our results also lead to the suggestion that the gastruloid system models the primitive streak and reveals its self-organizing potential.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

Effective inhibition of target pathogenicity with blocking approaches, however, is often challenged by target parameters that lead to insufficient occupancy and/or incomplete pharmacology limited by only single site binding. Extracellular targeted protein degradation approaches, such as lysosomal targeting chimeras (LYTACs), offer an opportunity to minimize these challenges by an event-driven mechanism that selectively, thoroughly and irreversibly eliminates drivers of disease. First generation LYTACs, designed to traffic to the lysosome, show limited durability since the therapeutic is degraded along with the target protein of interest. Here we describe cataLYTACs, which overcome this limitation by combining stabilized asialoglycoprotein (ASGPR) ligands, pH-sensitive target binding and recycling via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). These cataLYTACs degraded superstoichiometric levels of a target protein, IgE, in vitro and demonstrated deep and sustained clearance of human IgE in mouse models. In non-human primates, cataLYTACs resulted in >98% clearance of circulating endogenous IgE for 2 weeks and outperformed the standard of care blocking antibody, omalizumab (Xolair), in both free IgE elimination and duration of action. CataLYTACs represent a new therapeutic modality for a wide range of disease states driven by circulating factors, with the potential for superior efficacy and duration of action compared to traditional inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

Yet, mechanical stress can also contribute to the evolution of some pathologies, notably by accelerating pretumoural cell expansion through the process of mechanical cell competition2-5. Mechanical cell competition is a conserved process in which one cell population is preferentially eliminated when mixed with another cell population due to its higher sensitivity to mechanical stress2,3,5-8. Most of the recent theoretical and experimental explorations of mechanical cell competition focused so far on the contribution of growth and pressure to cell elimination and were limited to few genetic contexts, including the activation of Ras in vivo2,8, and the mutation of the polarity gene scribble in mammalian cell culture3,4,9. However, it remains unclear whether other oncogenes can trigger similar mechanisms and whether growth is generally the only central regulator of cell compaction and cell elimination. Using the Drosophila pupal notum (a single layer epithelium), quantitative live imaging and vertex modelling, we revisited the mechanisms contributing to cell compaction and cell elimination during mechanical cell competition. Doing so, we outlined the co-existence of two modes of wild type (WT) cell compaction near oncogenic cells, namely the compaction driven by growth versus local compaction driven by increased tension at tumoural/WT cell interfaces in zones of high curvature (similar to ""Laplace pressure""). We highlighted distinctive signatures in cell deformation and cell elimination distribution that can delineate these two modes of compaction, and we recapitulated them in silico and in vivo using genetic backgrounds affecting growth and/or interfacial tension independently.

Multisensory integration, the non-linear combination of information from multiple senses to reduce environmental uncertainty, may be influenced by respiratory dynamics. This study investigated how respiration modulates reaction times and multisensory integration in a simple detection task. Forty healthy participants were presented with unimodal (Auditory, Visual, Tactile) and bimodal (Audio-Tactile, Audio-Visual, Visuo-Tactile) stimuli while their respiratory activity was recorded. Results revealed that reaction times systematically varied with respiration, with faster responses during peak inspiration and early expiration but slower responses during the expiration-to-inspiration transition. Applying the race model inequality approach to quantify multisensory integration, we found that Audio-Tactile and Audio-Visual stimuli exhibited the highest integration during the expiration-to-inspiration phase. These findings conceivably reflect respiration phase-locked changes in cortical excitability which in turn, orchestrates multisensory integration. Interestingly, participants also tended to adapt their respiratory cycles, aligning response onsets preferentially with early expiration. This suggests that, rather than a mere bottom-up mechanism, respiration is actively adjusted to maximise the signal-to-noise balance between interoceptive and exteroceptive signals.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885076

Each omic level is highly reproducible between biological replicates and between accessions despite their 0.5% sequence divergence; the single best predictor of any level in one accession is the corresponding level in the other. Within each accession, gene codon frequencies accurately model both mRNA and protein expression. The effects of a codon on mRNA and protein expression are highly correlated but are unrelated to genome-wide codon frequencies or to tRNA levels which instead match genome-wide amino acid frequencies. Ribosome-associated transcripts closely track mRNA levels.

ConclusionsIn the absence of environmental perturbation, neither methylation, tRNA nor ribosome-associated transcript levels add appreciable information about constitutive protein abundance beyond that in DNA codon frequencies and mRNA expression levels. The impact of constitutive gbM is mostly explained by gene codon composition. tRNA abundance tracks overall amino acid demand. However, genetic differences between accessions associate with differential gbM by inflating differential expression variation. Our data show that the Central Dogma holds only if both sequence and abundance information in mRNA are considered.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885077

Epithelial tissues contact the external environment and are exposed to various stresses that are potentially deleterious for the epithelial barrier1. However, how focal epithelial barrier defects are detected and repaired to maintain epithelial barrier homeostasis remains poorly understood. We co-cultured ZO-1/ZO-2 double-knockout (DKO) MDCK II cells, which lack tight junctions, with wild-type MDCK II cells, to understand how epithelial cells respond to focal epithelial barrier defects. When co-cultured with wild-type cells, ZO-1/ZO-2 DKO cells were selectively eliminated by induction of apoptosis. The elimination depended on a purse-string-like contraction of supracellular actomyosin cables formed at the clone boundary, regulated by ROCK. Furthermore, Hippo signaling and adherens junctions in the surrounding wild-type cells were required to eliminate ZO-1/ZO-2 DKO cells. These results demonstrate that selective elimination of ZO-1/ZO-2-deficient cells by cell competition regulates epithelial barrier homeostasis.

In briefOtani et al. reveal that epithelial barrier homeostasis is regulated by cell competition-mediated elimination of ZO-1/ZO-2-deficient cells. Supracellular actomyosin cables form at the clone boundary and constrict in a purse-string-like manner to eliminate the  loser cells. Mechanosensing in the winning cells is required to eliminate the  loser cells.

By integrating taxonomic, genomic and predicted functional annotations, we uncover how Bifidobacterium adapts to host-specific environments, shaped by vertical transmission, dietary influences, and host phylogeny. Our findings reveal that host phylogeny is a major determinant of gut microbiota composition. Distinct microbial networks in mammalian and avian hosts reflect evolutionary adaptations to dietary niches, such as carnivory, and ecological pressures. At a strain-resolved level, we identify strong co-phylogenetic associations between Bifidobacterium strains and their hosts, driven by vertical transmission and dietary selection, underscoring the intricate co-evolutionary dynamics between these microbes and their hosts. Functional analyses highlight striking host-specific metabolic adaptations in Bifidobacterium, particularly in carbohydrate metabolism and oxidative stress responses. In mammals, we observe an enrichment of glycoside hydrolases (GH) tailored to complex carbohydrate-rich diets, including multi-domain GH13_28 -amylases featuring diverse carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM25, CBM26, and the novel CBM74). These adaptations emphasise the ecological flexibility of Bifidobacterium in breaking down -linked glucose polysaccharides, such as resistant starch. Together, our study provides new insights into the evolutionary trajectories and ecological plasticity of Bifidobacterium, revealing how host phylogeny and dietary ecology drive microbial diversity and function. These findings deepen our understanding of host-microbe co-evolution and the critical role of microbiota in shaping animal health and adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885077

Here, we conducted a comprehensive three-year longitudinal study examining T cell and antibody responses in 78 vaccinated individuals without reported symptomatic infections. We observed distinct dynamics in Spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across multiple vaccine doses. While antibody titers incrementally increased and stabilized with each booster, T cell responses rapidly plateaued, maintaining remarkable stability across CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Notably, approximately 30% of participants showed CD4+ T cell reactivity to non-Spike antigens, consistent with asymptomatic infections. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a diverse landscape of Spike-specific T cell phenotypes, with no evidence of increased exhaustion or significant functional impairment. However, qualitative changes were observed in individuals with evidence of asymptomatic infection, exhibiting unique immunological characteristics, including increased frequencies of Th17-like CD4+ T cells and GZMKhi/IFNR CD8+ T cell subsets. Remarkably, repeated vaccinations in this group were associated with a progressive increase in regulatory T cells, potentially indicating a balanced immune response that may mitigate immunopathology. By regularly stimulating T cell memory, boosters contribute to a stable and enhanced immune response, which may provide better protection against symptomatic infections.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885077

Marine microbes interact by exchanging metabolites, thus shaping marine microbial ecology, DOM composition, and global carbon cycling. To better constrain one set of microbe-metabolite interactions, we cultured the marine gammaproteobacterium Alteromonas macleodii MIT1002 on a range of compounds excreted by a sympatric cyanobacterium, Prochlorococcus. Alteromonas could assimilate the branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, as well as 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid (a branched chain ketoacid intermediate of valine metabolism), but not thymidine, kynurenine, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, or the other branched chain ketoacids. The assimilation of branched chain amino acids indicates that Alteromonas can metabolically process each corresponding ketoacid, suggesting that transporter specificity underlies the observed substrate specificity for 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid. These experiments show that even subtle changes in chemical structure can result in different microbial interactions and different fates for dissolved metabolites.

Significance StatementMicrobial interactions with dissolved organic matter are important controls on the marine carbon cycle. Dissolved organic matter is often considered in bulk, which leaves the specificity and nature of these interactions poorly constrained. Here we show that microbe-molecule interactions can be highly specific, distinguishing between molecules that are structurally and biochemically similar. This implies that small changes in this pool of carbon could have large impacts for the overall system function, and that measuring this pool of carbon with molecular-level resolution is important to characterizing microbe-molecule interactions. We further explore the mechanism underlying the observed substrate specificity and suggest that it is caused by transporter selectivity, meaning the ability of these microbes to selectively uptake specific dissolved organic molecules.","NA","biorxiv",1736978885077

However, toxicity of its substrate hydrogen peroxide and background labeling by endogenous peroxidases limit its use to in vitro studies of specific cell types. By combining APEX2 with a D-amino acid oxidase to locally produce hydrogen peroxide, we establish a more versatile, improved APEX (iAPEX) workflow that minimizes hydrogen peroxide toxicity and reduces non-specific background labeling. We employ iAPEX to perform live-cell proteomics of a cellular microdomain, the primary cilium, in previously inaccessible cell lines, leading to the identification of new ciliary proteins.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US and it is important to monitor changes in pain during and after the pandemic.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential contributing factors.

MethodsWe analyze a nationally representative sample of 88,469 community-dwelling Americans aged 18 and older from three cross-sectional waves of the National Health Interview Survey before (2019), during (2021), and after (2023) the COVID-19 pandemic.

Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; fully controlled models include 19 additional covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of long COVID. Outcomes are CP and HICP using measures proposed by the US National Pain Strategy; we also present findings for six site-specific pain measures.

ResultsBetween 2019 and 2023, CP and HICP prevalence increased by 18% and 13%, respectively. Specifically, CP prevalence was 20.6% (95%CI: 19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9%(20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP prevalence declined from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019 to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021, before rising sharply to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023. The increases occurred in all examined body sites except for tooth/jaw pain, and in all major population groups. Approximately 13% of the increase in CP and HICP was attributable to long COVID.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before and during the pandemic but has surged substantially since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1736978885077

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1736978885077

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1736978885077
