In previous studies, we found enhanced IgG reactivity to EBV EBNA4 and EBNA6 arginine-rich sequences in postinfectious ME/CFS (piME/CFS).

ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate IgG responses to arginine-rich (poly-R) EBNA4 and EBNA6 sequences and homologous human sequences in PCS and ME/CFS.

MethodsThe IgG responses against poly-R EBNA4 and EBNA6 and corresponding homologous human 15-mer peptides and respective full-length proteins were analyzed using a cytometric bead array (CBA) and a multiplex dot-blot assay. Sera of 45 PCS patients diagnosed according to WHO criteria, with 26 patients fulfilling the Canadian Consensus criteria for ME/CFS (pcME/CFS), 36 patients with non-COVID post-infectious ME/CFS (piME/CFS), and 34 healthy controls (HC) were investigated.

ResultsAutoantibodies to poly-R peptide sequences of the neuronal antigen SRRM3, the ion channel SLC24A3, TGF-{beta} signaling regulator TSPLY2, angiogenic regulator TSPYL5, as well as to full-length -adrenergic receptor (ADRA) proteins were more frequent in patients. Several autoantibodies were positively associated with key symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, fatigue, cognition, and pain.

ConclusionCollectively, we identified autoantibodies with new antigen specificities with a potential role in PCS and ME/CFS.

Clinical ImplicationThese finding should prompt further studies on the function of these autoantibodies, their exploitation for diagnostic use, and of drugs targeting autoantibodies.

Capsule summaryOur study reveals elevated autoantibodies to EBV-related poly-R sequences and their human homologues in PCS and ME/CFS patients associated with symptom severity, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis.","NA","medrxiv",1735942058586

These complex networks have been shown to be disrupted during aging, disease, and cancer. However, profiling these networks across diverse cell types and states has been limited due to the technical constraints of existing methods for mapping DNA:Protein interactions in single cells. As a result, a critical gap remains in understanding where TFs or other chromatin remodelers bind to DNA and how these interactions are perturbed in pathological contexts. To address this challenge, we developed a transformative single-cell immuno-tethering DNA:Protein mapping technology. By coupling a species-specific antibody-binding nanobody to a cytosine base editing enzyme, this approach enables profiling of even weak or transient factor binding to DNA, a task that was previously unachievable in single cells. Thus, our Docking & Deamination followed by sequencing (D&D-seq) technique induces cytosine-to-uracil edits in genomic regions bound by the target protein, offering a novel means to capture DNA:Protein interactions with unprecedented resolution. Importantly, this technique can be seamlessly incorporated into common single-cell multiomics workflows, enabling multimodal analysis of gene regulation in single cells. We tested the ability of D&D-seq to record TF binding both in bulk and at the single-cell level by profiling CTCF and GATA family members, obtaining high specificity and efficiency, with clear identification of TF footprint and signal retention in the targeted cell subpopulations. Furthermore, the deamination reaction showed minimal off-target activity, with high concordance to bulk ChIP-seq reference data. Applied to primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), D&D-seq successfully identified CTCF binding sites and enabled integration with advanced machine-learning algorithms for predicting 3D chromatin structure. Furthermore, we integrated D&D-seq with single-cell genotyping to assess the impact of IDH2 mutations on CTCF binding in a human clonal hematopoiesis sample, uncovering altered binding and chromatin co-accessibility patterns in mutant cells. Altogether, D&D-seq represents an important technological advance enabling the direct mapping of TF or chromatin remodeler binding to the DNA in primary human samples, opening new avenues for understanding chromatin and transcriptional regulation in health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) has inherently low catalytic efficiency, making it a key target for photosynthesis and crop improvement. However, introducing mutations to the chloroplast-encoded Rubisco large subunit (rbcL), which contains the enzyme's catalytic sites, is technically challenging. In this study, we successfully generated a range of chloroplast-genome-edited Arabidopsis thaliana plants targeting rbcL by a targeted base editor, ptpTALECD. The M309I and D397N substitutions in rbcL resulted in an increased Rubisco catalytic rate (kcat) without any reductions of Rubisco content, thereby enhancing photosynthetic rates and plant growth under both current atmospheric CO2 concentrations (i.e., 381 mol mol-1) and projected future concentrations (i.e., 549 mol mol-1). Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structural analysis showed that the M309I and D397N substitutions, although located far from the catalytic site, induce structural alterations in the catalytic (60s) loops. Our findings highlight the potential of Rubisco engineering to improve plant photosynthesis and growth, and underscore the unique opportunities that chloroplast genome editing offers for enhancing photosynthesis and crop productivity and reducing atmospheric CO2 levels in a non-GMO context.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

However, designing highly stable mRNAs with programmable cell type-specificity remains a challenge. To address this, we measured the regulatory activity of 60,000 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTRs) across six cell types and developed PARADE (Prediction And RAtional DEsign of mRNA UTRs), a generative AI framework to engineer untranslated RNA regions with tailored cell type-specific activity. We validated PARADE by testing 15,800 de novo-designed sequences across these cell lines and identified many sequences that demonstrated superior specificity and activity compared to existing RNA therapeutics. mRNAs with PARADE-engineered UTRs also exhibited robust tissue-specific activity in animal models, achieving selective expression in the liver and spleen. We also leveraged PARADE to enhance mRNA stability, significantly increasing protein output and therapeutic durability in vivo. These advancements translated to notable increases in therapeutic efficacy, as PARADE-designed UTRs in oncosuppressor mRNAs, namely PTEN and P16, effectively reduced tumor growth in patient-derived neuroglioma xenograft models and orthotopic mouse models. Collectively, these findings establish PARADE as a versatile platform for designing safer, more precise, and highly stable mRNA therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

A great majority of their manifold copies remain silenced in somatic cells, nevertheless, some are transcribed, often in a tissue specific manner, and a small fraction retains its ability to mobilize. Retrotransposon expression or mobility are increasingly recognized to contribute to normal development and tissue homeostasis, as well as to aging and disease. While it is well characterized that retrotransposon sequences may provide cis regulatory elements for neighboring genes, how their own expression and mobility are achieved in different somatic contexts is not well understood. Here, using long-read DNA sequencing, we characterize somatic retrotransposition in the Drosophila intestine. We show that retroelement mobility does not change significantly upon aging and is limited to very few active sub-families of retrotransposons. Importantly, we identify a polymorphic donor locus of an endogenous LTR retroviral element rover, active in the intestinal tissue. We reveal that gut activity of the rover donor copy depends on its genomic environment. Without affecting local gene expression, the copy co-opts its upstream enhancer sequence, rich in transcription factor binding sites, for somatic expression. Further we show that escargot, a snail-type transcription factor critical for gut progenitor cell function, can drive transcriptional activity of the active rover copy. These data provide new insights into how locus-specific features allow active retrotransposons to produce functional transcripts and mobilize in a somatic lineage.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

Virulent phages, characterized by their obligatory lytic cycle, are assumed to lack the ability to persist within bacterial colonies, and their infection is expected to decimate the host population under in-vitro conditions. Consequently, when bacterial isolates are cultured for sequencing, the resulting assemblies are not expected to contain virulent phage genomes. To test this assumption on a large scale, we analyzed over 267,000 publicly available Escherichia assemblies. Surprisingly, we identified 373 genomes corresponding to virulent phages within the bacterial genomes. These viral genomes are associated with specific phage groups and especially with jumbo phages with very large genomes (>200 kb). Chimallin was a core gene in two of these jumbo phage clusters, the major protein used by some jumbo phages to form a protective phage nucleus during infection. We found multiple lines of evidence suggesting that these virulent phage genomes in bacterial assemblies arise from persistent infections rather than contamination. Supporting this, we experimentally demonstrated the coexistence of non-temperate jumbo phages with their bacterial hosts. In a targeted follow-up search for three clades of persistent jumbo phages, we identified 285 additional jumbo phage genomes in bacterial taxa beyond Escherichia, highlighting that there are many more undiscovered persistent phages in bacterial assemblies. Our findings challenge the traditional virulent-temperate dichotomy, highlighting the overlooked diversity and prevalence of non-canonical phage lifestyles.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

However, much of the supporting evidence was developed using the statistic D, which assumes, without testing, both that mutation rate is constant and that recurrent mutations are vanishingly rare. These assumptions together preclude an alternative explanation based on variation in mutation rates across human populations. Here we critically evaluate the assumptions underlying D and confirm that neither is valid. Over 40% of SNPs in dbSNP carry recurrent mutations. Theory indicates that D does not vary with mutation rate as long as the mutation rate does not vary between populations. In practice, D calculated separately for different sequence motifs varies greatly, implying strongly that mutation rates do vary between populations. We show that most, if not all, D-informative sites result from two mutations rather than the one mutation expected under the introgression hypothesis. Moreover, individual non-Africans carry a signal in more than five times as many genomic windows as can be accounted for by the 2% legacy they are thought to carry, indicating a signal that is radically more diffuse than expected. Remarkably, partitioning the data by whether the chimpanzee or Neanderthal allele is the major allele in humans reveals that the overall reported D-value of ~5% actually comprises two opposing components: one with D ~ 30% and another with D ~ -25%. Tellingly, the positive component is produced by sites where the Neanderthal allele is the major allele, the exact opposite of what should be the case under introgression, where introgressed alleles should be rare. We show further that the entire D signal can be accounted for by sites where the Neanderthal allele is fixed outside Africa and the chimpanzee allele is rare inside Africa. Investigating potential mechanisms, we extend the published observation that the mutability of three-base combinations across human populations is influenced by flanking sequence heterozygosity to reveal how genomic regions that lost more heterozygosity out of Africa exhibit higher D-values. This correlation supports a model where loss of heterozygosity slowed the mutation rate, thereby reducing the divergence between Neanderthals and non-Africans. Across independent tests, our findings consistently indicate that the mutation rate variation hypothesis provides a more compelling explanation for the observed patterns in human-Neanderthal genetic relationships than the introgression hypothesis. We argue that the mutation rate variation hypothesis would help settle a number of conflicting patterns in the literature and, hence, that the concept of archaic introgression into humans and its implications for hominin-derived traits warrants reconsideration.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1735942058586

Modification of pre-existing ligands with fragments that can alter the protein surface can lead to the creation of novel compounds (targeted glues) able to induce neo-interactions between the target and an E3 ligase, resulting in targeted protein degradation. By screening a library of potential BRD9 targeted glue compounds, we have discovered a potent and selective, reversibly covalent BRD9 degrader, AMPTX-1. Co-immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry experiments demonstrated that cell treatment with AMPTX-1 induces selective recruitment of BRD9 to the E3 ligase DCAF16. Degradation is dependent on the engagement of the surface Cys58 of DCAF16 and formation of a covalent adduct to DCAF16 is facilitated by the ternary complex formation with BRD9. BRD9 degradation is achieved in vivo after oral dosing, demonstrating that covalent recruitment of DCAF16 is a viable strategy for targeted protein degradation and can be achieved with drug-like, orally bioavailable compounds with promising in vivo activity.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

We identify BNST neurons defined by the expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 3, VGluT3. VGluT3 neurons were localized to anteromedial BNST, were molecularly distinct from accumbal VGluT3 neurons, and co-express vesicular GABA transporter (VGaT). Cell-type specific presynaptic processes were identified in arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), regions critical for feeding and homeostatic regulation. Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology revealed that, while these neurons co-express VGluT3 and VGaT, they functionally transmit GABA to both ARC and PVN, with rare glutamate co-transmission to ARC. Neuronal recordings of VGluT3 BNST neurons showed greater calcium-dependent signaling in response to sucrose consumption while sated compared with fasted. When fasted, optogenetic stimulation of BNST VGluT3 neurons decreased sucrose consumption using several stimulation conditions but not when stimulation occurred prior to sucrose access, suggesting that BNST VGluT3 activation concurrent with consumption in the fasted state reduces feeding. BNST VGluT3 activation during anxiety-like paradigms (novelty-suppressed feeding, open field, and elevated zero maze) and real-time place conditioning resulted in no changes in anxiety-like or reward/aversion behavior. We interpret these data such that VGluT3 BNST neurons represent a unique cellular population within the BNST that provides inhibitory input to hypothalamic regions to decrease feeding without affecting anxiety-like or reward/aversion behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

We trained mice to consume sucrose in context A, associated an aversive stimulus in context B to few or many forward or backwards paired cues (CS+), and then tested for conditioned suppression in context A in response to the CS+. We found that few or many forward CS+ and few backward CS+ produced conditioned suppression, but many backwards cues did not. Administration of diazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor, prevented conditioned suppression to the backward CS+ but not to the forward CS+. Furthermore, freezing behavior was observed in response to the forward CS+ but not the backward CS+, and diazepam had no effect on freezing or locomotion. We next examined BNST GABA neurons for potential sensitivity to backwards cues and conditioned suppression. VGaT BNST signaling increased in response to sucrose licks during the backward CS+ but not to licks outside the CS+ and not to the backward CS+ onset or offset. Using designer receptors, we found that BNST VGaT neuron activation, but not its inhibition, prevented backward conditioned suppression expression. We conclude that backward conditioned suppression is dependent on both positive allosteric modulation of GABA on GABA-A receptors by diazepam and BNST GABA neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

While previous studies identified gene expression differences between central and basal inflorescence sections, the spatio-temporal dynamics and gradients along the apical-basal axis remain poorly resolved due to bulk tissue-level techniques. Here, using spatial transcriptomics, we profiled 200 genes across four stages of wheat inflorescence development to cellular resolution. Cell segmentation and unsupervised clustering identified 18 expression domains and their enriched genes, revealing dynamic spatio-temporal organisation along the apical-basal axis of the inflorescence. Along this axis, we uncovered distinct and spatially coordinated gene expression gradients patterning meristems prior to the visible delay in basal spikelet development.

In this work, we have characterized the transport and accumulation of different tattoo inks in the lymphatic system using a murine model. Upon quick lymphatic drainage, we observed that macrophages mainly capture the ink in the lymph node (LN). An initial inflammatory reaction at local and systemic levels follows ink capture. Notably, the inflammatory process is maintained over time as we observed clear signs of inflammation in the draining LN two months following tattooing. In addition, the capture of ink by macrophages was associated with the induction of apoptosis in both human and murine models. Furthermore, the ink accumulated in the LN altered the immune response against a COVID-19 vaccine. We observed a reduced antibody response following vaccination with a mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which was associated with a decreased expression of the Spike protein in macrophages in the draining LN. Considering the unstoppable trend of tattooing in the population, our results are crucial in informing the toxicology programs, policymakers, and the general public regarding the potential risk of the tattooing practice associated with an altered immune response.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

Most of these delicate structures must survive for an organism's lifetime, meaning up to a century in humans. Long-term maintenance and sustained functionality of axons requires motor protein-driven transport distributing life-sustaining materials and organelles to places of need. It seems therefore plausible that loss of motor function can cause axon degeneration; however, also gain-of-function conditions were linked to disorders including motor neuron disease or spastic paraplegia. To understand this phenomenon, we studied ~40 genetic manipulations of motor proteins, cargo linkers and regulators of reactive oxygen species in one standardised Drosophila primary neuron system. Using axonal microtubule bundle organisation as a relevant readout reflecting the state of axon integrity, we found that losses of Dynein heavy chain, KIF1A/Unc-104 and KIF5/Kinesin heavy chain (Khc) all cause bundle disintegration in the form of chaotically curled microtubules. Detailed functional studies of Khc and its adaptor proteins revealed that losses of mitochondrial or lysosomal transport cause ROS dyshomeostasis, which is a condition that inducing MT-curling in fly and mouse neurons alike. We find that hyper-activated Khc induces the same MT-curling phenotype, not through ROS but directly through enhanced mechanical forces. Studies with loss of Unc-104 and expression of an ALS-linked mutant form of the human Khc orthologue KIF5A suggest that the two mechanisms apply to motors beyond Khc. We discuss a model which can explain the surprising common outcome of both conditions and examine its relevance for understanding motor-linked neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

Here we investigated the basis of the polarized bleb morphology of metastatic melanoma cells migrating in non-adhesive confinement. Using high-resolution time-lapse imaging and specific molecular perturbations, we found that EGF signaling via PI3K stabilizes and maintains a polarized leader bleb. Protein activity biosensors revealed a unique EGFR and PI3K activity gradient decreasing from rear-to-front, promoting PIP3 and Rac1-GTP accumulation at the bleb rear, with its antagonists PIP2 and RhoA-GTP concentrated at the bleb tip, opposite to the front-to-rear organization of these signaling modules in integrin-mediated mesenchymal migration. Optogenetic experiments showed that disrupting this gradient caused bleb retraction, underscoring the role of this signaling gradient in bleb stability. Mathematical modeling and experiments identified a mechanism where, as the bleb initiates, CD44 and ERM proteins restrict EGFR mobility in a membrane-apposed cortical actin meshwork in the bleb rear, establishing a rear-to-front EGFR-PI3K-Rac activity gradient. Thus, our study reveals the biophysical and molecular underpinnings of cell polarity in bleb-based migration of metastatic cells in non-adhesive confinement, and underscores how alternative spatial arrangements of migration signaling modules can mediate different migration modes according to the local microenvironment.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

We identify a novel role for BORC (BLOC-1-related complex) in segregating SVPs and lysosomal proteins in the cell body. BORC subunit SAM-4/Myrlysin acts through ARL-8 and Kinesin motor proteins UNC-116/KIF5 and UNC-104/KIF1A in segregating SVPs and lysosomal proteins. Additionally, we also show that LRK-1/LRRK2 and APB-3/AP-3 ({beta}3), involved in pre-SV biogenesis, regulate the segregation of SVPs and lysosomal proteins in the neuronal cell body. LRK-1 recruits SAM-4 that in turn governs the localisation of APB-3 suggesting a hierarchical pathway of LRK-1-SAM-4-APB-3 for the segregation of SVPs and lysosomal proteins. Additionally, we also observe that the size of lysosomal protein-containing compartments (LPCCs) is smaller in SAM-4 and LRK-1. This size regulation depends on UNC-116.

The coordinated determination of cell fates is crucial in any developmental process and requires extensive intercellular communication. Plants cells exchange many molecular signals via the symplasmic pathway, i.e., via plasmodesmata: narrow channels connecting the cytoplasm of neighbouring cells. Regulation of symplasmic transport is vital for normal plant development, and mutations that disrupt this regulation are often embryo or seedling lethal. In many tissues, symplasmic transport of small molecules is diffusion driven, resulting in a non-selective and bidirectional transport, although net directionality could arise from gradients. This has led to the (dogmatic) belief that symplasmic transport can only be detrimental to pattern formation, because signalling molecules cannot be confined, and gradients would fade. Here, we develop a detailed biophysical description of symplasmic transport to explore how plasmodesmata affect gradients in a linear tissue. We then apply the model in more complex tissue contexts, observing and explaining, e.g., that symplasmic transport may result in steeper gradients in the root apical meristem. In conclusion, our model provides a reference framework for estimating the consequences of symplasmic transport and explains how symplasmic transport can contribute to more robust developmental patterning.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

While ML algorithms are proficient in general-purpose tasks, their highly technical nature often hinders their compatibility with the observed biological principles and constraints in the brain, thereby limiting their suitability for neuroscience applications. In this work, we introduce NeuroTorch, a comprehensive ML pipeline specifically designed to assist neuroscientists in leveraging ML techniques using biologically inspired neural network models. NeuroTorch enables the training of recurrent neural networks equipped with either spiking or firing-rate dynamics, incorporating additional biological constraints such as Dales law and synaptic excitatory-inhibitory balance. The pipeline offers various learning methods, including backpropagation through time and eligibility trace forward propagation, aiming to allow neuroscientists to effectively employ ML approaches. To evaluate the performance of NeuroTorch, we conducted experiments on well-established public datasets for classification tasks, namely MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Heidelberg. Notably, NeuroTorch achieved accuracies that replicated the results obtained using the Norse and SpyTorch packages. Additionally, we tested NeuroTorch on real neuronal activity data obtained through volumetric calcium imaging in larval zebrafish. On training sets representing 9.3 minutes of activity under darkflash stimuli from 522 neurons, the mean proportion of variance explained for the spiking and firing-rate neural network models, subject to Dales law, exceeded 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. Our analysis of networks trained on these datasets indicates that both Dales law and spiking dynamics have a beneficial impact on the resilience of network models when subjected to connection ablations.

LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that TT is a complex mixture of proteins, similar to other TTs where the detoxified tetanus neurotoxin (d-TeNT) has been shown to be the most abundant protein (30-56%), regardless the quantification method used. The fifteen most abundant proteins account for approximately 78% of the total proteins.

Using the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model synapse, we previously reported that Mitochondrial Complex I (MCI) subunits were required for maintaining NMJ function and growth. Here we report tissue-specific ad-aptations at the NMJ when MCI is depleted. In Drosophila motor neurons, MCI depletion causes profound cytological defects and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). But in-stead of diminishing synapse function, neuronal ROS triggers a homeostatic signaling process that maintains normal NMJ excitation. We identify molecules mediating this compensatory response. MCI depletion in muscles also enhances local ROS. But high levels of muscle ROS cause destruc-tive responses: synapse degeneration, mitochondrial fragmentation, and impaired neurotransmis-sion. In humans, mutations affecting MCI subunits cause severe neurological and neuromuscular diseases. The tissue-level effects that we describe in the Drosophila system are potentially relevant to forms of mitochondrial pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

We apply Bambu-Clump to identify fusion transcripts in single-cells, compare 5' and 3' selection protocols, and identify novel isoform cell-type markers in spatial mouse brain data.

Although the use of RNA-degraded tissues in transcriptome analysis remains controversial, such samples are sometimes the sole means to address specific questions. Current studies on the impact of PMI on transcriptome data are limited to large-scale RNA-seq, which ignores cellular heterogeneity. Thus, deciphering the non-cell-autonomous effects caused by PMI is imperative for understanding the cellular and molecular disruption it elicits. Here, we investigated the impact of PMI on cellular components and gene expression using snRNA-seq data from mouse brain tissues of post-mortem. We collected samples that were allowed to decay for varying amounts of time at 25 C prior to snRNA-seq, covering the entire range of RIN values. The different effects on the PMI to the degradation rate of mRNA and rRNA within nuclei, and the mRNA presented a more stable state. Multi-channel analysis revealed the preferential transient depletion oligodendrocytes and OPCs with increasing PMI. In addition, a rapid widespread overregulation of ribosomal transient recruitment to protein (RP) genes in various cells, and reached a plateau at PMI of 36h. Although state depletion of neuronal cells was not detected, we reported significant upregulation of PMI-dependent RP genes in its subpopulations and their cell loss. Moreover, RP genes showed the greatest differential expression in the subpopulations with greater cell perturbation, and we speculated that aberrant expression of these genes might be associated with cell death. In this study, we systematically investigated the changes in the transcriptome profile of brain tissue induced by PMI at single-cell resolution, and revealed one of the important factors that might be responsible for the changes. In addition, our data complemented a possible explanation for the changes in the cellular state of brain tissue induced by postmortem hypoxia-ischemia, and provided a reference for transcriptome studies of RNA degradation samples.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

This leads to a state of relative inhibition, reducing feedforward gamma (40-90 Hz) rhythms and spiking to predictable inputs. We refer to this model as predictive routing. It is currently unclear which circuit mechanisms implement this push-pull interaction between alpha/beta and gamma rhythms. To explore how predictive routing is implemented, we developed a self-supervised learning algorithm we call generalized Stochastic Delta Rule (gSDR). It was necessary to develop this learning rule because manual tuning of parameters (frequently used in computational modeling) is inefficient to search through a non-linear parameter space that defines how neuronal rhythms emerge and interact. We used gSDR to train biophysical neural circuits and validated the algorithm on simple tasks, e.g., tuning membrane potentials and firing rates. We next applied gSDR to model observed neurophysiology. We asked the model to reproduce a shift from baseline oscillatory dynamics ([~]<20Hz) to stimulus induced gamma ([~]40-90Hz) dynamics recorded in the macaque monkey visual cortex. This gamma-band oscillation during stimulation emerged by self-modulation of synaptic weights via gSDR. We further showed that the gamma-beta push-pull interactions implied by predictive routing could emerge via stochastic modulation of both local inhibitory circuitry as well as top-down modulatory inputs to a network. To summarize, we implemented gSDR to train biophysical neural circuits based on a series of objectives. gSDR succeeded in implementing these objectives. This revealed the inhibitory neuron mechanisms underlying the gamma-beta push-pull dynamics that are observed during predictive processing tasks in systems and cognitive neuroscience.

Significant StatementThis study contributes to the advancement of self-supervised learning for modeling the behavior of complex neural circuits and specifically, biophysical models based on predictive routing framework. Since gSDR is an evolutionary algorithm and does not rely on specific model-based assumptions, it could improve autonomous approaches both in computational neuroscience and neural network research.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

Using an Ago413-/- mouse, we show that AGO3 and AGO4 are key regulators of spermatogenesis, orchestrating expression of meiosis-related genes during prophase I while maintaining silencing of spermiogenesis genes. Premature overexpression of spermiogenesis genes during prophase I in Ago413-/- mice results in subfertility, altered sperm morphology and reduced fertilization capability. We also identify BRG1, a BAF complex subunit, as an AGO3 interactor.

Previous studies have identified an interbacterial toxin predicted to exhibit proteolytic activity that is broadly distributed among Gram-negative bacteria. However, the precise mechanism of intoxication remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that one such protease toxin from Escherichia coli, Cpe1, disrupts DNA replication and segregation by recognizing and cleaving conserved sequences in the essential type II DNA topoisomerases GyrB and ParE. Cpe1 belongs to the papain-like cysteine protease family and is associated with toxin delivery pathways, including the type VI secretion system and contact-dependent growth inhibition. The crystal structure of Cpe1 in complex with its immunity protein reveals a neutralization mechanism involving competitive substrate binding rather than active site occlusion, distinguishing it from previously characterized effector-immunity pairs. Collectively, our findings unveil a unique mode of interbacterial intoxication and provide insights into how bacteria protect themselves from self-poisoning by protease toxins.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

Cannulae have been postulated to act as a primitive extracellular matrix through which cells could communicate or exchange material, although their native biological function remains obscure. Here, we report cryoEM structural analyses of ex vivo cannulae and of in vitro protein assemblies derived from recombinant cannula-like proteins. Three-dimensional reconstructions of P. abyssi cannulae revealed that the structural interactions between protomers in the native and recombinant filaments were based on donor strand complementation, a form of non-covalent polymerization in which a donor {beta}-strand from one subunit is inserted into an acceptor groove in a {beta}-sheet of a neighboring subunit. Donor strand complementation in cannulae is reinforced through calcium ion coordination at the interfaces between structural subunits in the respective assemblies. While donor strand complementation occurs during the assembly of chaperone-usher pili, this process requires the participation of accessory proteins that are localized in the outer membrane. In contrast, we demonstrate that calcium ions can induce assembly of cannulae in the absence of other co-factors. Crystallographic analysis of a recombinant cannula-like protein monomer provided evidence that calcium ion binding primes the precursor for donor strand invasion through unblocking of the acceptor groove. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that structurally homologous cannula-like proteins occurred within the genomes of other hyperthermophilic archaea and were encompassed within the TasA superfamily of biomatrix proteins.

This is evident during brain development, when synaptic plasticity during critical windows enables adaptability to changing environments whilst ensuring the stability of population dynamics. The emergence of population dynamics that balance stability and flexibility during development is poorly understood. Here, we investigated developmental brain dynamics in larval zebrafish, using in vivo 2-photon imaging to record single-cell activity across major brain regions from 3-8 days post-fertilisation, a highly plastic period in which hunting behaviours are established. Our findings revealed region-specific trajectories in the development of such dynamic regimes: the telencephalon exhibited increased neuronal excitability and long-range correlations, alongside the emergence of scale invariant avalanche dynamics indicative of enhanced flexibility. Conversely, while other regions showed increased state transitions over development, the telencephalon demonstrated a surprising rise in state stability, characterized by slightly longer dwell times and drastically reduced angular velocity in state space. Remarkably, such rotationally stable dynamics persisted up to 5 seconds into the future, indicating the emergence of strong attractors supporting stability over long timescales. Notably, we observed that telencephalon dynamics were maintained near to but not at a phase transition, thus allowing for robust responses while remaining adaptable to novel inputs. Our results highlight regionally-specific trajectories in the relationship between flexibility and stability, illustrating how developing neuronal populations can self-organize to balance these competing demands.","NA","biorxiv",1735942058586

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1735942058586

Core genes are traditionally identified by the analysis of amino acid similarities among proteomes, but can also be defined using structures, which bear potential in deep clades beyond the twilight zone of amino acids. Despite breakthroughs in accurate AI-driven protein structure prediction, obtaining full 3D structural models on a proteomic scale is still prohibitively slow. Here, we present Unicore, a novel method for identifying structural core genes at a scale suitable for downstream phylogenetic analysis. By applying the ProstT5 protein language model to the input proteomes to obtain their 3Di structural strings, Unicore saves over three orders of magnitude in runtime compared to a full 3D prediction. Using Foldseek clustering, Unicore identifies single-copy structures universally present in the species and aligns them using Foldmason. These structural core gene alignments are projected back to amino acid information for downstream phylogenetic analysis. We demonstrate that this approach defines core genes with linear run-time scaling over the number of species, up to 56 times faster than OrthoFinder, while reconstructing phylogenetic relationships congruent with conventional approaches.
