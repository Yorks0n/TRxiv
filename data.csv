While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1735682948698

While ML algorithms are proficient in general-purpose tasks, their highly technical nature often hinders their compatibility with the observed biological principles and constraints in the brain, thereby limiting their suitability for neuroscience applications. In this work, we introduce NeuroTorch, a comprehensive ML pipeline specifically designed to assist neuroscientists in leveraging ML techniques using biologically inspired neural network models. NeuroTorch enables the training of recurrent neural networks equipped with either spiking or firing-rate dynamics, incorporating additional biological constraints such as Dale's law and synaptic excitatory-inhibitory balance. The pipeline offers various learning methods, including backpropagation through time and eligibility trace forward propagation, aiming to allow neuroscientists to effectively employ ML approaches. To evaluate the performance of NeuroTorch, we conducted experiments on well-established public datasets for classification tasks, namely MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Heidelberg. Notably, NeuroTorch achieved accuracies that replicated the results obtained using the Norse and SpyTorch packages. Additionally, we tested NeuroTorch on real neuronal activity data obtained through volumetric calcium imaging in larval zebrafish. On training sets representing 9.3 minutes of activity under darkflash stimuli from 522 neurons, the mean proportion of variance explained for the spiking and firing-rate neural network models, subject to Dale's law, exceeded 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. Our analysis of networks trained on these datasets indicates that both Dale's law and spiking dynamics have a beneficial impact on the resilience of network models when subjected to connection ablations. NeuroTorch provides an accessible and well-performing tool for neuroscientists, granting them access to state-of-the-art ML models used in the field without requiring in-depth expertise in computer science.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Yet, the relationship between atomic features and condensate function remains poorly understood. We studied this relationship using the polar organizing protein Z (PopZ) as a model system, revealing how its material properties and cellular function depend on its ultrastructure. We revealed PopZs hierarchical assembly into a filamentous condensate by integrating cryo-electron tomography, biochemistry, single-molecule techniques, and molecular dynamics simulations. The helical domain drives filamentation and condensation, while the disordered domain inhibits them. Phase-dependent conformational changes prevent interfilament contacts in the dilute phase and expose client binding sites in the dense phase. These findings establish a multiscale framework that links molecular interactions and condensate ultrastructure to macroscopic material properties that drive cellular function.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

However, several emerging JN.1 sublineages, such as LF.7.2.1, MC.10.1, NP.1, and, especially, LP.8.1, have demonstrated superior growth advantages compared to XEC. It is critical to access the virological and antigenic characteristics of these emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we found that LF.7.2.1 is significantly more immune invasive than XEC, primarily due to the A475V mutation, which enabled the evasion of Class 1 neutralizing antibodies. However, LF.7.2.1s weak ACE2 binding affinity substantially impaired its fitness. Likewise, MC.10.1 and NP.1 exhibited strong antibody immune evasion due to the A435S mutation, but their limited ACE2 engagement efficiency restricted their growth advantage, suggesting that A435S may regulate the Spike conformation, similar to the NTD glycosylation mutations found in KP.3.1.1 and XEC. Most importantly, we found that LP.8.1 showed comparable humoral immune evasion to XEC but demonstrated much increased ACE2 engagement efficiency, supporting its rapid growth. These findings highlight the trade-off between immune evasion and ACE2 engagement efficiency in SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and underscore the importance of monitoring LP.8.1 and its descend lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

However, whether tempo is responsible for these differences in magnitude, and how, remains to be determined. Here, we used brain organoids to investigate this and observed that human axon tracts spend more time growing and extend farther compared to those of mice, independent of their tissue environment. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis pointed to a subset of calcium-permeable ion channels expressed throughout neuron development, including during axon tract outgrowth. Calcium imaging during early neuron development consistently revealed a reduced calcium influx in human neurons compared to mouse neurons. Stimulating calcium influx and increasing cAMP levels resulted in premature halting of axon tract outgrowth and shorter axon tracts, mimicking the mouse phenotype, while abrogating calcium influx led to an even longer phase of axon tract outgrowth and longer axon tracts in humans. Thus, evolutionary differences in calcium regulation set the tempo of neuronal development, by extending the time window to foster the more elaborated human neuron morphology.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

It describes the deviations of connectivity patterns from those expected in randomly connected networks. Understanding the origins of wiring specificity in neural networks remains difficult as a variety of generative mechanisms could have contributed to the observed connectome. To take a step forward, we propose a generative modeling framework that operates directly on dense connectome data as provided by saturated reconstructions of neural tissue. The computational framework allows testing different assumptions of synaptic specificity while accounting for anatomical constraints posed by neuron morphology, which is a known confounding source of wiring specificity. We evaluated the framework on dense reconstructions of the mouse visual and the human temporal cortex. Our template model incorporates assumptions of synaptic specificity based on cell type, single-cell identity, and subcellular compartment. Combinations of these assumptions were sufficient to model various connectivity patterns that are indicative of wiring specificity. Moreover, the identified synaptic specificity parameters showed interesting similarities between both datasets, motivating further analysis of wiring specificity across species.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

In this vaccine, the Cys538 in the recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is linked, through a thiosuccinimide linker, to lysine residues of tetanus toxoid (TT) preparation. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that TT is a complex mixture of proteins, similar to other TTs where the detoxified tetanus neurotoxin (d-TeNT) has been shown to be the most abundant protein (30-56%), regardless the quantification method used. The fifteen most abundant proteins account for approximately 78% of the total proteins. LC-MS/MS analysis of the activation process showed that 102 out of 107 lysine residues in the d-TeNT incorporated a maleimide group. In contrast, when tryptic peptides isolated by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography, were analyzed by LC-MS/MS, only 22 Lys residues in the d-TeNT were cross-linked to the RBD C-terminal tryptic peptide (538CVNF541-HHHHHH), probably due to steric hindrance. Twelve and eighteen conjugation sites were assigned based on the identification of linear peptides carrying a conjugated lysine residues (K(+1454.58 Da) or K(+1472.59 Da)) and cross-linked peptides with stabilized linker forms, respectively. Eight conjugation sites were coincidently assigned by both strategies. The assignment of the conjugation sites was manually validated by observed regularities (z equal or higher to 3+, XIC, immonium ions, specific linker fragment ions) not considered by the identification software (PEAKS, Kojak and pLink2). The RBD was also conjugated, but to a lesser extent, to ten other low abundance carrier proteins. To our knowledge, this work is the first report of conjugation site assignment in a TT-based conjugate vaccine.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

These 3D stem cell-derived models exist in a newer space at the intersection of in vivo and 2D in vitro models. Functional benchmarking has so far remained largely uncharacterised however, leaving the extent to which these models may accurately portray in vivo processes still yet to be fully realised. Here we present a standardised unguided protocol to generate brain organoids from mice, the most commonly-used in vivo mammalian model; and in parallel establish a guided protocol for generating region-specific choroid plexus mouse organoids. Both unguided and guided mouse organoids progress through neurodevelopmental stages with an in vivo-like tempo and recapitulate species-specific characteristics of neural and choroid plexus development, respectively. Neuroepithelial cells generate neural progenitors that give rise to different neural subtypes including deep-layer neurons, upper-layer neurons, and glial cells. We further adapted protocols to prolong mouse cerebral organoid (CO) cultures as slices at the air-liquid interface (ALI), enhancing accessibility for long-term studies and functional investigations. In mature mouse ALI-COs, we observed mature glia, as well as synaptic structures and long-range axon tracts projecting to distant regions, suggesting an establishment and maturation of neural circuitry. Indeed, functional analyses with high-density multi-electrode arrays (HD-MEAs) indicate comparable activity to ex vivo organotypic mouse brain slices. Having established protocols for both region-specific and unpatterned mouse brain organoids, we demonstrate that their neurodevelopmental trajectories, and resultant mature features, closely mimic the in vivo models to which they are benchmarked across multiple biochemical, morphological, and functional read-outs. We propose that mouse brain organoids are a valuable model for functional studies, and provide insight into how closely brain organoids of other species, such as human, may recapitulate their own respective in vivo development.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

We show that DNMT3A2/3B3 preferentially binds di-nucleosomes separated by short DNA linkers by inducing large-scale changes to the di-nucleosome structure, enabling each DNMT3B3 subunit to bind each nucleosome. Linker length and the position of cytosines within the linker control DNA methylation, indicating that a significant fraction of linkers in chromatin are naturally resistant to DNMT3A2/3B3 activity. Finally, DNMT3A2/3B3 scans for H3K36me2-3 modifications, explaining how H3K36 methylation simulates DNMT3A2 activity.

Identifying active ingredients requires access to detailed intervention descriptions, such as from trial protocols or manuals. We conducted a large-scale survey of the accessibility of trial protocols or manuals for evidence-based psychological interventions, tested in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for multiple mental disorders. Methods: We assembled a large cohort of RCTs, selecting these from six large network meta-analyses of psychological interventions for severe mental disorders (schizophrenia and other psychotic, borderline personality disorder, substance use disorder, bipolar disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa). For each trial and active intervention arm, we used a multipronged approach (published protocol, trial registries, author contact, commercial availability) to identify protocols or manuals. We described, by trial and by active intervention arm, the proportion for which protocols or manuals were (1) accessible, i.e., retrievable by any method, and (2) publicly available. Findings: We included 260 RCTs, with 401 active intervention arms. Of these, 20 RCTs (8%, 95% confidence interval/CI 5% to 12%) were associated to protocols, published separately or as supplement. For the remaining 240 trials, we contacted 450 authors. Authors shared protocols for 43 trials (18%, 95% CI 13% to 23%), refused to share for 73 (30%, 95% CI 25% to 37%) and did not respond for 101 (42%, 95% CI 36% to 49%).

Conclusions: Access to detailed descriptions of psychological interventions, even using multiple methods, is difficult and burdensome, hampering much-needed examinations of treatment components. Relying only on open-access resources and sharing from authors, a researcher would be able to access about one third of trial protocols or manuals. Improving dissemination and implementation of evidence-based treatments requires publicly available treatment manuals.

Because these RBD sequences did not match known circulating strains and their source was not known, we termed them ""cryptic lineages"". To date, more than 20 cryptic lineages have been identified using the RBD-focused sequencing strategy. Here, we identified and characterized additional cryptic lineages from SARS-CoV-2 wastewater sequences submitted to NCBIs Sequence Read Archives (SRA). Wastewater sequence datasets were screened for individual sequence reads that contained combinations of mutations frequently found in cryptic lineages but not contemporary circulating lineages. Using this method, we identified 18 cryptic lineages that appeared in multiple samples from the same sewershed, including 12 that were not previously reported. Partial consensus sequences were generated for each cryptic lineage by extracting and mapping sequences containing cryptic-specific mutations. Surprisingly, seven of the mutations that appeared convergently in cryptic lineages were reversions to sequences that were highly conserved in SARS- CoV-2-related bat Sarbecoviruses. The apparent reversion to bat Sarbecovirus sequences suggests that SARS- CoV-2 adaptation to replicate efficiently in respiratory tissues preceded the COVID-19 pandemic.

Author SummaryWastewater surveillance has been used during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to monitor viral activity and the spread of viral lineages. Occasionally, SARS-CoV-2 sequences from wastewater reveal unique evolutionary advanced lineages of SARS-CoV-2 from an unknown source, which are termed cryptic lineages. Many groups nationwide also use wastewater surveillance to track the virus and upload that information to NCBIs SRA database. That sequence data was screened to identify 18 cryptic lineages worldwide and identify convergent mutations throughout the genome of multiple cryptic lineages that suggest reversion to residues common in SARS-CoV-2-related Sarbecoviruses.","NA","medrxiv",1735682948698

However, how the genetic sex shapes the molecular architecture of the nervous system at a single neuron level is still unknown. To address this gap, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile the transcriptome of the sex-shared nervous system of adult male and hermaphrodite Caenorhabditis elegans. By ranking neurons based on the degree of molecular dimorphism, we uncover novel sexually dimorphic neurons such as PLM neurons, where functional dimorphism was corroborated by diminished posterior touch responses in hermaphrodites. We identify sex-specific regulators of mechanosensory behavior and neuronal function by combining our dataset with reverse genetic screens. While most sex-shared neurons retain their neurotransmitter identity, the male neuropeptide connectome undergoes substantial remodeling, with most of the neuropeptides showing a male-bias expression. This reinforces the notion that neuropeptides are crucial for diversifying connectome outputs. Furthermore, by correlating gene expression with outgoing synaptic connectivity, we identified regulatory candidates for synaptic wiring, including both shared and sex-specific genes. This comprehensive resource provides foundational insights into the molecular drivers of sexual dimorphism, facilitating future exploration of regulatory mechanisms and their impact on sex-specific behaviors in higher organisms.

Emerging work suggests that the thalamus, the relay center of the brain that undergoes secondary damage after cortical TBI, is involved with heightened seizure risks after TBI. TBI also induces the recruitment of peripheral immune cells, including T cells, to the site(s) of injury, but it is unclear how these cells impact neurological sequelae post-TBI. Here, we characterize the identities and kinetics of lymphocytic infiltrates into the cortex and thalamus using a mouse model of cortical TBI. We identify a population of IFN{gamma}-producing type 1 lymphocytes that infiltrate specific thalamic subregions over weeks following injury, where they elicit a local IFN{gamma} response in microglia and neuronal subset(s). Depletion of CD4+ T cells protects mice from TBI-induced seizure susceptibility by de-repressing other non-CD4+ type 1 lymphocytes and disease-associated microglia (DAMs) in the thalamus. Strikingly, we find that a single dose of IFN{gamma} prior to challenge with a proconvulsant agent was sufficient to reduce TBI-induced seizure incidence, severity, and mortality. This work identifies IFN{gamma} as a direct modulator of TBI-associated seizure susceptibility, which could have therapeutic implications for the treatment of TBI patients.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

To address this question, we measured the consequences of category learning on the macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex, a key waypoint along the ventral visual stream that is known to support object recognition. First, we observed that neural activity across task-trained monkeys IT showed increased object category selectivity, enhanced linear separability (of categories), and overall more categorical representations compared to those from task-naive monkeys. To model how these differences could arise, we next developed a computational hypothesis-generation framework of the monkeys learning process using anatomically-mapped artificial neural network (ANN) models of the primate ventral stream that we combined with various choices of learning algorithms. Our simulations revealed that specific gradient-based, performance-optimizing updates of the ANNs internal representations substantially approximated the observed changes in the IT cortex. Notably, we found that such models predict novel training-induced phenomena in the IT cortex, including changes in category-orthogonal representations and ITs alignment with behavior. This convergence between experimental and modeling results suggests that plasticity in the visual ventral stream follows principles of task optimization that are well approximated by gradient descent. We propose that models like the ones developed here could be used to make accurate predictions about visual plasticity in the ventral stream and its transference - or lack thereof - to any future test image.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

While this period of beta cell dysfunction is well established, its cause and underlying mechanism remain unknown. To address this knowledge gap, live human pancreas tissue slices were prepared from autoantibody- negative organ donors without diabetes (ND), donors positive for one or more islet autoantibodies (AAb+), and donors with T1D within 0-4 years of diagnosis (T1D+). Dynamic imaging and physiological secretion studies were conducted to assess the extent and impact of T cell infiltration on beta cell function through immunolabeling, Ca2+ imaging, and perifusion assays for insulin secretion. Beta cells were identified in living slices by ENTPD3 cell surface staining. Beta cells from both ND and AAb+ donors exhibited normal cytosolic Ca2+ mobilization in response to high glucose and KCl. Beta cells from donors with T1D had significantly diminished Ca2+ responses to high glucose but preserved responses to KCl. In T1D, glucose responsiveness was impaired in both T cell-infiltrated and non-infiltrated insulin positive islets, supporting the concept that beta cell dysfunction is independent of close spatial association between beta cells and T cells. Fixed tissue staining and gene expression profiling of laser-capture microdissected islets revealed significant decreases in markers of glucose metabolism to ATP in beta cells from donors with T1D but no changes in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers. From these data, we posit that functional defects occur in beta cells during T1D pathogenesis independent of local T cell infiltration and beta cell destruction. Additionally, these beta cell metabolic defects contribute to the clinical manifestation of dysglycemia at T1D diagnosis despite a remaining mass of beta cells.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

In cancer, TLS are associated with better prognosis and enhanced response to immunotherapy, making these structures attractive therapeutic targets. However, the mechanisms regulating TLS formation and maintenance in cancer are incompletely understood. Using spatial transcriptomics and multiplex imaging across various human tumors, we found an enrichment of mature dendritic cells (DC) expressing high levels of CCR7 in TLS, prompting us to investigate the role of DC in the formation and maintenance of TLS in solid tumors. To address this, we developed a novel murine model of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that forms mature TLS, containing B cell follicles with germinal centers and T cell zones with T follicular helper cells (TFH) and TCF1+PD-1+ progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tpex). Here we show that, during the early stages of tumor development, TLS formation relies on IFN{gamma}-driven maturation of the conventional DC type 1 (cDC1) subset, their migration to tumor-draining lymph nodes (tdLN), and recruitment of activated T cells to the tumor site. As tumors progress, TLS maintenance becomes independent of T cell egress from tdLN, coinciding with a significant reduction of cDC1 migration to tdLN. Instead, mature cDC1 accumulate within intratumoral CCR7 ligand-enriched stromal hubs. Notably, timed depletion of cDC1 or disruption of their migration to these stromal hubs after TLS are formed alters TLS maintenance. Importantly, we found that cDC1-mediated antigen presentation to both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and intact CD40 signaling, is critical for the maintenance of TLS, the preservation of the TFH cell pool, the formation of germinal center and the production of tumor-specific IgG antibodies. These findings underscore the key role of mature cDC1 in establishing and maintaining functional TLS within tumor lesions and highlight the potential for cDC1-targeting therapies as a promising strategy to enhance TLS function and improve anti-tumor immunity in patients with cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Changes in astrocyte function contribute to depressive-like behaviors. However, while neuronal mechanisms driving MDD have been studied in some detail, molecular mechanisms by which astrocytes promote depression have not been extensively explored. To uncover astrocyte contributions to MDD, we subjected male mice to chronic social defeat stress precipitated by encounters with a dominant male. Animals exposed to this treatment exhibit symptoms indicative of MDD, including reduced social interactions, anxiety, despair, and anhedonia. We then measured astrocyte translating mRNA expression changes in mice that underwent chronic social defeat and control animals using ribosome affinity purification. Bioinformatic analyses reveal significant alterations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), consistent with previous studies implicating this brain region in MDD. Expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, cell-cell interaction proteins, and proteins controlling glutamatergic synaptic function are significantly altered. These changes correlate with perturbation of glutamatergic transmission, measured by electrophysiology, and increased synaptic cleft size. Among ECM genes, increased expression of mRNAs encoding the synaptic remodeling protein secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (Sparc) correlates the most with the depressive phenotype. Furthermore, presence of Sparc and other ECM proteins in synaptosomes is also increased and overexpressing Sparc in PFC partially alleviates stress symptoms. Our results raise the possibility that increased expression of Sparc may be a natural protective mechanism against stress-induced synaptic dysfunction in depression.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

This process is typically slow in nature because of low mutational frequency. In contrast, the B cells of mammalian immune systems have evolved somatic hypermutation (SHM) mechanisms that introduce mutations at the immunoglobulin genomic loci at a significantly higher frequency than the rest of the genome. SHM allows B cells to rapidly evolve new antibody sequences without compromising their fitness as a consequence of genome-wide mutations. In this work, we developed a continuous directed evolution platform in human B cell lines (CODE-HB) that recruits and repurposes the SHM mechanisms to rapidly evolve reporter proteins like the Green Fluorescent Protein. This approach uses a stable, non-immunoglobulin locus within the genomes of human B cell lines. To comprehensively characterize the mutational profile and breadth of this strategy, we performed single-molecule sequencing experiments. We illustrate the utility of the platform by rapidly evolving antibody fragments in a continuous manner by B cell surface display targeting avian subtypes of influenza hemagglutinin (e.g., H5) from emerging strains.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Using the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model synapse, we previously reported that Mitochondrial Complex I (MCI) subunits were required for maintaining NMJ function and growth. Here we report tissue-specific adaptations at the NMJ when MCI is depleted. In Drosophila motor neurons, MCI depletion causes profound cytological defects and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). But instead of diminishing synapse function, neuronal ROS triggers a homeostatic signaling process that maintains normal NMJ excitation. We identify molecules mediating this compensatory response. MCI depletion in muscles also enhances local ROS. But high levels of muscle ROS cause destructive responses: synapse degeneration, mitochondrial fragmentation, and impaired neurotransmission. In humans, mutations affecting MCI subunits cause severe neurological and neuromuscular diseases. The tissue-level effects that we describe in the Drosophila system are potentially relevant to forms of mitochondrial pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

We investigated the roles of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination and latent infections in the progression of COVID-19 and sepsis. Methods: We conducted a prospective analysis of 97 individuals recovering from mild-to-critical COVID-19 and 64 sepsis patients. Immune cell frequencies, expression of functional markers, and plasma titers of anti-Toxoplasma gondii/cytomegalovirus/BCG antibodies were assessed and their impact on disease severity and outcomes was determined. To examine monocyte response to secondary challenge, monocytes isolated from COVID-19 convalescent patients and BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 and LPS. Results: Post COVID-19 patients showed immune dysregulation regardless of disease severity characterized mainly by altered expression of activation and functional markers in myeloid (CD39, CD64, CD85d, CD11b) and lymphoid cells (CD39, CD57, TIGIT). Strikingly, post-critical COVID-19 patients showed elevated expression of CD57 in CD8+ T cells compared to other severity groups. Additionally, higher frequency of CMV and T. gondii seropositive- alongside with lower frequency of BCG seropositive- patients were associated with severe and critical COVID-19.

Unless counteracted by synergistic epistasis, finite populations suffer from loss of low copy-number haplotypes by drift, forcing them into a regime called 'run-away evolution' in which new copies accumulate without bound nor equilibrium. We discuss a few empirical examples and interpret them in the light of our models. Generally, large gene families appear too overdispersed to fit the single template model suggesting a dynamic, and potentially accelerating, duplication process.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

However, there is no universally accepted or applied statistical test to analyze the performance of these circuits. Many basic statistical tests fail to capture the predicted logic (OR, AND, etc.) and most studies neglect statistical analysis entirely. As synthetic gene circuits shift toward advanced applications, primarily in computing, biosensing, and human health, it is critical to standardize the statistical methods used to evaluate gate success. Here, we propose the application of a linear mixed effects model to analyze and quantify genetic Boolean logic gate performance. First, we analyzed 144 currently published Boolean logic gates for trends and used unsupervised machine learning (k-means clustering) to validate the statistical model. Next, we utilized the model to generate estimates for the fixed effect of the ON state, {beta}, as a general descriptor of the Boolean nature of a circuit and used Monte Carlo simulations to recommend sample sizes for evaluating gate performance. Finally, we examined {beta} as a holistic metric for circuit performance using a series of nested repressor OR gates with intentionally degraded performance. We observed a linear correlation between {beta} and the predicted translation rate, highlighting the use of {beta} for the forward design of new Boolean gates. In summary, we utilized a linear mixed effects model to describe synthetic gene circuits and determined that the fixed effect, {beta}, is an appropriate descriptor of gate behavior that can be used to statistically evaluate performance.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Accurate identification and quantification of TLS in tissue can provide crucial insights into the immune response of several disease processes including antitumor immune response. TLS are defined as aggregates of T cells, B cells and dendritic cells. In histological tissue sections stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin they are identified as aggregates of 50 or more lymphoid cells, however immunohistochemical analysis are required to confirm presence of distinct immune cell patterns. Assessment of lymphoid aggregates can be done in H&E slides or in slides stained with single or multiplex immunohistochemistry or other tissue based high-plex approaches with key biomarkers such as CD3 (T cells) and CD20 (B cells), however manual assessment of them is time consuming thus limiting its full evaluation. To our knowledge, published algorithms that identify TLS within a tissue are based on histological assessment of H&E slides or through use of ML algorithms trained on images that show the TLS presence in tissues; and quantification and spatial analysis of TLS still remains a challenge. This study aims to develop a robust algorithm to recognize TLS using the spatial coordinates of immune cells in any given tissue. The algorithm uses X and Y coordinates of T and B cells in tissues identified by a pathologist-supervised digital image analysis of multiplex chromogenic immunohistochemistry of tissues stained with CD3 and CD20. The algorithm is flexible to be used for detailed analysis of TLS stages; including other cell types within the definition of TLS; such as dendritic cells (DC) and high endothelial venules (HEV); to assess different stages of TLS formation.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

The generalized model yields a potentially more realistic and substantially more flexible model that we call ""super admixture"". This super admixture model provides a one-to-one mapping in terms of probability moments with the population-level kinship model, the latter of which is a general model of genome-wide relatedness and structure based on identity-by-descent. We introduce a method to estimate the super admixture model that is based on method of moments, does not rely on likelihoods, is computationally efficient, and scales to massive sample sizes. We apply the method to several human data sets and show that the admixed populations are indeed substantially related, implying the proposed method captures a new and important component of evolutionary history and structure in the admixture model. We show that the fitted super admixture model estimates relatedness between all pairs of individuals at a resolution similar to the kinship model. The super admixture model therefore provides a tractable, forward generating probabilistic model of complex structure and relatedness that should be useful in a variety of scenarios.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Researchers routinely estimate representational distances from brain-activity measurements that either sparsely sample the underlying neural population (e.g. neural recordings) or pool across the activity of many neurons (e.g. fMRI voxels). Here we use theory and simulations to clarify under what circumstances representational distances estimated from brain-activity measurements reflect the representational geometry of the underlying neural population, and what distortions must be expected under other circumstances. We demonstrate that the estimated representational distances are undistorted if single neurons are sampled at random. For voxels that take non-negatively weighted linear combinations, the resulting geometry is linearly distorted, correctly reflecting the population-mean dimension, while downscaling all orthogonal dimensions, for which the averaging cancels a large portion of the signal. Surprisingly, removing the mean from voxel patterns recovers the underlying representational geometry exactly in expectation under idealized conditions. This explains why the correlation distance, the most popular measure of representational dissimilarity in neuroimaging studies, ``works"" so well, yielding geometries that can appear similar between fMRI and neural recordings. The Euclidean (or Mahalanobis) distance computed after removing the mean of each pattern (without normalizing its variance) is an attractive alternative to the correlation distance in that it corrects for the inflated relative contribution of the population-mean dimension, while avoiding the drawback of the correlation distance: it can be large for confusable low-norm patterns, failing to reflect decodability. Our results demonstrate that measured representational distances reflect the neural representational geometry when (1) single neurons are sampled at random or (2) the weights with which the measured responses sample the neurons are drawn i.i.d. and (2a) the weights are drawn from a zero-mean distribution or (2b) the population mean is the same for all conditions or (2c) the mean is removed from each estimated pattern. We discuss practical implications for analyses of neural representational geometries.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a key pathogen from this group associated with chronic lung infections that has been extensively studied in this context, but the mechanism driving its adaptation towards chronic colonisation in the CF lung is not fully understood.

This work focuses on the adaptations of P. aeruginosa to long-term hypoxia, one of the important environmental pressures present in the CF lung, to investigate whether it drives the development of persistence in CF patients. We examined how an early CF isolate adapted to 6% oxygen over 28 days using an experimental evolution approach and showed that two distinct P. aeruginosa small colony variants (SCVs) emerged, one exclusively in hypoxia exposure cultures. Importantly, SCVs were more prevalent in hypoxia-adapted cultures than in normoxia-adapted cultures (98% vs <35%). Proteomic analysis revealed significant changes in the abundance of >200 proteins within 28 days, including proteins involved in antibiotic resistance, stress response, iron acquisition, biofilm formation and those previously associated with chronic infection. Importantly the observed changes in the proteome were distinct from changes reported after short-term exposure to hypoxia. Phenotypic characterisation of adapted cultures supported these findings, showing that hypoxia-adapted cultures developed higher resistance to 8 of 13 antibiotics tested; increased biofilm (1.8-4.1-fold (p<0.0001) and decreased pyocyanin production (2.6-fold, p<0.0001). All hypoxia-adapted cultures showed decreased siderophore production (2.9-3.6-fold, p<0.02). Two distinct patterns of adaptation to hypoxic conditions were observed, with the phenotypes of one culture being markedly different from the other two. Overall, we demonstrate that long-term hypoxia exposure contributes to multiple phenotype and proteome changes that are also observed in P. aeruginosa CF lung chronic infection, possibly opening the path to treatment of chronic infections.

Author SummaryOpportunistic antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections emerging from the natural environment are an increasing threat, particularly for immunocompromised individuals such as people with cystic fibrosis (CF). These infections increase disease severity, the number of deaths and healthcare costs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major pathogen in this context, causing long-term infections, yet the mechanisms driving its adaptation towards chronic colonisation in the CF lung are not understood.

We investigated the adaptations of P. aeruginosa exposed to low oxygen conditions (an important environmental pressure in the CF lung), for 28 days, to examine whether it drives the process of persistence. We found that prolonged exposure to hypoxia induced changes in the pathogens characteristics, which were distinct from those reported after short term exposure. We observed multiple adaptations in hypoxia adapted cultures, many of which were associated with important signalling networks linked to lifestyle shifts in most bacteria and several of them are also observed in isolates that had adapted to chronic infection. Similar adaptive responses in other opportunistic environmental pathogens suggest that this adaptation could be targeted to create universal therapeutic approaches preventing antibiotic overuse and improving patient outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

When recognized by host immune receptors, these proteins become avirulence (AVR) effectors. Several sequence-diverse AVRPM3 effectors and the suppressor of AVRPM3-PM3 recognition (SVRPM3a1/f1) are involved in triggering allele-specific, Pm3-mediated resistance, but the molecular mechanisms controlling their function in the host cell remain unknown. Here, we describe that AVRPM3b2/c2, AVRPM3a2/f2 and SVRPM3a1/f1 form homo- and heteromeric complexes with each other, suggesting they are present as dimers in the host cell. Alphafold2 modelling substantiated previous predictions that AVRPM3b2/c2, AVRPM3a2/f2 and SVRPM3a1/f1 all adopt a core RNase-like fold. We found that a single amino acid mutation in a predicted surface exposed region of AVRPM3a2/f2 resulted in recognition by the PM3b immune receptor, which does not recognize wildtype AVRPM3a2/f2. This indicates that differential AVRPM3 recognition by variants of the highly related PM3 immune receptors is due to subtle differences in similar protein surfaces of sequence-diverse AVRs. Based on our findings, we propose a model in which homodimers of AVRPM3s are recognized by their corresponding PM3 variants and that heterodimer formation with SVRPM3a1/f1 allows for evasion of recognition.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

We report that a ubiquitous gaseous molecule, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), regulates redox, metabolism, and mitochondrial bioenergetics to control SARS-CoV-2. Virus replication is associated with down-regulation of the H2S producing enzymes cystathionine-{beta}-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-{gamma}-lyase (CTH), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), resulting in diminished endogenous H2S levels. Inhibition of CTH resulted in SARS-CoV-2 proliferation. A slow-releasing H2S donor, GYY4137, diminished virus replication by inducing Nrf2/Keap1 pathway, restoring redox balance and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected animals with GYY4137 suppressed viral replication, ameliorated respiratory pathology, and restored antioxidant gene expression. Notably, whole-body plethysmography showed improved pulmonary function variables, including pulmonary obstruction and end-expiratory pause upon GYY4137 treatment in vivo.

Here, we demonstrate that innate looming stimulus responses, an innate predator-evasion behaviour, can be robustly extinguished via repeated unreinforced presentation over several days. We report that this extinction is long-lasting and generalises to other contexts, but can be rapidly recovered via the pairing of the visual stimulus with an aversive electric foot-shock stimulus. Moreover, fiber photometric recordings reveal that this behavioural paradigm results in the attenuation of SC and PAG physiological responses to visual looming stimuli, and that these responses do not recover following recovery of behavioural responses. An analysis of c-Fos expression patterns throughout the midbrain and hippocampus uncovered a ventral CA1 (vCA1) ensemble that is active during both innate and learned visual looming fear responses. We investigate the functional significance of this vCA1 ensemble and report that, while its activity is not necessary for innate defensive behaviour, it is necessary for learned fear responses. Together, these findings reveal a novel role of the hippocampus in enabling adaptive behavioural responses to the innately threatening visual looming stimulus which acts in complement with innate circuitry of the SC and PAG.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Ion uptake into condensates directly follows binding affinities, resulting in selective uptake of strong-binding ions, but exclusion of weak-binding ions. Ion binding further shapes the condensate microenvironment by altering the composition, viscosity and interface potential. Such changes can have profound effects on biochemical processes taking place inside condensates, as we show for RNA duplex formation.

In cultured cells, chemical-mediated control of Cas9 activity can limit off-target effects and enable mechanistic study of essential genes. However, widely-used Tet-On systems often show ""leaky"" Cas9 expression, leading to unintended edits, as well as weak activity upon induction. Leakiness can be distinctly problematic in the context of Cas9 nuclease activity, which may result in cumulative DNA damage and degradation of the target cell genome over time. To overcome these deficiencies, we established transgenic platforms that minimize Cas9 functionality in the off-state along with maximized and uncompromised on-state gene editing efficiency. By combining conditional destabilization and inhibition of Cas9, we developed an all-in-one (one or multiple guide RNAs and Cas9) ultra-tight, Tet-inducible system with exceptional dynamic range (on vs. off-state) across various cell lines and targets. As an alternative to Tet-mediated induction, we created a branaplam-regulated splice switch module for low-baseline and robust Cas9 activity control. Lastly, for circumstances where DNA damage needs to be avoided, we constructed a dual-control, Tet-inducible CRISPRi module for tight and potent transcriptional silencing. This upgraded suite of inducible CRISPR systems has broad applications for numerous cell types and experimental conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

The mtDNA is often not specifically evaluated in patients with suspected Mendelian disease, resulting in overlooked diagnostic variants.

MethodsUsing dedicated pipelines to address the technical challenges posed by the mtDNA - circular genome, variant heteroplasmy, and nuclear misalignment - single nucleotide variants, small indels, and large mtDNA deletions were called from exome and genome sequencing data, in addition to RNA-sequencing when available. A cohort of 6,660 rare disease families were analyzed (5,625 genetically undiagnosed, 84%) from the Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare diseases (GREGoR) Consortium as well as other rare disease cohorts.

ResultsDiagnostic mtDNA variants were identified in 10 previously genetically undiagnosed families (one large deletion, eight reported pathogenic variants, one novel pathogenic variant). In one additional undiagnosed proband, the detection of >900 heteroplasmic variants provided functional evidence of pathogenicity to a novel de novo variant in the nuclear gene POLG (DNA polymerase gamma), responsible for mtDNA replication and repair.

ConclusionmtDNA variant calling from data generated by exome and genome sequencing for nuclear variant analysis resulted in a genetic diagnosis or detection of a candidate variant for 0.4% of undiagnosed families affected by a broad range of rare diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1735682948698

However, there are other reorganizations of the network that do not involve fission and fusion. One such exception is the elusive, beads-on-a-string morphological transition of mitochondria. During such transitions, the cylindrical tubes of the mitochondrial membrane transiently undergo shape changes to a string of pearls connected along thin tubes. These dynamics have been anecdotally observed in many contexts and given disparate explanations. Here we unify these observations by proposing a common underlying mechanism based on the biophysical properties of tubular fluid membranes for which it is known that, under particular regimes of tension and pressure, membranes reach an instability and undergo a shape transition to a string of connected pearls. First, we use high-speed light-sheet microscopy to show that transient, short-lived pearling events occur spontaneously in the mitochondrial network in every cell type we have examined, including primary fibroblasts, T-cells, neurons, and budding yeast. We present evidence that transient mitochondrial pearling occurs during important biological events, particularly during T cell activation and neuronal firing. Using our high-temporal resolution data, we identify two distinct categories of spontaneous pearling, i) internal pressure-driven pearling regulated by ionic flux, and ii) external tension-driven pearling regulated by molecular motors. By applying live-cell STED microscopy we document the structural reorganization of inner cristae membranes during mitochondrial pearling. We then compare numerous methods for inducing pearling, including the ability to induce these dynamics with single mitochondrion precision. These methods include ionophores, channel activators, osmotic shock, detergents, laser stimulation, membrane intercalating molecules, chemical fixation, and micro-needle force. These disparate inducers establish three main physical causes of pearling, i) ionic flux amplifying internal osmotic pressure, ii) membrane packing lowering bending elasticity, and iii) external mechanical force increasing membrane tension. Pearling dynamics thereby reveal a fundamental biophysical facet of mitochondrial biology. We suggest that pearling should take its place beside fission and fusion as a key process of mitochondrial dynamics, with implications for physiology, disease, and aging.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

This leads to a state of relative inhibition, reducing feedforward gamma (40-90 Hz) rhythms and spiking to predictable inputs. We refer to this model as predictive routing. It is currently unclear which circuit mechanisms implement this push-pull interaction between alpha/beta and gamma rhythms. To explore how predictive routing is implemented, we developed a self-supervised learning algorithm we call generalized Stochastic Delta Rule (gSDR). It was necessary to develop this learning rule because manual tuning of parameters (frequently used in computational modeling) is inefficient to search through a non-linear parameter space that defines how neuronal rhythms emerge and interact. We used gSDR to train biophysical neural circuits and validated the algorithm on simple tasks, e.g., tuning membrane potentials and firing rates. We next applied gSDR to model observed neurophysiology. We asked the model to reproduce a shift from baseline oscillatory dynamics (~<20Hz) to stimulus induced gamma (~40-90Hz) dynamics recorded in the macaque monkey visual cortex. This gamma-band oscillation during stimulation emerged by self-modulation of synaptic weights via gSDR. We further showed that the gamma-beta push-pull interactions implied by predictive routing could emerge via stochastic modulation of both local inhibitory circuitry as well as top-down modulatory inputs to a network. To summarize, we implemented gSDR to train biophysical neural circuits based on a series of objectives. gSDR succeeded in implementing these objectives. This revealed the inhibitory neuron mechanisms underlying the gamma-beta push-pull dynamics that are observed during predictive processing tasks in systems and cognitive neuroscience.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Previous studies have identified an interbacterial toxin predicted to exhibit proteolytic activity that is broadly distributed among Gram-negative bacteria. However, the precise mechanism of intoxication remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that one such protease toxin from Escherichia coli, Cpe1, disrupts DNA replication and segregation by recognizing and cleaving conserved sequences in the essential type II DNA topoisomerases GyrB and ParE. Cpe1 belongs to the papain-like cysteine protease family and is associated with toxin delivery pathways, including the type VI secretion system and contact-dependent growth inhibition. The crystal structure of Cpe1 in complex with its immunity protein reveals a neutralization mechanism involving competitive substrate binding rather than active site occlusion, distinguishing it from previously characterized effector-immunity pairs. Collectively, our findings unveil a unique mode of interbacterial intoxication and provide insights into how bacteria protect themselves from self-poisoning by protease toxins.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Metastatic spreading correlates with tumor cell state evolution. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying metastasis remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the quantitative dosage of oncogenic KRAS drives lung adenocarcinoma progression and metastasis via the integration of external signaling and pioneer transcription factor dynamics into qualitative cell states. Combining mouse models, in vivo CRISPR activation screens, and fate mapping, we show that even mild transcriptional amplification of KRAS significantly fuels tumor progression and metastasis. Chromatin profiling and transcriptomics reveal that high and low KRAS dosages supersede and integrate inflammatory and TGF{beta} signaling to dictate mouse cancer cell states. Patient data show that KRAS dosages correlate with distinct survival outcomes, transcription factor activity, and cell states. Direct KRAS inhibition in xenografts limits the KRAS-high ""proliferative"" cell state but spares a minimal residual state mimicking the KRAS-low ""ciliated-like"" state. Thus, oncogenic KRAS dosage fuels tumor heterogeneity at the cell state level and drives a bimodal tumor evolution during metastasis, with implications for prognosis and treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

This study combines organic biomarker analyses; organic matter content analyses; carbon and oxygen stable isotope analyses on bulk sediment, surface-dwelling, deep-dwelling planktonic and benthic foraminifera, ostracods and fish otoliths; and foraminifera, ostracod and sponge abundance estimates, with statistical assessment of paleoenvironmental regime shifts and estimation of fish distribution depths in the past. Our results show that temperature and productivity played the most important role in driving ecosystem changes in the study area at different times: temperature was the primary driver during MIS 21 interglacial, whereas productivity became a dominant factor in the MIS 19 interglacial. In addition, organism responses varied across the ecosystem. Both interglacials yielded higher plankton and benthos biomasses. However, for fishes, the responses differ. The early MIS 21 abrupt global warming, which was also captured by our record, probably led to a reduction in their diel vertical migration by the mesopelagic fishes, and consequently to the efficiency of the biological carbon pump. In contrast, increased productivity across trophic levels is attested for MIS 19, and subsequent drop in MIS 18, affecting foraminifera, ostracod and sponge biomasses, but not inhibiting fish DVM. As a result, carbon sequestration during MIS 19 was enhanced.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

The existence of virulence genes (stx1, stx2, and rfbO157) was confirmed by pathogenicity assessments carried out on mouse model, which led to a considerable increase in morbidity and mortality. 82.08% of isolates showed evidence of resistance to at least one antibiotic, according to the antimicrobial susceptibility test with beta-lactams displaying the highest rates of resistance. Remarkably, complex resistance patterns were observed in 77.61% of the isolates, which were categorized as multidrug-resistant. Multiple antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were found by molecular analysis, particularly blaTEM and tetA as well as virulence-associated genes (VAGs) linked to extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli. Phylogenetic grouping indicated that 90.38% of the MDR isolates belonged to virulent groups B2 and D.

In order to explore the landscape and consequences of genetically regulated intron retention, we perform an intron retention quantitative trait loci (irQTL) analysis in 49 human tissues across 838 individuals. We identify 8,624 unique intron retention events associated with genetic polymorphisms. 1,369 irQTLs (16%) are also associated with genome-wide association study (GWAS) traits, suggesting that genetically regulated intron retention may play a causal role in the regulation of these GWAS traits. 1,999 irQTLs (23%) colocalize with eQTLs to their respective gene, suggesting that intron retention and steady-state gene expression levels are regulated by shared sets of genetic variants. Through a colocalization analysis of irQTL:eQTL events, we demonstrate that irQTLs are sufficient to generate eQTLs when one of the alternatively spliced transcripts is preferentially targeted by the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway. Surprisingly, for intron retention events whose potential NMD effects can be confidently predicted based on their positions within known gene annotations, we find that 58.8% (923/1570) of the colocalized irQTL and eQTL pairs show effect size directions that are discordant with the NMD model. Moreover, we find that irQTLs are significantly more likely to occur in the same gene with the same effect size direction as compared to exon skipping QTLs. Through mathematical modeling and analysis of experimental perturbation data, we provide evidence that eQTLs are able to generate irQTLs by altering the steady state ratios of spliced and unspliced transcripts, and we postulate that this mechanism may partially underlie the widespread intron retention observed previously in various biological conditions. Taken together, these results show that intron retention and steady state gene expression levels are closely intertwined to regulate phenotypic traits.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

We observed stark differences between ciliates and amoebae in terms of microbiome and virome compositions, highlighting the specificity of protist-microbe interactions. Over 115 of the recovered microbial genomes were affiliated with known endosymbionts of eukaryotes, including diverse members of the Holosporales, Rickettsiales, Legionellales, Chlamydiae, Dependentiae , and more than 250 were affiliated with possible host-associated bacteria of the phylum Patescibacteria.

We also revealed a wide range of other viruses that were predicted to infect eukaryotes or host-associated bacteria. Our results provide further evidence that protists serve as mediators of complex microbial and viral associations, playing a critical role in ecological networks.

As PRS can be derived from a single biological sample and remain stable throughout life, we explore the potential of PRS to optimize existing screening programs. Methods: Using UK Biobank (n = 444,949), we quantified the potential clinical benefits arising from a knowledge of PRS across seven diseases with existing screening programs globally (breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, abdominal aortic aneurysm, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease). We identified individuals at high genetic risk (PRS OR>2) and very high genetic risk (PRS OR>3) and estimated the optimal screening ages for these genetically high risk individuals, based on the equivalent risk to population-level risk at recommended screening ages. We then leveraged published mortality estimates, with and without screening-based interventions, to assess the potential benefits of tailoring screening age based on genetic risk. We also estimated the case enrichment ratio, which is a ratio of the percentage of cases in the high PRS risk group and in the total population. Findings: Very high risk individuals reach the risk level associated with usual starting screening age on average 10.8 years earlier, high risk individuals 8.9 years earlier and reduced risk individuals (OR<0.5) 16.8 years later. During this time, case enrichment in the high risk group is between 1.7 and 3.0 depending on disease. Across all seven diseases, appropriate interventions following PRS-guided screening would reduce premature deaths in high risk individuals by 19.0%. Conclusion: Knowledge of genetic risk, measured using PRS, has the potential to deliver substantial public health benefits when aggregated across conditions, and could reduce premature mortality by tailoring existing screening programs.","NA","medrxiv",1735682948698

Therefore, we used chemogenetic inhibition to study the role of the dentate gyrus in a goal-guided spatial navigation paradigm over a familiar but dynamic crossword maze. Mice were challenged to localize a novel reward location from alternative pathways in two versions of the task with particular configurations in each experimental day. In the simple task, the two optimal paths to the goal shared some segments in their trajectory. In a more complex task, optimal trajectories demanded completely different directions to the reward location. Overall, mice with chemogenetic inhibition of the dentate gyrus were able to learn all the routes regardless the complexity of the task, similarly to control animals. However, after having solved a first route in the complex task, mice with dentate gyrus inhibition displayed an impairment to efficiently navigate over the alternate path.

Although the behavioral manifestations of sequence learning are clear, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Motor sequence learning may arise from three distinct processes: (1) improved execution of individual movements independent of their sequential context; (2) enhanced anticipation of ""what"" movement should be executed next, enabling faster initiation; and (3) the development of motoric sequence-specific representations that encode ""how"" movements should be optimally performed within a sequence. However, many existing paradigms conflate the ""what"" and ""how"" components of learning, as participants often acquire both the sequence content (what to do) and its execution (how to do it). This overlap obscures the distinct contributions of each mechanism to motor sequence learning. In this study, we disentangled these mechanisms using a continuous reaching task. Performance in trained sequences was compared to random sequences to rule out improvements attributable solely to isolated movement execution. By also varying how many upcoming targets were visible we assessed the role of anticipation in learning. When participants could only see one future target, improvements were mostly due to them learning which target would come next. When they could see four future targets, participants immediately demonstrated fast movement times and increased movement smoothness, surpassing late-stage performance in the one target condition. Crucially, even with full visibility of future targets, participants showed further sequence-specific learning caused by a continuous optimization of movement trajectories. Follow-up experiments revealed that the learned sequence representations were effector-specific and encoded contextual information of four movements or longer. Our paradigm enables a clear dissociation between the ""what"" and ""how"" components of motor sequence learning and provides compelling evidence for the development of effector-specific sequence representations that guide optimal movement execution.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Recent studies highlight the significance of interactions between ACh and various neuromodulators in regulating complex behaviors. The ability to simultaneously image ACh and other neuromodulators can provide valuable information regarding the mechanisms underlying these behaviors. Here, we developed a series of red fluorescent G protein-coupled receptor activation-based (GRAB) ACh sensors, with a wide detection range and expanded spectral profile. The high-affinity sensor, rACh1h, reliably detects ACh release in various brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and cortex. Moreover, rACh1h can be co-expressed with green fluorescent sensors in order to record ACh release together with other neurochemicals in various behavioral contexts using fiber photometry and two-photon imaging, with high spatiotemporal resolution. These new ACh sensors can therefore provide valuable new insights regarding the functional role of the cholinergic system under both physiological and pathological conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Prior studies of earlier generations of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) demonstrated narrowband spectral increases in the electroencephalographic (EEG) spindle frequency range (11-16 Hz) in non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. However, the impact of 5G RF-EMF on sleep remains unexplored. Additionally, RF-EMF can activate L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (LTCC), which have been linked to sleep quality and EEG oscillatory activity.

ObjectiveThis study investigates whether the allelic variant rs7304986 in the CACNA1C gene, encoding the 1C subunit of LTCC, modulates 5G RF-EMF effects on EEG spindle activity during NREM sleep.

MethodsThirty-four healthy, matched participants, genotyped for rs7304986 (15 T/C and 19 T/T carriers), underwent a double-blind, sham-controlled study with standardized left-hemisphere exposure to two 5G RF-EMF signals (3.6 GHz and 700 MHz) for 30 min before sleep. Sleep spindle activity was analyzed using high-density EEG and the Fitting Oscillations & One Over f (FOOOF) algorithm.

ResultsT/C carriers reported longer sleep latency compared to T/T carriers. A significant interaction between RF-EMF exposure and rs7304986 genotype was observed, with 3.6 GHz exposure in T/C carriers inducing a faster spindle center frequency in the central, parietal, and occipital cortex compared to sham.

ConclusionThese findings suggest 3.6 GHz 5G RF-EMF modulates spindle center frequency during NREM sleep in a CACNA1C genotype-dependent manner, implicating LTCC in the physiological response to RF-EMF and underscoring the need for further research into 5G effects on brain health.","NA","medrxiv",1735682948698

There are a range of methods for HGT inference, but they are seldom systematically compared with each other. This is due to the validation problem associated with HGT inference. It is impossible to go back in time and know the true HGT events that we infer today, that too after the effect of other evolutionary processes. In the absence of such a benchmark, inference methods are often validated using simulated data. Simulations may not accurately reflect reality. They can be biased by our current understanding of evolution and by simplifying assumptions. The assumptions made in the inference model may also get incorporated into the simulation. Here, we perform a large-scale comparison of HGT inference methods using a common dataset of bacterial genomic data. We focus on how they infer clusters of neighboring co-acquisitions and co-transferred genes, as well as the inference of HGT experienced by genes associated with environmental response. Our analysis reveals that implicit phylogenetic methods, which depend on gene presence-absence profiles rather than gene trees, demonstrate superior performance in inferring meaningful HGT events. Our findings underscore the importance of selecting an appropriate inference method to accurately infer HGT. We offer practical recommendations to guide the choice of such methods and establish a comprehensive benchmark, which can inform future development of HGT inference approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

CAZymes are extremely important to research in human health, nutrition, gut microbiome, bioenergy, plant disease, and global carbon recycling. Current CAZyme annotation tools are all based on sequence similarity. A more powerful approach is to detect protein structural similarity between query proteins and known CAZymes indicative of distant homology. Here, we developed CAZyme3D (https://pro.unl.edu/CAZyme3D/) to fill the research gap that no dedicated 3D structure databases are currently available for CAZymes. CAZyme3D contains a total of 870,740 AlphaFold predicted 3D structures (named Whole dataset). A subset of CAZymes 3D structures from 188,574 nonredundant sequences (named ID50 dataset) were subject to structural similarity-based clustering analyses. Such clustering allowed us to organize all CAZyme structures using a hierarchical classification, which includes existing levels defined by the CAZy database (class, clan, family, subfamily) and newly defined levels (subclasses, structural cluster [SC] groups, and SCs). The inter-family structural clustering successfully grouped CAZy families and clans with the same structural folds in the same subclasses. The intra-family structural clustering classified structurally similar CAZymes into SCs, which were further classified into SC groups. SCs and SC groups differed from sequence similarity-based CAZy subfamilies. With CAZyme structures as the search database, we created job submission pages, where users can submit query protein sequences or PDB structures for a structural similarity search. CAZyme3D will be a useful new tool to assist the discovery of novel CAZymes by providing a comprehensive database of CAZyme 3D structures.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

The origins of these biases remain incompletely understood. In this study, we identify PSC differentiation biases as arising from fluctuations in repressive and activating histone posttranslational modifications, leading to the acquisition of a caudal epiblast-like phenotype.

We present a novel approach to overcome this bias using a chemical chromatin restoration (CHR) treatment. This method restores transcriptional programs, chromatin accessibility, histone modification profiles, and differentiation potential, effectively recapitulating the competent anterior epiblast-like state. Furthermore, we propose that a high bivalency state is a defining feature of the anterior human epiblast. We suggest that fluctuations in histone modification marks drive epiblast regionalization, ultimately shaping cellular responses to differentiation cues.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

In North America, infections in novel avian and mammalian species suggest the potential for changing ecology and establishment of new animal reservoirs. Outbreaks among domestic birds have persisted despite aggressive culling, necessitating a re-examination of how these outbreaks were sparked and maintained. To recover how these viruses were introduced and disseminated in North America, we analyzed 1,818 Hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences sampled from North American wild birds, domestic birds and mammals from November 2021-September 2023 using Bayesian phylodynamic approaches. Using HA, we infer that the North American panzootic was driven by [~]8 independent introductions into North America via the Atlantic and Pacific Flyways, followed by rapid dissemination westward via wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, shorebirds, and Galliformes, while species such as songbirds, raptors, and owls mostly acted as dead-end hosts. Unlike the epizootic of 2015, outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by [~]46-113 independent introductions from wild birds, with some onward transmission. Backyard birds were infected [~]10 days earlier on average than birds in commercial poultry production settings, suggesting that they could act as ""early warning signals"" for transmission upticks in a given area. Our findings support wild birds as an emerging reservoir for HPAI transmission in North America and suggest continuous surveillance of wild Anseriformes and shorebirds as crucial for outbreak inference. Future prevention of agricultural outbreaks may require investment in strategies that reduce transmission at the wild bird/agriculture interface, and investigation of backyard birds as putative early warning signs.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Substances containing microbes-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are representative inducers of pathogen resistance and damage repair, thus treatment of healthy plants with such substances can pre-activate plant immunity and cell repair functions. In this study, the effects of DAMP/MAMP oligosaccharides mixture (Oligo-Mix) derived from plant cell wall (cello-oligosaccharide and xylo-oligosaccharide), and fungal cell wall (chitin-oligosaccharide) were examined in cucumber. Treatment of cucumber with Oligo-Mix promoted root germination and plant growth, along with increased chlorophyll contents in the leaves. Oligo-Mix treatment also induced typical defense responses such as MAP kinase activation and callose deposition in leaves. Pretreatment of Oligo-Mix enhanced disease resistance of cucumber leaves against pathogenic fungi Podosphaera xanthii (powdery mildew) and Colletotrichum orbiculare (anthracnose). Oligo-Mix treatment increased the induction of hypersensitive cell death around the infection site of pathogens, which inhibited further infection and the conidial formation of pathogens on the cucumber leaves. RNA-seq analysis revealed that Oligo-Mix treatment upregulated genes associated with plant structural reinforcement, responses to abiotic stresses and plant defense. These results suggested that Oligo-Mix has beneficial effects on growth and disease resistance in cucumber, making it a promising biostimulant for agricultural application.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Here we show that LAMA5, a central BM component, is critical for luminal mammary tumour initiation, and controls tumor progression and phenotype development. LAMA5 is overexpressed in both human and mouse luminal mammary tumours and LAMA5 downregulation attenuates growth of human breast cancer cells. Prepubertal luminal deletion of Lama5 in MMTV-PyMT mice results in marked reduction in emergence of early hyperplasias, along with a shift from mature hormone receptor (HR+) positive luminal epithelial phenotype towards a HR+ progenitor phenotype, and widespread alterations in extracellular matrix and Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signalling genes, including overexpression of Fgf receptor 2 (Fgfr2) in the HR+ progenitor cells. Single allele deletion, but not biallelic deletion of Lama5 additionally inhibits growth and progression towards advanced mammary carcinomas. However, inhibition of Fgf receptors restores growth decrease and induces apoptosis in biallelic-Lama5-deleted organoids without affecting wildtype organoids. Our analyses demonstrate a critical role for a BM component LAMA5 in mammary tumour initiation and reveal mechanisms of extracellular matrix-epithelial interplay in breast tumour progression and phenotype maintenance.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

We show that as DNA linkers extend from 25 bp to 30 bp, as examplars of 10N+5 and 10N (integer N) bp lengths, chromatin condensates become less thermodynamically stable and nucleosome mobility increases. Simulations reveal that this is due to trade-offs between inter- and intramolecular nucleosome stacking, favored by rigid 10N+5 and 10N bp linkers, respectively. A remodeler can induce or inhibit phase separation by moving nucleosomes, changing the balance between intra- and intermolecular stacking.

Direct force measurements reveal increased mechanical activity at the interface of the two competing cell types in the form of large stress fluctuations which can lead to upward forces and cell elimination. We show how a winning cell type endowed with a stronger intercellular adhesion exhibits a higher resistance to elimination while benefiting from efficient force transmission to neighboring cells.

Furthermore, sensory neuronal TrkB expression and function has been traditionally associated with non-nociceptive neurons, particularly A{delta} low-threshold mechanoreceptors. This study challenges prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that TrkBT1 is the predominant TrkB isoform expressed in sensory neurons and plays a functional role in modulating neuronal activity. We demonstrate that TrkBT1 is the predominant isoform expressed in nociceptors, identified by markers such as TRPV1, TRPA1, TRPM8 and 5HT3A, as well as non-nociceptors, while the full-length isoform (TrkBTK+) is restricted to non-nociceptive subpopulation. Functionally, we show that acute application of BDNF induces modest calcium influx in nociceptors and prolonged BDNF exposure significantly potentiates capsaicin-induced calcium influx, an effect blocked by the TrkB-specific antagonist ANA12. Additionally, BDNF also promotes the survival of both nociceptive and non-nociceptive neurons in culture, an effect dependent on TrkBT1 activity. Our data also reveal that ANA12 inhibits BDNF-mediated neuronal sensitization and survival in a concentration-dependent manner, implicating distinct TrkBT1 signaling pathways in these processes. Collectively, our findings redefine TrkBT1 as a functional modulator of nociceptor activity rather than a passive regulator of full-length TrkB. By uncovering its dual roles in nociceptor sensitization and survival, this study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of BDNF/TrkB signaling in pain. Future work evaluating the role of TrkBT1 in sensory biology could offer new perspectives on how this receptor contributes to neuronal function and plasticity during chronic pain conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Bradybaena snails in particular have numerous intriguing traits that make them a good model for studying evolution, including shell pattern polymorphism and convergent evolution. They are also introduced and invasive across the world. In this study, we present a chromosome-level genome assembly of the Asian tramp snail Bradybaena similaris utilizing 88-fold Illumina short-read sequences, 125-fold Nanopore long-read sequences, 63-fold PacBio HiFi sequences, and 47-fold Hi-C sequences. The assembled genome of 2.18 Gb is anchored to 28 chromosomes, and exhibits high completeness (98.8% metazoan BUSCO completeness) and contiguity (N50 of 75.6 Mb). Additionally, we also obtained a high-quality transcriptome for annotation. This resource represents the first chromosome-level assembly for snails in the superfamily Helicoidea, which includes more than 5,000 species of terrestrial snails, and will facilitate genomic study in Bradybaena and, more broadly, in the superfamily Helicoidea.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhile the Helicoidea is the largest land snail superfamily, consisting of more than 5,000 species, many of interest to evolutionary studies, no chromosome-level assembly has been available for any species. Previously, the genus Bradybaena in the Helicoidea has been studied in the context of speciation, adaptation and invasive biology, and thereby has high potential for further research. In this study, we present a chromosome-level assembly and transcriptome of the Asian tramp snail Bradybaena similaris. These high-quality genomic resources will facilitate research on related species, and eventually enhance our understanding of many areas of evolutionary biology.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Previously, we showed that transplantation of cortical interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) opens a robust period of ocular dominance plasticity 33-35 days after transplantation into neonatal host visual cortex. The plasticity can be induced by transplanting either PV or SST MGE-derived cortical interneurons; it requires transplanted interneurons to express the vesicular GABAergic transporter; and it is manifested by changes to the host visual circuit. Here, we show that transplantation of MGE-derived cortical interneurons into the adult host visual cortex also opens a period of ocular dominance plasticity. The transplanted interneurons must be active to induce plasticity, and the neuronal activity and tuning of visually evoked responses in transplanted and host PV and SST interneurons are modulated by the locomotor state of the host. We also show that changes in activity over the period of plasticity induction are different between PV and SST interneurons but similar between host and transplanted interneurons of each type. The present findings demonstrate that the transplant-induced plasticity generated in adult visual cortex has many features in common with the role of these interneurons during the normal, juvenile critical period.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Nevertheless, condensates have been shown to interact with lipid membranes in diverse biological processes, such as autophagy and T-cell activation. Since many condensates are known to have a net surface charge density and associated electric potential(s), we hypothesized that they can induce a local membrane potential. Using an electrochromic dye, we demonstrate that poly-lysine/ATP condensates induce a localized membrane potential in Giant Unilamellar Vesicles. This effect diminishes with increasing salt concentration and higher ATP-to-poly-lysine ratios, underscoring the key role of condensate charge. Numerical modeling of the condensate-membrane interface using an electro-thermodynamic framework supports our experimental findings and highlights parameters expected to play a key role in the effect. These results have broad implications for biological processes regulated by membrane potential, particularly in contexts such as neuronal signaling, where condensate interactions with membranes may play a previously unrecognized regulatory role.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Immunotherapies including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell approaches are under investigation, but high levels of disease heterogeneity remain a major hurdle to achieving durable responses. Targeting of multiple surface antigens may ensure complete immunological coverage of leukemic blast populations, but such antigens are often also present on healthy haematopoietic populations. To address likely aplasia, strategies can be designed to bridge CAR T cell therapies to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), as demonstrated in recent anti-CD7 CAR T cell studies. Here we report that monotherapy using base edited (BE)  universal donor CAR T cells against CD33, CLL-1, or CD7 delivered inhibition of AML in immunodeficient mice when antigen expression was homogenous, but combined use of BE-CAR33 and BE-CARCLL-1 T cells was required to address heterogenous CLL-1-/+CD33-/+ disease. We also demonstrate that removal of shared CD7 antigens enabled compatibility of BE-CAR33 with BE-CAR7 T cells, including in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of AML. Therapeutic strategies envisage  pick and mix applications of base edited universal CAR T cells in combinations determined by patient-specific antigen profiles. Such approaches also offer the possibility of deep, cell-based, de-bulking and preparative conditioning ahead of allo-SCT followed by donor-derived reconstitution.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Recent studies have identified several cell behaviors as triggers, including junctional tension, cell density and geometry, and topological defects. However, how these factors drive stratification throughout the entire epithelium remains poorly understood. Here, we report a mechanism underlying epithelial stratification that mirrors the physics of phase transition. Combining cell culture with three-dimensional vertex modeling, we demonstrate that epithelium stratifies via nucleation-growth process, i.e., multilayer origins dispersedly appear and expand across the epithelium via unordered intermediate states. This process is akin to a phase transition induced by a mechanical instability inherent in the foam-like geometry of the epithelium. Moreover, this concept applies to embryonic skin development and malignant transformation of cancer. These findings conceptualize epithelial stratification as a form of a phase transition governed by nucleation and growth, offering a physical perspective on various epithelial developments.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

This study introduces ContextMirror2.0 (CM2.0), a coevolution-based method designed to address these limitations.

Hippocampal place cells are the neuronal substrate of these cognitive maps. However, while hippocampal allocentric position coding in reference to external landmarks is well characterized, the determinants of idiothetic hippocampal distance coding remain poorly understood. Using virtual reality, electrophysiological recordings in mice, and local cue manipulations we could dissociate distance from position coding. In the cue-poor condition, we found pervasive distance coding with high distance indices in all bidirectional place cells including both superficial and deep CA1 pyramidal cells. In this condition, the mapping of distance onto a low-dimensional manifold and rigid distance relationships between place fields suggested strong attractor dynamics similar to those observed for grid cells. Inactivation of the medial septum (MS), which disrupts grid cells, significantly reduced both distance coding and rigid distance dynamics, suggesting an alteration (but not complete abolition) of the underlying attractor. In contrast, allocentric position coding could be observed in cue-rich environments, predominantly engaged deep CA1 pyramidal cells, and persisted during MS inactivation. These results are consistent with a selective contribution of grid cells and associated rigid attractor dynamics to hippocampal idiothetic distance coding but not allocentric position coding.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Recent experiments have probed these questions by measuring cortical responses to two-photon optogenetic perturbations of single cells in the mouse primary visual cortex. A robust theoretical framework is needed to determine the implications of these responses for cortical recurrence. Here we propose a novel analytical approach: a formulation of the dependence of cell-type-specific connectivity on spatial distance that yields an exact solution for the linear perturbation response of a model with multiple cell types and space- and feature-dependent connectivity. Importantly and unlike previous approaches, the solution is valid in regimes of strong as well as weak intra-cortical coupling. Analysis reveals the structure of connectivity implied by various features of single-cell perturbation responses, such as the surprisingly narrow spatial radius of nearby excitation beyond which inhibition dominates, the number of transitions between mean excitation and inhibition thereafter, and the dependence of these responses on feature preferences. Comparison of these results to existing optogenetic perturbation data yields constraints on cell-type-specific connection strengths and their tuning dependence. Finally, we provide experimental predictions regarding the response of inhibitory neurons to single-cell perturbations and the modulation of perturbation response by neuronal gain; the latter can explain observed differences in the feature-tuning of perturbation responses in the presence vs. absence of visual stimuli.

Significance StatementThe cerebral cortex is strongly re-currently connected with complex wiring rules. This circuitry can now be probed by studying responses to optogenetic perturbations of one or small numbers of cells. However, we currently lack a general theory connecting these responses to underlying circuitry. Here we develop a novel, exactly solvable theory to determine responses to small perturbations from the underlying connectivity. Analysis of these equations reveals simple rules that govern perturbation response patterns. Comparison with experimental data yields new constraints on the connectivity parameters. The theory yields predictions for the responses of unmeasured cell types and in new experimental conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Core genes are traditionally identified by the analysis of amino acid similarities among proteomes, but can also be defined using structures, which bear potential in deep clades beyond the twilight zone of amino acids. Despite breakthroughs in accurate AI-driven protein structure prediction, obtaining full 3D structural models on a proteomic scale is still prohibitively slow. Here, we present Unicore, a novel method for identifying structural core genes at a scale suitable for downstream phylogenetic analysis. By applying the ProstT5 protein language model to the input proteomes to obtain their 3Di structural strings, Unicore saves over three orders of magnitude in runtime compared to a full 3D prediction. Using Foldseek clustering, Unicore identifies single-copy structures universally present in the species and aligns them using Foldmason. These structural core gene alignments are projected back to amino acid information for downstream phylogenetic analysis. We demonstrate that this approach defines core genes with linear run-time scaling over the number of species, up to 56 times faster than OrthoFinder, while reconstructing phylogenetic relationships congruent with conventional approaches.

Treatments with the greatest perceived benefits were identified, which had varied effects on different core symptoms. In addition, treatment responses were significantly correlated (R{superscript 2} = 0.68) between the two patient groups.

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1735682948698

Currently known phage counter-defense systems are specific to (the activity of) the targeted bacterial defense system. Here, we uncover a mechanism by which the T7 bacteriophage broadly counteracts bacterial defenses using protein phosphorylation. We show that the T7 protein kinase (T7K), which was believed to specifically redirect the function of a few host proteins, is in fact a hyper-promiscuous, dual-specificity kinase enacting a massive wave of phosphorylation on virtually all host and phage proteins during infection. The scale of phosphorylation vastly exceeds the number of previously known phosphorylation events in E. coli, has no sequence motif specificity, and results in a higher proteome-wide phosphorylation density than that of mammalian cells which encode [~] 500 kinases. Stoichiometry analysis of phosphorylation sites revealed a strong bias of T7K activity towards nucleic acid-binding substrates, which we show is mediated by its C-terminal DNA-binding domain. This specificity for highly stoichiometric phosphorylation of nucleic acid-binding proteins enables the deactivation of DNA-targeting or - containing bacterial defense systems. We provide mechanistic insight into how T7K weakens two such defense systems, Retron-Eco9 and DarTG1, through specific phosphorylation events, with single phosphomimetic mutations in key sites of the toxins abolishing defense. Finally, by screening a large collection of E. coli strains, we provide evidence of broad counter-defense capacities for T7K in nature, as strains counteracted contain diverse bacterial defense systems.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

However, the biochemical mechanisms underlying these reactive species-mediated labelings, particularly the spatial patterns of labeling methods within the sub-m range, remain poorly understood. Here, we employed DNA nanostructure platforms to precisely measure the labeling radii of TurboID and APEX2 through in vitro assays. Our DNA nanoruler design enables the deployment of oligonucleotide-barcoded labeling targets with nanometer precision near the enzymes. By quantifying labeling yields using quantitative PCR and mapping them against target distances, we uncovered surprising insights into the labeling mechanisms. Contrary to the prevailing diffusive labeling model, our results demonstrate that TurboID primarily operates through contact-dependent labeling. Similarly, APEX2 shows high labeling efficiency within its direct contact range. In parallel, it exhibits a low-level diffusive labeling towards more distant phenols. These findings reframe our understanding in the mechanism of proximity labeling enzymes, at the same time highlight the potential of DNA nanotechnology in spatially profiling reactive species.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Many species are motile, despite having no appendages and a completely rigid cell body. Cells move to seek out nutrients, locate mating partners, and undergo vertical migration. To explore the natural diversity of diatom motility, we perform a comparative study across five common biofilm-forming species. Combining morphological measurements with high-resolution cell tracking, we establish how gliding movements relate to the morphology of the raphe - a specialised slit in the cell wall responsible for motility generation. Our detailed analyses reveal that cells exhibit a rich but species-dependent phenotype, switching stochastically between four stereotyped motility states. We model this behaviour and use stochastic simulations to predict how heterogeneity in microscale navigation patterns leads to differences in long-time diffusivity and dispersal. In a representative species, we extend these findings to quantify diatom gliding in complex, naturalistic 3D environments, suggesting that cells may exploit these distinct motility signatures to achieve niche segregation in nature.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

However, the mechanisms that separate TADs remain incompletely understood. Most boundaries between TADs contain CTCF binding sites (CBSs), which individually contribute to the blocking of Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. Using genome-wide classification, we show here that TAD boundary width forms a continuum from narrow to highly extended and correlates with CBS distribution, chromatin features, and gene regulatory elements. To investigate how these boundary widths emerge, we modified the Random Cross-Linker (RCL) polymer model to incorporate specific boundary configurations, enabling us to evaluate the differential impact of boundary composition on TAD insulation. Our analysis identifies three generic boundary categories, each influencing TAD insulation differently, with varying local and distal effects on neighboring domains. Notably, we find that increasing boundary width reduces long-range inter-TAD contacts, as confirmed by Hi-C data. While blocking loop extrusion at boundaries indirectly promotes spurious intermingling of neighboring TADs, extended boundaries counteract this effect, emphasizing their role in maintaining genome structure. In conclusion, TAD boundary width not only enhances the efficiency of loop extrusion blocking but may also modulate enhancer-promoter contacts over long distances across TADs boundaries, providing a mechanism for transcriptional regulation.

Significance statementTopologically Associating Domains (TADs) compartmentalize vertebrate genomes to limit cross-domain enhancer-promoter loops. Our study reveals that boundaries between TADs are diverse genomic entities that range from narrow to highly extended. Using an interdisciplinary approach that combines genome-wide data analysis with biophysical polymer modeling, we find that wider TAD boundaries reduce spurious long-range interactions between neighboring domains. Moreover, we reveal how different boundary components can create this difference in insulating capacity. Our identification and characterization of TAD boundary width and composition suggests they have the potential to regulate the formation of enhancer-promoter loops across TAD boundaries at close and long distance.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Here, we take advantage of 71 new SAR11 genomes from strains we isolated from the tropical Pacific Ocean to evaluate the distribution of metabolic traits across the Pelagibacteraceae, a recently classified family within the order Pelagibacterales encompassing subgroups Ia and Ib. Our analyses of metagenomes generated from stations where the strains were isolated reveals distinct habitat preferences across SAR11 genera for coastal or offshore environments, and subtle but systematic differences in metabolic potential that support these observations. We also observe higher levels of selective forces acting on habitat-specific metabolic genes linked to SAR11 fitness and polyphyletic distributions of habitat preferences and metabolic traits across SAR11 genera, suggesting that contrasting lifestyles have emerged across multiple lineages independently. Together, these insights reveal niche-partitioning within sympatric and parapatric populations of SAR11 and demonstrate that the immense genomic diversity of SAR11 bacteria naturally segregates into ecologically and genetically cohesive units, or ecotypes, that vary in spatial distributions in the tropical Pacific.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1735682948698

Mixotrophy in ciliates is commonplace, but has been investigated at a cellular and molecular level almost entirely in one organism, Paramecium bursaria. Reliance on just one model system makes it difficult to know which cell biological aspects of this system represent general features of ciliate mixotrophy versus accidental features of the specific organism. Here we describe the cell biology and genome of the giant heterotrichous ciliate Stentor pyriformis. We show that this giant unicellular organism contains Chlorella variabilis as its endosymbiont, that the Chlorella can live freely outside the host, that within the host the Chlorella cells are docked near the cell surface, surrounded by microtubule ""baskets"", and that the photosynthetic efficiency of the Chlorella is reduced inside the Stentor cell compared to when it is free-living outside the host, with photon energy instead being shunted to non-photochemical quenching. Compared to the non-mixotrophic Stentor coeruleus, S. pyriformis has several distinct cellular features that may be related to endosymbiosis: the presence of microtubule baskets, which are absent in S. coeruleus; positive rather than negative phototaxis, which is likely an adaptation to allow the photosynthetic symbionts access to sufficient light; and a lack of pigment in the host cell, which may be an adaptation to tolerate high light levels. Compared to P. bursaria, S. pyriformis has several similar cellular features: in both organisms, the symbiont is a strain of Chlorella variabilis; the Chlorella endosymbiont retains the ability to live freely when separated from the host; and the algal symbionts contained in perialgal vesicles are docked at the cell surface. One potentially informative difference between P. bursaria and S. pyriformis is that S. pyriformis employs a standard genetic code, similar to other Stentor species but different from most other ciliates, including P. bursaria, which use a non-standard code in which one or more stop-codons are respecified to encode amino acids. This difference in genetic code could serve as a barrier to impede gene transfer from symbiont to host in other ciliates, but this would not be a factor in S. pyriformis. A second cell biological difference is that whereas P. bursaria performs phototaxis by a kinetic accumulation mechanism, in which swimming is non-directional but cells slow down in regions of higher light intensity, S. pyriformis performs directed swimming towards the direction of high light intensity. However, as in P. bursaria, phototaxis in S. pyriformis requires the presence of the Chlorella, implying a potential flow of information from the symbiont to direct the orientation and swimming of the host cell. We propose that S. pyriformis will serve as a useful model system for studying the evolution of mixotrophy and endosymbiosis, with unique advantages in terms of size and regenerative ability as well as distinct cellular and genomic features compared with other mixotrophic ciliate models.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

While case studies suggest that population history can also affect specific structures of languages, such as patterns in their sound systems and grammars, results are conflicting, and it remains unknown whether such effects hold globally. Here we show that, adjusting for geography, phylogeny, and environment, genetic diversity is inversely correlated with diversity in linguistic structures. Low genetic diversity (i.e. excess homozygosity) results from relative isolation, and this promotes diversification in language. High genetic diversity results from contact and migration, and this promotes homogenization in language. These effects are particularly pronounced in Asia and, under some conditions, also in a few other areas, suggesting sociocultural factors contributing to differences in how strongly isolation favors linguistic diversity and how strongly contact promotes linguistic homogenization. Our results suggest that present-day hotspots of linguistic diversity, which are characterized by relative isolation, may provide a privileged window on the dynamics of linguistic evolution as they are less affected by the vast demographic expansions, migrations, and extinctions that characterize the Neolithic age.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Could the distinct properties of human cortical neurons help explain the superior cognitive capabilities of humans? Understanding this relationship requires a metric to quantify how neuronal properties contribute to the functional complexity of single neurons, yet no such standardized measure currently exists. Here, we propose the Functional Complexity Index (FCI), a generalized, deep learning-based framework to assess the input-output complexity of neurons. By comparing the FCI of cortical pyramidal neurons from different layers in rats and humans, we identified key morpho-electrical factors that underlie functional complexity. Human cortical pyramidal neurons were found to be significantly more functionally complex than their rat counterparts, primarily due to differences in dendritic membrane area and branching pattern, as well as density and nonlinearity of NMDA-mediated synaptic receptors. These findings reveal the structural-biophysical basis for the enhanced functional properties of human neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

In this work, we introduce Accessible Chromatin by Cytosine Editing Site Sequencing with ATAC-seq (ACCESS-ATAC), which harnesses a double-stranded DNA cytosine deaminase (Ddd) enzyme to stencil TF binding locations within accessible chromatin regions. We optimize bulk and single-cell ACCESS-ATAC protocols and develop computational methods to show that the increased resolution compared with ATAC-seq improves the accuracy of TF binding site prediction. We use ACCESS-ATAC to perform genome-wide allelic occupancy and co-occupancy imputation for 64 TFs each in HepG2 and K562, revealing that the propensity of a majority of TFs to co-occupy nearby motifs oscillates with a period approximating the helical turn of DNA. Altogether, ACCESS-ATAC expands the resolution and capabilities of bulk and single-cell epigenomic profiling.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Here, we present pipemake, a computational platform designed to streamline the development and implementation of efficient and reproducible Snakemake workflows. pipemake creates modular pipelines that can be seamlessly integrated or removed from the platform without requiring reconfiguration of the core system, enabling flexible adaptation of workflows to different analytical needs across diverse fields. To demonstrate the platforms capabilities, we created and implemented pipelines to reanalyze two distinct biological datasets. First, we recreated a population genomics analysis of the socially flexible halictid bee, Lasioglossum albipes, using pipemake-generated workflows for de novo genome annotation, processing of variant data, dimensionality reduction, and a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We then used pipemake to analyze behavioral tracking data from the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. In both cases, pipemake workflows produced results consistent with published findings while substantially reducing hands-on analysis time. Overall, pipemakes modular design allows researchers to easily modify existing pipelines or develop new ones without software development expertise. Beyond streamlining workflow creation, pipemake leverages the full Snakemake ecosystem to enable parallel processing, automated error recovery, and comprehensive analysis documentation. These features make pipemake an efficient and accessible solution for analyzing complex biological datasets. pipemake is freely available as a conda package or direct download at https://github.com/kocherlab/pipemake","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

However, pathogen effectors can evolve to avoid immune recognition, resulting in devastating diseases that threaten global agriculture. Here, we show that an integrated Exo70 domain from the barley NLR RGH2 can interact with both the rice blast pathogen effector AVR-Pii and a closely related wheat blast variant. We used structure-led engineering to develop RGH2+ that shows increased binding affinity towards AVR-Pii variants and increased cell death responses on heterologous expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. Infection assays in transgenic barley lines harbouring RGH2+ (along with the paired NLR RGH3) show reduced virulence towards blast strains expressing AVR-Pii variants. These results demonstrate the potential of engineering NLR receptors as an effective strategy for improving resistance towards one of the most destructive diseases affecting cereal production.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

To resolve the most complex repeats, this project relied on the semi-manual combination of long, accurate PacBio HiFi and ultra-long Oxford Nanopore sequencing reads. The Verkko assembler later automated this process, achieving complete assemblies for approximately half of the chromosomes in a diploid human genome. However, the first version of Verkko was computationally expensive and could not resolve all regions of a typical human genome. Here we present Verkko2, which implements a more efficient read correction algorithm, improves repeat resolution and gap closing, introduces proximity-ligation-based haplotype phasing and scaffolding, and adds support for multiple long-read data types. These enhancements allow Verkko to assemble all regions of a diploid human genome, including the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes and both sex chromosomes. Together, these changes increase the number of telomere-to-telomere scaffolds by twofold, reduce runtime by fourfold, and improve assembly correctness. On a panel of 19 human genomes, Verkko2 assembles an average of 39 of 46 complete chromosomes as scaffolds, with 21 of these assembled as gapless contigs.

However, no current computational model explains V4 responses under natural conditions. To address this, we developed a new hierarchical convolutional energy (HCE) model reflecting computations thought to occur in areas V1, V2, and V4, but which consists entirely of simple- and complex-like units like those found in V1. In contrast to prior models, the HCE model is trained end-to-end on neurophysiology data, without relying on pre-trained network features. We recorded 313 V4 neurons during full-color nature video stimulation and fit the HCE model to each neuron. The model's predicted optimal patterns (POPs) revealed complex spatiotemporal pattern selectivity in V4, supporting its role in representing space, time, and color. These findings indicate that area V4 is crucial for image segmentation and grouping operations that are essential for complex vision. Thus, responses of V4 neurons under naturalistic conditions can be explained by a hierarchical three-stage model where each stage consists entirely of units like those found in area V1.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

In an OPM, the sample space is mapped to a distortion free image space via remote focusing, and the oblique light-sheet plane is mapped via a tilted tertiary imaging system onto a camera. As a result, the 3D point-spread function and optical transfer function are tilted to the optical axis of the tertiary imaging system. To satisfy Nyquist sampling, small scanning steps are required to encompass the tilted 3D OTF, slowing down acquisition and increasing sample exposure. Here we show that a judicious amount of under-sampling can lead to a form of aliasing in OPM that can be recovered without a loss of spatial resolution or introducing artifacts. The resulting speed gain depends on the optical parameters of the system and can reach 2-4-fold in our demonstrations. We leverage this speed gain for rapid subcellular 3D imaging of mitochondrial dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

However, bacteria in nature experience flowing environments that are nutrient limited. Using microfluidics and single cell imaging, we discover that flow promotes growth of the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa at surprisingly low nutrient concentrations. In static environments, cells require high nutrient concentrations as they steadily consume non-renewable resources. In flowing environments, cells grow robustly at very low nutrient concentrations that are constantly replenished. Our simulation-guided experiments show how stopping flow halts growth within minutes and varying flow impacts growth gradients across bacterial populations. By precisely delivering nutrients using microfluidics, we learned that cells in flow can grow on glucose concentrations 1,000 times lower than those observed in typical laboratory experiments. The ultralow glucose concentrations sufficient for growth in flow closely align with the affinity of bacterial glucose transporters, suggesting that bacteria have evolved in flowing environments with scarce nutrients. Collectively, our results emphasize the limits of traditional culturing approaches and highlight how depleted environments can unexpectedly support bacterial growth.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Cells may prevent deleterious RNA-RNA interactions by genome organization to avoid complementarity however, RNA viruses generate long, perfectly complementary antisense RNA during replication. How do viral RNAs avoid irreversible entanglement? One possibility is RNA sequestration into biomolecular condensates. To test this, we reconstituted critical SARS-CoV-2 RNA-RNA interactions in Nucleocapsid condensates. We observed that RNAs with low propensity RNA-RNA interactions resulted in more round, liquid-like condensates while those with high sequence complementarity resulted in more heterogeneous networked morphology independent of RNA structure stability. Residue-resolution molecular simulations and direct sequencing-based detection of RNA-RNA interactions support that these properties arise from degree of trans RNA contacts. We propose that extensive RNA-RNA interactions in cell and viral replication are controlled via a combination of genome organization, timing, RNA sequence content, RNA production ratios, and emergent biomolecular condensate material properties.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

However, an increased incidence of severe dengue and fatalities are seen in females of the reproductive age. As per vaginal (PV) bleeding is an important complication that has not been well characterized, we sought to determine the frequency, complications and disease outcomes in women who develop PV bleeding.

Methodology/Principal findings288 adult female patients were recruited from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Sri Lanka. All clinical features and laboratory investigations were recorded throughout the duration of hospital admission along with treatment received.

28/288 (9.72%) reported PV bleeding, with 12/28 (42.85%) developing dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) compared to 65/260 (25%) of those who did not have bleeding.

Women who developed PV bleeding were more likely to have developed DHF (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.1, p=0.06), abdominal pain (OR=2.17, 95% CI = 0.99 to 4.69, p = 0.06), vomiting (OR= 2.0, 95% CI= 0.89 to 4.44, p= 0.10), diarhoea (OR= 4.35, 95% CI = 1.908 to 9.610, p= 0.0004) or evidence of any fluid leakage (OR= 1.98, 95% CI = 0.91 to 4.5, p = 0.11).

ConclusionsPV bleeding appears to associate with worse disease outcomes. The possible contribution of PV bleeding to higher incidence of severe dengue and fatality rates observed in many countries, should be further investigated.

While contemporary research has somewhat advanced our understanding of DMT, and psychedelics more broadly, there is little research that integrates time-resolved measures of subjective experience with temporally fine-grained brain imaging. We therefore present the current study, a repeated-measures dose-dependent study of the subjective and neural dynamics induced through DMT under naturalistic conditions. Nineteen participants received either a 20mg or 40mg dose of freebase DMT across two dosing sessions in a blinded, counterbalanced order, with blinding rates consistent across doses. Electroencephalography (EEG) data was collected, as well as time-resolved retrospective measures of subjective experience (Temporal Experience Tracing). Both doses of DMT induced rapid changes in experience dimensions. However, the 40mg dose induced significantly more extreme visual hallucinations and emotionally intense experiences. Further, we computed a variety of neural markers on the EEG data, and found that oscillatory alpha power and permutation entropy were most strongly associated with continuous subjective experience dimensions. Strikingly, lempel-ziv complexity, a previously hailed as a robust correlate of subjective experiences within the psychedelic-state, was the least strongly associated neural marker. These findings provide an important insight into how distinct neural dynamics may contribute to this radical and intense altered state of consciousness.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

A total of 1,017 female mosquitoes (81.4%, N=1,249) intercepted on nets suspended from helium balloons at altitudes of 120-290 m above ground over Mali and Ghana were screened for infection with arboviruses, plasmodia, and filariae, using pan-genus qPCR analyses followed by sequencing of positive samples. The mosquito fauna collected at altitude comprised 61 species, across 9 genera, dominated by Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles. Infection and infectiousness rates of high-altitude migrant mosquitoes were 7.2% and 4.4% with plasmodia, 1.6% and 0.6% with filariae, 3.5% and 1.1% with flaviviruses, respectively.

Confirmed head-thorax (disseminated) infections of multiple pathogens in multiple mosquito species, eg., Culex perexiguus, Coquilletidia metallica, Mansonia uniformis, and Anopheles squamosus provides evidence that pathogens carried by high-altitude windborne mosquitoes are infectious and likely capable of infecting naive hosts far from their starting location. This traffic of sylvatic pathogens may be key to their maintenance among foci as well as initiating outbreaks away from them.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Gastruloids, self-organizing stem cell-based models of post-implantation mammalian development, provide a powerful platform to address this question. Here, we show that physical parameters, particularly system size, critically influence the timing and outcomes of morphogenetic processes. Larger gastruloids exhibit delayed symmetry breaking, increased multipolarity, and prolonged axial elongation, with morphogenesis driven by system size. Despite these variations, transcriptional programs and cell fate composition remain remarkably stable across a broad size range. Notably, extreme sizes show distinct transcriptional modules and clear shifts in gene expression patterns. Intriguingly, size perturbation experiments rescued the morphogenetic and pattern phenotypes observed in extreme sizes, demonstrating the remarkable adaptability of gastruloids to their effective system size. These findings establish gastruloids as versatile models for studying spatiotemporal dynamics in mammalian embryogenesis and reveal how physical constraints decouple transcriptional from morphogenetic programs.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

First, we found that the intrinsic bend direction of DNA sequences correlated with the observed bending in known protein-DNA complex structures, suggesting that many proteins co-evolved with their DNA partners to capture DNA in its intrinsically preferred bent conformation. We then applied our model to large-scale yeast population genetics data and showed that centromere DNA element II, whose consensus sequence is unknown, leaving its sequence-specific role unclear, is under mechanical selection to increase the stability of inner-kinetochore structure and to facilitate centromeric histone recruitment. Finally, in silico evolution under strong mechanical selection discovered hallucinated sequences with cyclizability values so extreme that they required experimental validation, yet, found in nature in the densely packed mitochondrial(mt) DNA of Namystynia karyoxenos, an ocean-dwelling protist with extreme mitochondrial gene fragmentation. The need to transmit an extraordinarily large amount of mtDNA, estimated to be > 600 Mb, in combination with the absence of mtDNA compaction proteins may have pushed mechanical selection to the extreme. Similarly extreme DNA mechanics are observed in bird microchromosomes, although the functional consequence is not yet clear. The discovery of eccentric DNA mechanics in unrelated unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes suggests that we can predict extreme natural biology which can arise through strong selection. Our methods offer a way to study the biological functions of DNA mechanics in any genome and to engineer DNA sequences with desired mechanical properties.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Here, we demonstrate in vitro and in Drosophila cells that the mitotic kinase POLO phosphorylates PP187B at a conserved residue (T286) within a pocket implicated in the recognition of RVxF-containing target proteins. Phosphorylation of T286 inhibits PP187B binding to the RVxF motif of the SAC kinase MPS1, dampening the dephosphorylation of MPS1 T-loop. Phosphorylation of T286 is dynamically regulated during mitosis. It occurs at unattached/tensionless kinetochores and decreases as chromosomes congress. Expression of phosphomimetic PP187BT286D prevents MPS1 inactivation in metaphase and causes a SAC-dependent delay of anaphase onset. Conversely, an unphosphorylatable PP187BT286A mutant impairs MPS1 activation at unattached kinetochores and weakens the SAC. In vivo, larval neuroblasts expressing PP187BT286 phosphomutants exhibit frequent chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy. Thus, our findings identify POLO-mediated phosphorylation of PP187B as a critical regulatory strategy that fine-tunes phosphatase activity to ensure a robust and timely SAC and prevent genome instability.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Moreover, profiling TMAs allows efficient screening of tissue samples for translational and clinical applications. Multiplexed imaging technologies allow for spatial profiling of proteins at single cell resolution, providing insights into tumour microenvironments (TMEs) and disease mechanisms. High-plex spatial single cell protein profiling is a powerful tool for biomarker discovery and translational cancer research, however, there remain limited options for end-to-end computational analysis of this type of data. Here, we introduce PRISM, a Python package for interactive, end-to-end analyses of TMAs with a focus on translational and clinical research using multiplexed proteomic data from the CODEX, Phenocycler Fusion (Akoya Biosciences), Comet (Lunaphore), MACSima (Miltenyi Biotec), CosMx and Cellscape (Bruker Spatial Biology) platforms. PRISM leverages the SpatialData framework to standardise data storage and ensure interoperability with single cell and spatial analysis tools. It consists of two main components: TMA Image Analysis for marker-based tissue masking, TMA dearraying, cell segmentation, and single cell feature extraction; and AnnData Analysis for quality control, clustering, iterative cell-type annotation, and spatial analysis. Integrated as a plugin within napari, PRISM provides an intuitive and purely interactive graphical interface for real-time and human-in-the-loop analyses. PRISM supports efficient multi-resolution image processing and accelerates bioinformatics workflows using efficient scalable data structures, parallelisation and GPU acceleration. By combining modular flexibility, computational efficiency, and a completely interactive interface, PRISM simplifies the translation of raw multiplexed images to actionable clinical insights, empowering researchers to explore and interact effectively with spatial omics data.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Upon autophagy induction, a unique double-membraned structure, called a phagophore, forms and expands into a cup shape to engulf these cytosolic substrates. ATG8 proteins are covalently conjugated to autophagic membranes by lipidation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and are thought to localise on both sides of the phagophore membrane. ATG8 conjugated on the inner membrane of the phagophore recruits autophagy cargo receptors, such as p62. To recapitulate events on the inner membrane, we used giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as a model membrane and encapsulated proteins of interest inside GUVs, thus generating a membrane platform to which ATG8 proteins could be localised on the inner leaflet of the vesicles. We reconstituted WIPI2b-directed and cargo-directed ATG8 lipidation inside the GUVs and revealed distinct roles of WIPI2b and p62 in initiating the ATG conjugation cascade. Furthermore, we showed that p62 or p62 droplets were recruited to the inner membrane of the GUVs though interaction with membrane-bound ATG8s. Using a bead-based membrane expansion assay, we demonstrated a redistribution and local enrichment of membrane-bound ATG8s across the membrane upon interaction with p62 and p62 droplets. Our study provides novel model systems to investigate the interactions on the inner membrane of the phagophore and reveals fundamental molecular insights into phagophore membrane bending. This process is directed by ATG8-cargo interaction, during which cargo receptors concentrate ATG8 proteins on the inner surface of the phagophore membrane.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948698

Neurological symptoms include anxiety, depression and impaired short-term memory. However, the exact underlying mechanisms of long Covid are not yet decrypted. Using the golden hamster as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persist in the central nervous system, as we found viral RNA and replicative virus in the brainstem after 80 days of infection. Infected hamsters presented a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, with overexpression of innate immunity genes, impacted dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, altered energy metabolism. Finally, the infected hamsters manifested persistent signs of depression and impaired short-term memory, as well as late-onset signs of anxiety, as a valuable model to study long Covid. Conclusively, we provide evidence that virus-related and neurodegenerative and immunometabolic mechanisms coexist in the brainstem of infected hamsters and contribute to the manifestation of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.

Although these methods are conceptually similar, we show by analyzing association studies of 209 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank that they systematically prioritize different genes. This raises the question of how genes should ideally be prioritized. We propose two prioritization criteria: 1) trait importance -- how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and 2) trait specificity -- a genes importance for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, while burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, while burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation. Our results illustrate that burden tests and GWAS reveal different aspects of trait biology and suggest ways to improve their interpretation and usage.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948699

From the first COVID-19 case detected through March 25, 2022, 66,684 of 196,652 residents of Californias state prison system were infected, most of them in two large winter waves of outbreaks that reached all 35 of the state prisons. We used individual-level data on disease timing and nightly room assignments in these prisons to reconstruct locations and pathways of transmission statistically, and from that estimated reproduction numbers, locations of unobserved infection events, and the subsequent magnitude and distribution of long COVID prevalence. Where earlier work has recommended smaller cells over large dormitory housing to reduce transmission, recommended use of cells with solid doors over those with bars only, and cautioned against reliance on solid doors (e.g., in cold months when HVAC systems can circulate aerosols), we found evidence of substantial transmission in both dorms and cells regardless of the door and season. Effective reproduction numbers were found to range largely between 0 and 5, in both cells and dorms of all door types. Our estimates of excess case rates suggest that as a result of disparities in incarceration, prison outbreaks contributed to disproportionate disease burden on Black and Indigenous people in California. We estimated that 9,100-11,000 people have developed long COVID as a result of infection in these prison outbreaks, 1,700-2,000 of them with disabling consequences, and that this burden is disproportionately on Black and Indigenous people in comparison to the state as a whole. We urge high-quality medical care for prison residents affected by long COVID, and decarceration to reduce the risk of future outbreaks of both COVID-19 and other diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1735682948699

They infect and cause disease in humans, animals and plants but also play crucial roles in the ecology of microbial communities. Tolerance to genetic change, high-mutation rates, adaptations to hosts and immune escape has driven high divergence of viral genes, hampering their functional annotation and phylogenetic inference. The protein structure is more conserved than sequence and can be used for searches of distant homologs and evolutionary analysis of divergent proteins. Structures of viral proteins are traditionally underrepresented in public databases, but recent advances in protein structure prediction allows us to address this issue. Combining two state-of-the-art approaches, AlphaFold2-ColabFold and ESMFold, we predicted models for 85,000 proteins from 4,400 human and animal viruses, expanding the structural coverage for viral proteins by 30 times compared to experimental structures. We also performed structural and network analyses of the models to demonstrate their utility for functional annotation and inference of distant phylogenetic relationships. Taking this approach, we examined the deep evolutionary history of viral class-I fusion glycoproteins, gaining insights on the origins of coronavirus spike protein. To enable further discoveries, we have created Viro3D (https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/), a virus species-centred protein structure database. It allows users to search, browse and download protein models from a virus of interest and explore similar structures present in other virus species. This resource will facilitate fundamental molecular virology, investigation of virus evolution, and may enable structure-informed design of therapies and vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1735682948699

The result is a genomic network that describes the conditionally independent genetic associations between traits that remain when controlling for shared signal with the broader network of traits. Graph theory metrics provide added insight by formally quantifying the most important traits in the genomic network.

Mormon Fritillary butterflies (Speyeria mormonia) exhibit a striking wing color polymorphism throughout their range: typical morphs bear silver spots on their ventral surfaces, and can co-occur with unsilvered morphs displaying a dull coloration1. Through genome-wide association studies in two polymorphic populations, we fine-map this difference in silvering to the 3 region of the transcription factor gene optix. The expression of optix is confined to the unsilvered regions that surround the spots, and these patterns are transformed to a silver identity upon optix RNAi knockdown, implicating optix as a repressor of silver scales in this butterfly. We show that the unsilvered optix haplotype shows signatures of recent selective sweeps, and that this allele is shared with the monomorphic, unsilvered species Speyeria hydaspe, suggesting that introgressions facilitate the exchange of variants of adaptive potential across species. Remarkably, these findings parallel the role of introgressions and cis-regulatory modulation of optix in shaping the aposematic red patterns of Heliconius butterflies2-7, a lineage that separated from Speyeria 45 million years ago8. The genetic basis of adaptive variation can thus be more predictable than often presumed, even for traits that appear divergent across large evolutionary distances.

However, effectively controlling these models to generate novel sequences with desired functions remains a major challenge. Here, we show that Evo, a 7-billion parameter genomic language model, can perform function-guided design that generalizes beyond natural sequences. By learning semantic relationships across multiple genes, Evo enables a genomic ""autocomplete"" in which a DNA prompt encoding a desired function instructs the model to generate novel DNA sequences that can be mined for similar functions. We term this process ""semantic mining,"" which, unlike traditional genome mining, can access a sequence landscape unconstrained by discovered evolutionary innovation. We validate this approach by experimentally testing the activity of generated anti-CRISPR proteins and toxin-antitoxin systems, including de novo genes with no significant homology to any natural protein. Strikingly, in-context protein design with Evo achieves potent activity and high experimental success rates even in the absence of structural hypotheses, known evolutionary conservation, or task-specific fine-tuning. We then use Evo to autocomplete millions of prompts to produce SynGenome, a first-of-its-kind database containing over 120 billion base pairs of AI-generated genomic sequences that enables semantic mining across many possible functions.
