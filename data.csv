Studies of neural circuit evolution often focus on a few elements within a network. However, addressing fundamental questions in evolutionary neuroscience, such as whether some elements are more evolvable than others, requires a more global and unbiased approach. Here, we used synapse-level comparative connectomics to examine how an entire olfactory circuit evolves. We compared the full antennal lobe connectome of the larvae of two closely related Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. erecta, which differ in their ecological niches and odour-driven behaviours. We found that evolutionary change is unevenly distributed across the network. Some features, including neuron types, neuron numbers and interneuron-to-interneuron connectivity, are highly conserved. These conserved elements delineate a core circuit blueprint presumably required for fundamental olfactory processing. Superimposed on this scaffold, we find rewiring changes that mirror each species ecologies, including a systematic shift in the excitation-to-inhibition balance in the feedforward pathways. We further show that some neurons have changed more than others, and that even within individual neurons some synaptic elements remain conserved while others display major species-specific changes, suggesting evolutionary hot-spots within the circuit. Our findings reveal constrained and adaptable elements within olfactory networks, and establish a framework for identifying general principles in the evolution of neural circuits underlying behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188639

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1749766188639

Mathematical models of spreading have been developed leading to several established methods of inferring whether information spreads via social or individual learning. Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) has emerged as a leading frequentist framework for inferring and quantifying social transmission, particularly in non-human animal populations. NBDA has been extended several times to account for multiple diffusions, multiple networks, individual-level variables, and complex transmission functions. Bayesian implementations of NBDA were introduced in two prior studies. However, there is not yet a user-friendly package to implement a Bayesian NBDA, and the approach has seen limited usage by other researchers. Here, we present a unified framework for performing Bayesian analysis of social transmission using NBDA-type models, implemented in the widely used Stan programming language. We provide a user-friendly R package ""STbayes"" (ST: social transmission) for other researchers to easily use this framework. STbayes accepts user-formatted data, but can also import data directly from the existing NBDA R package. Based on the data users provide, STbayes automatically generates multi-network, multi-diffusion models that allow for individual covariates that may influence transmission, as well as individual-level varying (random) effects for any parameter. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that this model can accurately differentiate the relative contribution of individual and social learning in the spread of information through networked populations. We illustrate how incorporating upstream uncertainty about the relationships between individuals in the social group can improve model fit. We show that our framework can be used to infer complex transmission rules and describe a new parameterization of frequency-dependent transmission that is more numerically stable than prior parameterizations. Finally, we introduce support for dynamic transmission weights and a ""high-resolution"" data mode, which allows users to make use of fine-scale data collected by contemporary automated tracking methods. These extensions increase the set of contexts that this type of model may be used for.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

Chronic active white matter lesions (CAL), identifiable radio-logically as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), indicate progression-relevant chronic neuroinflammation. Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1) and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells. Despite B-cell depletion, PRL-associated neuroinflammation, driven by myeloid activation and CD8+ T-cell cy-totoxicity, persisted. Serum and CSF proteomic networks showed PRL-pertinent signatures, including net-works unaffected by B-cell depletion. Using in silico perturbation, we nominated therapeutic targets, including MYD88, TNF, MYC, TYK2, JAK2, and BTK, for alleviating chronic neuroinflammation in MS.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1749766188640

Here we uncover an unprecedented mechanism of RNA-guided gene activation involving the coordinated action of {sigma}E factor in complex with nuclease-dead Cas12f (dCas12f). We screened a large set of genetically-linked dCas12f and {sigma}E homologs in E. coli using RIP-seq and ChIP-seq experiments, revealing systems that exhibited robust guide RNA enrichment and DNA target binding with a minimal 5'-G target-adjacent motif (TAM). Recruitment of {sigma}E was dependent on dCas12f and guide RNA (gRNA), suggesting direct protein-protein interactions, and co-expression experiments demonstrated that the dCas12f-gRNA-{sigma}E ternary complex was competent for programmable recruitment of the RNAP holoenzyme. Remarkably, dCas12f-RNA-{sigma}E complexes drove potent gene expression in the absence of any requisite promoter motifs, with de novo transcription start sites defined exclusively by the relative distance from the dCas12f-mediated R-loop.

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract.

Common wisdom holds that G should respond to drift only as a scaled reduction. In contrast, I find that drift causes drastic and predictable shifts in the orientation of G by driving genetic correlations to their extremes. Biologically, this is a consequence of linkage build-up introduced by drift. I compare these theoretical results to empirical observations based on experiments conducted by Phillips et. al. (2001). Additionally, to derive the model of G-matrix evolution, I developed a novel synthetic framework for modelling ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations carrying multivariate traits. By striking a balance between genetic detail and analytical tractability, and by minimizing requisite technical background, this framework is optimized for deriving new models across a wide range of topics in population biology. Foundations of the framework are formalized by the theory of measure-valued processes, but application of the framework only requires multivariate calculus, and heuristics are presented in the main text for making additional calculations involving stochastic processes. Collectively, this work establishes a powerful framework enabling efficient formal analysis of integrated population processes across evolution and ecology, and its potential for making new discoveries is illustrated by novel findings on fundamental aspects of G-matrix evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

Although dietary tryptophan is associated with various health benefits, excessive intake can result in adverse physiological effects. The specific tryptophan-derived metabolites responsible for such toxicity, however, remain incompletely characterized. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying tryptophan-induced toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We observe that tryptophan concentrations of 1 mM or higher are highly toxic to C. elegans, blocking egg hatching. Notably, supplementation with various sugars alleviates this toxicity. Genetic analyses reveal that host tryptophan metabolism is dispensable for the observed effects. Instead, bacterial metabolism, particularly the conversion of tryptophan to indole, is essential for mediating toxicity. Bacterial strains deficient in indole production abolished tryptophan-induced toxicity, and all sugars that conferred protection also suppressed bacterial indole synthesis. These findings demonstrate that tryptophan toxicity in C. elegans is primarily mediated by microbial metabolism and underscore the pivotal role of host-microbiota interactions in shaping the physiological consequences of dietary amino acid intake.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

Inspired by in silico antimicrobial activity prediction, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of Av2 in vitro. Furthermore, its role in V. dahliae virulence was assessed through microbiota sequencing of inoculated plants, microbial co-cultivation assays, and inoculations in a gnotobiotic plant cultivation system. We show that Av2 inhibits bacterial growth, and acts as a virulence factor during host colonization. Microbiota sequencing revealed involvement of Av2 in suppression of Pseudomonas spp. recruitment upon plant inoculation with V. dahliae, suggesting that Av2 suppresses the cry for help. We show that several Pseudomonas spp. are antagonistic to V. dahliae and sensitive to Av2 treatment.

The core challenge lies in balancing quality and scalability. Manual curation delivers high quality, reliable annotations but is time-intensive and non-scalable; automated approaches, including those based on natural language processing, can scale but often fall short in accuracy and completeness. This tradeoff is particularly severe in public datasets, where metadata is frequently distributed across multiple sources for a single dataset. A notable example includes multi-omics datasets available on GEO and similar public repositories, which are often accompanied by associated publications. These supplementary sources can be leveraged to substantially enhance metadata quality, thereby supporting downstream applications such as classifier model development or the identification of biologically relevant cohorts, etc. We present a first-in-class multi-agent AI system that bridges the gap, achieving both high quality and scalability in metadata curation. Built on large-language models (LLMs), our system orchestrates a set of specialized agents that collaboratively extract, normalize, and infer critical metadata fields such as tissue, disease, cell line, sampling site, demographics, and experimental context from GEO entries, associated publications. A central orchestrator agent delegates tasks such as data retrieval, document parsing, ontology mapping, and context inference to expert sub-agents, enabling scalable, end-to-end automation. Applied to GEO data sets, a notoriously difficult metadata domain, our system achieves a 93% recall on average across 23 key fields (all original terms, normalized terms, and corresponding ontology ids) that include information about disease, tissue, treatment, donor-related information, outperforming existing automated baselines and approaches expert level quality. We also present a system that can easily scale to curate hundreds of metadata fields of interest with similar precision. This work demonstrates that an LLM-based multi-agent architecture can overcome traditional trade-offs in metadata curation, enabling both precision and scale, and offers a promising path forward for curating large public biomedical repositories for downstream AI applications.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

While morphogen gradients pattern tissues, how cells respond to dynamic morphogens remains unclear. Here, we investigate how dorsal patterning in the Drosophila embryo is specified by a rapidly evolving BMP gradient. Using a live reporter of BMP pathway activity and nascent transcription reporters, we find that gene expression is best predicted by time integration of BMP signaling, rather than instantaneous levels. However, in sog mutant embryos with broad BMP activity, integration alone fails to predict gene expression outside the normal domain. We show that the transcription factor Zen lowers the signaling threshold required for activation, enabling integration to drive rapid transcriptional responses even at low BMP levels. Together, these results suggest that cells interpret dynamic morphogen signals through the combined action of temporal integration and spatial competence, providing a framework for robust pattern formation on fast developmental timescales.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

Here, we demonstrate that SALL4, a transcription factor strongly expressed in cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) and associated with syndromes featuring craniofacial anomalies, plays a critical role in this early regulatory process. Using a SALL4-haploinsufficient human iPSC model that recapitulates clinical haploinsufficiency, we show that the SALL4A isoform directly interacts with the BAF complex subunit DPF2 through its zinc-finger-3 domain. This interaction enables SALL4-mediated recruitment of BAF to CNCC-specific enhancers during early neural plate stages. Without functional SALL4, BAF fails to load at chromatin, leaving CNCC enhancers inaccessible despite normal neuroectodermal progression. Consequently, cells cannot undergo proper CNCC induction and specification due to persistent enhancer repression. Our findings reveal SALL4 as an essential regulator of BAF-dependent enhancer activation during early neural crest development, providing molecular insights into SALL4-associated craniofacial anomalies.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

In bacteria, diverse clades of repurposed TnpB and CRISPR-associated proteins repress gene expression by blocking transcription initiation or elongation, enabling non-canonical modes of regulatory control and adaptive immunity(1,6,7). Intriguingly, a distinct class of nuclease-dead Cas12f homologs (dCas12f) instead activates gene expression through its association with unique extracytoplasmic function sigma factors ({sigma}E)(8), though the molecular basis has remained elusive. Here we reveal a novel mode of RNA-guided transcription initiation by determining cryo-electron microscopy structures of the dCas12f-{sigma}E system from Flagellimonas taeanensis. We captured multiple conformational and compositional states, including the DNA-bound dCas12f-{sigma}E-RNAP holoenzyme complex, revealing how RNA-guided DNA binding leads to {sigma}E-RNAP recruitment and nascent mRNA synthesis at a precisely defined distance downstream of the R-loop. Rather than following the classical paradigm of {sigma}E-dependent promoter recognition, these studies show that recognition of the -35 element is largely supplanted by CRISPR-Cas targeting, while the melted -10 element is stabilized through unusual stacking interactions rather than insertion into the typical recognition pocket. Collectively, this work provides high-resolution insights into an unexpected mechanism of RNA-guided transcription, expanding our understanding of bacterial gene regulation and opening new avenues for programmable transcriptional control.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

We describe a novel mechanism whereby JIP4 regulates lysosomal cystine storage by controlling the abundance of cystinosin (CTNS), the transporter responsible for lysosomal cystine efflux. To this end, JIP4, previously characterized as a motor adaptor and kinase signaling scaffold, suppresses TMEM55B-dependent ubiquitylation of CTNS. Loss of JIP4 reduces CTNS protein levels, leading to lysosomal cystine accumulation and lysosomal storage defects that phenocopy loss of CTNS in both human cells and the renal proximal tubules of JIP4 knockout mice. These phenotypes mirror cystinosis, the lysosomal storage disease caused by CTNS loss-of-function. Our findings thus reveal a fundamental process that controls the efflux of lysosomal cystine and has relevance to understanding human disease arising from JIP4 mutations.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

Here, we present a multidisciplinary study encompassing structural, biochemical, and cellular approaches to elucidate Siglec-10-carbohydrate interactions and function. X-ray crystallography revealed two key arginine residues within the Siglec-10 binding site that interact with the carboxyl group of sialic acid, a canonical R119 and a non-canonical R127, suggesting potential dual contributions to ligand engagement. Saturation Transfer Difference (STD)-NMR confirmed that R119 is essential for binding to sialoglycans, while R127 appears dispensable in interactions with glycans in solution. However, cell-based binding assays using primary human T cells and engineered monocytic lines demonstrated that both arginines (R119 and R127) are critical for cellular recognition, highlighting a more complex mechanism of interaction with the glycocalyx. We further ruled out CD24 as a principal ligand for Siglec-10 on T cells or breast cancer cells, despite high CD24 expression, suggesting the involvement of alternative sialylated glycoproteins or glycolipids.

Among these, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and extracellular targeted protein degradation (eTPD) specifically depend on efficient lysosomal trafficking for activity. However, many tumor antigens exhibit poor internalization, limiting ADC effectiveness. To address this, we developed low-density lipoprotein receptor-targeting chimeras (LIPTACs), leveraging the constitutive endocytic and recycling activity of the LDLR to enhance lysosomal delivery. LIPTACs enable efficient and selective degradation of diverse extracellular membrane proteins. Additionally, by coupling LIPTACs with cytotoxic payloads to generate degrader-drug conjugates, we can achieve superior intracellular delivery and enhanced cytotoxicity compared to conventional ADCs. The dual modality addresses key challenges of inadequate internalization in conventional ADCs and cytotoxic potency for current eTPD strategies. Our findings demonstrate that LDLR-mediated trafficking can enhance eTPD and ADCs, providing a hybrid blueprint for developing next-generation antibody therapeutics with broader utility and improved efficacy in cancer treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

The effects of OTR could be mediated by modulating the activity of pre-synaptic axon terminals or via post-synaptic neurons or glia. Using a viral-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system in California mice (Peromyscus californicus), we selectively knocked down OTR in the anteromedial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) or the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to examine their roles modulating social approach and vigilance behaviors. Knockdown of OTR in the BNST attenuated stress-induced decreases of social approach and increases of social vigilance behaviors in adult female California mice, similar to prior pharmacological studies. These effects were more prominent in the large arena social interaction where mice could control proximity to a social target with a barrier (wire cage). In a small arena interaction test where focal mice freely interacted with target mice, effects of BNST OTR knockdown were muted. This suggests that within the BNST OTR are more important for modulating behavioral responses to more distal stimuli versus more proximal social contexts. In mice with OTR knockdown in the NAc, few behavioral changes were observed which is consistent with previous findings of the importance of presynaptic OTR, which were unaffected by our gene editing strategy, driving social approach behaviors in the NAc. Interestingly, BNST OTR knockdown increased exploratory behavior toward a non-social stimulus after stress, pointing to a potentially broader role for BNST OTR function. Our findings highlight the region- and context-specific functions of OTR in social behavior and the advantages of using a selective gene-editing tool to dissect the neural circuits that influence social and stress-related responses.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

The dominant yeast Hanseniaspora uvarum varied dramatically in abundance (4.3-97.5%) and exhibited significant local adaptation and maladaptation patterns across orchard-variety combinations. Critically, H. uvarum local adaptation strongly predicted community composition: locally adapted populations achieved higher abundance while suppressing competitors. However, local adaptation had no effect on community-level performance in apple decomposition. Communities dominated by locally adapted H. uvarum performed equivalently to diverse assemblages, indicating functional redundancy among species. These results demonstrate that rapid evolutionary change can decouple community composition from performance, suggesting that functional redundancy can maintain community performance despite dramatic compositional shifts driven by local adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

Statistical genetics offers a hypothesis-free approach to this problem, as opposed to mechanistic models, which can be used only for reference isolates that are not representative of the whole species. In this study, we assembled two genomic and transcriptomic datasets for Escherichia coli (N=117) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N=413) and identified associations between genetic variants in cis non-coding regions and recorded gene expression variation. We identified at least one associated variant in up to 39% of the tested genes in both species. We partly validated the associations in-silico and in-vitro for E. coli, reinforcing the difficulty of identifying a single mechanism generating gene expression diversity. We then investigated the relevance of non-coding variants in explaining the variability in antimicrobial resistance in both species using two additional publicly available datasets, identifying a large number of these variants across antimicrobial compounds.

Instead, pSyn129 was reduced by ablation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein EMC4, which enhanced ER-driven autophagic flux and lysosomal clearance. OXR1 activation preferentially modulated cellular reactions to fibrils derived from multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients, whereas EMC4 ablation broadly reduced pSyn129 across diverse -Syn polymorphs. These findings were confirmed in human iPSC-derived cortical and dopaminergic neurons, where OXR1 preferentially promoted somatic aggregation and EMC4 reduced both somatic and neuritic aggregates. These results uncover previously unrecognized roles for OXR1 and EMC4 in -Syn aggregation, thereby broadening our mechanistic understanding of synucleinopathies.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

Plastic biodegradation is a potential sustainable solution to MNPP, but understanding the fitness of potential plastic-degrading proteins (PPDPs) across environments requires comparative resources. Here, we introduce the Plastic-Degrading Clusters of Orthologous Groups (PDCOGs) database, available at https://phylobone.com/microworld/PDCOG. The resource includes 625,616 PPDPs from free-living prokaryotes classified in 51 PDCOGs. The PDCOG database is a robust resource that improves understanding of plastic biodegradation and supports research on global MNPP challenges. Overall, PDPPs represent 3.5% of proteins in prokaryotes and are widely distributed across the Earth, spanning across most prokaryotic species and environments. Nearly all prokaryotic species (>95%) have the potential to biodegrade at least one polymer type.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

BMP-dependent patterning of the secondary body axis is ancestral for Bilateria and possibly also for the bilaterian sister clade Cnidaria. However, the variety of levels of centralization of the nervous systems in Bilateria - from diffuse to fully centralized - as well as the lack of centralization of the nervous system in Cnidaria, suggest that BMP signaling cannot be perceived as a universally ""anti-neural"" signal. Here we use transgenic reporter lines in the anthozoan cnidarian Nematostella to show that BMP signaling is active in distinct neuronal populations. Moreover, attenuation of BMP signaling followed by RNA-Seq shows that BMP signaling is a positive regulator of many neuronal genes, including the top-tier neural progenitor marker soxB(2). Further, we analyze BMP signaling activity in the true jellyfish Aurelia and box jellyfish Tripedalia proving that BMP signaling in the diffuse cnidarian nervous system is not an anthozoan but an ancestral cnidarian feature, shared by anthozoans and medusozoans. Finally, we show that the highly centralized ventral nervous system of the non-model spiralian, the chaetognath Spadella, forms out of paired BMP signaling-positive domains on the lateral sides of the embryo. Together, our data suggest that one of the ancestral roles of BMP signaling was in promoting neurogenesis. We propose that the ""anti-neural"" function of BMP signaling in vertebrates and arthropods is a side effect of its global role in the dorsoventral patterning of the ectoderm.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

Mutations in YIPF5 cause MEDS2 (microcephaly with simplified gyral pattern, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes syndrome), a fatal disorder manifesting in early childhood. We demonstrate that YIPF5 is involved in ER export of a subset of proteins, including cargoes of the ER-export receptor SURF4, with which it directly interacts. In YIPF5 knockout cells, we observe a shift in the cell surface and secretome composition, marked by reduced neuronal adhesion molecules and increased secretion of ER chaperones influencing cell migration. YIPF5 depletion enhances cell migration in a wound-healing assay and alters SURF4 localization, causing elongated ERGIC53- and Rab1-positive tubules from COPII-labeled ER exit sites. Kinetic analysis suggests that YIPF5 negatively regulates SURF4-mediated ER export. In utero knockdown of Yipf5 in embryonic mouse brains induces premature neuronal migration and abnormal neuronal morphology. These findings suggest that YIPF5 and SURF4 coordinate ER export, and disruption may underlie cortical development defects leading to microcephaly.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer a promising approach for both treatment and prevention. Here, we describe the discovery and characterization of 4F11, a highly potent and broadly neutralizing mAb with demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy against HMPV. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we defined a unique mechanism of binding HMPV employed by 4F11, which distinguishes it from previously characterized RSV and HMPV mAbs. 4F11 targets an epitope located at the apex of the prefusion F protein (site O) with a 1:1 stoichiometry, distinct from the 3:1 stoichiometry observed with other HMPV site O antibodies. Unlike other site O antibodies, which penetrate the glycan shield between Asn57 and Asn172, 4F11 binds vertically and directly interacts with the Asn172 glycan, representing a unique glycan-dependent mode of recognition. In vitro, 4F11 displayed high potency and broad neutralization across diverse HMPV strains. It also showed a low propensity for resistance development, with only a single escape mutation (K179E) identified, a mutation not found in any published HMPV sequence to date. Viruses rescued with the K179E escape mutation had significantly decreased fitness in vitro compared to wild-type virus. In a hamster challenge model, 4F11 significantly reduced viral loads in both the lungs and nasal turbinates. These findings highlight 4F11 as a promising candidate for therapeutic development, particularly for immunocompromised individuals and other high-risk groups.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

Here, we introduce spatial ISOform sequencing (Spl-ISO-Seq), which reveals exons and polyadenylation sites from long reads with near-single-cell resolution. Spl-ISO-Seq selects long cDNAs and doubles to triples read lengths compared to standard preparations. Adding a highly specific software tool (Spl-ISOquant) and comparing human post-mortem pre-puberty samples of the visual cortex (8-11 years) to post-puberty samples (16-19 years), we find that cortical layers harbor stronger splicing and poly(A)-site regulation than the adjacent white matter, with enrichment of multiple protein-domain types. For oligodendrocytes however, developmental splicing changes are stronger in white matter. Among cortical layers, layer 4 has the most developmental changes in alternative-exon inclusion in excitatory neurons and in poly(A) sites. We also find many repeat elements, especially ERV1 long terminal repeats downstream of developmentally-regulated layer 4 exons. Overall, alternative splicing changes are linked to synapses - specifically at the post-synapse. Age-linked splicing changes in layers 1-3 and 4 are associated with autism spectrum disorder but not with schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimers disease. These results root developmental splicing changes during puberty and the resulting protein changes in specific layers and cell types.

However, the mechanism by which LAMV is attenuated is not well understood, contributing to the increased vaccine hesitancy that has caused a worldwide resurgence of measles. Here, we provide a molecular model of attenuation that implicates increased host innate immune responses and increased LAMV susceptibility to those responses. Our study leverages both in vitro and in vivo models of infection to find that acute induction of innate immunity in immune cells is the critical determinant of LAMV attenuation. We show that LAMV, in contrast to pathogenic wild type measles virus (MeV), causes a strong IFN response in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which restricts viral replication and spread in a post-entry manner. LAMV can enter, transcribe viral mRNA and translate viral proteins in immune cells, but is not able to form infectious particles and spread from cell to cell. Specifically, we find that mutations conserved across LAMV strains in the P/V/C and H genes are responsible for the induction of IFN and the restriction of infectious virus production. In PBMC cultures and in rhesus macaques, LAMV infection also results in the acute induction of proinflammatory cytokines that likely play a role in the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Overall, our study provides a virological and immunological framework for LAMV attenuation which can be leveraged in repurposing the LAMV backbone and in future vaccine design.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

Yet, epidemiological studies associate in-utero SSRI exposure with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The potential molecular mechanisms by which SSRIs impact early neurodevelopment are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the effects of four commonly prescribed SSRIs--fluoxetine, citalopram, sertraline, and paroxetine--on neuroepithelial stem cells derived from four different human induced pluripotent stem cells. Following SSRI exposure, we assessed cellular viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial function through adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assays and performed high throughput metabolomic profiling at two timepoints: proliferation and neural differentiation stages. Sertraline and paroxetine significantly decreased ROS and ATP levels, indicating mitochondrial alteration. Metabolomic analysis identified several affected pathways and pinpointed three lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1 as significantly elevated across all SSRI exposures and time points, except for citalopram. In a complementary population-based cohort study, the Barwon Infant Study (BIS), consisting of 1074 mother-child pairs, we further observed elevated LPC levels in the cord blood of infants prenatally exposed to SSRIs, with a dose-dependent correlation to autism and ADHD-related symptoms at age two.

Here we propose a new method, pleiotropic heritability with bias correction (PHBC), to estimate pleiotropic heritability (h2pleio), defined as the liability-scale genetic variance of a target disease that is shared with a specific set of auxiliary diseases. We estimate h2pleio from GWAS summary statistics by estimating the proportion of variance explained from an estimated genetic correlation matrix and employing a Monte-Carlo bias correction procedure to account for sampling noise in genetic correlation estimates. Simulations showed that PHBC produces approximately unbiased estimates of pleiotropic heritability. The average ratio of pleiotropic heritability vs. total SNP-heritability (h2pleio / h2) across 15 diseases from the UK Biobank (spanning 7 disease categories) was 34% (s.e. 7%). Several diseases were dominated by pleiotropic heritability, including depression (71%) and type 2 diabetes (65%). Pleiotropic heritability was broadly distributed across disease categories, with h2pleio / h2 decreasing only slightly when removing all auxiliary diseases in the target disease category (avg = 31% (s.e. 7%)) and only moderately when further removing one other (most informative) category whose removal had the greatest impact (avg = 20% (s.e. 3%)). Average h2pleio / h2 increased to 44% (s.e. 9%) when adding 16 UK Biobank auxiliary quantitative traits, and 50% (s.e. 5%) when further adding 30 non-UK Biobank auxiliary diseases. On average, h2pleio / h2 was 2.4x larger than the proportion of liability-scale total phenotypic variance explained by the same set of auxiliary diseases, implying higher pleiotropy for genetic effects than the effects of non-genetic exposures. In conclusion, we determined that roughly half of common disease heritability is pleiotropic with diseases from a broad range of disease categories, emphasizing the need for a multi-disease approach to personalized medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1749766188640

Here we present a 2.25 A cryo-EM structure of the vault cap, revealing an unexpected 13-fold symmetric arrangement that contrasts with the 39-fold symmetry of the vault body, with each repeating module of the cap formed by an asymmetric homotrimer of adjacent subunits, in which two C-termini remain in the vault interior, and one projects into the cytosol.

The vault cap features a positively charged exterior and a negatively charged interior surface, with implications for binding partner recruitment and putative binding of the vault particle to microtubules and lipid rafts.

Active surveillance for bacterial colonization is effective at preventing infection but is resource-intensive and limited to high-risk units and a subset of high-risk pathogens. Colonization pressure (CP) for common pathogens has been associated with hospital acquired infection and can be calculated in real-time using data in the electronic health record. We aimed to assess the impact of CP on nosocomial acquisition for a range of drug susceptible and drug resistant pathogens, across an entire hospital system. Methods We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study of all inpatients admitted to a large regional integrated healthcare system between May 2015 and July 2024 who stayed in one room during the 30 day observation period. Cases had target organisms detected in any clinical or surveillance culture taken between 3 and 30 days after admission into their first room. Controls were matched on demographics, length of stay, prior surgery and 14 classes of antibiotic exposure. Our outcome was nosocomial acquisition of 11 common pathogens spread across enteric, skin and environmental niches. We applied conditional logistic regression and XGBoost to model nosocomial acquisition using as covariates the Elixhauser comorbidity index and CP, defined as the time-weighted prevalence of an organism in ward co-occupants over the previous 6 months. CP was calculated for 9 organism sets, including the Enterobacterales, ESBL Enterobacterales, vancomycin susceptible and resistant Enterococcus spp, C. difficile, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and drug susceptible and drug resistant (DR) P. aeruginosa (PsA). Findings Our pooled cohort included 14,923 cases matched to 28,480 controls. Hospital acquisition occurred four times more frequently for drug susceptible versus drug resistant organisms. Baseline characteristics were well matched between cases and controls. The strongest positive associations were between CPC. difficile and nosocomial acquisition of C. difficile (+32.5%, 95% CI +21.9% to +44.0%), CPESBL and ESBL K. pneumoniae (+29.4%, 95% CI +11.3% to +50.6%), and CPPsA-DR with drug resistant P. aeruginosa (+28.6%, 95% CI +14.0% to +45.0%). Among the skin flora, CPMSSA was associated with a +12.1% (95% CI +9.9% to +14.4%) increase in the odds of nosocomial acquisition of MSSA, CPMRSA was associated with a +6.7% (95% CI +1.3% to +12.5%) increase in the odds of MRSA. Negative associations were observed between organisms inhabiting different niches, including CPMSSA and ESBL K. pneumoniae (-7.9%, 95% CI -15.1% to -0.2%), and CPPsA-DR and vancomycin susceptible E. faecalis (-10.0%, 95% CI -15.6% to -4.0%). Interpretation A hospitalized patient's odds of nosocomially acquiring a potential pathogen is associated with its prevalence among that patient's ward co-occupants, regardless of the organism's drug resistance profile. Further research is necessary to understand the role of passive surveillance of CP for preventing infection.","NA","medrxiv",1749766188640

TrAEL-seq is a robust method for profiling DNA replication genome-wide that works in unsynchronised cells and does not require treatment with drugs or nucleotide analogues. Here, we provide an updated method for TrAEL-seq including multiplexing of up to 6 samples that dramatically improves sample quality and throughput, and we validate TrAEL-seq in multiple mammalian cell lines. The updated protocol is straightforward and robust yet provides excellent resolution comparable to OK-seq in mammalian cell samples. High resolution replication profiles can be obtained across large panels of samples and in dynamic systems, for example during the progressive onset of oncogene induced senescence. In addition to mapping zones where replication initiates and terminates, TrAEL-seq is sensitive to replication fork speed, revealing effects of both transcription and proximity to replication Initiation Zones on fork progression. Although forks move more slowly through transcribed regions, this does not have a significant impact on the broader dynamics of replication fork progression, which is dominated by rapid fork movement in long replication regions (>1Mb). Short and long replication regions are not intrinsically different, and instead replication forks accelerate across the first ~1 Mb of travel such that forks progress faster in the middle of regions lying between widely spaced Initiation Zones.

Dynamic modeling using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a powerful framework for understanding and predicting microbiome behaviors. However, developing reliable ODE models is severely hampered by their nonlinear nature and the presence of significant challenges, particularly critical issues related to identifiability. Here, we address the identification problem in dynamic microbial community models by proposing an integrated methodology to tackle key challenges. Focusing on nonlinear ODE-based models, we examine four critical pitfalls: identifiability issues (structural and practical), unstable dynamics (potentially leading to numerical blow-up), underfitting (convergence to suboptimal solutions), and overfitting (fitting noise rather than signal). These pitfalls yield unreliable parameter estimates, unrealistic model behavior, and poor generalization. Our study presents a comprehensive workflow incorporating structural and practical identifiability analysis, robust global optimization for calibration, stability checks, and rigorous predictive power assessment. The methodologys effectiveness and versatility in mitigating these pitfalls are demonstrated through case studies of increasing complexity, paving the way for more reliable and mechanistically insightful models of microbial communities.

Phenotype-based discovery in ST data holds transformative potential for linking spatial molecular expression patterns to clinical outcomes; however, appropriate ST data analysis remains fundamentally fragmented and highly labor-intensive. Due to its limited scalability considering the size of typical ST data in large cohorts, researchers must rely on other phenotypeannotated omics data modalities (e.g. bulk RNAsequencing) and align them with ST data to extract clinically meaningful spatial patterns. Yet, this process requires manually identifying relevant cohorts, aligning multi-modal data, selecting and tuning analysis pipelines, and interpreting results--typically without any built-in support for biologically context-aware reasoning. In this paper, we present PhenoGraph, a large language model (LLM) based multi-agent system, that automates the full pipeline for phenotype-driven ST data analysis, augmented by biological knowledge graphs for enhanced interpretability. Built on a modular agent architecture, PhenoGraph dynamically selects, executes, and corrects phenotype analysis pipelines based on user-defined queries. We showcase the flexibility and effectiveness of PhenoGraph across a variety of TME ST datasets and phenotype classes, highlighting its potential to enhance biological discovery efficacy.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

Despite the identification of several substrates and interaction partners for MuRF1, the precise molecular mechanisms by which MuRF1 causes skeletal muscle atrophy remain unclear. To gain further insight into the underlying mechanism of skeletal muscle atrophy, we applied targeted biochemical approaches, and identified tripartite motif-containing protein 72 (TRIM72) as a novel MuRF1-interacting protein. Subsequent analysis using MuRF1 knockout and rescue experiments showed that TRIM72 protein abundance is dependent on the presence of MuRF1 protein. Furthermore, TRIM72 protein level was increased by dexamethasone treatment in C2C12 myotubes, alongside increased MuRF1 protein level. Dexamethasone decreases IRS1/Akt signalling, protein synthesis, and glucose uptake specifically in wild-type myotubes, but not in MuRF1 KO myotubes. Further analysis showed that overexpression of TRIM72 impairs IRS1/Akt signalling without the presence of MuRF1, indicating that MuRF1 induces a negative impact on insulin signalling through a plausible cooperation with TRIM72. Our findings provide novel non-degradative molecular roles of MuRF1 that link together skeletal muscle atrophy and impaired insulin responses.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake.

Here, we identify myeloid leukemia factor 2 (MLF2) as a disease-agnostic biomarker for phase transitions, including stress granules and nuclear condensates associated with dystonia. Exploiting fluorophore-derivatized MLF2 constructs, we developed a high-content platform and computational pipeline to screen modulators of NE condensates across chemical and genetic space. We identified RNF26 and ZNF335 as protective factors that prevent the buildup of nuclear condensates sequestering K48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins. Chemical screening identified four FDA-approved drugs that potently modulate condensates by resolving polyubiquitinated cargo and MLF2 accumulation. Our exploratory integrated chemical-genetics approach suggests that modulation of zinc, and potentially autophagy and oxidative stress, is critical for condensate modulation and nuclear proteostasis, offering potential therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders. Application of our platform to a genome-wide CRISPR KO screen identified strong enrichment of candidate genes linked to primary microcephaly and related neurodevelopmental disorders. Two hypomorphic microcephaly-associated alleles of ZNF335 failed to rescue nuclear condensate accumulation in ZNF335 KO cells, suggesting that aberrant condensates and impaired nuclear proteostasis may contribute to the pathogenesis of microcephaly.

Cyclic peptides offer greater stability and potential oral delivery, but their de novo design with computational methods as agonists is unproven. Here, we used the EvoBind AI platform to design cyclic peptide agonists for GCGR from sequence alone, without any structural templates or prior binding site information. EvoBind consistently identified the receptors activation surface, producing peptides that also activated GLP1R. Of three synthesised peptides, two showed potent dual activation of GCGR and GLP1R in cAMP assays, while all three activate GLP1R, with the 18-residue design achieving EC50 values of 32 nM (GLP1R) and 542 nM (GCGR), rivalling natural hormones. The designed sequences show no similarity to known agonists, and structural modelling indicates that they adopt novel binding modes compatible with active-state stabilisation. This is made possible by EvoBinds purely sequence-based, template-free approach, which enables the discovery of alternative solutions that are inaccessible to structure-guided methods. This study presents the first successful blind de novo design of a cyclic peptide agonist for a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), using only the receptor sequence as input. The findings highlight EvoBinds capacity to go beyond static binding, offering a generalisable strategy for therapeutic discovery through target-agnostic, sequence-driven peptide design.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

Each sense organ is composed of two glial cells, called the sheath and socket, and one or more neurons. A major challenge in studying their development has been the lack of methods to directly observe these structures in the embryo. Here, we mine a recently published high-resolution ultrastructural dataset of a comma-stage embryo that provides an untapped resource for visualizing early developmental events. From this dataset we reconstructed all head sense organs (two amphid (AM), four cephalic (CEP), six inner labial (IL), four outer labial quadrant (OLQ), and two outer labial lateral (OLL)). Symmetric sense organs were at different stages of morphogenesis, allowing us to infer developmental steps by which they form. First, we found that the sheath glial cell begins wrapping its partner neurons at the distal tip of the dendrites where it self-fuses into a seamless tube and then ""zippers"" down the dendrite. In many cases, sheath glia wrap the progenitors of partner neurons prior to their terminal division. After sheath wrapping has begun, the socket glia wraps the sheath glia circumferentially before presumably elongating to form the mature sheath-socket channel. We also observed transient interactions not found in the mature animal, such as amphid sheath glia wrapping the AUA neuron, that may reflect ancestral relationships. This study demonstrates the value of large public EM datasets that can be mined for new insights, and sheds light on how neurons and glia undergo coordinated morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

In mammals, the menthol receptor, TRPM8, is activated by temperatures below [~]26{degrees}C and is essential for the perception of cold or chemical cooling agents 4-6. A fascinating, yet still unachieved goal is to elucidate structural mechanisms whereby TRPM8 or other thermosensitive channels are gated by changes in ambient temperature. Recent studies using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have attempted to address this challenging question but are limited by difficulties in visualizing temperature-evoked conformational substates or assessing the energetic landscape governing gating transitions 7,8. Here, we close this gap by using cryo-EM to visualize TRPM8 channels in cellular membranes, where bona fide menthol- and cold-evoked open states are captured. We identify a novel  semi-swapped architecture in which interdigitation of channel subunits is substantially rearranged following repositioning of the S6 transmembrane helix and elements of the pore region. By combining this structural analysis with thermodynamic measurements using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we are able to pinpoint the pore and TRP helices as key regions undergoing stimulus-evoked conformational dynamics that drive channel gating. Structural mechanisms associated with activation are validated by comparison of human TRPM8 with the menthol-sensitive, but relatively cold-insensitive avian orthologue.

While there are hundreds of diverse GPCRs, only two {beta}-arrestin isoforms ({beta}arrs) must recognize and engage this wide range of receptors with varied phosphorylation patterns. Traditional models suggest that {beta}arr activation requires displacement of its autoinhibitory C-tail by a phosphorylated GPCR C-terminus; however, this paradigm fails to explain how minimally phosphorylated GPCRs still complex with {beta}arrs. Using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer imaging and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we observe basal dynamics in which the {beta}arr1 C-tail spontaneously releases from the N-domain, transiently adopting an active conformation that can facilitate binding of the phosphorylated GPCR C-terminus. We further demonstrate the importance of an intermediate state of {beta}arr1 arising from spontaneous C-tail release stabilized by the membrane phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2. Both PI(4,5)P2 and mutations in the proximal or middle regions of the C-tail shift {beta}arr1 towards a partially released state, revealing an allosteric connection that informs a refined model for {beta}arr activation.

We used simultaneous EEG and respiratory recordings over a full night of sleep collected from N = 23 healthy participants to unravel the nested dynamics of respiration phase-locked excitability states across the wake-sleep cycle. We demonstrate a prominent phase shift in the coupling of aperiodic brain activity to respiratory rhythms as participants were transitioning from wakefulness to sleep. Moreover, respiration-brain coupling became more consistent both across and within participants, as interindividual as well as intraindividual variability systematically lessened from wakefulness and the transition to sleep towards deeper sleep stages.

Based on the number of formants, two different coda quality categories have been described: a-codas and i-codas. In the present paper, we demonstrate that sperm whale codas not only resemble human vowels acoustically, but also pattern like them across several dimensions. First, traditional count- and timing-based coda types interact with coda ""vowel"" quality (a vs. i). Second, a-codas are generally longer than i-codas. Third, the duration of i-codas has a bimodal distribution, showing a contrast between short i-codas and long [i]-codas. Fourth, the baseline coda length differs across whales. And fifth, edge clicks mismatching their coda often match an adjacent coda, a phenomenon that resembles human coarticulation. All five properties have close parallels in the phonetics and phonology of human languages. Sperm whale coda vocalizations thus represent one of the closest parallels to human phonology of any known animal communication systems.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

Mutations and certain post-translational modifications impact its aggregation propensity and pathogenicity. Glycation, a non-enzymatic modification enhanced during hyperglycemia and aging, both known risk factors for PD, has been implicated in -Syn pathology. Although preformed -Syn-fibrils induce PD-like phenotypes in mice, the impact of glycation on their pathogenicity is unclear. In the current study, we glycated -Syn using methylglyoxal (MGO), a potent glycating agent, resulting in altered biophysical characteristics in comparison to non-glycated -Syn. Glycation inhibited the formation of typical beta sheet structures under aggregating conditions. Despite that, glycated -Syn assemblies induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation to a similar extent as the non-glycated -Syn fibrils upon their injection in the mouse substantia nigra (SN). However, these glycated assemblies triggered higher neuroinflammation and increased accumulation of receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) compared to non-glycated fibrils. Consequently, an earlier onset of neuromuscular deficits and anxiety was observed in these mice. Thus, glycation of -Syn causes distinct PD-associated pathology compared to non-glycated -Syn, causing an earlier onset of motor symptoms. These findings provide insight into how glycation of -Syn due to hyperglycemia may contribute to an increased risk of PD in diabetic populations.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

The relationship between the dynamics of Wnt signaling and specification of AP coordinates is difficult to study in mammalian embryos due to the inaccessibility of developing embryos and the difficulty of live imaging. Here, we developed an in vitro model of human neuroectoderm patterning, where the anterior-posterior axis self-organizes along the radius of a micropatterned human pluripotent stem cell colony. We used this system to study the quantitative relationship between Wnt signaling in space and time and the resulting AP patterns. We found that rather than a smoothly varying gradient along the axis, signaling is elevated in midbrain compared to either surrounding region. The timing, rather than the amplitude or duration, of the Wnt response played the most important role in setting axial coordinates. These results establish a simple system for studying the patterning of the human nervous system and elucidate how cells interpret Wnt dynamics to determine their position along the AP axis.","NA","biorxiv",1749766188640

Participants with detectable Abs (from prior COVID antigen exposure) were classified as ""COVID-Exposed"" and those with undetectable Abs as ""COVID-Naive."" FoTv, versus Placebo, significantly reduced side-effects in COVID-Naive, but not in COVID-Exposed individuals. In the COVID-Naive FoTv group, Ab responses were preserved across 6 months, an effect not observed among other groups. Adjunctive FoTv was safe, feasible, and reduced vaccine side-effects without compromising (and possibly increasing) Ab levels up to 6 months in participants without previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1749766188640

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1749766188641

We demonstrate the real world implications of the use of testing and evaluate adverse events and outcomes in individuals who did not receive pharmacogenomic testing for clopidogrel.

MethodsWe analyzed ~100K individuals with paired EHR and exome sequencing data from population health studies administered at multiple medical centers using the Helix Exome+(R) assay. We inferred clopidogrel dosage by processing the prescription with an LLM. We identified all instances of individuals with at least one prescription that is not in concordance with their CYP2C19 genotype. Lastly, we identify instances of thrombosis using a comprehensive codeset based on ICD9, ICD10, and SNOMED terms.

ResultsWe identified 16,140 prescriptions of clopidogrel given to 3,853 participants. We found that 29% of these individuals have a mismatch between the recommended clopidogrel dosage guideline based on their CYP2C19 genotype and their actual prescribed daily dosage. 25% of poor metabolizers experienced thrombosis, with 40% occurring within 2 months of treatment. Poor and intermediate metabolizers receiving clopidogrel are much more likely to experience thrombosis and myocardial infarction (binomial p-value = 0.001).

ConclusionsWe estimate a 38% excess of adverse events occur in poor and intermediate metabolizers relative to normal and rapid metabolizers. The lack of testing may be responsible for 1 thrombosis event per every ~30 people prescribed clopidogrel.","NA","medrxiv",1749766188641

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.
