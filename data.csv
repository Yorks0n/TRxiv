MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 33 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time- dependent covariate) was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, including adjusting for influenza activity as an effect modifier.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43920 (82.2%) were vaccinated by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1130 (2.12%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over time the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the risk of influenza was not significantly different during periods when influenza activity was low (HR, .70; 95% C.I., .42 - 1.15; P = .15) or medium (HR, 1.20; 95% C.I., .86 - 1.67; P = .28), but was significantly higher for the vaccinated state than the unvaccinated state when influenza activity was high (HR, 1.33; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.64; P = .009).

ConclusionsThis study was unable to find a protective influence of influenza vaccination among working-aged adults during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season and found that influenza vaccination was associated with a higher risk of influenza when influenza activity was high.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find a protective influence of influenza vaccination during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season and found a significantly higher risk of influenza with vaccination when influenza activity was high.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1761602998778

In the vertebrate spinal cord, progenitors are patterned into molecularly defined domains, but how lineage relationships shape neuronal diversity and function has remained unclear. Here, we combine genomic barcoding with single-cell RNA sequencing in chick and human embryos to generate cell-type-resolved clonal maps. We find that spinal neurogenesis follows a hierarchical organisation in which the neural tube first partitions into five broad subdivisions that resolve into the eleven progenitor domains generating the cardinal neuronal classes. This bifurcating architecture implies a patterning mechanism of sequential binary decisions. The most prominent lineage restriction occurs at the embryonic alar-basal boundary, separating sensory-processing from motor-control circuits. Individual progenitors generate neurons across multiple temporal waves while remaining constrained within their lineage subdivision, demonstrating persistence of spatial identity despite temporal competence changes. Among sensory populations, we identify two developmental routes, via unifated or bifated progenitors, to pain- and itch-processing interneurons. These principles are conserved between chick and human, with clonal analysis in human embryos revealing that most fate choices are resolved by six weeks post-conception. Together, these findings provide a framework for spinal cord development and reveal lineage compartmentalisation as a fundamental principle in neural circuit assembly and evolution.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC001051),;""},{""name"":""Wellcome"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC001051;220379/D/20/Z;218670/Z/19/Z;215116/Z/18/Z;""},{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC001051;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""742138;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""792-2021;""},{""name"":""UKRI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X031225/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

To stabilize proteins during simulation, Martini is typically combined with structure-based force fields such as elastic network models (ENMs) or G[o] models. While these approaches preserve global folds and capture protein flexibility, their ability to reproduce conformational dynamics remains unclear. Here, we benchmark Martini combined with ENMs or G[o] models on three folded proteins and show that both approaches struggle to sample the conformational space observed in atomistic simulations, even when uniform interaction strengths or equilibrium bond distances are adjusted. This limitation arises from the assumption of a uniform interaction network, in which all bond energies are equal. To overcome this, we present a fully automated, perturbation-based optimization approach for G[o] networks, PoG[o], that iteratively refines a non-uniform G[o] network against a pre-computed atomistic free energy landscape in essential conformational space. Our approach converges rapidly, yielding CG ensembles in close agreement with reference atomistic simulations. As a cross-validation, the optimization also improves the root-mean-square fluctuation profile.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""449750155 – RTG 2756, Project A1;""},{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PGSD-599306-205;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

Acute stress is known to impact the hippocampus but may have opposite effects on these competing functions. That is, although stress impairs episodic encoding, it may instead enhance statistical learning. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested how stress influences the hippocampal pathways and subfields that support episodic encoding and statistical learning while participants performed a task that engaged both processes. Across several analyses, stress biased hippocampal processing in favour of statistical learning, suppressing pattern separation between events in the dentate gyrus and enhancing the representation of statistically predictive features. Furthermore, stress drove the hippocampal monosynaptic pathway to support statistical learning rather than episodic encoding during predictive situations. Together, these data suggest that acute stress elicits targeted, adaptive changes in hippocampal pathways which may facilitate predicting and responding to upcoming events.","[{""name"":""NIMH"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R21MH128740;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

VPS13C readily binds lysosomes under mechanical or osmotic tension in anticipation of membrane lesions. The latter trigger a conformational change in the protein's C-terminus, involving its ATG2C domain acting as sensor of damage-induced lipid packing defects. We show that ER-lysosome contacts formed by VPS13C provide critical binding platforms for OSBP/ORPs to enable efficient ER wrapping of damaged lysosomes. A chemical approach to assess directional ER-to-lysosome lipid transport revealed that VPS13C is essential for large-scale lipid delivery to acutely damaged lysosomes to facilitate their repair.

We find that only a subset of full promoters is activated by distal neuronal enhancers and that the promoter-proximal region is necessary for this enhancer-promoter compatibility. Core promoters alone are insufficient to respond to distal enhancers but modulate the transcriptional output of responsive promoters. Our results suggest that within multipartite regulatory domains, the promoter-proximal region fulfills a facilitator-like function that filters and transmits signal from distal enhancers, ultimaltely conferring enhancer-promoter compatibility.","[{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101076709;101125530;813327;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IB 139/6-1;KR 5247/1-1;KR 5247/1-2;KR 5247/1-3;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

Phylogenetic and recombination analyses reveal that nvHKU5r-CoV originated from bat HKU5-like viruses circulating in southeastern China. We characterize the spike loop2 region as a critical determinant of ACE2 receptor specificity, directly interacting with the receptor, and show that the bat HKU5r-CoV with the closest loop2 sequence to nvHKU5r-CoV could already utilize mink ACE2. Using AlphaFold3, we predicted spike-ACE2 binding interfaces consistent with our experimental infectivity results. Targeted mutagenesis demonstrates that a single amino acid substitution (R548S) enables robust entry of nvHKU5r-CoV via human ACE2. We further show that this substitution can arise in vitro during hACE2-expressing cell infection with a replication-competent VSV system. Molecular dating suggests that nvHKU5r-CoV transmitted from bats to mink within the last decade, consistent with an expansion of mink fur farming in China.

Butyrate, a gut microbial metabolite, has been found to be reduced in AD patients; butyrate supplementation improved cognition and decreased amyloid burden in animal models. However, the precise underlying mechanisms are unclear. Our previous studies have demonstrated that insulin signaling impacts A transport kinetics at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we investigated the effect of butyrate treatment on intra-endothelial A accumulation and BBB integrity by modulating the insulin signaling pathway. The effect of butyrate on A accumulation was assessed by flow cytometry in BBB cell culture models. Insulin signaling activation and the expression of various receptors and transporters at the BBB were evaluated by Western blots and confocal microscopy. The roles of various molecular mediators were confirmed using specific inhibitors (MK2206, Trametinib, Rapamycin, VX-745). The effect of butyrate on the expression of BBB receptors and transporters that play a critical role in A trafficking was examined in mouse brains colonized with butyrate-producing bacteria via immunohistochemistry. Butyrate significantly decreased A{beta}42 accumulation in endothelial cells. This effect was associated with insulin signaling pathway activation, particularly AKT and ERK phosphorylation. Inhibitor studies established the critical role of these specific arms, as co-incubation with MK2206 (AKT inhibitor) or Trametinib (ERK inhibitor) reversed the protective effect of butyrate and increased A{beta}42 accumulation. However, mTOR and p38 inhibitors did not show a similar effect. In addition, butyrate restored P-glycoprotein efflux transporter expression and claudin-5 tight junction protein levels that were reduced with A{beta} treatment. These effects were supported by in vivo work, which demonstrated the upregulation of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2). This protein is associated with AKT activation and extracellular matrix stabilization in mice colonized with butyrate-producing bacteria. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that butyrate decreases A{beta}42 uptake at the BBB endothelium by activating the AKT and ERK arms of the insulin signaling pathway.

Here, we show how HAESA-LIKE 3 (HSL3) specifically recognizes the folded, disulfide-stabilized CTNIP/SCREW phytocytokines in Arabidopsis. Quantitative binding assays define a minimal CTNIP4 region required for high-affinity HSL3 interaction and signaling activation. A 2.12 [A] crystal structure of the HSL3-CTNIP4 complex reveals a unique C-terminal receptor pocket that accommodates the cyclic architecture of the peptide through a combination of hydrophobic and polar contacts, a feature absent in the closely related HAE/HSL LRR-RKs. The cyclic CTNIP4 fold further establishes a largely hydrophobic interface that bridges HSL3 to the SERK co-receptor, forming a distinct activation surface. Together, these structural, biochemical and physiological insights uncover a previously unrecognised mechanism of peptide perception and receptor activation, highlighting how subtle architectural variations enable precise ligand selectivity among highly conserved plant receptor kinases.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_204526;10001549;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 1061-2023;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""773153;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

In mammals, three main neuronal pathways through the BG have been described - the direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways - which together orchestrate many aspects of learning and behavior. In songbirds, cell types associated with striatal and pallidal components appear intermingled in a single basal ganglia nucleus, Area X, essential for song learning. This allows for the dense reconstruction of the entire circuit within a compact volume. Here, we introduce the first vertebrate basal ganglia connectome, comprising over 8,500 automated neuron reconstructions connected by about 20 million synapses. High image quality and automated reconstruction allowed analysis with minimal manual proofreading. Based on direct anatomical measurement of synaptic connectivity, we confirm that a direct, indirect and hyperdirect pathway can be traced through Area X. However, detailed morphological and connectomic analysis revealed no clearly distinct direct and indirect medium spiny neuron subpopulations, and a dominance of the direct and hyperdirect pathway. In addition to previously identified neuron types in Area X, we could distinguish three novel GABAergic neuron types, two of which are major output targets of GPe neurons, leading to novel feedback circuitry within Area X. We further found unexpectedly strong neuronal interconnectivity and recurrency between neurons associated with all pathways. Our data thus challenge the universality of the view of the basal ganglia as an information processor organized into discrete feedforward pathways.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

This situation potentially leads to misleading velocity visualizations and putative cell state transitions. To this end, we introduce velotest, a cell-level statistical test that quantifies the faithfulness of a velocity embedding with respect to its high-dimensional counterpart. Applying velotest across multiple datasets and embedding methods, we find strong differences in the embedding qualities between embedding methods, datasets, and regions in individual datasets. velotest thus provides an essential validation step and enables researchers to select a suitable visualization of high-dimensional velocities, ensuring that hypotheses drawn from velocity projections are grounded in accurately represented dynamics.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""390727645;520388526;""},{""name"":""Bundesministerium für Forschung, Technologie und Raumfahrt"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""01IS18039;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

There is robust evidence on the role of right-hemisphere frontoparietal dysfunction, interhemispheric structural disconnection and maladaptive activity in the left hemisphere in the persistence of neglect. However, the specific impact of right frontoparietal dysfunction on the functional (re)organization of the left hemisphere remains poorly understood. In this study, we introduce a novel application of functional connectivity gradient analysis to investigate macroscale functional reorganization in the non-lesioned left hemisphere of patients with chronic left spatial neglect. Focusing on resting-state fMRI data, we demonstrate that abnormal segregation patterns in the left frontoparietal and default mode networks are robustly associated with neglect severity and spatial attentional bias. Notably, the principal gradient--typically capturing a global unimodal-to-transmodal hierarchy--was altered in these patients, suggesting a reorganization favoring lateralized unimodal networks. We also show that the structural integrity of the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) plays a key role in shaping these functional dynamics. These findings reveal a previously overlooked aspect of neglect pathophysiology: the maladaptive dominance of the non-lesioned hemispheres intrinsic architecture. By combining innovative gradient-based metrics with classical lesion approaches, our study offers a new framework for understanding neglect as an emergent property of large-scale network imbalance, with clinical implications for diagnosis and intervention, and theoretical consequences for models of hemispheric asymmetries and conscious access.

Highlights[bullet] Functional connectivity gradients uncover altered segregation in the non-lesioned left hemisphere of patients with chronic spatial neglect.

However, its relationship with stroke remains uncertain: some studies have reported a significant association between CHIP and stroke risk, while others, including large biobank analyses, found no association after adjustment. To resolve these conflicting findings, we analyzed genomic and clinical data from 800,160 participants with genetic sequencing and medical records across the Vanderbilt BioVU, NIH AllofUs, and UK Biobank. Stroke events were identified and classified as ischemic or hemorrhagic using ICD codes. Results from the three cohorts were meta-analyzed with previously published results. Subgroup analyses were conducted by driver gene, clone size, sex and menopausal status. In addition, genetically predicted levels of 27 plasma cytokines were assessed as potential modifiers of CHIP-associated stroke risk. CHIP was associated with increased risk of incident stroke in each cohort and in the meta-analysis (HR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.13?1.27; P = 2.21 x 10?10). This association was observed for both ischemic (HR = 1.18) and hemorrhagic (HR = 1.30) stroke subtypes. Gene-specific analyses showed strong associations for JAK2 (HR = 2.46) and TET2 (HR = 1.40). DNMT3A demonstrated weak but significant associations (HR = 1.11). CHIP was associated with stroke risk in both sexes; however, among women, the association was evident in postmenopausal (HR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.16?1.92; P = 1.91 x 10?3) but not in premenopausal participants (HR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.36?1.43, P = 0.33). Among participants with CHIP, but not among participants without CHIP, genetically predicted levels of IL-1RAP were predictive of risk for stroke, suggesting IL-1RAP as a modifier of the CHIP-associated risk for stroke. Collectively, this large-scale, multi-cohort study establishes CHIP as an important determinant of incident stroke risk and IL-1-mediated inflammation as a targetable pathway to reduce this risk.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1761602998778

We co-cultured host cells with live, stool-derived gut microbiomes from Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria, Malaysia, and the United States, and quantified transcriptional responses using RNA-seq. We found that urban microbiomes affected innate immune pathways, including TNF signaling and bacterial antigen recognition. We also found that high-diversity microbiomes elicited a stronger host transcriptional response, while low-diversity microbiomes triggered epithelial restructuring and glycolysis. Finally, specific taxa driving these effects, including Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bacteroides dorei, correlated with lifestyle factors such as diet.

To investigate the putative genetic basis of this disease, we generated high-quality whole-genome data from 249 individuals spanning the species range, including from the New Zealand mainland (Northern range) and subantarctic Enderby and Campbell Islands (Southern). Population genomic analyses unexpectedly revealed three deeply divergent lineages with negligible gene flow, consistent with recognition of three distinct subspecies.

Phylogenetic divergence dating suggests that these splits predate human arrival by several millennia, with the Northern lineage diverging from the Southern populations 5-16 ka. Genome scans for local adaptation revealed regions of strong differentiation, and genome-wide association analyses identified candidate immune and respiratory genes linked to RDS.

Focused interrogation of complex regions uncovered pronounced haplotype-specific length polymorphisms and structural heterogeneity within centromeric higher-order repeat (HOR) arrays. Notably, we observed extensive HOR copy-number variation between haplotypes, including a large copy-number difference on maternal chromosome 18, underscoring dynamic HOR array evolution even among genetically identical individuals. Concurrently, genome-wide DNA methylation profiling delineated allele-specific epigenetic variation that may contribute to phenotypic discordance.

Modeling and analyzing these systems require solving very large mathematical problems that can quickly become computationally prohibitive. To address this challenge, we present a quantum algorithm to analyze metabolic networks, focusing on flux balance analysis as a representative case. We use a quantum interior point method consisting of a quantum subroutine for matrix inversion. Specifically, we reformulate the metabolic optimization problem for efficient execution on a quantum computer using quantum singular value transformation, enabling a rapid solution of complex systems that arise in flux balance analysis. This quantum approach offers a potential computational advantage over classical interior point methods for large and well-conditioned networks. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our method with numerical simulations on the glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle network and show that the quantum solution converges to the correct biological objective.

We mapped editing outcomes in human CD34 hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), mouse LSK HSPC equivalents, human upper airway organoids, and mouse multi-organ in vivo editing. Profiling 500,000 alleles across 74 cell types, scOUT-seq revealed that outcomes in most cell subtypes differ markedly from the bulk average. Various cell types shifted major repair classes, preferred different molecular sequences, and even enriched large structural variants, with distinctive patterns of allelic co-occurrence. Surprisingly, rare stem subtypes diverged from prevalent progenitors, and inhibitory neuron subtypes efficiently incorporated HDR alleles. These data suggest the potential for tailored therapeutic editing that may have been missed by bulk measurements.","[{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BIF 18919;""},{""name"":""NOMIS Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01zkd3118"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_188858;""},{""name"":""Lotte and Adolf Hotz-Sprenger Stiftung"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_201160;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""855741-DDREAMM-ERC-2019-SyG;""},{""name"":""NCCR RNA and Disease"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""182880;205601;""},{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""51NF40-182895;""},{""name"":""Fickel Family Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRCPBM100005;SEBINT-2024/100003;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

All previously characterized retrons produce high levels of multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) in the cell by reverse transcription, which acts as an antitoxin in the absence of phage infection. However, we describe here a non-canonical mechanism for Type VI retrons, which do not produce detectable msDNA in the absence of phage, yet still provide phage defense. Focusing primarily on Retron-Vpa2, a Type VI retron from Vibrio parahaemolyticus, we show broad defense against phages and identify triggers of the system within phage recombination systems. Within the Retron-Vpa2 operon, we find a highly enriched, structured transcript that we term a hybrid RNA (hyRNA), which contains both the retrons reverse transcription template and a translationally repressed toxic effector coding sequence. We find that phage infection induces the accumulation of high levels of msDNA and that this msDNA is necessary for derepressing translation of the antiviral toxin. These findings present key biological and mechanistic insights into a distinct group of retrons while highlighting the diversity of systems that participate in bacterial immunity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

Despite the extensive circulation of these viruses in many horseshoe bat species, the potential interactions between virus and receptor evolution remain poorly understood. We sampled individuals of the intermediate horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis) across Vietnam and identified 15 genotypes of ACE2 proteins, 10 of which are previously unreported. Phylogenetic analysis and infectivity assays with a panel of 36 sarbecovirus spike proteins indicated that the R. affinis ACE2 phylogeny has geographic structuring and genotypes originating from different geographic regions exhibit distinct infectivity phenotypes. We detected site-specific positive selection on ACE2 site 24 with the associated substitutions largely affecting the receptor's sarbecovirus infectivity profile. Together, our findings suggest that the R. affinis within-species ACE2 diversity has likely been shaped through selection by past sarbecovirus infection. Similarly on the virus end, we use mutagenesis assays and structural analysis through cryo-EM, to delineate the proximal evolution of the Ra22QT77 spike defined by specialization to the ACE2 genotypes of horseshoe bats found in and near southern Vietnam, where the virus was sampled.

The Pm3 allelic series in wheat encodes NLR receptors that recognize avirulence (AVR) effectors of wheat powdery mildew. Here, we show that near-identical Pm3 alleles vary greatly in resistance efficacy and broadness against a global mildew isolate collection and subsequently use this model system to study the mechanisms underlying broad-spectrum resistance. We demonstrate that two alleles, Pm3d and Pm3e, provide resistance against the majority of isolates worldwide, by each recognizing two AVR effectors from powdery mildew, thereby lowering the risk of resistance breakdown. While Pm3d recognizes two closely related RNase-like AVR effectors, Pm3e detects two structurally diverse AVRs, including an effector belonging to a large, uncharacterized protein family with a novel structural fold. Using chimeric Pm3 NLRs, we identify specificity-defining polymorphisms of Pm3d and Pm3e against their diverse effector targets. Lastly, we demonstrate that Pm3d and Pm3e activities can be combined in engineered Pm3 NLRs, thereby further extending their recognition spectrum. Our findings highlight the potential of Pm3 immune receptors for long-lasting wheat protection by demonstrating their versatility in recognizing structurally diverse effectors and their amenability to NLR engineering.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

We find that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of metabolic homeostasis activated in response to nutrient scarcity, triggers movement of EEs to the perinuclear region of cells, leading to enhanced proximity of endosomes to mitochondria and increased delivery of iron to mitochondria. The movement of EEs and increased mitochondrial iron content elicited by AMPK activation requires Gapex-5, a GEF for the early endosome Rab5 previously shown to be an AMPK substrate.

However, some species undergo programmed DNA elimination (PDE), whereby specific genome regions are removed from somatic cell lineages early during development, leading to distinct germline and somatic genomes. Since its discovery in parasitic nematodes over a century ago, PDE has been observed in diverse eukaryotes, including ciliates, arthropods, and vertebrates. However, the function, mechanisms, and evolutionary origins of PDE remain poorly understood. Here, we report the unexpected discovery of PDE in three early-diverging Caenorhabditis species. Using long-read and chromatin conformation capture sequencing, we reconstructed germline and somatic genomes for all three species, and found that between 0.7 and 2.3% of the genome is eliminated during the 8- to 16-cell stage of embryogenesis, including the telomeres and regions within chromosomes. Elimination of regions within chromosomes results in fragmentation of the six germline chromosomes into 8-15 somatic chromosomes. The sites of elimination are precise, and we identified conserved motifs that likely recruit a nuclease to induce double-strand breaks. The newly formed somatic chromosome ends are healed by de novo telomere addition. A small number of genes are eliminated in each species, some of which have C. elegans orthologues with essential germline functions.

Leveraging the increasing availability of publicly accessible bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets, we developed an integrated analytical framework to identify genes selectively enriched in BMECs compared to endothelial cells (ECs) from other tissues. To address the substantial batch effects inherent to multi-source bulk RNA-seq data, we combined two differential expression strate- gies, rank aggregation methods, and extensive quality controls. Our analysis incorporated EC samples from 16 different tissues and employed robust statistical workflows to mitigate technical confounders while preserving biologically mean- ingful signals. Validation using known BBB markers and independent proteomic evidence confirmed the reliability of our approach. We present Brendo (Brain Endothelial Open Resource), an open-access web platform providing searchable, filterable, and downloadable data on differentially expressed genes in BMECs. Brendo enables an in-depth exploration of brain endothelial gene expression and offers broader applications across vascular biology by supporting cross-tissue EC com- parisons. The workflow described is adaptable to other biological contexts, promoting the systematic reuse of public bulk RNA-seq datasets for target discovery. Collectively, this resource provides a foundation for advancing BBB-targeted therapeutic strategies and highlights the value of open data integration in transcriptomic research.","[{""name"":""Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04w9kkr77"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""122S347;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IG-5352;IG-4163;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

Despite correlations between thermal performance traits having been reported in the literature for a few taxa and performance tasks, such as population growth rate, a comprehensive global analysis of the entire tree of life and multiple performance tasks remains an open challenge. To advance in this open question, we compile a database of 1,300 thermal response curves, encompassing 38 variable types related to individuals' performance (including per capita population growth rate, photosynthetic rate, among others) and 1,125 different species, ranging from viruses to mammals, encompassing all major lineages of the tree of life. Our analysis reveals that among all possible relationships between traits and optimal performance, four traits form a line with a high goodness-of-fit, while the remaining traits exhibit a polygonal pattern, either a triangle or a tetrahedron. We derive a thermodynamic framework that explains the relationships described by a curve or line (as opposed to a surface or polygon), highlighting the linear relationship between maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as between maximum and optimum temperatures. We also discuss other generic trait evolution models, which could account for the other significant sublinear relationships, as well as the more general model, Pareto optimality theory, which could account for relationships in the form of lines or polygons. Our theoretical framework and empirical evidence suggest that, based on a single data point (e.g., minimum temperature), all critical temperature limits and maximum performance boundaries can be predicted using the estimated parameter from this study. Our results reveal universal scaling relationships in thermal performance, which could be useful for predicting changes in performance under scenarios of climate warming.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

Conventional genetic engineering of hiPSC lines requires a laborious process involving transfection, selection and expansion that can result in karyotypic abnormalities or transgene silencing during differentiation, limiting their applications. Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) delivery is a potential alternative integration-free method for durable expression of transgenes. Here, we used saRNA to deliver transcription factors and functional reporters in hiPSCs and demonstrate that expression can persist for weeks. Specifically, saRNA delivery enables highly efficient forward programming to Ngn2-induced neurons and enables measurement of functional reporters over time. We show that a single transfection of saRNA encoded jRCaMP1b reporter in hiPSCs generates sustained expression throughout differentiation to 3D cardiac spheroids. The persistence of the reporter allows measurement of calcium dynamics at a single-cell and population level over weeks, allowing tracking of cardiomyocyte maturation and drug responses. Together, our systematic analysis shows that saRNA provides sustained transgene expression in hiPSCs, supporting integration- free cell-fate programming and measurement of functional reporters in clinically relevant model systems.

Although cOA-activated effectors have been extensively characterized, the cA5-specific effectors remained unexplored despite cA5 being among the most abundant cOA species produced during phage infection. Here, we report that Actinomyces procaprae Csm6 (ApCsm6) selectively employs cA5 as its activator. Unlike other characterized Csm6 proteins, ApCsm6 self-limits its ribonuclease activity by degrading cOAs via its HEPN domain, rather than relaying on the CARF domain. Cryo-EM structures of ApCsm6 and its complexes with cA5 and cA6 reveal a homotetrameric assembly, where each monomer binds a single cOA within a composite pocket formed by two tandem CARF-HEPN domains. Binding of cA5, but not cA6, enhances tetramerization and induces large conformational shifts in CARF, which in turn allosterically activates ssRNA cleavage in HEPN.

Elucidating how the healthy central nervous system (CNS) differentially encodes objective stimulus intensity and subjective experiences of pain perception may offer key insights into the central mechanisms contributing to chronic pain. Functional MRI (fMRI) combined with controlled noxious stimulation provides a powerful means to explore neural representations of nociception and pain perception. Here, we applied noxious heat at three intensities (46 {degrees}C, 47 {degrees}C, 48 {degrees}C, 8 trials each randomized) to the right forearm of 28 healthy women during simultaneous spinal cord-brain fMRI to investigate how distributed corticospinal activity and connectivity encode stimulus intensity and subjective pain. Activity increased with stimulus temperature across regions involved in pain processing--including somatosensory, motor, prefrontal, insular, and subcortical areas--as well as in the ipsilateral dorsal and ventral spinal cord. Spinal-brain functional connectivity was observed between the right dorsal horn and pain-related brain regions such as primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and periaqueductal gray, and was positively associated with individual pain ratings. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), we found that multivoxel activation patterns in the brain and spinal cord, as well as corticospinal connectivity patterns, reliably tracked stimulus temperature, while only subsets of cortical regions (e.g., insula, sensorimotor, and frontal cortices) encoded subjective pain. Notably, spinal cord representations were primarily organized by stimulus temperature rather than perceived pain intensity. These findings demonstrate that simultaneous spinal cord-brain fMRI combined with multivariate modeling can identify sensory and perceptual components of nociceptive processing across the neuroaxis. Such approaches advance mechanistic understanding of pain and may inform the development of CNS-based biomarkers for chronic pain assessment and intervention.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 NS109450;K23NS104211;L30NS108301;R01NS128478;K24NS126781;""},{""name"":""National Institute on Drug Abuse"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00fq5cm18"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T32DA035165;""},{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P500PM_214211;""},{""name"":""Italian National Institute of Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CUP I85E23001090005;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

Although macrophages are important for controlling GAS infection, we and others have demonstrated that GAS can persist in macrophages by perforating the phagolysosome using the pore-forming toxin streptolysin O (SLO). In this study, we examined how phagosomal perforation releases lysosomal and bacterial proteins into the cytosol and alters cytosolic protein content in the macrophage. Using IL-1{beta} as a measure of intracellular pathogen detection, we confirmed that cytosolic preparations from macrophages infected with either wild-type (WT) or SLO-deficient ({Delta}SLO) bacteria contained new proteins that are absent in uninfected cytosol controls. Proteomic analysis revealed distinct cytosolic protein profiles in both WT- and {Delta}SLO-infected macrophages. M1 protein was detected only in the cytosol of WT-infected macrophages and corresponded with the IL-1{beta} response, indicating SLO-mediated release of M1 protein from the phagosome, and providing a mechanism for cytosolic recognition of this virulence factor. Unexpectedly, cytosolic extracts of both WT- and {Delta}SLO-infected macrophages contained all histone proteins, suggesting that nucleosomal complexes are released into the cytosol during GAS infection. Our work reveals both a mechanism for the activation of the inflammatory response on a cellular level, and the surprising consequences of phagosomal perforation in GAS infections. These responses may collectively contribute to the pathologies observed during severe invasive GAS infection, and can help inform therapies aimed at improving macrophage function and patient outcomes.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) enables deep profiling of large nanobody libraries and panning campaigns, however the scale and diversity of nanobody NGS datasets presents a significant bioinformatic challenge. To this end, we have developed alpseq, an optimised, open-source software pipeline designed specifically for the efficient and accurate processing of NGS data from nanobody libraries and panning campaigns. alpseq is also paired with a PCR-free sequencing library preparation protocol to allow researchers to easily generate their own data while avoiding biases. The alpseq software pipeline is composed of two parts: a pre-processing module written in Nextflow efficiently handles raw nanobody reads in a single line of code. These results are then fed into the analysis module, which contains a comprehensive suite of functions for quality control, diversity analysis, identification of enriched sequences and clustering. alpseq also creates a user-friendly interactive report which empowers scientists to explore their data without the need for extensive bioinformatic experience. Sophisticated panning campaign designs are supported, such as replicates and comparisons between different pans to find cross-binding leads. alpseq thus generates insights into the nanobody selection process and delivers a list of lead candidates for further experimental validation and downstream applications. alspeq is available at https://github.com/kzeglinski/alpseq.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

The allosteric surfaces of FOXG1 and FOXP1 are quite diverged, revealing a potential for protein-specific regulation in protein families. All three TFs have potentially druggable pockets where mutations have strong functional effects on binding, either within the binding interface or distant from it.

This supports an early migration of the ancestors of Oceanians through South Asia followed by the later arrival of the ancestors of present-day South Asians. East Asians do not share this Denisovan component in their genomes, suggesting that their ancestors arrived independently, perhaps by a northerly route.

These artifacts can affect demultiplexing accuracy and downstream analyses.

ResultsWe performed a rapid barcoding experiment on 66 diagnostic samples and found that 83% of reads carried the expected single-barcode pattern, while 17% contained multiple barcodes or other artifacts. Current demultiplexers, including the widely used Dorado, fail to correctly handle these complex cases, leaving approximately 7% of reads partially trimmed and contaminated with adapter fragments. Additional issues include the presence of two barcodes at the same read end--either identical, originating from the same sample, or different, introduced after pooling. The latter can lead to barcode bleeding when the outer barcode is incorrectly selected. To address these challenges, we developed Barbell, a pattern-aware demultiplexer that detects all barcode configurations.

Nevertheless, experimental studies and network simulations suggest that interneuron subclasses such as parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) exert distinct control over oscillatory dynamics. Yet, we lack a theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying oscillations in E-PV-SOM circuits and of the differences with respect to the classical mechanisms for oscillations in simpler E-I networks. Here, we derive a biologically realistic mean-field model of a canonical three-population E-PV-SOM circuit. This model robustly generates oscillations whose features are consistent with experimental observations, including the relative timing of PV and SOM activity and the effects of optogenetic perturbations. By reducing the model to a linear analytical form, we demonstrate that gamma oscillations emerge directly from the cell-specific connectivity of the three-population circuit. This connectivity motif alone accounts for experimentally observed phase relationships, with PV activity consistently leading that of SOM neurons. Together, this mean field model identifies a distinct structural mechanism giving rise to oscillations in canonical E-PV-SOM circuits and provides theoretical primitives for constructing large-scale, cell-type-specific models of cortical dynamics.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

To enumerate adaptive immune responses associated with MS and to identify MS-related epitopes recognized by CD8 T cells, we evaluated T-cell recognition of 1,158 predicted major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-binding peptides derived from latent EBV antigens (laEBVs) and selected neuroantigens (NAgs) using DNA barcode-labelled pMHC multimers. HLA-B*07:02+ individuals living with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS (PMS) were characterized by a relative reduction in EBNA6-specific and MAG-specific CD8 T cells compared to healthy donors. Furthermore, both RRMS and PMS patients exhibited a delayed expansion of CMV- and laEBV-specific CD8 T cells compared to healthy donors indicating an age-specific interaction with disease. Female RRMS patients were moreover characterized by a specific reduction of laEBV-specific CD8 T cells compared to male RRMS patients. NAg-specific CD8 T cells recognized heterogeneous peptides, were of low cellular frequency in peripheral blood, and exhibited a circulating, naive-like, anergic phenotype. In contrast, virus-specific CD8 T cells were characterized by high-frequency cellular responses with an effector-like, tissue-homing phenotype. These immunophenotypes were largely shared between MS and healthy donors.

Collectively, our data provide novel insights into CD8 T-cell recognition of both NAg and laEBV antigens in MS and constitute a key reference map of epitopes for further immunomonitoring of EBV- and self-specific CD8 T cells in health and disease.","[{""name"":""The Lundbeck Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R190-2014-4178;""},{""name"":""European Research Council ERC Consolidator"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MIMIC 101045517;""},{""name"":""Scleroseforeningen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/037s01565"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""A44005;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

These chemically-identical ""mass tags"" conjugate to peptides to encode samples with different mass offsets for parallel analysis. The current state-of-the-art for multiplexing with non-isobaric mass tags was recently improved from 3-plex to 9-plex, but what is the largest plex size that can be reasonably achieved with current technology? A full answer to this question requires evaluating current mass spectrometry hardware, facets of which have been well-investigated by others. However, it may be underappreciated that multiplexing 1000s of samples with mass tags does not actually require 1000s of isotopes, or 1000s of synthesis steps to create. Non-intuitively, high plex mass tags can require relatively few different isotopes. The focus of this exposition is to characterize the potential of the differential mass defect to create tens to over a thousand isotopologues of small molecules and how careful combinations of these small molecules can combinatorially scale the plex size to minimize synthetic steps. Importantly, we show that plex sizes in the hundreds, an order of magnitude greater than state-of-the-art, are achievable using molecules comparable in size to existing commercial tags, and that going beyond hundreds may require larger molecules. Approaches to achieve high-plex proteomics will almost certainly require using the differential mass defect, so we hope this exposition serves to accelerate progress in reagent development to achieve high plex proteomics.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

Specifically, enhancing the homing of monocyte-derived macrophages to the affected brain has been shown to reduce local inflammation, decrease proteinopathy, rescue neurons, and mitigate cognitive decline. However, the factors limiting their spontaneous recruitment remain unclear. Using multi-omics techniques, we identified impaired myelopoiesis and monocyte development in both mice and AD patients. While not the primary cause of the disease, this impairment is associated with disease progression. In the 5xFAD mouse model, monocyte differentiation was found to be disrupted due to a maladaptive bone marrow (BM) response, driven by type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling. A similar phenotype was found in circulating monocytes from AD patients compared to healthy controls. Blocking IFN-I with monoclonal antibodies or using chimeric AD mice with BM from mice lacking the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR1) alleviated myelopoiesis dysfunction, normalized monocyte phenotypes, and reduced cognitive impairment. These improvements in myeloid function were accompanied by an increased homing of monocyte-derived macrophages in the AD brain. Our results reveal an unexpected dysfunction in BM myelopoiesis in the context of neurodegeneration and support the emerging concept that neurodegenerative diseases are not solely brain-centric.","[{""name"":""Advanced European Research Council"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""7417;""},{""name"":""Israel Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04sazxf24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""991/16;""},{""name"":""ISF Legacy Heritage Bio-Medical Science Partnership"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1354/15;""},{""name"":""Thompson Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fundación Ramón Areces"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

The new probes provide robust organelle targeting, except for the mitochondrial probe, whose targeting ability is cell type dependent. Due to operating range of Prodan fluorophore in the UV-Blue region, our probes can be easily combined with other fluorescent tags in the visible range. Therefore, polarity of sub-cellular compartments can be studied together with additional fluorescent reporters. We used these probes to show the polarity of organelle membranes in healthy cells and under starvation condition where we observed organelle-specific polarity remodeling.

A marked decrease in inter-hemispheric connectivity was observed in patients (70.9%) compared with controls (29.1%; p < 0.001). The finding was consistent across all diagnostic groups. These alterations remained stable following reanalysis and aggregation, reliably distinguishing patients from controls. No significant differences were found in intra-hemispheric connectivity across the patient groups. Additionally, out of 12 predefined interregional connections, ten showed significant alterations in at least one patient group.

While traditionally thought to consist of a uniform set of proteins, here we discover that ribosome composition is reprogrammed to adapt to intrinsic and external cellular perturbations. During infection by non-segmented negative-sense viruses, viral entry into cells recruits the large ribosomal subunit protein rpL40 to a noncanonical site on the small subunit of 80S ribosomes near the mRNA entry site. These specialized ribosomes preferentially bind viral mRNAs to drive enhanced viral protein synthesis that is critical for replication under host pressures. Unexpectedly, we find that viruses have co-opted this translation pathway from a previously unrecognized endogenous ribosome remodeling program in which metabolic stress alters ribosome structure to promote mRNA translation required for cell survival. Thus, ribosome remodeling is a conserved mechanism enabling dynamic protein synthesis across pathogen and cellular adaptation.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1S10OD036228-01;GM067945;GM007122;1R35GM142527;""},{""name"":""Pew Charitable Trusts"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02xhk2825"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""G.

It is an exemplar condition for evaluating penetrance in adult cohorts due to its relatively low mortality, variable expressivity and link to several large genes. Using genome sequencing data from [~]500,000 adults in UK Biobank, we curated a set of rare pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in COL1A1, COL1A2 and IFITM5 using annotations from gnomAD, ClinVar and SpliceAI. Analysis of summed read-count data from genome and exome sequencing led to exclusion of 16 mosaic variants with consistently low allelic balance of 3.4-35.9%. We identified 61 likely constitutive heterozygous pathogenic variants in COL1A1 and COL1A2 (29 loss-of-function or splice variants and 32 missense) in 115 participants, with a mean age at recruitment of 55.1 years; no pathogenic variants were identified in IFITM5. Phenotypes were assessed using ICD-10 codes, self-reports and heel bone mineral density. Overall disease penetrance was lower than anticipated: 40.7% for COL1A1 and 21.3% for COL1A2, potentially due to depletion of severe early-onset disease. When considering only truncating variants in COL1A1, disease penetrance increased to 73.1%, and 90% of individuals had reduced levels of circulating COL1A1 protein. For COL1A2, bone mineral density data supported the low penetrance, whereas for COL1A1, data suggested the possibility of a subclinical phenotype. Overall, for pathogenic missense variants (including those altering Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats), the low penetrance observed suggests reliance on current ClinVar assertions to support pathogenicity may overstate OI risk in population screening.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1761602998778

Here, we developed AF-CALVADOS, a coarse-grained simulation model that is informed by AlphaFold to model the dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins and multi-domain proteins containing mixtures of folded and disordered regions. AF-CALVADOS leverages information from AlphaFold 2 to model folded regions that we then integrate with the coarse-grained CALVADOS model. Our automated framework makes it possible to perform simulations of any soluble folded or disordered protein without manually defined folded regions, enabling scaling to the proteome level. We validate AF-CALVADOS using experimental data and consistency between our simulations and the AlphaFold 2 predicted aligned error matrix. We demonstrate the scalability of AF-CALVADOS by performing simulations of 12,483 cytosolic human proteins and make the data freely available; we envisage that large-scale simulation data generated by AF-CALVADOS can be used to benchmark or train machine learning models for flexible, multi-domain proteins. The conformational ensembles can be used to study sequence-dynamics-function relationships at scale, and can shed light on the interplay between folded and disordered regions.

It facilitates molecular evolution and has been characterized in a variety of biological systems, but studies of prokaryotic promoters are limited. Prokaryotic promoters are non-coding DNA sequences that regulate transcription. The main housekeeping promoters ({sigma}70) share two sequence motifs called the -35 and the -10 box that are spaced 17{+/-}1 base pairs (bps) apart. The sequence of these boxes, their distance, and the existence of multiple nearby boxes can determine promoter strength, the ability of a promoter to drive high levels of transcription. Here we used computational modelling to show that the mutational robustness of {sigma}70 promoters - the persistence of promoter strength upon mutation - correlates with promoter strength itself. Mutational robustness is also influenced by potential overlaps between -10 and -35 boxes, and by specific positions within the boxes. It is higher when the boxes are exactly 17 bps apart. These findings can be partially explained by the flexibility of -35 boxes, which enables adjacent bases to create overlapping and new -35 boxes. Our work can help to engineer synthetic promoters for strength and robustness, and to understand the dynamics of promoter evolution.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""31003A_172887;310030_208174;""},{""name"":""University of Zurich"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02crff812"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FK-23-120;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998778

Understanding how gut microbes interact and contribute to plastic degradation is essential for developing potential microbiome-based bioremediation strategies. We isolated 184 microbes from wild Alaskan threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) guts across six lakes and screened for plastic degrading potential using lipase/esterase assays and biofilm formation on PET and PP. During the screen for microbes with plastic degrading potential, we discovered that stickleback gut microbiota members enhance and suppressed the lipase, esterase, and biofilm activity of other microbes. Isolates with the highest plastic degrading potential were incubated in minimal media with PET or PP as the sole carbon source to determine whether plastic degradation potential is enhanced. Surface analysis identified a Pseudomonas trivialis strain that exhibited degradation of PP in monoculture; however, this activity was suppressed in the presence of another gut isolate, Pseudomonas germanica.

BCI implants have targeted broad cortical regions known to have relevant motor representations, but emerging technologies will allow flexible targeting to specific neural populations. The structure of motor representations at this scale, however, has not been well characterized across frontal motor cortices. Here, we investigate how motor representations and population dynamics (temporal coordination) vary across a large expanse of frontal motor cortices. We used high-density, laminar, microelectrode arrays to simultaneously record many neurons and then sampled neural populations across frontal motor cortex in two monkeys while they performed a reaching task. Our experiments allowed us to map neuronal activity across three spatial dimensions and relate them to movement. Target decoding analysis revealed that task information was heterogeneously distributed across the cortical surface and in depth. Similarly, we found that the temporal dynamics of different neural populations were heterogeneous, but that the amount of task information predicted which neural populations had similar dynamics. The neural populations with the most similar dynamics were composed of neurons with high task information regardless of spatial location. Our results highlight the spatiotemporal complexity of motor representations across frontal motor cortex at the level of neurons and neural populations, where well-learned movements consistently recruit a spatially distributed subset of neurons. Further insights into the spatiotemporal structure of neural activity patterns across frontal motor cortex will be critical to guide future implants for improved BCI performance.

Significance StatementMotor brain-computer interfaces (BCI) translate neural activity into movement, but how to target implants within motor cortices to maximize performance remains unclear. We used high-density recordings of neural activity spanning a large cortical area and related them to movement to map the spatial distribution of task information and the evolution of neural population activity over time. Our measurements revealed that neurons with the most task information were heterogeneously distributed across cortex yet also evolved coherently in time, suggesting that spatially distributed neurons coordinate to control movements. Our results provide new links between neuron- and population-level maps of motor representations, and highlight the complex spatiotemporal structure of activity that may need to be considered when designing next-generation BCIs.","[{""name"":""National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TL1 TR002318;""},{""name"":""Heiwa Nakajima Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/000k40t10"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Graduate Fellowship;""},{""name"":""Weill Neurohub"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""postdoctoral fellowship;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Simons Collaboration for the Global Brain Pilot award, 898220;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2117997;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIH R01 NS134634;UF1NS126485;""},{""name"":""Office of Research Infrastructure Programs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01jdyfj45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P51 OD010425;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998779

Dysregulation of microglial activation occurs in numerous brain disorders, and driving or inhibiting specific states could be therapeutic. To discover regulators of microglial activation states, we conducted CRISPR interference screens in iPSC-derived microglia for inhibitors and activators of six microglial states. We identified transcriptional regulators for each of these states and characterized 31 regulators at the single-cell transcriptomic and cell-surface proteome level in two distinct iPSC-derived microglia models. Finally, we functionally characterized several regulators. STAT2 knockdown inhibits interferon response and lysosomal function. PRDM1 knockdown drives disease-associated and lipid-rich signatures and enhanced phagocytosis. DNMT1 knockdown results in widespread loss of methylation, activating negative regulators of interferon signaling. These findings provide a framework to direct microglial activation to selectively enrich microglial activation states, define their functional outputs, and inform future therapies.

We attenuated ACD across distinct striatal regions, finding that ACD attenuation specifically in ventral striatum (VS) increased decision noisiness and impaired reward-guided choice. This effect was largely due to a reduction in ""win-stay"" behavior. Using in-vivo calcium imaging, we found that VS ACD correlated with reward prediction errors (RPEs). Furthermore, these trial-by-trial ACD fluctuations predicted trial-by-trial choice variability. Finally, ex-vivo slice electrophysiology and computational modeling revealed two mechanisms through which astrocytes could regulate behavioral variability: by regulating presynaptic excitatory-inhibitory balance, and by sharing RPE signals across populations of striatal neurons.

The DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), classically defined as the maintenance methyltransferase that preserves DNA methylation patterns during replication, exemplifies this versatility. Beyond its canonical role, DNMT1 is highly expressed in the developing and adult brain, where it contributes to transcriptional regulation in postmitotic neurons. Notably, cytoplasmic DNMT1 localization has been observed in neural cells, and emerging evidence links DNMT1 to mitochondrial function with implications for neurodegenerative disease, whereby the underlying functional mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.

Here, we identify a previously unrecognized cytosolic function of DNMT1 in developing cortical excitatory neurons. Through genetic perturbation, proteomics, and high-resolution imaging, we show that DNMT1 regulates dendritic and axonal branching independently of its catalytic activity and nuclear localization. Instead, DNMT1 operates as a cytosolic scaffold interacting with the polarity regulator DOCK7 to modulate Rac1-STMN1 signaling, microtubule dynamics, and organelle trafficking. These findings expand the conceptual framework of DNMT1 from a genome guardian to a dual-compartment regulator that coordinates cytoskeletal remodeling and mitochondrial positioning. Beyond advancing our understanding of neuronal morphogenesis, this work provides mechanistic insight into how DNMT1 mutations may lead to neurodegenerative diseases.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ZI-1224/13-1;ZI-1224/13-1;368482240/GRK2416;""},{""name"":""Excellence Strategy of the Federal Government and the Länder"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OPSF678;OPSF812;SFASIA002;""},{""name"":""European Union&#8722;NextGenerationEU-HEAL ITALIA"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PE00000019;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998779

We find that Oct4 increases DNA accessibility not by decondensing chromatin, but by driving fibres into compact liquid-like states in which nucleosomes breathe, reorient, exchange neighbours, and transiently expose DNA. Oct4 binds preferentially to linker DNA through its structured POU domains, while its disordered activation domains mediate cluster formation: a three-stage process consisting of nucleation of small clusters, attachment to chromatin via the DNA binding domains, and growth that is amplified when long DNA linkers enable fibre bending and looping. Oct4 clusters deform chromatin and bridge distal DNA segments in a stoichiometry- and linker length-dependent manner, revealing a tunable mechanism for controlling higher-order structure. Together, our results establish how Oct4 exploits multivalency, nucleosome breathing, and chromatin flexibility to reorganise fibres into liquid-like states that reconcile condensation with enhanced accessibility, providing a physical route to overcome the transcription-factor  search problem and activate silenced genes during reprogramming.","[{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X02332X/1;EP/Z002028/1;EP/X035603/1;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""803326;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998779

However, emerging viral variants have escaped all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved NAb treatments, underscoring the urgent need for effective therapeutic alternatives. Using a nanoluciferase (Nluc)-expressing attenuated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 lacking the open reading frames (ORF) 3a and 7b ({Delta}3a7b-Nluc), we characterized resistance profiles of two broadly protective NAbs targeting the S receptor binding domain (RBD) in S1 (1301B7) and the stem helix domain (SH) in S2 (1249A8). Serial passaging of {Delta}3a7b-Nluc under selective pressure identified a 1301B7 antibody-resistant mutants (ARM-B7) harboring an RBD mutation (S371F) that conferred resistance to 1301B7 and other RBD-directed NAbs (Casirivimab, SC27 and Sotrovimab). In contrast, no ARM emerged under treatment with 1249A8, or an antibody cocktail of 1301B7 (RBD) + 1249A8 (SH). These findings demonstrate that S2 SH-targeting NAbs shows higher genetic barrier to resistance than S1 RBD-targeting NAbs, and that a NAbs cocktail therapy targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD and S2 SH offers the most effective strategy to prevent the emergence of escape mutations. Together, our findings provide critical insights into developing next-generation resistance-evading NAb therapies against SARS-CoV-2, and potentially other coronaviruses, and demonstrate the value of using our attenuated viral platforms for the safe identification of ARM without the potential biosafety concerns of doing these experiments using wild-type (WT) forms of SARS-CoV-2.

SIGNIFICANCEThe clinical efficacy of early SARS-CoV-2 NAbs has been challenged by the emergence of escape viral variants, highlighting an urgent need to anticipate resistance. Using a luminescent attenuated SARS-CoV-2 platform, we profiled resistant mutations against two broadly protective SARS-CoV-2 NAbs. Passage of {Delta}3a7b-Nluc in the presence of a NAb targeting the RBD S1 domain (1301B7) readily selected for an ARM, whereas passage in the presence of an SH S2 domain NAb (1249A8) did not. Notably, a cocktail of 1301B7 and 1249A8 created a high barrier of selecting SARS-CoV-2 ARM, preventing the emergence of resistant variants. We identified an S371F mutation in the S1 RBD of ARM-B7 that confers resistance to 1301B7 and other S1 RBD-targeting NAbs. These results highlight the importance of combination therapies targeting both variable RBD S1 and conserved SH S2 domain for the efficient treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and to prevent the emerge of NAb-induced escape mutations.","[{""name"":""NIAID"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 AI161363;75N93021C00014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998779

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998779

While clonal expansions in the hematopoietic system have been extensively characterized and reported to be nearly ubiquitous, clonal mosaicism (CM) has more recently also been described across multiple solid tissues. However, outstanding questions remain about the parameters and processes of human somatic evolution in non-cancerous solid human tissues, including when clones arise, how they evolve over time, and what mechanisms lead to their expansion. Questions of timing and clonal dynamics can be addressed through phylogenetic reconstruction, which serves as a  temporal microscope, while uncovering the mechanisms of expansion necessitates simultaneous phenotypic profiling. To address this gap, here we develop Single-cell Miniaturized Automated Reverse Transcription and Primary Template-directed Amplification (SMART-PTA) for joint single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing for large scale and cost efficient interrogation of solid tissue CM. We established a workflow that generates hundreds of matched single-cell whole genome and transcriptome libraries within a week. We profiled phenotypically normal esophagus tissue from four aged donors and used somatic variants to build high-resolution single-cell lineages from >2,700 cells with accompanying transcriptomic information, reconstructing >70 years of somatic evolution. T cell expansions identified from T cell receptor (TCR) sequences validated the clonal structure of the single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based phylogenies and phylogenetic cross-correlation analysis showed that epithelial cells had higher degrees of shared ancestry by spatial location compared to immune cells. Mapping mutation signatures to the phylogenetic tree revealed the emergence of tobacco/alcohol exposure-related signatures later in life, consistent with the donors exposure histories. We identified variants in driver genes that were previously reported in the phenotypically normal esophagus, detecting clonal expansions harboring mutations in genes including TP53 and FAT1. We mapped the evolution of clones with both monoallelic as well as biallelic TP53 loss, including a clone associated with high expression of cell cycling genes and higher chromosome instability. Leveraging the matched transcriptome data, we uncovered cell type biases in mutant clones, with a higher proportion of TP53 or FAT1-mutant cells in an earlier basal epithelial cell state compared to wild-type cells. We further observed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) events on chromosome 9q that spanned the NOTCH1 locus in up to [~]35% of epithelial cells. Mapping CNLOH events to the phylogenetic tree revealed a striking pattern in which CNLOH was separately acquired many times, reflecting convergent evolution. Cells with CNLOH events were biased towards the earlier basal epithelial state, suggestive of a selective advantage that leads to prevalent recurrence of chr9q CNLOH. Together, we demonstrate that SMART-PTA is an efficient, scalable approach for single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome profiling to build phenotypically annotated single-cell phylogenies with enough throughput and power for application to normal tissue somatic evolution. Moreover, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the esophageal epithelium at high scale and resolution, providing a window into the dynamics and processes that shape clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues throughout a lifespan.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3NS132139;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R33 CA267219;""},{""name"":""NIDDK"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30 DK132710;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RM1HG011014;""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01d35cw23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Career Award for Medical Scientists;""},{""name"":""Vallee Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05nmp3276"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Scholar Award;""},{""name"":""Blood Cancer United"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00v7th354"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MacMillan Family Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998779

Here, we developed a new computational framework to minimize negative transfer for domain-adaptive brain decoding by reframing source selection as a mixture model parameter estimation problem, allowing each source subject to contribute through a continuous mixture weight rather than being outright included or excluded. To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer. Collectively, this research advances toward a more principled and generalizable brain decoding framework, laying the mathematical foundation for scalable brain-computer interfaces and other applications in computational neuroscience.","[{""name"":""Schroeder Institute for Brain Innovation and Recovery"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998779

A promising strategy for ""proteome editing"" is to use bifunctional molecules (e.g. PROteolysis-Targeting Chimeras or PROTACs1) that bring a target protein into proximity with a degradation or stabilization effector, but their broader application is constrained by a limited repertoire of well-characterized target or effector ""handles"". We asked whether coupling de novo protein design to a multiplex screening framework could address this gap by accelerating the discovery of effector handles for intracellular protein degradation, stabilization, or relocalization. Using LABEL-seq2, a sequencing-based assay that enables multiplex, quantitative measurement of protein abundance, we screened 9,715 de novo designed candidate effector handles for their ability to recruit a target protein to components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system3 (UPS) (FBXL12, TRAF2, UCHL1, USP38) or the autophagy pathway4 (GABARAP, GABARAPL2, MAP1LC3A). In a single experiment, we discovered hundreds of de novo designed effector handles that reproducibly drove either intracellular degradation (n = 277) or stabilization (n = 204) of a reporter protein. Validation of a subset of these hits in an orthogonal assay confirmed that sequencing-based measurements from the primary screen reliably reflected changes in intracellular abundance of the target protein. Successful effector handles were discovered for both the UPS (n = 194) and autophagy (n = 287) pathways, which provide complementary routes for programmable proteome editing. Autophagy-recruiting effector handles generalized to endogenous targets, as substituting the reporter-specific target handle with a high-affinity MCL1 binder5 reduced endogenous levels of this intracellular oncoprotein6. Moreover, directing autophagy-recruiting effector handles to the outer mitochondrial membrane dramatically perturbed mitochondrial networks in a manner consistent with synthetic tethering and sequestration7,8. Beyond generating a diverse repertoire of protein abundance or localization effector handles, our results establish a scalable, low-cost platform that links deep learning-guided protein design to functional cellular readouts, and chart a course toward a general framework for programmable proteome editing.","[{""name"":""National Heart Lung and Blood Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012pb6c26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31HL168982;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T32GM136534;""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV-043758;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG010632;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998779

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility.

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998779

In sum, this platform provides a comprehensive 3D atlas of early neoplastic transformation, yielding mechanistic insights into tumor initiation and informing clinical screening strategies for detecting cancer precursors in whole organs at cellular resolution.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U54CA268083;RO1CA300052;UG3CA275681;P50CA228991;R01GM149976;U01AI167892;5R01NS111039;R21NS125395;U54 HL165443;U54 DK 134301;R01 HL170107;U2CCA271891;""},{""name"":""Sloan research fellow award, a CZI Scialog award, and UCSD Startup funds"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Johns Hopkins University and Instituto Superior Técnico student exchange program (HOPTEC and FLAD)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Richard W.

This is especially a problem in children, where cancer survivors experience a subsequent high risk of bone mineral deficits and fractures, normally seen in the older population. Here, we model this to show that early-life treatment with a single dose of the commonly used chemotherapy cisplatin profoundly impairs late-life bone health, and that these bone deficits are completely resolved through treatment with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). While we had previously shown that this same strategy protects against chemotherapy induced female infertility, this maintenance of aged bone health appears to be unrelated to endocrine changes due to protection of the ovarian reserve. Rather, this is driven by altered phosphorus homeostasis and protection against renal damage, which otherwise increases parathyroid hormone secretion to mobilise calcium stores from bone. Overall, this work highlights a new approach for maintaining healthy bone ageing in cancer survivors.","[{""name"":""American Federation for Aging Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/000r61a05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Hevolution/AFAR New Investigator Award in Aging Biology;""},{""name"":""National Health and Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/011kf5r70"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""APP1139763;APP1127821;APP2009940;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998779

Here, we question this view by demonstrating cross-communication between distinct arbitrium systems. Using prototypical arbitrium phages, we demonstrate that AimP peptides bind and repress unrelated AimR receptors, promoting lysogeny and reducing prophage induction.

In mixed lysogenic cultures, these interactions shape induction outcomes, demonstrating ecological relevance. We extent these findings to infection contexts, showing that arbitrium signalling influences outcomes in cells harbouring prophages with compatible communicating systems.

This revealed that selenoprotein production is limited by ribosome collisions that occur at inefficiently decoded selenocysteine codons. Accordingly, slowed translation elongation reduced collisions and enhanced selenocysteine decoding. Oxidative stress also slowed translation elongation and augmented selenoprotein production. We identified translation elongation factor EEF1G as a sensor of oxidized glutathione that couples the cellular redox state to translation elongation rate.

Little is known, however, about whether and how phages can establish long-term genetic stability. We addressed this eco-evolutionary question in an open marine animal associated system, through two longitudinal samplings years apart in an oyster farm, obtaining >1,000 virulent phages and >600 Vibrio crassostreae strains. Surprisingly, lineages of phage and bacteria were very persistent, with some phages remaining strictly identical after four years. The phage-vibrio infection network remained modular with multiple lineages co-habitating within individual oysters for long periods of time. Seasonal restriction of V. crassostreae, overwintering in wild oysters, and limited viral decay may explain phage stability. Oysters also act as hotspots of activity of diverse mobile genetic element (MGE), hosting plasmids, prophages, phage-plasmids and entirely new classes of satellite-plasmids. Our findings demonstrate how nested ecological constraints can stabilize viral lineages: oysters house vibrio populations that escape host immunity, vibrios restrict phages via receptors and defenses, and satellites parasitize their cognate helper phages. We suggest that ecological context can favor the long-term maintenance of viral lineages and stabilize MGE persistence in the ocean, even amid ongoing mutation and antagonistic co-evolution.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""884988;""},{""name"":""Canada Excellence Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02tvrwm90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-00051;""},{""name"":""FRQ-NT, Fonds des leaders John-R.-Evans"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""44584;""},{""name"":""ANR"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""20-CE35-0014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998779

We design RNA structures with novel folds and experimentally validate them using a combination of chemical footprinting (SHAPE-seq) and electron microscopy. We further use this approach to design protein-nucleic acid assemblies; the crystal structure of one such design is nearly identical to the design model. This work demonstrates that the principles of structure-based de novo protein design can be extended to nucleic acids, opening the door to creating a wide range of new RNA structures and protein-nucleic acid complexes.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998779

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has allowed proteome-scale quantification of hundreds of thousands of ubiquitination sites (ubi-sites), however the functional importance and regulatory roles of most ubi-sites remain undefined. Here, we assembled a human reference ubiquitinome of 108,341 ubi-sites by harmonizing public proteomics data. We identified a core subset of ubi-sites under evolutionary constraint through alignment of ubiquitin proteomics data from six non-human species, and determined ultra-conserved ubi-sites recurring at regulatory hotspots within protein domains. Perturbation proteomics revealed that these highly conserved ubi-sites are more likely to regulate signaling functions rather than proteasomal degradation. To further prioritize functional ubi-sites with roles in cellular signaling, we constructed a functional score for more than 100,000 ubi-sites by integrating evolutionary, proteomic, and structural features using machine learning. Our score identifies ubi-sites regulating diverse protein functions and rationalizes mechanisms of genetic disease. Finally, we employed chemical genomics to validate the functional relevance of high-scoring ubi-sites and leveraged genetic code expansion to demonstrate that ubiquitination of K320 in the RNA-regulator ELAVL1 disrupts RNA binding. Our work reveals systems-level principles of the ubiquitinome and provides a powerful resource for studying protein ubiquitination.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998779

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761602998779

Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid.

We discovered that this neuron is required for navigating both attractive odor and aversive temperature cues and is activated by attractive cues, such as food odour and sugar, and inhibited by different aversive cues, such as cooling, salt, or non-food odors.
