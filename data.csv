We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1723932349909

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Thereafter, JN.1 subvariants, such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1), KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), and KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which convergently acquired a deletion of Serine at the 31st position in S (S:S31del) in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We recently reported the virological features of JN.1 subvariants including KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3.2,3 Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.3.1.1. First, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3.1.1 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model4 based on genome surveillance data from Spain, the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, where this variant has spread as of June 2024. In Spain, the Re of KP.3.1.1 is over 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and even higher than those of KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein show higher Re for KP.3.1.1. However, it must be noted there is the possibility of overestimation in these countries due to more limited KP.3.1.1 sequence numbers. These results suggest that KP.3.1.1 will spread worldwide along with other JN.1 sublineages. We then assessed the virological properties of KP.3.1.1 using pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus of KP.3.1.1 had significantly higher infectivity than that of KP.3. Neutralization of KP.3.1.1 was tested using i) convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or EG.5, ii) convalescent sera after the infection with HK.3 or JN.1, and iii) sera after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.3.1.1 was significantly lower than KP.3 (1.4-1.6-fold) in all four groups of convalescent sera tested. KP.3.1.1 also showed a 1.3-fold lower NT50 against XBB.1.5 vaccine sera than KP.3. Moreover, KP.3.1.1 showed stronger resistance with a 1.3-fold lower NT50 with statistical significances to the convalescent sera infected with EG.5 and HK.3 than KP.2.3. Altogether, KP.3.1.1 exhibited a higher Re, higher pseudovirus infectivity, and higher neutralization evasion than KP.3. These results align with our recent report that the JN.1 subvariants with S:S31del (e.g., KP.2.3 and LB.1) exhibited enhanced Re and immune evasion compared to the other JN.1 subvariants without S:S31del (e.g., JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3), highlighting the evolutionary significance of S:S31del in the JN.1 lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

During REM sleep, the brain's internal representation of direction keeps shifting like that of an awake animal moving through its environment. What causes these shifts, given the immobility of the sleeping animal? Here we show that the superior colliculus of the mouse, a motor command center involved in orienting movements, issues motor commands during REM sleep, e.g. turn left, that are similar to those issued in the awake behaving animal. Strikingly, these motor commands, despite not being executed, shift the internal representation of direction as if the animal had turned. Thus, during REM sleep, the brain simulates actions by issuing motor commands that, while not executed, have consequences as if they had been. This study suggests that the sleeping brain, while disengaged from the external world, uses its internal model of the world to simulate interactions with it.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Herein we propose (depict) a rigorous system to evaluate the complex interaction between the two infections in vitro in a lung epithelial cell line (A549). Overall, the process includes eight steps: (I) Mtb culture, (II) cell maintenance, (III) preparation of viral stocks, (IV) determination of infectious titers, (V) Mtb and SARS2 co-infection, (VI) determination of intracellular bacterial load, (VII) SARS2 viability test, and (VIII) decontamination of supernatants.

In this context, a major transcriptional response of microglia is the upregulation of APOE, the strongest late-onset AD risk gene. Of its three isoforms, APOE2 is thought to be protective, while APOE4 increases AD risk. We hypothesised that the isoforms functionally alter microglia by shaping their transcriptomic and chromatin landscapes. We used RNA- and ATAC-sequencing to profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility of human microglia isolated from a xenotransplantation model of AD. We identified widespread transcriptomic and epigenomic differences which are dependent on APOE genotype, and are corroborated across the profiling assays. Our results indicate that impaired microglial proliferation, migration and immune responses may contribute to the increased risk for late-onset AD in APOE4 carriers, while increased DNA-binding of the vitamin D receptor in APOE2 microglia may contribute to the isoforms protective role.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

However, identifying gene function is often hampered by genetic redundancy. For example, under standard laboratory conditions, three-quarters of the genes in the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae are non-essential. A powerful approach to unravel genetic redundancy is by identifying gene-gene interactions. To uncover genetic interactions (GIs) in S. pneumoniae on a genome-wide scale, a generally applicable dual CRISPRi-Seq method and associated analysis pipeline was developed. Specifically, we created a library of 869 dual sgRNAs targeting high-confidence operons that encode essential and non-essential genes, covering over 70% of the genetic elements in the pneumococcal genome. Testing these 378,015 unique combinations, 4,026 significant GIs were identified, including 1,935 negative and 2,091 positive interactions. Besides known GIs, we found and confirmed previously unknown interactions involving genes responsible for fundamental cellular processes such as cell division, cell shape maintenance, and chromosome segregation. The presented methods and bioinformatic approaches can serve as a roadmap for genome-wide gene interaction studies in other organisms. Lastly, all interactions are available for exploration via the Pneumococcal Genetic Interaction Network (PneumoGIN) at https://veeninglab.shinyapps.io/PneumoGIN, which can serve as a starting point for new biological discoveries and translational research.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Large-scale studies have been able to detect genetic variants with contributions to height in the range of approximately 1.2 millimetre per allele copy on average. Non-additive genetic interactions may, in part, account for the difference between broad-sense and narrow-sense heritability estimates. However, prior studies have failed to identify variants with non-additive effects, possibly due to the lack of statistical power. Leveraging 3.6M individuals of European genetic ancestry in the 23andMe research cohort, we performed a genome-wide analysis study (GWAS) to select 1,063 independent common SNPs associated with height (p-value < 5e-8), and then screened for evidence of non-additive effects by analysing 564,453 models including a pairwise SNP-SNP interaction term. We identified 69 pairwise models with suggestive evidence of SNP-SNP interaction (p-value < 1e-4) and, for each SNP pair, we evaluated a fully saturated model including additive, dominant, and epistatic (additive-by-additive, additive-by-dominance and dominance-by-dominance) terms. We tested for the presence of epistatic interactions by comparing models with and without epistatic terms using a likelihood ratio test. Assuming a strict Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 8.9e-8 (0.05/564,453), we found no evidence of epistatic interactions (Likelihood ratio test (LRT) p-value < 9e-07 for all models). Our analysis rules out the existence of epistatic interactions between alleles of >1% frequency with effect sizes larger than 2.42mm. Our large-scale analysis provides further evidence of the minimal contribution of non-additivity in the genetic architecture of adult human height.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Isolated microglia were sorted based on reporter expression and their transcriptomic profiles acquired in both wildtype and APP transgenic animals, allowing us to disentangle TREM2 versus pathology-specific effects. Bulk RNA-sequencing highlighted TREM2 level-dependent changes in major immunometabolic pathways, with enrichment of genes in oxidative phosphorylation and cholesterol metabolism in microglia with increased TREM2 expression. To confirm these findings, we next analysed uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and examined metabolomic and lipidomic profiles. Again, independent of A{beta} pathology, TREM2 expression correlated with uptake of FDG as well as increased cellular redox, energetics, and cholesterol homeostasis. Finally, we performed chronic treatment with a brain penetrant TREM2 agonist and identified a window of TREM2 expression where microglia are most responsive. Thus, our data provide novel insights into TREM2-mediated regulation of microglial metabolic function and informs current efforts to bring TREM2 agonists into clinical application.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

This has led to breakthrough infections (BTI) in vaccinated individuals, with a large proportion of the neutralizing antibody response targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein. Immune imprinting, where prior exposure of an antigen to the immune system can influence the response to subsequent exposures, and its role in a population with heterogenous exposure histories has important implications in future vaccine design. Here, we develop an accessible approach to map epitope immunodominance of the neutralizing antibody response in sera. By using a panel of mutant Spike in a pseudovirus neutralization assay, we observed distinct epitope usage in convalescent donors infected during wave 1, or infected with the Delta, or BA.1 variants, highlighting the antigenic diversity of the variant Spikes. Analysis of longitudinal serum samples taken spanning 3 doses of vaccine and subsequent breakthrough infection (BTI), showed the influence of immune imprinting from the ancestral-based vaccine, where reactivation of existing B cells elicited by the vaccine resulted in the enrichment of the pre-existing epitope immunodominance. However, subtle shifts in epitope usage in sera were observed following BTI by Omicron sub-lineage variants. Antigenic distance of Spike, time after last exposure, and number of vaccine boosters may play a role in the persistence of imprinting from the vaccine. This study provides insight into RBD neutralizing epitope usage in individuals with varying exposure histories and has implications for design of future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Author SummaryThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants has resulted in a rise in breakthrough infections (BTIs). Infection with different variants has led to varying exposure histories in the general population. Although the neutralizing response to Spike has been thoroughly characterized, with several key epitopes identified, there is a lack of knowledge of the proportion each epitope contributes to the neutralizing response in sera and how this is affected by exposure history. Here, we use a panel of mutant Spike pseudoviruses to screen epitope usage and immunodominance in polyclonal sera. In a cohort of unvaccinated donors infected with different variants, distinct epitope usage was observed, highlighting the antigenic diversity between the variant Spikes. Furthermore, samples collected spanning multiple vaccine doses and BTI showed the influence of prior immunity from the vaccine on epitope usage. Although a large proportion of the immune response following BTI could be attributed to enrichment of pre-existing immunodominance from the vaccine, subtle shifts in epitope usage were observed with infection by more mutated variants. This work gives more detailed insight into differences in the neutralizing response of individuals with varying exposure histories that may inform next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Scatter pie plots are one type of commonly used data visualization for such data but present perceptual challenges that may lead to difficulties in interpretation.

We developed scatterbar, an open-source R package that extends ggplot2, to visualize proportional data across many spatially resolved coordinates using scatter stacked bar plots. We apply scatterbar to visualize deconvolved cell-type proportions from a spatial transcriptomics dataset of the mouse olfactory bulb to demonstrate how scatter stacked bar plots can enhance the distinguishability of proportional distributions compared to scatter pie plots.

Dysfunction in different networks is proposed to associate with distinct symptoms in neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the specific networks targeted by current clinical transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) approaches are unclear. While standard-of-care TMS relies on scalp-based landmarks, recent FDA-approved TMS protocols use individualized functional connectivity with the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) to optimize TMS targeting. Leveraging previous work on precision network estimation and recent advances in network-level TMS targeting, we demonstrate that clinical TMS approaches target different functional networks between individuals. Homotopic scalp positions (left F3 and right F4) target different networks within and across individuals, and right F4 generally favors a right-lateralized control network. We also modeled the impact of targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) zone anticorrelated with the sgACC and found that the individual-specific anticorrelated region variably targets a network coupled to reward circuitry. Combining individualized, precision network mapping and electric field (E-field) modeling, we further illustrate how modeling can be deployed to prospectively target distinct closely localized association networks in the dlPFC with meaningful spatial selectivity and E-field intensity.

Individuals with pathological MAPT variants exhibit behavioural changes, cognitive impairment and signs of parkinsonism. Missense mutations of residue P301, which are the most common MAPT mutations associated with FTDP-17, give rise to the assembly of mutant four-repeat tau into filamentous inclusions, in the absence of extracellular deposits. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from five individuals belonging to three unrelated families with mutation P301L and from one individual belonging to a family with mutation P301T. A novel three-lobed tau fold resembling the two-layered tau fold of Pick's disease was present in all cases with the P301L tau mutation. Two different tau folds were found in the case with mutation P301T, the less abundant of which was a variant of the three-lobed fold. The major P301T tau fold was V-shaped, with partial similarity to the four-layered tau folds of corticobasal degeneration and argyrophilic grain disease. These findings suggest that FTDP-17 with mutations in P301 should be considered distinct inherited tauopathies and that model systems with these mutations should be used with caution in the study of sporadic tauopathies.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1723932349910

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

However, it is unclear how recent WGDs may contribute to evolvability within recent polyploids. Hybridization accompanying some WGDs may combine divergent gene content among diploid species. Some theory and evidence suggest that polyploids have a greater accumulation and tolerance of gene presence-absence and genomic structural variation, but it is unclear to what extent either is true. To test how recent polyploidy may influence pangenomic variation, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated twelve complete, chromosome-scale genomes of Camelina sativa, an allohexaploid biofuel crop with three distinct subgenomes. Using pangenomic comparative analyses, we characterized gene presence-absence and genomic structural variation both within and between the subgenomes. We found over 75% of ortholog gene clusters are core in Camelina sativa and <10% of sequence space was affected by genomic structural rearrangements. In contrast, 19% of gene clusters were unique to one subgenome, and the majority of these were Camelina-specific (no ortholog in Arabidopsis). We identified an inversion that may contribute to vernalization requirements in winter-type Camelina, and an enrichment of Camelina-specific genes with enzymatic processes related to seed oil quality and Camelina's unique glucosinolate profile. Genes related to these traits exhibited little presence-absence variation. Our results reveal minimal pangenomic variation in this species, and instead show how hybridization accompanied by WGD may benefit polyploids by merging diverged gene content of different species.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

In several major Asian cities, public food centres are the main venue for food consumption and yet we lack a baseline understanding of their environmental microbiomes. We conducted city-wide metagenomic surveillance of food-centre microbiomes in Singapore (16 centres, n=240 samples) to provide a detailed map of microbial (bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses) as well as non-microbial DNA abundances across two timepoints. Food-centre microbiomes were found to be enriched in food-related DNA signatures compared to other environments such as hospitals and offices, with specific food-microbe associations (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae and fish) and food DNA providing a partial explanation for the microbial profiles observed (44% of variation explained). Machine learning analysis identified a small set of microbial species (n=22) that serve as highly accurate (>80%) location-specific signatures for various food centres, some of which persist even after 3 years. Profiling of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens identified a surprising enrichment of ARGs in food centres relative to other non-healthcare environments (>2.5{xi}), and an order of magnitude enrichment of key pathogenic species (e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp) even compared to hospital environments. These results highlight the contribution of diverse biotic and abiotic factors in shaping the unique microbiome profiles of different food-centre environments, and the potential for using metagenomic surveillance to understand the risk for infections and antibiotic resistance gene transmission.","NA","medrxiv",1723932349910

We compared A{beta} production across all missense PSEN2 variants in the Alzforum database and, when possible, to corresponding PSEN1 variants.

METHODSWe expressed 74 PSEN2 variants, 21 of which had homologous PSEN1 variants with the same amino acid substitution, in HEK293 cells lacking PSN1/2. A{beta} production was compared to age at symptom onset (AAO) and between homologous PSEN1/2 variants.

RESULTSA{beta}42/40 and A{beta}37/42 ratios were associated with AAO across PSEN2 variants, strongly driven by PSEN2 variants with PSEN1 homologs. PSEN2 AAO was 18.3 years later compared to PSEN1 homologs. A{beta} ratios from PSEN1/2 homologs were highly correlated, suggesting a similar mechanism of {gamma}-secretase dysfunction.

DISCUSSIONThe existence of a PSEN1 homolog and patterns of A{beta} production are important considerations in assessing the pathogenicity of previously-reported and new PSEN2 variants.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Exploitation of this largely unexplored molecular space requires identification and functional characterisation of genes that act at the phage-host interface. To date, this is restricted to few model phage-host systems that are amenable to genetic manipulation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a non-genetic mRNA targeting approach using exogenous delivery of programmable antisense oligomers (ASOs) to silence genes of both DNA and RNA phages. A systematic knockdown screen of core and accessory genes of the nucleus-forming jumbo phage {Phi}KZ, coupled to RNA-sequencing and microscopy analyses, reveals previously unrecognised proteins that are essential for phage replication and that, upon silencing, elicit distinct phenotypes at the level of the phage and host response. One of these factors is a {Phi}KZ-encoded nuclease that acts at a major decision point during infection, linking the formation of the protective phage nucleus to phage genome amplification. The non-genetic ASO-based gene silencing used here promises to be a versatile tool for molecular discovery in phage biology, will help elucidate defence and anti-defence mechanisms in non-model phage-host pairs, and offers potential for optimising phage therapy and biotechnological procedures.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Our model employs a dual-track framework that tokenizes proteins into token-level and atomic-level representations, integrating them through a multi-layer decoding process with traversing representations and recycling mechanism. We also introduce the atom14 representation method, which unifies the description of unknown side-chain coordinates, ensuring high fidelity between the generated all-atom conformation and its physical structure. Experimental results demonstrate that Pallatom excels in key metrics of protein design, including designability, diversity, and novelty, showing significant improvements across the board.

Understanding how environmental factors shape the genetic differentiation of natural populations and identifying the genetic basis of local adaptation will provide insights into how species may cope with environmental changes. The buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) has a wide natural distribution range and has been successfully domesticated to produce commercial colonies for greenhouse pollination. Previous population genetics studies on B. terrestris have mainly focused on populations in Europe; however, populations in Asia, representing the eastern side of its natural distribution, have been less thoroughly sampled. To fill this gap, we collected wild B. terrestris samples from Asia, as well as wild B. terrestris from Europe and samples from domesticated colonies. We conducted whole-genome resequencing for 77 collected B. terrestris workers and performed population genomics analysis. Our results indicated distinct genetic differentiation (FST=0.076) exists between buff-tailed bumblebees in Europe and Asia, with substantial morphological and physiological differences detected between them; B. terrestris in Asia likely represents a new subspecies. Demographic analysis suggested that the population size of buff-tailed bumblebees had increased during historic cold periods, confirming their cold-adapted characteristics. Selective sweep analysis identified 331 genes under selection in the genomes of Asian B. terrestris, likely involved in their adaptation to high ultraviolet radiation, low temperature, and low precipitation in their habitats. Our research provides insights into the population genetic structure and genetic basis of local adaptation in the buff-tailed bumblebee, which will be useful for its conservation and management.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Although nutrient availability and temperature are key interlinked factors for a sustained plant growth, the molecular mechanisms underlying their sensing and downstream signaling pathways remain unclear. Here, we identified that moderate low temperature (10C) condition triggers a strong RH elongation response involving several molecular components of the auxin pathway. Then, we have determined that auxin biosynthesis carried out by YUCCAs/TAA1, the auxin transport conducted by PIN2/PIN4 and AUX1/PGP4, and the auxin signaling controlled by TIR1/AFB2 coupled to four specific ARFs (ARF6/ARF8 and ARF7/ARF19), are all crucial for the RH response at moderate low temperature. These results uncover the auxin pathway as being one central hub under moderate low temperature in the roots to trigger RH growth.

Many pathogenic and oncogenic viruses encode E3 ligases (vE3s), which de facto have strictly limited expression to diseased cells. Here, we provide proof-of-concept for Viral E3 Pan-Essential Removing Targeting Chimeras (VIPER-TACs) that are bi-functional molecules that utilize viral E3 ubiquitin ligases to selectively degrade pan-essential proteins and eliminate diseased cells. We find that the human papillomavirus (HPV) ligase E6 can degrade the SARS1 pan-essential target protein in a model of HPV-positive cervical cancer to selectively kill E6 expressing cancer cells.

We establish interactions between DNAAF9 (human Shulin) and mammalian ODA subunits, IFT proteins and the ciliary small GTPase ARL3 using proteomics and in vitro reconstitutions. Mutagenesis combined with biochemical and structural studies reveal that DNAAF9 and Shulin preferentially bind the active Arl3-GTP state.

Using their surface bound T cell antigen receptors (TCRs), these cells, screen millions of antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or MHC-like molecules. In other protein families, the dynamics of protein-protein interactions have important implications for protein function. Case studies ofTCR:class I peptide-MHCs (pMHC-Is) structures have reported mixed results on whether the binding interfaces undergo conformational change during engagement and no robust statistical quantification has been done to generalise these results. It thus remains an open question if movement occurs in the binding interface that enables recognition and activation of T cells. In this work, we quantify the conformational changes in the TCR:pMHC-I binding interface by creating a dataset of 358 structures, comprising 25 TCRs, 20 MHC alleles, and 58 peptide structures in both unbound (apo) and bound (holo) conformations. In support of some case studies, we demonstrate that all complimentary determining region (CDR) loops move to a certain extent but only CDR3 and CDR3{beta} loops modify their shape when binding pMHC-Is. We also map out the contacts between TCRs and pMHC-Is, generating a novel fingerprint of TCRs on MHC molecules and show that the CDR3 tends to bind the N-terminus of the peptide and the CDR3{beta} tends to bind the C-terminus of the peptide. Finally, we show that the presented peptides can undergo conformational changes when engaged by TCRs, as has been reported in past literature, but novelly show these changes depend on how the peptides are anchored in the MHC binding groove. Our work has implications in understanding the behaviour of TCR:pMHC-I interactions and providing insights that can be used for modelling T cell antigen specificity, an ongoing grand challenge in immunology.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Functionally different classes of extant ARFs operate as antagonistic auxin-dependent and -independent regulators. While part of the evolutionary trajectory to the present auxin response functions has been reconstructed, it is unclear how ARFs emerged, and how early diversification led to functionally different proteins. Here, we use in silico and in vivo analyses to revisit the molecular events that led to the origin and subsequent evolution of the ARFs. We reveal the shared origin of ARFs from preexisting domains, uncovering a protein fold homologous to the ARF DNA-binding fold in a conserved eukaryotic chromatin regulator. Building on this, we reconstruct the complete evolutionary history of ARFs, including the divergence events leading to the appearance of the ARF classes and defining the main molecular targets for their functional diversification. We derive a complete evolutionary trajectory that led to the emergence of the nuclear auxin signalling pathway.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

While numerous approaches can probe the activity of given microbes in enrichment cultures, no single technique can render simultaneous data on both metabolic capacities and mobile genetic elements. Here, we apply long-read sequencing to monitor the incorporation of non-canonical bases in genome-resolved metagenomic datasets and elucidate the replication patterns of both bacteria and phages. This technology enables the simultaneous reconstruction of both prokaryotic and viral genomes (alongside genomics downstream analyses like metabolic predictions), in addition to providing information regarding their replication in enrichment cultures. By spiking the base analog 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) into activated sludge microcosms, we determined that 114 of the 118 high-quality genomes recovered were actively replicating in enrichment cultures from activated sludge and identified both slow (low BrdU incorporation and change in abundance) and rapidly replicating organisms (high BrdU incorporation and change in abundance). Some of the genomes detected exhibited regions rich in BrdU that were predicted to represent prophages in their lytic cycle. Ultimately, this novel means of monitoring the replication responses of microbes, and deciphering their genomes and active mobile genetic elements will advance and empower strategies aimed at isolating previously uncultivated microbes in pure culture.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

In combination with phylogenomics analyses, hybrid zone studies may illuminate the role of ancient and contemporary gene flow in shaping variation of phylogenetic signals across the genome, but this avenue has not been explored yet. We combined phylogenomic and geographic cline analyses in a Pogoniulus tinkerbird clade to determine whether contemporary introgression through hybrid zones contributes to gene-tree heterogeneity across the species ranges. We found diverse phylogenetic signals across the genome with the most common topologies supporting monophyly among taxa connected by secondary contact zones. Remarkably, these systematic conflicts were also recovered when selecting only individuals from each taxons core range. Using analyses of derived allele sharing and ""recombination aware"" phylogenomics, we found that introgression shapes gene-tree heterogeneity, and the species tree most likely supports monophyletic red-fronted tinkerbirds, as recovered in previous reconstructions based on mitochondrial DNA. Furthermore, by fitting geographic clines across two secondary contact zones, we found that introgression rates were lower in genomic regions supporting the putative species tree compared to those supporting the two taxa in contact as monophyletic. This demonstrates that introgression through narrow contact zones shapes gene-tree heterogeneity even in allopatric populations. Finally, we did not find evidence that mitochondria-interacting nuclear genes acted as barrier loci. Our results show that species can withstand important amounts of introgression while maintaining their phenotypic integrity and ecological separation, raising questions regarding the genomic architecture of adaptation and barriers to gene flow.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

To address this question, we optogenetically silenced the dHPC or the vHPC while simultaneously recording from the PFC of mice performing a SWM task. We found that whereas both HPC subregions were necessary during the encoding phase of the task, only the dHPC was necessary during the choice phase. Silencing of either subregion altered the spatial firing patterns of PFC neurons. However, only silencing of the vHPC affected their coding of spatial goals. These results thus reveal distinct contributions of the dorsal and ventral HPC poles to SWM and the coding of behaviorally-relevant spatial information by PFC neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

It imposes an enormous symptomatic burden on patients, leaving many with residual disease despite optimal procedural therapy, and up to 1/3 with debilitating angina amenable neither to procedures, nor to current pharmacologic options. Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist originally approved for management of diabetes, has garnered substantial attention for its capacity to attenuate cardiovascular risk. Although subgroup analyses in patients indicate promise, studies explicitly designed to isolate the impact of semaglutide on the sequelae of CAD, independently of comorbid diabetes or obesity, are lacking. Approach and Results: Yorkshire swine (n=17) underwent placement of an ameroid constrictor around the left circumflex coronary artery to induce CAD. Oral semaglutide was initiated postoperatively at 1.5 mg and scaled up in 2 weeks to 3 mg in treatment animals (SEM, n=8) for a total of 5 weeks, while control animals (CON, n=9) received no drug. All then underwent myocardial harvest with acquisition of perfusion and functional data using microsphere injection and pressure-volume loop catheterization. Immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were performed on the most ischemic myocardial segments for mechanistic elucidation. SEM animals exhibited improved left ventricular ejection fraction, both at rest and during rapid myocardial pacing (both p<0.03), accompanied by increased perfusion to the most ischemic myocardial region at rest and during rapid pacing (both p<0.03); reduced perivascular and interstitial fibrosis (both p <0.03); and apoptosis (p=0.008). These changes were associated with increased activation of the endothelial-protective AMPK pathway (p=0.005), coupled with downstream increases in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p=0.014). Conclusion: This study is the first to reveal the capacity of oral semaglutide to augment cardiac function in the chronically ischemic heart in a highly translational large animal model, likely through AMPK-mediated improvement in endothelial function and perfusion to the ischemic myocardium.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

In this study, we show that a range of RAFi drive ERK1/2-independent activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), including expression of ATF4 and CHOP, that required the translation initiation factor eIF2-alpha. RAFi-induced ATF4 and CHOP expression was not reversed by inhibition of PERK, a known upstream activator of the eIF2-alpha-dependent Integrated Stress Response (ISR). Rather, we found that RAFi exposure activated GCN2, an alternate eIF2-alpha kinase, leading to eIF2-alpha-dependent (and ERK1/2-independent) ATF4 and CHOP expression. The GCN2 kinase inhibitor A-92, GCN2 RNAi, GCN2 knock-out or ISRIB (an eIF2-alpha antagonist) all reversed RAFi-induced expression of ATF4 and CHOP indicating that RAFi require GCN2 to activate the ISR. RAFi also activated full-length recombinant GCN2 in vitro and in cells, generating a characteristic bell-shaped concentration-response curve, reminiscent of RAFi-driven paradoxical activation of WT RAF dimers. Activation of the ISR by RAFi was abolished by GCN2 kinase dead mutations and M802A or M802G gatekeeper mutations, suggesting that RAFi bind directly to the GCN2 kinase domain; this was supported by mechanistic structural models of RAFi interaction with GCN2. Since the ISR is a critical pathway for determining cell survival or death, our observations may be relevant to the clinical use of RAFi, where paradoxical GCN2 activation may be a previously unappreciated off-target effect that may modulate tumour cell responses.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

MethodsWe used Australian census data linked to the Australian Immunisation Register and death registrations to estimate COVID-19 booster effectiveness according to booster type and recency in adults aged 65+ years in Australia during August 2023-February 2024, a period dominated firstly by XBB-related SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants and then the BA.2.86-related JN.1. Survival analysis, adjusted for age, sex, and other sociodemographic and health measures, was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness.

ResultsWe followed 4.12 million adults aged 65+ years from 1 August 2023 to 29 February 2024. By 29 February, 581146 doses of the XBB.1.5 vaccine were administered, and 1620 COVID-19-specific deaths occurred. COVID-19 mortality rates were 72/100000 person-years in people who received a COVID-19 booster >365 days earlier, and 21/100000 in those who received the XBB.1.5 booster in the last 3 months. The relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of XBB.1.5 booster receipt in the last 3 months against COVID-19 mortality was 74.7% (95%CI 59.9-84.1%). The rVE for those receiving other booster types in the last 3 months was 51.6% (39.3-61.4%). Booster rVE against COVID-19 mortality waned. Compared to those who received a COVID-19 booster >365 days earlier, rVE for a booster within 3-6 months earlier was 31.2% (18.9-41.6%) and for a booster received 6-12 months earlier rVE was 13.1% (1.8-23.2%). rVE estimates were similar in analyses restricted to 1 December 2023 to 29 February 2024 when the dominant Omicron subvariant was JN.1.

ConclusionsRecent booster vaccination with the XBB.1.5 monovalent COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective in preventing COVID-19 mortality including in the period when the JN.1 subvariant circulated, supporting recommendations for 6-monthly boosting in older adults. Evaluation of vaccination effectiveness against other health outcomes, such as COVID-19 hospitalisations and ICU admission, would help further document vaccination benefits.","NA","medrxiv",1723932349910

H2 gas is produced in large quantities during bacterial fermentation and consumed as an energy source by bacteria and archaea. Disruption of H2 cycling is linked to gastrointestinal disorders, infections, and cancers, with H2 used as an indicator of gut dysfunction through breath tests. Despite this, the microorganisms, pathways, and enzymes mediating H2 production remain unresolved. Here we show that a previously uncharacterised enzyme, the group B [FeFe]-hydrogenase, drives most fermentative H2 production in the human gut. Analysis of stool, biopsy, and isolate (meta)genomes and (meta)transcriptomes show this hydrogenase is encoded by most gut bacteria and is highly expressed. Through analysis of 19 taxonomically diverse gut isolates, the group B [FeFe]-hydrogenase produces large amounts of H2 gas and supports fermentative growth of both Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Bacteroides particularly dominate H2 production. Biochemical and spectroscopic characterisation shows purified group B [FeFe]-hydrogenases are catalytically active and bind a di-iron active site. These hydrogenases are highly enriched in the guts of healthy individuals, but significantly depleted in favour of other fermentative hydrogenases in Crohns disease. Furthermore, we show that metabolically flexible respiratory bacteria are the most abundant H2 oxidizers in the gut, not sulfate reducers, methanogens, and acetogens as previously thought. This combination of enzymatic, cellular, and ecosystem-level analysis provides the first detailed understanding of H2 cycling in the human gut and reveals new links between microbiota function and gastrointestinal health.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

We show that Raygun can shrink proteins by 10-25% (sometimes over 50%) while preserving predicted structural integrity and fidelity, introduce extensive sequence diversity while preserving functional sites, and even expand proteins beyond their natural size. In experimental validation, we successfully miniaturize the fluorescent proteins eGFP and mCherry to synthesize functional variants, two of which are smaller than 96% of fluorescent proteins reported in FPbase. Raygun's conceptual innovations in template-based protein design open new avenues for protein engineering, potentially catalyzing the development of more efficient molecular tools and therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Thus far, only a limited number of Clade I MPXV genomes have been characterized, and they are not representative across different regions and time periods.

MethodsWe conducted whole genome sequencing of 603 mpox-positive samples that were collected from 581 patients between 2018-2024 in 17/26 provinces of the DRC.

ResultsGenome coverage was at least 70% for 423/603 (70.1%) samples and near full-length MPXV genomes (>90% coverage) were obtained for 348/603 (57.7%) samples. All newly generated MPXV sequences belonged to Clade I, among which 17 were Clade Ib strains, all from patients infected in 2024 in the South-Kivu province. The large majority (95%) of the new strains fall within previously described Clade Ia groups and potential new groups have also been observed. Genetically diverse MPXV lineages co-circulate in small geographic areas during the same outbreak suggesting multiple zoonotic introductions over a short period from one or multiple reservoir species. The low number of APOBEC3 mutations found among Clade Ia suggests that most human mpox cases are probably linked to zoonotic transmissions. Recent identification of mpox cases in Kinshasa shows multiple virus lineages being present within a large urban center.

ConclusionThe mpox epidemic in the DRC exhibits two distinct patterns. In traditional endemic regions, the epidemic in DRC is predominated by zoonotic spillover events involving Clade Ia. Conversely, in the eastern part of the country, the Clade Ib outbreak is driven by human-to-human transmission highlighting the need for a coordinated response effort at the national, regional and international levels.","NA","medrxiv",1723932349910

Natural selection is a major force shaping variation, and understanding it is necessary to explain the genetic architecture and prevalence of heritable diseases. Here, we analyze data for 27 traits, including anthropometric traits, metabolic traits, and binary diseases--both early-onset and post-reproductive. We develop an inference framework to test existing population genetics models based on the joint distribution of allelic effect sizes and frequencies of trait-associated variants. A majority of traits have GWAS results that are inconsistent with neutral evolution or long-term directional selection (selection against a trait or against disease risk). Instead, we find that most traits show consistency with stabilizing selection, which acts to preserve an intermediate trait value or disease risk. Our observations also suggest that selection may reflect pleiotropy, with each variant influenced by associations with multiple selected traits.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

However, a mechanistic correlation between these risk factors has not been fully established. Using a historical birth cohort from Chile, we delve into the relationship between obesity and accelerated aging, spanning cellular to systemic levels. The cohort, comprising men and women in their late 20s, had their BMI recorded since birth, with 57% having obesity since childhood or adolescence. Our aim was to investigate if persistent obesity since childhood or adolescence leads to the display of molecular aging features in young adulthood. We also sought to determine whether cardiometabolic health issues accompanied this early aging phenotype. We used inferential statistics and data mining for analysis. Results show that persistent obesity since childhood or adolescence leads to epigenetic changes, telomere shortening, chronic inflammation, impaired nutrient sensing, mitochondrial stress, and diminished intercellular communication, resembling a compound network of interactions. This obesity-induced accelerated aging phenotype coincided with persistent decline of the cardiometabolic profile. Implications of our findings are significant and suggest that integrating molecular markers with clinical and epidemiological data could be valuable in identifying individuals at increased disease risk due to accelerated aging.","NA","medrxiv",1723932349910

For example, gene expression data at the molecular level needs to be interpreted based on cell type, spatial context, tissue type, and interactions with the surrounding environment. Recent advances in spatial profiling technologies allow measurements of the level of thousands of proteins or genes at different spatial locations along with corresponding cellular composition. Representing such high dimensional data effectively to facilitate data interpretation is a major challenge. Existing methods such as spatially plotted pie charts obscure underlying tissue regions and necessitate switching between different views for comprehensive interpretations. Here, we present TissuePlot, a novel method for visualizing spatial data. TissuePlot tackles the key challenge of visualizing multi-scale phenotypic data at molecular, cellular and tissue level in the context of their spatial locations. To this end, TissuePlot employs a transparent hexagon tesselation approach that utilizes object borders to represent cell composition or gene-level data without obscuring the underlying cell image. Moreover, we implement a multi-view interactive approach, to allow interrogating spatial tissue data at multiple scales linking molecular information to tissue anatomy and motifs.

Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the irreversible final step of glycolysis, yet the physiological function of its regulation is poorly understood. Through metabolomics and enzyme kinetics studies, we discovered that pyruvate kinase activity is inhibited during gluconeogenesis in the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. This regulation involves an extra C-terminal domain (ECTD) of pyruvate kinase, which is essential for autoinhibition and regulation by metabolic effectors. Introducing a pyruvate kinase mutant lacking the ECTD into B. subtilis resulted in defects specifically under gluconeogenic conditions, including inefficient carbon utilization, slower growth, and decreased resistance to the herbicide glyphosate. These defects are not caused by the phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate-oxaloacetate futile cycle. Instead, we identified two significant metabolic consequences of pyruvate kinase dysregulation during gluconeogenesis: increased carbon overflow into the medium and failure to expand glycolytic intermediates such as phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). In silico analysis revealed that in wild-type cells, an expanded PEP pool enabled by pyruvate kinase regulation is critical for the thermodynamic feasibility of gluconeogenesis. Our findings underscore the importance of allosteric regulation during gluconeogenesis in coordinating metabolic flux, efficient energy utilization, and antimicrobial resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Here, we imaged motile T cells as they colonized peripheral tissues during zebrafish development to ask if cells tailor their migration strategy to their local tissue environment. We found that T cells in most sites migrated with f-actin-rich leading-edge pseudopods, matching how they migrate in vitro. T cells notably deviated from this strategy in the epidermis, where they instead migrated using a rearward concentration of f-actin and stable leading-edge blebs. This mode of migration occurs under planar confinement in vitro, and we correspondingly found the stratified keratinocyte layers of the epidermis impose planar-like confinement on leukocytes in vivo. By imaging the same cell type across the body, our data collectively indicates that cells adapt their migration strategy to navigate different tissue geometries in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

One unifying consequence of the molecular risk factors in CVD is DNA damage, which must be repaired by DNA damage response proteins. However, the impact of DNA damage on global cardiomyocyte protein abundance, and its relationship to CVD risk remains unclear. We therefore treated induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes with the DNA-damaging agent Doxorubicin (DOX) and a vehicle control, and identified 4,178 proteins that contribute to a network comprising 12 co-expressed modules and 403 hub proteins with high intramodular connectivity. Five modules correlate with DOX and represent distinct biological processes including RNA processing, chromatin regulation and metabolism. DOX-correlated hub proteins are depleted for proteins that vary in expression across individuals due to genetic variation but are enriched for proteins encoded by loss-of-function intolerant genes. While proteins associated with genetic risk for CVD, such as arrhythmia are enriched in specific DOX-correlated modules, DOX-correlated hub proteins are not enriched for known CVD risk proteins. Instead, they are enriched among proteins that physically interact with CVD risk proteins. Our data demonstrate that DNA damage in cardiomyocytes induces diverse effects on biological processes through protein co-expression modules that are relevant for CVD, and that the level of protein connectivity in DNA damage-associated modules influences the tolerance to genetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Here, we reveal that embryoid body in vitro differentiation generates two distinct lineages of mesodermal cells matching YS and allantois respectively. Combining in vitro models with in vivo chimeric embryo analysis, we discover that Eomesodermin (Eomes) regulates the formation of a subset of YS-fated ExEM but is dispensable for allantois formation.

In contrast, plants that use the derived and more efficient C4 photosynthetic pathway have a significant chloroplast compartment in both bundle sheath and mesophyll cells. Accordingly, the evolution of C4 photosynthesis from the ancestral C3 state requires an increase in the chloroplast compartment of the bundle sheath. Here we investigated the potential to increase chloroplast compartment size in rice bundle sheath cells by manipulating brassinosteroid signalling. Treatment with brassinazole, a brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor, increased leaf chlorophyll content and increased the number but decreased the area of chloroplasts in bundle sheath cells. Constitutive overexpression of the BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (OsBZR1) transcription factor increased bundle sheath chloroplast area by up to 45% but plants became chlorotic. However, when OsBZR1 was placed under the control of a bundle sheath specific promoter, the negative effects on growth and viability were removed whilst chloroplast area still increased. In summary, we report a role for brassinosteroids in controlling chloroplast area and number in rice and conclude that cell-specific manipulation of brassinosteroid signalling can be used to manipulate the chloroplast compartment in rice bundle sheath cells.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Rather than filtering out the inelastic scattering at the price of reducing potential signal, as is done in energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM), we show how a dose-efficient and unfiltered image can be rapidly obtained using tilt-corrected bright-field scanning-TEM (tcBF-STEM) data collected on a pixelated detector.

Therefore, they are not compatible with fixation and permeabilization, presence of serum, or cell co-culture because of their exchange with the medium. Here, we report a concept of lipid-directed covalent labeling of PM, which exploits transient binding to lipid membrane surface generating high local dye concentration, thus favoring covalent ligation to random proximal membrane proteins. This concept yielded a class of fluorescent probes for PM (MemGraft), where a cyanine dye (Cy3 and Cy5) bears at its two ends low-affinity membrane anchor and reactive group: an activated ester or a maleimide. We found that MemGraft probes with these reactive groups provide efficient PM labelling, in contrast to a series of control compounds, including commercial Cy3-based labels of amino and thiol groups, revealing the crucial role of the membrane anchor combined with high reactivity of activated ester and a maleimide groups. In contrast to conventional PM probes, based on non-covalent interactions, MemGraft labelling approach is compatible with cell fixation, permeabilization, trypsinization and presence of serum. The latter allows long-term cell tracking and video imaging of cell PM dynamics without signs of phototoxicity. The covalent strategy also enables staining and long-term tracking of co-cultured cells labelled in different colors without probes exchange. Moreover, combination of different ratios of MemGraft-Cy3 and MemGraft-Cy5 probes enabled long-term cell barcoding in at least 5 color codes, important for tracking and visualizing multiple cells populations. Ultimately, we found that MemGraft strategy enables efficient biotinylation of cell surface, opening the path to cell surface engineering and cell manipulation.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

However, traditional short-read sequencers have limited our ability to fully characterize how GWAS variants exert their effects on gene expression regulation or alternative splicing in response to the pathology, particularly resulting in inaccurate detection of splicing. To address this gap, we utilized long-read RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in the AppNL-G-F knock-in mouse model to identify changes in splicing and novel transcript isoforms in response to amyloid-{beta}. We show that long-read RNA-seq can recapitulate the expected induction of microglial expressed risk genes such as Trem2 in response to amyloid-{beta} at 9 months of age associated with ageing-dependent deficiencies in spatial short-term memory in the AppNL-G-F knock-in mice. Our results not only identified novel splicing events and transcript isoform abundance in genes associated with AD, but also revealed the complex regulation of gene expression through splicing in response to amyloid plaques. Surprisingly, the regulation of alternative splicing in response to amyloid was seen in genes previously not identified as AD risk genes, expressed in microglia, neurons and oligodendrocytes, and included genes such as Syngr1 that modulate synaptic physiology. We saw alternative splicing in genes such as Ctsa, Clta, Dennd2a, Irf9 and Smad4 in mice in response to amyloid, and the orthologues of these genes also showed transcript usage changes in human AD brains. Our data suggests a model whereby induction of AD risk gene expression associated with microglial proliferation and activation is concomitant with alternative splicing in a different class of genes expressed by microglia and neurons, which act to adapt or preserve synaptic activity in response to amyloid-{beta} during early stages of the disease. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms and effects of the regulation of genes associated with amyloid pathology, which may ultimately enable better disease diagnosis, and improved tracking of disease progression. Additionally, our findings identify new therapeutic avenues for treatment of AD.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

In two areas within the Hill Antechamber and the Dinaledi Chamber this work uncovered concentrations of abundant Homo naledi fossils including articulated, matrix-supported skeletal regions consistent with rapid covering by sediment prior to the decomposition of soft tissue. We additionally re-examine the spatial positioning of skeletal material and associated sediments within the Puzzle Box area, from which abundant H. naledi remains representing a minimum of six individuals were recovered in 2013 and 2014. Multiple lines of evidence exclude the hypothesis that skeletal remains from these three areas come from bodies that decomposed on the floor of the chamber or within a shallow depression prior to burial by sediments. The spatial positioning of skeletal material, the topography of the subsystem, and observations on sediments within and surrounding features exclude the hypothesis that rapid burial by sediment was a result of gravity-driven slumping or spontaneous movement of sediments. We present a minimal hypothesis of hominin cultural burial and test the evidence from all three areas, finding that this hypothesis is most compatible with the pattern of evidence. These results suggest that mortuary behavior including cultural burial was part of the repertoire of Homo naledi.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

To aid intracellular delivery, drug carrier nanoparticles have been used to overcome the barrier imposed by the plasma membrane. The carrier must entrap large amounts of cargo, efficiently and quickly deliver the cargo in the cytosol or other intracellular compartments, and must be as inert as possible. In other words, they should not induce cellular responses or alter the cell state in the course of delivery. Here, we show that cationic liposomes with high charge density efficiently fuse with synthetic membranes and the plasma membrane of living cells. Direct fusion efficiently delivers large amounts of cargo to cells and cell-like vesicles within seconds, bypassing slow and often inefficient internalization-based pathways. These effects depend on liposome charge density and, to some extent, liposome concentration and the helper lipid. However, fusion-mediated cargo delivery results in the incorporation of large amounts of foreign lipids that leads to changes in the material properties of these membranes, namely modifications in membrane packing and fluidity, induction of membrane curvature, decrease in surface tension and the formation of (short-lived) pores. Importantly, these effects are transient and liposome removal allows cells to recover their state prior to liposome interaction.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

We have uncovered a sex chromosome in California two-spot octopus (Octopus bimaculoides) in which males/females have ZZ/ZO karyotypes respectively. We show that the octopus Z chromosome is an evolutionary outlier with respect to divergence and repetitive element content as compared to autosomes and that it is present in all cephalopods that we have examined including Nautilus, the outgroup to squids and octopuses. Our results suggest that the cephalopod Z chromosome system originated before the split of all extant cephalopod lineages, over 480 million years ago and has been conserved to the present, making it the among the oldest conserved animal sex chromosome systems known.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Here, we found that an understudied splice isoform of tau termed ""big tau"" is significantly more abundant in the brain regions less vulnerable to tau pathology compared to tau pathology-vulnerable regions. We used various cellular and animal models to demonstrate that big tau possesses multiple properties that can resist AD-related pathological changes.

Recent biogeographic work has provided global snapshots of NCLDV diversity and community composition across the worlds oceans, yet little information exists about the guiding  rules underpinning their community dynamics over time. We leveraged a five-year monthly metagenomic time-series to quantify the community composition of NCLDVs off the coast of Southern California and characterize these populations temporal dynamics. NCLDVs were dominated by Algavirales (Phycodnaviruses, 59%) and Imitervirales (Mimiviruses, 36%). We identified clusters of NCLDVs with distinct classes of seasonal and non-seasonal temporal dynamics. Overall, NCLDV population abundances were often highly dynamic with a strong seasonal signal. The Imitervirales group had highest relative abundance in the more oligotrophic late summer and fall, while Algavirales did so in winter. Generally, closely related strains had similar temporal dynamics, suggesting that evolutionary history is a key driver of the temporal niche of marine NCLDVs. However, a few closely-related strains had drastically different seasonal dynamics, suggesting that while phylogenetic proximity often indicates ecological similarity, occasionally phenology can shift rapidly, possibly due to host-switching. Finally, we identified distinct functional content and possible host interactions of two major NCLDV orders-including connections of Imitervirales with primary producers like the diatom Chaetoceros and widespread marine grazers like Paraphysomonas and Spirotrichea ciliates. Together, our results reveal key insights on season-specific effect of phylogenetically distinct giant virus communities on marine protist metabolism, biogeochemical fluxes and carbon cycling.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Previous studies, including our own research, have shown that specific interneuron subtypes are closely associated with particular pyramidal neuron types, forming stereotyped local inhibitory microcircuits. However, the developmental processes that establish these precise networks are not well understood. Here we show that pyramidal neuron types are instrumental in driving the terminal differentiation and maintaining the survival of specific associated interneuron subtypes. In a wild-type cortex, the relative abundance of different interneuron subtypes aligns precisely with the pyramidal neuron types to which they synaptically target. In Fezf2 mutant cortex, characterized by the absence of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons and an expansion of layer 6 intratelencephalic neurons, we observed a corresponding decrease in associated layer 5b interneurons and an increase in layer 6 subtypes. Interestingly, these shifts in composition are achieved through mechanisms specific to different interneuron types. While SST interneurons adjust their abundance to the change in pyramidal neuron prevalence through the regulation of programmed cell death, parvalbumin interneurons alter their identity. These findings illustrate two key strategies by which the dynamic interplay between pyramidal neurons and interneurons allows local microcircuits to be sculpted precisely. These insights underscore the precise roles of extrinsic signals from pyramidal cells in the establishment of interneuron diversity and their subsequent integration into local cortical microcircuits.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

This study presents a pipeline for the genetic engineering and pilot-scale production of biodiesel and thermoplastic polyurethane precursors in the extremophile species Chlamydomonas pacifica. This extremophile microalga exhibits exceptional resilience to high pH, high salinity, and elevated temperatures. Initially, we evolved this strain to also have a high tolerance to high light intensity through mutagenesis, breeding, and selection. Subsequently, we genetically engineered C. pacifica to produce high levels of lipids and starch without compromising growth. We demonstrated the scalability of these engineered strains by cultivating them in pilot-scale raceway ponds and converting the resulting biomass into biodiesel and thermoplastic polyurethanes. This study showcases the complete cycle of transforming a newly discovered species into a commercially relevant commodity production strain. This research underscores the potential of extremophile algae, including C. pacifica, as a key species for the burgeoning sustainable bioeconomy, offering a viable path forward in mitigating environmental challenges and supporting global bioproduct demands.

We used single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to globally profile gene expression and identify dysregulated genes in the embryonic and juvenile wild type and Chd8+/- mouse cortex, respectively. Chd8 and other ASD risk-associated genes showed a convergent expression trajectory that was largely conserved between the mouse and human developing cortex, increasing from the progenitor zones to the cortical plate. Genes associated with risk for neurodevelopmental disorders and genes involved in neuron projection development, chromatin remodeling, signaling, and migration were dysregulated in Chd8+/- embryonic day (E) 12.5 radial glia. Genes implicated in synaptic organization and activity were dysregulated in Chd8+/- postnatal day (P) 25 deep- and upper-layer excitatory cortical neurons, suggesting a delay in synaptic maturation or impaired synaptogenesis due to CHD8 loss of function. Our findings reveal a complex pattern of transcriptional dysregulation in Chd8+/- developing cortex, potentially with distinct biological impacts on progenitors and maturing neurons in the excitatory neuronal lineage.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Basal cells are tissue-resident airway stem cells that enact regeneration, yet the mechanisms regulating their proliferation and differentiation remain incompletely understood. To identify compounds that promote primary human airway basal cell proliferation, we performed phenotype-based compound screening of 1,429 compounds (from the ENZO and Prestwick Chemical libraries) in 384-well format using primary cells transduced with lentiviral luciferase. 16 pro-proliferative compounds validated in independent donor cell cultures, with several hit compounds activating the Wnt signalling pathway. The effects of compounds on proliferation were further explored in concentration-response, colony formation and 3D organoid assays. Structurally and functionally-related compounds that more potently induced both Wnt activation and basal cell proliferation were investigated. One such compound, 1-azakenpaullone, induced Wnt target gene activation and basal cell proliferation in mice in the absence of tracheal injury. Our results demonstrate the pro-proliferative effect of small-molecule Wnt activators on airway basal cells. These findings contribute to the rationale to develop novel approaches to modulate Wnt signalling during airway epithelial repair.

Academic publishers are adapting to the transformative role of AI chatbots in producing or facilitating scientific research. This study aimed to examine the policies established by scientific, technical, and medical academic publishers for defining and regulating the responsible authors use of AI chatbots.

MethodsThis study performed a cross-sectional audit on the publicly available policies of 163 academic publishers, indexed as members of the International Association of the Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers (STM). Data extraction of publicly available policies on the webpages of all STM academic publishers was performed independently in duplicate with content analysis reviewed by a third contributor (September 2023 - December 2023). Data was categorized into policy elements, such as  proofreading and  image generation. Counts and percentages of  yes (i.e., permitted),  no, and  N/A were established for each policy element.

ResultsA total of 56/163 (34.4%) STM academic publishers had a publicly available policy guiding the authors use of AI chatbots. No policy allowed authorship accreditations for AI chatbots (or other generative technology). Most (49/56 or 87.5%) required specific disclosure of AI chatbot use. Four policies/publishers placed a complete ban on the use of AI tools by authors.

ConclusionsOnly a third of STM academic publishers had publicly available policies as of December 2023. A re-examination of all STM members in 12-18 months may uncover evolving approaches toward AI chatbot use with more academic publishers having a policy.","NA","medrxiv",1723932349910

However, how IL2 function is integrated during earlier antigen-dependent T cell synapses is unknown. Here, we demonstrate a synergistic effect between the T cell receptor (TCR) and IL2 receptor signaling at the immunological synapse of CD8+ T cells with supported lipid bilayers.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Warm White Light-Emitting Diode (LED), Cool White LED, Blue LED, and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic Puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation, and husbandry programs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic Puffin strandings remains to be the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine if aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1723932349910

MethodsWe employed molecular assays, cell and egg culture, Sanger and next generation sequencing to isolate and characterize viruses from multiple farm specimens (cow nasal swab, milk specimens, fecal slurry, and a dead bird).

ResultsWe detected H5N1 HPAIV in 64% (9/14) of milk specimens, 2.6% (1/39) of cattle nasal swab specimens, and none of 17 cattle worker nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We cultured and characterized virus from eight H5N1-positive specimens. Sanger and next-generation sequencing revealed the viruses were closely related into other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. Our isolates had multiple mutations associated with increased spillover potential. Surprisingly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in a nasal swab from a sick cow. Additionally, 14.3% (2/14) of the farm workers who donated sera were recently symptomatic and had elevated neutralizing antibodies against a related H5N1 strain.

ConclusionsWhile our sampling was limited, these data offer additional insight into the large H5N1 HPAIV epizootic which thus far has impacted at least 96 cattle farms in twelve US states. Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few. We need to find ways to work with dairy farms in collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data that are necessary for the design of future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms.","NA","medrxiv",1723932349910

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Here we show that language models trained on tokens generated by evolution can act as evolutionary simulators to generate functional proteins that are far away from known proteins. We present ESM3, a frontier multimodal generative language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to biological alignment. We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins with a chain of thought. Among the generations that we synthesized, we found a bright fluorescent protein at far distance (58% identity) from known fluorescent proteins. Similarly distant natural fluorescent proteins are separated by over five hundred million years of evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Yet little is known about factors contributing to long-term lack of intimate relationships. We investigated phenotypic and genetic correlates of never having had sex in [~]400,000 UK residents aged 39 to 73 and [~]13,500 Australian residents aged 18 to 89. The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g. upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% and 14% of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56. Polygenic scores predicted a range of related outcomes in the Australian dataset. Our findings uncover multifaceted correlates of human intimacy of evolutionary significance.","NA","medrxiv",1723932349910
"The Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect: Pupils size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest during exhalation","10.1101/2024.06.27.599713","biorxiv",102.08,0,0,0,89.03,"Schaefer, M.; Mathot, S.; Lundqvist, M.; Lundstrom, J.

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

In aged mice, partial reprogramming, characterized by pulsed expression of reprogramming factors, has shown promise in improving function in various tissues, but its impact on the aging brain remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the impact of in vivo partial reprogramming on mature neurons in the dentate gyrus of young and aged mice. Using two different approaches - a neuron-specific transgenic reprogrammable mouse model and neuron-specific targeted lentiviral delivery of OSKM reprogramming factors - we demonstrated that in vivo partial reprogramming of mature neurons in the dentate gyrus, a neurogenic niche in the adult mouse brain, can influence animal behavior, and ameliorate age-related decline in memory and learning. These findings underscore the potential of in vivo partial reprogramming as an important therapeutic intervention to rejuvenate the neurogenic niche and ameliorate cognitive decline associated with aging or neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910

Identifying and controlling dose-dependent transgenes require tools for precisely titrating expression. To this end, we developed a highly modular, extensible framework called DIAL for building editable promoters that allow for fine-scale, heritable changes in transgene expression. Using DIAL, we increase expression by recombinase-mediated excision of spacers between the binding sites of a synthetic zinc finger transcription factor and the core promoter. By nesting varying numbers and lengths of spacers, DIAL generates a tunable range of unimodal setpoints from a single promoter. Through small-molecule control of transcription factors and recombinases, DIAL supports temporally defined, user-guided control of transgene expression that is extensible to additional transcription factors. Lentiviral delivery of DIAL generates multiple setpoints in primary cells and iPSCs. As promoter editing generates stable states, DIAL setpoints are heritable, facilitating mapping of transgene levels to phenotypes. The DIAL framework opens new opportunities for tailoring transgene expression and improving the predictability and performance of gene circuits across diverse applications.

However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.","NA","biorxiv",1723932349910
