By analysing 50 samples from nine archaeological sites across Iran, we report 23 newly sequenced mitogenomes and 13 nuclear genomes, spanning 4700 BCE to 1300 CE. We integrate an extensive reference sample set of previously published ancient DNA datasets from Western and South-Central Asia, enhancing our understanding of genetic continuity and diversity within ancient Iranian populations. A new Early Chalcolithic sample, predating all other Chalcolithic genomes from Iran, demonstrates mostly Early Neolithic Iranian genetic ancestry. This finding reflects long-term cultural and biological continuity in and around the Zagros area, alongside evidence of some western genetic influence. Our sample selection prioritizes northern Iran, with a particular focus on the Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sassanid periods (355 BCE-460 CE). The genetic profiles of historical samples from this region position them as intermediates on an east-west genetic cline across the Persian Plateau. They also exhibit strong connections to local and South-Central Asian Bronze Age populations, underscoring enduring genetic connections across these regions. Diachronic analyses of uniparental lineages on the Iranian Plateau further highlight population stability from prehistoric to modern times.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Nineteen out of 396 (4.8%) dogs and 21 out of 157 (13.4%) cats were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. Additionally, 95/382 (25%) dogs and 52/146 (36%) cats harbored SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Twenty-six companion animals of ten other species were negative. Overall, 164 (29%) pets were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by molecular and/or serological tests; a total of 110 (39%) out of 281 households had at least one animal with active or past SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cats were more likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and had higher endpoint antibody titers than dogs. Through viral isolation from a subset of respiratory swabs, we documented 6 different lineages in dogs and cats, including the B.1.1 lineage in a cat one month prior to the first known human case in the country. We observed animal and human-pet interaction factors associated with higher risk of infection for dogs and cats, such as days after COVID-19 diagnosis and sharing food. Frequency of clinical signs of disease reported by owners of pets with active infections did not differ from uninfected ones, suggesting that not all reported signs are attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Characterizing animal infections using active SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in pets at risk of infection may aid in One Health pandemic prevention, response, and management.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Over the past decades, single-cell and clonal analyses have revealed substantial functional and molecular heterogeneity within this compartment, challenging the notion that self-renewal is inherently tied to balanced, multi-lineage blood production. However, a cohesive model that explains the relationships among these diverse HSC states remains elusive. Here, we combined single-cell transplantations of over 1,000 highly purified murine long-term HSCs with in-depth phenotyping of their clonal progeny to achieve a detailed, time-resolved understanding of heterogeneous reconstitution outcomes. We identified reconstitution kinetics as an overall unifying metric of HSC functional potency, with the most potent HSCs displaying the greatest delay in hematopoietic reconstitution. Importantly, a progressive acceleration in reconstitution kinetics was also associated with a gradual shift in mature cell production from platelet and erythro-myeloid bias to balanced, and eventually lymphoid bias. Serial single-cell transplantations of HSCs revealed a unidirectional acceleration in reconstitution kinetics accompanied by a gradual decline in functional potency of daughter HSCs, aligning diverse phenotypes along a linear hierarchical trajectory. Mathematical modeling, together with experimental modulation of lineage-biased blood production, demonstrated that apparent lineage biases actually arise from cell-extrinsic feedback regulation and clonal competition between slow- and fast-engrafting clones to occupy the limited compartment sizes of mature lineages. Our study reconciles multiple layers of HSC heterogeneity into a unifying framework, prompting a reevaluation of the meaning of lineage biases in both normal and diseased hematopoiesis, with broad implications for other regenerating tissues during development, homeostasis, and repair.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Translation inhibition through tRNA cleavage or modification inhibits phage propagation, thereby protecting the bacterial population. To counteract this, some viruses encode their own tRNA molecules, allowing infection to take place. The AriB effector of the PARIS defence system is a Toprim nuclease previously shown to target the E. coli tRNALys(UUU), but not a tRNALys(UUU) variant encoded by bacteriophage T5. We demonstrate here that the T5-tRNALys(UUU) is required but not sufficient to bypass PARIS immunity. Combining tRNA sequencing, genetics, phage infection and in vitro biochemical data, we reveal that the E. coli tRNAThr(UGU), is another prime target of AriB and tRNAAsn(GUU) represents a secondary, yet biologically relevant, target of the PARIS effector. Activated AriB protein cleaves these targets in vitro, and the cleavage reaction is not dependent on the presence of specific tRNA modifications. We show that the overexpression of phage T5 tRNALys(UUU), tRNAThr(UGU) and tRNAAsn(GUU) variants is sufficient to inhibit PARIS anti-viral defence. Finally, we propose a model for tRNA recognition by the AriB dimer and provide molecular details of its nuclease activity and specificity.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

PGSs are often thought of as capturing the direct genetic effect of one's genotype on their phenotype. However, because PGSs are constructed from population-level associations, they are influenced by factors other than direct genetic effects, including stratification, assortative mating, and dynastic effects (''SAD effects''). Our interpretation and application of PGSs may hinge on the relative impact of SAD effects, since they may often be environmentally or culturally mediated. We developed a method that estimates the proportion of variance in a PGS (in a given sample) that is driven by direct effects, SAD effects, and their covariance. We leverage a comparison of a PGS of interest based on a standard GWAS with a PGS based on a sibling GWAS---which is largely immune to SAD effects---to quantify the relative contribution of each type of effect to variance in the PGS of interest. Our method, Partitioning Genetic Scores Using Siblings (PGSUS, pron. ''Pegasus''), breaks down variance components further by axes of genetic ancestry, allowing for a nuanced interpretation of SAD effects. In particular, PGSUS can detect stratification along major axes of ancestry as well as SAD variance that is ''isotropic'' with respect to axes of ancestry. Applying PGSUS, we found evidence of stratification in PGSs constructed using large meta-analyses of height and educational attainment as well as in a range of PGSs constructed using the UK Biobank. In some instances, a given PGS appears to be stratified along a major axis of ancestry in one prediction sample but not in another (for example, in comparisons of prediction in samples from different countries, or in ancient DNA vs. contemporary samples). Finally, we show that different approaches for adjustment for population structure in GWASs have distinct advantages with respect to mitigation of ancestry-axis-specific and isotropic SAD variance in PGS. Our study illustrates how family-based designs can be combined with standard population-based designs to guide the interpretation and application of genomic predictors.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Unregulated rapid transcription elongation can lead to detrimental consequences such as transcription-replication collisions, altered alternative splicing patterns, and genome instability1-7. Therefore, elongating Pol II requires mechanisms to slow its progression, yet the molecular basis of transcription braking remains unclear. RECQL5 is a DNA helicase that functions as a general elongation factor by slowing down Pol II8-11. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human RECQL5 bound to multiple transcription elongation complexes. Combined with biochemical analysis, we identify an -helix of RECQL5 responsible for Pol II binding and slowdown of transcription elongation. We further reveal that the transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) complex allows Pol II to overcome RECQL5-induced transcription braking through concerted actions of its translocase activity and competition with RECQL5 for engaging Pol II. Additionally, RECQL5 inhibits TCR-mediated Pol II ubiquitination to prevent activation of the DNA repair pathway. Our results suggest a model in which RECQL5 and the TCR complex coordinately regulate the transcription elongation rate to ensure transcription efficiency while maintaining genome stability. This work provides a framework for future studies on the regulatory role of elongation speed in gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

This approach enables the quantification of relative lipid densities in membrane nanodomains. We find differential partitioning of sphingomyelin into intraluminal vesicles, recycling tubules, and the boundary membrane of the early endosome, representing a degree of nanoscale organization previously observed only for proteins.

These studies have yielded remarkable results for understanding the Pol II transcription with elongation factors and nucleosome but may fail to represent transcription in native conditions. To investigate Pol II transcription within metazoan cells, we developed an approach to isolate the native transcription complexes from Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Utilizing one-step FLAG-tag affinity purification and mild chromatin treatment with Micrococcal Nuclease, we preserved the native transcription complex for cryo-EM and proteomics studies. In silico purification through the cryo-EM 2D/3D classifications determined structures of multiple forms of native transcription complex and nucleosome. Remarkably, we determined the first structures of native metazoan Rpb4/Rpb7 stalk-less elongation complex as well as hexameric nucleosome lacking an H2A/H2B dimer, revealing that diverse elongation complexes and nucleosomes are involved in active transcription in vivo. In the nucleosome elongation complex, nucleosome is positioned only downstream of Pol II, underscoring it as a major energy barrier and a time-consuming step during Pol II progression through nucleosomal DNA. Proteomics identified co-purified factors responsible for initiating and elongating transcription, as well as RNA modification factors. This study lays the groundwork for structural study of native transcription in eukaryotes, with future work focused on studies of transient and minor populations of Pol II transcription complexes.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

In areas with lower UV radiation, light pigmentation alleles increased in frequency because of their adaptive advantage and of other contingent factors such as migration and drift. However, the tempo and mode of their spread is not known. Phenotypic inference from ancient DNA is complicated, both because these traits are polygenic, and because of low sequence depth. We evaluated the effects of the latter by randomly removing reads in two high-coverage ancient samples, the Paleolithic Ust-Ishim from Russia and the Mesolithic SF12 from Sweden. We could thus compare three approaches to pigmentation inference, concluding that, for suboptimal levels of coverage (<8x), a probabilistic method estimating genotype likelihoods leads to the most robust predictions. We then applied that protocol to 348 ancient genomes from Eurasia, describing how skin, eye and hair color evolved over the past 45,000 years. The shift towards lighter pigmentations turned out to be all but linear in time and place, and slower than expected, with half of the individuals showing dark or intermediate skin colors well into the Copper and Iron ages. We also observed a peak of light eye pigmentation in Mesolithic times, and an accelerated change during the spread of Neolithic farmers over Western Eurasia, although localized processes of gene flow and admixture, or lack thereof, also played a significant role.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Methylation at cytosines in DNA (5mC) is actively regulated for proper control of gene expression and chromatin architecture. Numerous genes display active DNA demethylation across retinal development; a process that requires oxidation of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and is controlled by the ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET) enzymes. Using an allelic series of conditional TET enzyme mutants, we determine that DNA demethylation is required upstream of NRL and NR2E3 expression for the establishment of rod-photoreceptor fate. Using histological, behavioral, transcriptomic, and base-pair resolution DNA methylation analyses, we establish that inhibition of active DNA demethylation results in global changes in gene expression and methylation patterns that prevent photoreceptor precursors from adopting a rod-photoreceptor fate, instead producing a retina in which all photoreceptors specify as cones. Our results establish the TET enzymes and DNA demethylation as critical regulators of retinal development and cell fate specification, elucidating a novel mechanism required for the specification of rod-photoreceptors.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

These findings uncover an unrecognized mechanism of IFN{gamma} storage and release, underscoring its pivotal role in CD8 T cell-mediated tumor elimination.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

If sequences from two strains share less than ~99% identity, the strains are usually classified as different species. Classification thresholds for genera and other ranks have also been proposed, but they are based on dated datasets. Here we update these thresholds by determining sequence identity of the 16S rRNA gene for nearly 18,000 type strains. This represents 86.5% of all strains validly published, and it involved making more than 161 million pairwise sequence alignments. In 90% of all cases, sequences from the same species shared a minimum of 97.2 to 100% identity. The corresponding values for genus were 90.3 to 99.0%, 79.6 to 94.1% for family, 73.1 to 90.1% for order, 72.2 to 86.3% for class, and 69.7 to 83.6% for phylum. We propose these values serve as thresholds for classifying new prokaryotic taxa. A major change from previous guidelines is recognizing that these boundaries overlap. This overlap has already been observed for relative evolutionary divergence, a metric correlated with 16S rRNA gene identity. Together with other metrics, 16S rRNA gene identity allows classification of prokaryotes from species to phylum.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Place cells in CA1 of the hippocampus are crucial for spatial navigation and memories but show gradual changes in their preferred firing location over time when exposed to the same environment. This drift occurs despite the fact that the animal maintains the ability to navigate and to perform spatial tasks, suggesting a complex relationship between neural activity and behaviour. Here, we show that while the spatial tuning functions of individual CA1 neurons drift over time, stable space coding prevails at the population level: Representational drift is not random but can be described as a translation and rotation in population state space, which preserves the internal geometry of population activity over time. Compensating for the coordinated translation and rotation allows for drift correction and a recovery of spatial tuning on future days. Moreover, the preserved internal geometry stabilises downstream readout under noisy conditions. We propose that the conserved population geometry might serve as a mechanism by which downstream reader networks achieve effective drift correction and, thus, ameliorate the readout of stable information.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Recent developments in Natural Language Processing, particularly in multilingual neural network language models, offer a promising avenue to answer this question by providing a theory-agnostic way of representing linguistic content across languages. Our study leverages these advances to ask how the brains of native speakers of 21 languages respond to linguistic stimuli, and to what extent linguistic representations are similar across languages. We combined existing (12 languages across 4 language families; n=24 participants) and newly collected fMRI data (9 languages across 4 language families; n=27 participants) to evaluate a series of encoding models predicting brain activity in the language network based on representations from diverse multilingual language models (20 models across 8 model classes). We found evidence of cross-lingual robustness in the alignment between language representations in artificial and biological neural networks. Critically, we showed that the encoding models can be transferred zero-shot across languages, so that a model trained to predict brain activity in a set of languages can account for brain responses in a held-out language, even across language families. These results imply a shared component in the processing of different languages, plausibly related to a shared meaning space.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

VPS29 is a central conductor of this network through its assembly into Retromer, Retriever and Commander endosomal sorting complexes, and its role in regulating RAB GTPase activity. Two VPS29 isoforms have been described, VPS29A and VPS29B, that differ solely in their amino-terminal sequences. Here we identify a third VPS29 isoform, which we term VPS29C, that harbours an extended amino-terminal sequence compared to VPS29A and VPS29B. Through a combination of AlphaFold predictive modelling, in vitro complex reconstitution, mass spectrometry and molecular cell biology, we find that the amino-terminal VPS29C extension constitutes an autoinhibitory sequence that limits access to a hydrophobic groove necessary for effector protein recruitment to Retromer, and association with Retriever and Commander. VPS29C is therefore unique in its ability to uncouple Retromer-dependent cargo sorting from the broader roles of VPS29A and VPS29B in regulating the endosomal-lysosomal network through accessory protein recruitment. Our identification and characterisation of VPS29C points to additional complexity in the differential subunit assembly of Retromer, an important consideration given the increasing interest in Retromer as a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe endosomal-lysosomal network is essential for normal cellular function with network defects being associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Two heterotrimeric complexes, Retromer and Retriever, control transmembrane protein recycling through the network. Of these, reduced Retromer expression is observed in Alzheimers disease and Retromer mutations lead to familial Parkinsons disease. Here, we identify and characterise a new isoform of VPS29, a subunit shared between Retromer and Retriever. We reveal how this isoform, VPS29C, adopts an auto-inhibitory conformation to limit its association into Retriever and restrict the binding of VPS29C-containing Retromer to accessory proteins vital for regulating network function. By revealing added complexity in Retromer assembly and function, we provide new insight into Retromers potential as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Mutations in Commander are causative for Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome (RSS), a multiorgan developmental disease associated with a core triad of cerebellar-cardiac-craniofacial malformation. Here, using unbiased proteomics and computational modelling, we identify leucine rich melanocyte differentiation associated (LRMDA) as a novel Commander binding protein. Using recombinant protein reconstitution, we show that LRMDA simultaneously associates with Commander and active RAB32, and, by revealing that LRMDA and SNX17 share a common mechanism of Commander association, establish the mutually exclusive nature of RAB32-LRMDA-Commander and SNX17-Commander assemblies. From functional analysis in human melanocytes, we establish an essential role for RAB32-LRMDA-Commander in melanosome biogenesis and pigmentation and reveal a distinct functional role for SNX17-Commander in this organelle biogenesis pathway. We reveal how LRMDA mutations, causative for oculocutaneous albinism type 7 (OCA7), a hypopigmentation disorder accompanied by poor visual acuity, uncouple RAB32 and Commander binding thereby establishing the mechanistic basis of this disease. Our discovery and characterisation of this alternative Commander assembly establishes an unrecognised plasticity of Commander function within a highly complex organelle biogenesis pathway. This extends Commander function beyond the confines of SNX17-mediated cell surface recycling into RAB32-family mediated biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles and, potentially, other RAB32 regulated pathways including host-pathogen defence mechanisms.

Since proteome and transcriptome level abundances only modestly correlate with each other, complementary profiling of both is needed. We report a novel method called simultaneous protein and RNA -omics (SPARO) to capture the cell type-specific transcriptome and proteome simultaneously from both in vitro and in vivo experimental model systems. This method leverages the ability of biotin ligase, TurboID, to biotinylate cytosolic proteins including ribosomal and RNA-binding proteins, which allows enrichment of biotinylated proteins for proteomics as well as protein-associated RNA for transcriptomics. We validated this approach first using well-controlled in vitro systems to verify that the proteomes and transcriptomes obtained reflect the ground truth, bulk proteomes and transcriptomes. We also show that the effect of a biological stimulus (e.g., neuroinflammatory activation by lipopolysaccharide) can be faithfully captured. We also applied this approach to obtain native-state proteomes and transcriptomes from two key neural cell types, astrocytes and neurons, thereby validating the in vivo application of SPARO. Next, we used these data to interrogate protein-mRNA concordance and discordance across these cell types, providing insights into groups of molecular processes that exhibit uniform or cell type-specific patterns of mRNA-protein discordance.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

We demonstrate that endowing CAR T cells with ectopic interleukin-9 (IL-9) signaling by co-expressing an IL-9 receptor, rewires CAR T cell fate under antigen stress to enhance anti-tumor efficacy. In preclinical solid tumor models, IL-9-signaling CAR T cells exhibit increased expansion, persistence, and tumor infiltration, resulting in superior tumor control at significantly lower doses than conventional products. Trajectory and RNA velocity analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data reveal that IL-9 signaling alters CAR T cell differentiation under antigen stress away from dysfunction, favoring a multipotent transition toward CD8+ cell memory and effector states, and promoting a CD4+ cell proliferative state. Interrogation of transcription factor pathways indicates that IL-9-mediated activation of STAT1 and STAT4 drives the superior phenotype of IL-9-signaling CAR T cells, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for targeting solid cancers.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Importantly, they are involved in the formation and expansion of cell plates that partition daughter cells during cell division. While previous studies have revealed the important role of cytoskeletal dynamics in the proper functioning of the phragmoplast, the localization and role of AFs in the initial phase of cell plate formation remain controversial. Here, we used deep learning-based image restoration to achieve high-resolution 4D imaging with minimal laser-induced damage, enabling us to investigate the dynamics of AFs during the initial phase of cell plate formation in transgenic tobacco BY-2 cells labeled with Lifeact-RFP or RFP-ABD2 (actin binding domain 2). This computational approach overcame the limitation of conventional imaging, namely laser-induced photobleaching and phototoxicity. The restored images indicated that RFP-ABD2 labeled AFs were predominantly localized near the daughter nucleus, whereas Lifeact-RFP labeled AFs were found not only near the daughter nucleus but also around the initial cell plate. These findings, validated by imaging with a long exposure time, highlight distinct localization patterns between the two AF probes and suggest that Lifeact-RFP labeled AFs play a role in initiating cell plate formation.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Many of these animals regenerate the correct tissues and structures with remarkable fidelity according to the original polarity of the body, reflecting positional information present in the remaining tissue. Understanding the cellular and molecular basis of this positional information is a central question in regeneration biology. In planarians and acoels, muscle cells have been shown to carry such positional information, but where this information originates and whether this function is conserved in other highly regenerative animals, is not well understood. Here we use the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis to address the role of the nervous system in whole-body regeneration. We generated a transgenic line for conditional ablation of neurons and first showed that Nematostella can repeatedly regenerate its nervous system. Bisection experiments following nervous system ablation showed that all head fragments regenerate a second head instead of a foot, whereas foot fragments correctly regenerate the missing head. We further found that regenerating head fragments of nervous system-ablated animals increase the expression of Wnt signaling genes that in wildtype animals are only upregulated in regenerating foot fragments. These molecular changes and the initiation of ectopic head regeneration precede the re-appearance of neurons, suggesting that the nervous system does not directly control whether a head or foot will be regenerated. Instead, we propose a model in which the nervous system provides positional information to the tissue of the body column, and that this information allows foot regeneration by suppressing a default program for head regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Whole-genome sequencing of S. sonnei isolated over the last three decades has revealed phylogenomic diversity within the population and the emergence of multiple lineages associated with distinct epidemiological patterns such as resistance to critical antimicrobials and/or transmission within different groups. However most experimental work on S. sonnei biology and pathogenicity has focused on a single laboratory strain (53G), which is phylogenetically distant from currently circulating strains. Here we introduce a set of 15 phylogenetically diverse and epidemiologically relevant S. sonnei isolates made available through publicly accessible culture collections as a resource for laboratory science. We present their complete whole-genome sequences, including the pINV invasion plasmid (missing from a large proportion of public genome data due to loss during laboratory culture). Finally, the characterisation and comparison of these complete genome sequences highlight evidence for ongoing adaptive evolution in S. sonnei, featuring the accumulation of insertion sequences, gene pseudogenisation and structural variation.

Significance as a BioResource to the communityGenomic analysis of Shigella has historically been challenging due to presence of hundreds of repetitive sequence elements (which can cause fragmented assemblies) and loss of the pINV invasion plasmid (essential to virulence) during laboratory culture. Furthermore, most experimental work on S. sonnei pathogenicity uses a lab strain that is phylogenetically distant from circulating isolates. To support S. sonnei experimental and in silico research and increase its relevance to current clinical problems, we report here the complete, high-quality genome sequences of 15 S. sonnei isolates, each selected to represent distinct sub-clades of epidemiological interest. We also make the corresponding strains publicly available in national reference culture collections.

This allows plants to adapt flower number to their environment whilst maintaining a constant flower structure. The CLAVATA/WUSCHEL feedback loop underpins both inflorescence (IM) and floral meristem (FM) activity, respectively responsible for flower and floral organ production. We explore how plasticity and invariance can differ between IM and FM in response to nutrient availability. FM size is less sensitive to changes in nutrients than IM size, and floral organ production is insensitive to these small size changes. However, clavata3 mutants display larger changes in FM size, approaching those observed in WT IM under nutrient change, with increased floral organ number. This suggests that invariant floral organ production requires that FM size undergoes limited changes in response to nutrients. Compared to the IM, in the FM, levels of cytokinin (CK) signaling are lower and CK signaling and WUSCHEL expression are less impacted by nutrient level. Through genetic perturbations, we show a reduced response of FMs to varying cytokinin levels. Our work shows one way that the balance between plasticity and invariance can be set differently in different contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

ChatGPT O1 employs ""chain-of-thought reasoning"" (CoT) to enhance structured problem-solving, while DeepSeek-R1 introduces self-reflection capabilities through reinforcement learning. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of these models in pediatric scenarios using the MedQA dataset.

Materials and MethodsA total of 500 multiple-choice pediatric questions from the MedQA dataset were presented to ChatGPT O1 and DeepSeek-R1. Each question included four or more options, with one correct answer. The models were evaluated under uniform conditions, with performance metrics including accuracy, Cohens Kappa, and chi-square tests applied to assess agreement and statistical significance. Responses were analyzed to determine the models effectiveness in addressing clinical questions.

ResultsChatGPT O1 achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 92.8%, significantly outperforming DeepSeek-R1, which scored 87.0% (p < 0.00001). The CoT reasoning technique used by ChatGPT O1 allowed for more structured and reliable responses, reducing the risk of errors. Conversely, DeepSeek-R1, while slightly less accurate, demonstrated superior accessibility and adaptability due to its open-source nature and emerging self-reflection capabilities. Cohens Kappa (K=0.20) indicated low agreement between the models, reflecting their distinct reasoning strategies.

ConclusionsThis study highlights the strengths of ChatGPT O1 in providing accurate and coherent clinical reasoning, making it highly suitable for critical pediatric scenarios.

DeepSeek-R1, with its flexibility and accessibility, remains a valuable tool in resource-limited settings. Combining these models in an ensemble system could leverage their complementary strengths, optimizing decision support in diverse clinical contexts. Further research is warranted to explore their integration into multidisciplinary care teams and their application in real-world clinical settings.","NA","medrxiv",1738793368553

The goal of this project was to develop an automated rating of shopping baskets based on their health properties that can be deployed on top of existing loyalty or digital shopping basket programs by retailers without knowing for how long a basket will last or how many people consume it.

MethodsWe developed a model that uses nutrient densities as opposed to absolute quantities based on self-reported food intake from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) as well as mortality follow-up data and conducted a validation against the Nutri-Score as well as the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI).

ResultsThe model we obtained punishes consuming calories from sugar and saturated fats, high salt intake, as well as consuming calories from beverages. Furthermore, a penalty is applied to a nutrition that is deficient in protein, vitamin C, or iron. Fiber consumption is rewarded. The model showed a high degree of correlation with the Nutri-Score (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.60) and the AHEI (Pearson correlation coefficient: -0.62 for the AHEI without the protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption and -0.60 with it).

ConclusionsThe proposed model is aligned with the recommendations formulated in nutritional guidelines, which is indicated by a high degree of correlation with the AHEI. Product-level profiling systems such as the Nutri-Score also exhibit a correlation with the model and can be used in combination.","NA","medrxiv",1738793368553

Fine-tuning the homeostasis of these receptors is critical to prevent their hyperactivation. Here, we show that Arabidopsis plants lacking metacaspase 1 (AtMC1) display autoimmunity dependent on immune signalling components downstream of NLR and PRR activation. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive AtMC1 in an atmc1 background triggers severe autoimmunity partially dependent on the same immune signalling components. Overexpression of the E3 ligase SNIPER1, a master regulator of NLR homeostasis, fully reverts the AtMC1-dependent autoimmunity phenotype, inferring that a broad defect in NLR turnover may underlie the severe phenotype observed. Catalytically inactive AtMC1 localizes to punctate structures that are degraded through autophagy. Altogether and considering previous evidence on the proteostatic functions of AtMC1, we speculate that Wt AtMC1 may either directly or indirectly control NLR protein levels, thereby preventing autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.8, a pivotal driver of pain signaling, is a clinically validated target for the development of novel, non-addictive pain therapeutics. Small molecule inhibitors against NaV1.8 have shown promise in acute pain indications, but large clinical effect sizes have not yet been demonstrated and efficacy in chronic pain indications are lacking.

An alternative strategy to target NaV1.8 channels for analgesia is to reduce the number of channels that are present on nociceptor membranes. We generated a therapeutic heterobifunctional protein, named UbiquiNaV, that contains a NaV1.8-selective binding module and the catalytic subunit of the NEDD4 E3 Ubiquitin ligase. We show that UbiquiNav significantly reduces channel expression in the plasma membrane and reduces NaV1.8 currents in rodent sensory neurons. We demonstrate that UbiquiNaV is selective for NaV1.8 over other NaV isoforms and other components of the sensory neuronal electrogenisome. We then show that UbiquiNaV normalizes the distribution of NaV1.8 protein to distal axons, and that UbiquiNaV normalizes the neuronal hyperexcitability in in vitro models of inflammatory and chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. Our results serve as a blueprint for the design of therapeutics that leverage the selective ubiquitination of NaV1.8 channels for analgesia.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

FER is required for the perception of endogenous RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides to control various aspects of plant growth, development and immunity. RALFs are perceived by FER- LORELEI-LIKE GPI-ANCHORED PROTEIN (LLG) heterocomplexes to induce cellular responses and bind to LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT EXTENSIN (LRX) proteins as structural components of the cell wall. We show that FER s RALF ligands are necessary for full success of powdery mildew colonization. Our data reveals that LLGs and LRXs are also powdery mildew susceptibility factors, and that the susceptibility function of RALFs is best explained by a combination of peptide signalling and cell wall-related effects. We further reveal that cell wall and apoplastic pH homeostasis, hallmark features of RALF function, support powdery mildew reproductive success. The function of host RALF peptides is underlined by the fact that, in contrast to previously described pathogens that hijack FER for colonization, powdery mildew fungi do not produce functional RALF mimics. Surprisingly, RALF-dependent powdery mildew pathogenesis is partially independent of FER. The resistance phenotype of ralf and fer mutants is not associated with de-regulated salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signalling, important defense-related phytohormones. Collectively, powdery mildew fungi require RALF signalling for apoplastic pH regulation and cell wall structural organization for successful colonization, highlighting a novel mechanism for host susceptibility by obligate biotrophic fungi.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

In this study, we explored topological inversion and soma-targeting strategies, which are complementary to conventional mutagenesis, to re-engineer a red genetically encoded calcium indicator, FRCaMP, for enhanced in vivo performance. The resulting sensors, FRCaMPi and soma-targeted FRCaMPi (SomaFRCaMPi), exhibit up to 2-fold higher dynamic range and peak {Delta}F/F0 per single AP compared to widely used jRGECO1a in neurons in culture and in vivo. Compared to jRGECO1a and FRCaMPi, SomaFRCaMPi reduces erroneous correlation of neuronal activity in the brains of mice and zebrafish by two- to four-fold due to diminished neuropil contamination without compromising the signal-to-noise ratio.

This suggests that simple tractography techniques might not be sensitive enough to identify language dominance. Significant insights into the functional organization of the human brain may be achieved by considering networks and brain connectivity, providing more information about discrepancies in people with different hemispheric language dominance. In this study, we examined 285 healthy participants compare their structural connectomes at the whole-brain level and determine the networks responsible for the three different functional language lateralisation groups (typical, atypical and strongly atypical). Probabilistic tractography generated whole-brain tractograms, and white matter fibres were filtered according to anatomical Boolean guidelines. Connectivity matrices with nodes corresponding to supramodal sentence areas in the language atlas and edges weighted by fractional anisotropy (FA) were generated to compare the groups using graph theory and network-based statistic (NBS) approaches. We demonstrated that both atypical (bilateral) and strongly atypical (right-lateralised) lateralisation are characterised by heightened interhemispheric temporal connectivity. Post-hoc analyses showed that strongly atypical individuals exhibited increased temporo-frontal connectivity, while atypical individuals had enhanced temporal and frontal connectivity but lacked temporo-frontal connections. These connectivity patterns diverge from traditional models of hemispheric dominance, suggesting a reliance on integrated bilateral networks in atypically lateralised individuals. This reflects distinct neural mechanisms underlying atypical language organisation, departing from developmental trajectory of typical lateralisation and offering insights into cognitive flexibility and clinical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

PDN is a common and challenging complication of diabetes, characterized by changes in skin innervation accompanied by neuropathic pain. While there is growing evidence that epidermal non-neuronal cells, such as resident immune cells, play a crucial role in the progression of PDN, the underlying mechanisms of this neuropathy remain poorly understood. In our studies, we utilized transgenic methods, pain behavioral assessments, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in a clinically relevant high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model of PDN and skin biopsy samples from PDN patients, to investigate the role of epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) in this condition. We observed an increased density of LCs in the skin of PDN male mice coinciding with the onset of mechanical allodynia. Furthermore, we found that LCs density correlated with small fiber degeneration in HFD mice and skin biopsies taken from well-characterized PDN patients compared to healthy controls. Importantly, the selective ablation of LCs using a diphtheria-toxin strategy was found to prevent nociceptive behavior in male mice. This indicates that LCs are both necessary and sufficient for the development of mechanical allodynia and spontaneous pain in HFD male mice. Interestingly, when LCs were ablated in HFD female mice, it did not prevent but rather promoted pain behavior, suggesting the existence of sex-specific mechanisms mediated by LCs. scRNAseq transcriptomic analysis of the paw epidermis from HFD mice, which included both males and females, revealed significant sex-mediated differences in the expression of specific target genes within this PDN model. In male mice, scRNAseq identified differentially expressed genes associated with axonal guidance and immune responses in LCs. Additionally, by integrating single-cell RNA data from the epidermis and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of male mice, we uncovered altered communication between LCs and cutaneous afferents through Semaphorin-Plexin signaling pathways in PDN. These findings highlight LCs as key contributors to the development of PDN and suggest their potential as therapeutic targets for innovative treatments, particularly topical therapies aimed at modulating immune cell activity and neuroimmune communication in the skin. Our investigations of male and female mice indicate that LCs may play different roles in mechanical sensation under both normal and pathological conditions, such as PDN. This underscores the importance of considering sex differences when developing more effective treatments.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

A recent functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) study at 7T demonstrated for the first time layer-specific responses in the human dlPFC during working memory. Superficial layers were more active during the delay period when working memory items needed to be manipulated compared to mere maintenance. In contrast, deeper layers were more active during the motor response to a probe compared to non-action. Like many current layer fMRI studies, this study relied on several manual and semi-manual processing steps, including the selection of regions of interest. To test the replicability of these findings, we conducted a pre-registered replication of this study in 21 subjects using a fully automated and reproducible analysis pipeline. Our results do not show the same layer-specific effects. Although we observed higher activity in the superficial layers in response to working memory manipulation during the delay period, we did not find any evidence for stronger deep layer involvement during motor response in the probe period. We argue that our results are biologically plausible in light of previous research as well as methodological considerations inherent in layer fMRI acquisition and analysis. Consequently, we conclude that the evidence regarding the functional role of different layers within the human dlPFC during working memory remains inconclusive. A focus on replicability, reproducibility, and a better understanding of the influence of methodological choices will help layer fMRI become a more routine tool in cognitive neuroscience.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

To address this question, we introduce Genomic Taxometric Analysis of Continuous and Case-Control data (GTACCC), a novel method for systematically evaluating continuity and differentiation of traits across the severity spectrum. GTACCCs key innovation lies in binarizing continuous data at multiple severity thresholds, enabling the estimation of genetic continuity and differentiation within the trait and in its relation to other traits via multivariate models. We apply GTACCC to self-reported neuroticism data from UK Biobank (N= 414,448) and clinically ascertained major depressive disorder (MDD) data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (Neff = 111,221). We find that while neuroticism shares a considerable portion of its genetic etiology with MDD across the nonclinical, and even very low, range of (rg ~ .50), genetic sharing increases monotonically across the severity spectrum, approaching unity only at the highest levels of severity (rg ~ 1.0). Genomic structural equation models indicate that a single liability threshold model of negative emotionality is less consistent with the data than a multifactor model, suggesting that a gradient of genetic differentiation emerges across the spectrum of negative emotionality. Thus, within continuous measures of negative emotionality, partly distinct genetic liabilities exist at varying severity levels, with only the most severe levels associated with liabilities that approach equivalence to MDD genetics.","NA","medrxiv",1738793368553

In light of these findings, most countries have established specific guidelines regarding indoor air quality in university rooms. In France, for instance, the maximum permissible concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in university rooms without mechanical ventilation is set at 1,300 parts per million (ppm), and the minimum volume per occupant is 15 m3. For rooms with mechanical ventilation, the minimum clean air flow rate is 25 m3/h/occupant.

The primary objective of this study was to design and demonstrate the feasibility of a simple, cost-effective method for comparing the reality of indoor air quality in all university rooms with legal requirements. The secondary objectives of the present study were to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in identifying and reporting problematic situations, and in issuing practical recommendations.

Mobile CO2 sensors (Aranet4) were provided to volunteer lecturers to measure the CO2 concentration during and after classes. The number of occupants and the condition of openings were also recorded. These data were supplemented by measurements from 117 fixed Carbon Nexelec sensors. The data were then fitted to a model, which enabled the characterization of air quality and the estimation of the gauge reduction required to comply with the law.

None of the 14 rooms without mechanical ventilation complied with the legal minimum of 15 m3/occupant. 75% of the third quartiles of CO2 concentrations during classes exceeded 2692 ppm. In rooms with mechanical ventilation, median clean air flow was 15 m3/h/occupant at 100% occupancy (9 m3/h/occupant for the first quartile). In 32 out of 41 rooms with mechanical ventilation (78%), the clean air flow was estimated to be below the legal minimum of 25 m3/h/occupant at 100% occupancy. Concentrations in excess of 5,000 ppm were observed in 23 of the 101 rooms equipped with fixed sensors.

The proposed method has demonstrated its feasibility in real-life conditions.

We sought to determine whether a mitochondrial-targeted dietary supplement designed for children with ASD improved mitochondrial function and ASD symptomatology using a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design. Sixteen children [Mean Age 9y 4m; 88% male] with non-syndromic ASD and mitochondrial enzyme abnormalities, as measured by MitoSwab (Religen, Plymouth Meeting, PA), received weight-adjusted SpectrumNeeds(R) (NeuroNeeds, Old Lyme, CT) and QNeeds(R) (NeuroNeeds) and placebos matched on taste, texture and appearance during two separate 12-week blocks. Which product received first was randomized. The treatment significantly normalized citrate synthase and complex IV activity as measured by the MitoSwab. Mitochondrial respiration of peripheral blood mononuclear cell respiration, as measured by the Seahorse XFe96 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) with the mitochondrial oxidative stress test, became more resilient to oxidative stress after the treatment, particularly in children with poor neurodevelopment. The mitochondrial supplement demonstrated significant improvement in standardized parent-rated scales in neurodevelopment, social withdrawal, and hyperactivity with large effect sizes (Cohens d = 0.77-1.25), while changes measured by the clinical and psychometric instruments were not significantly different. Adverse effects were minimal. This small study on children with ASD and mitochondrial abnormalities demonstrates that a simple, well-tolerated mitochondrial-targeted dietary supplement can improve mitochondrial physiology, ASD symptoms. Further larger controlled studies need to verify and extend these findings. These findings are significant as children with ASD have few other effective treatments.","NA","medrxiv",1738793368553

By design, standard VCFs do not include data from sites where all individuals are homozygous for the reference allele (""invariant sites"") and thus do not differentiate these from sites where data are completely missing. However, missing data are a key feature of biological datasets across all domains of genomics, and many recent studies have shown that missing data can introduce a variety of statistical biases in the estimation of key population genetic parameters. A solution to this limitation is to include invariant sites in a standard VCF, creating an ""all-sites VCF"", exposing missing and invariant sites explicitly. One hurdle to the wider adoption of all-sites VCFs is a reliable parameterized simulation framework for generating biologically realistic all-sites VCFs. Here, we introduce an open-source command line tool, vcfsim, that interfaces with the popular coalescent simulation platform msprime and provides convenience functions for simulating all-sites VCFs with variable levels of ploidy and missing data. We show that the post-processed VCFs generated using vcfsim align precisely with population genetic expectations (i.e. are statistically identical to raw msprime output) and can accurately introduce missing data and varying ploidy levels, including the simulation of intraindividual ploidy variation (e.g. heterogametic sex chromosomes). We suggest vcfsim will be a useful tool for the benchmarking of new software tools, training of machine learning models, and the exploration of the effects of missing data in genomics data sets.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

To correlate AZ maturation with synaptic output, quantal imaging was performed at serially imaged time-stamped Drosophila synapses. Evoked release strength correlated strongly with AZ age and accumulation of late AZ scaffolds, while immature sites lacking VDCC accumulation supported spontaneous release. To examine how neuronal activity regulates AZ maturation and protein accumulation, the effects of disruptions to SV fusion or action potential generation were analyzed. Decreasing neuronal activity reduced AZ seeding and caused hyperaccumulation of presynaptic material at existing AZs. Although enlarged AZs are also observed in rab3 mutants, activity reduction acted through an independent mechanism that required postsynaptic glutamate receptor-dependent signaling. Together, these data indicate AZ maturation state sets distinct presynaptic release modes and output strength, with neuronal activity shaping both AZ number and size across development.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Convergent evidence suggests that neurodevelopment proceeds in a hierarchical manner, characterized by heterogeneous maturation patterns across brain regions and networks. However, the maturation of the intrinsic spatiotemporal propagations of brain activity remains largely unexplored. This study aims to bridge this gap by delineating spatiotemporal propagations from childhood to early adulthood. By leveraging a recently developed approach that captures time-lag dynamic propagations, we characterized intrinsic dynamic propagations along three axes: sensory-association (S-A), 'task-positive' to default networks (TP-D), and somatomotor-visual (SM-V) networks, which progress towards adult-like brain dynamics from childhood to early adulthood. Importantly, we demonstrated that as participants mature, there is a prolonged occurrence of the S-A and TP-D propagation states, indicating that they spend more time in these states. Conversely, the prevalence of SM-V propagation states declines during development. Notably, top-down propagations along the S-A axis exhibited an age-dependent increase in occurrence, serving as a superior predictor of cognitive scores compared to bottom-up S-A propagation. These findings were replicated across two independent cohorts (N = 677 in total), emphasizing the robustness and generalizability of these findings. Our results provide new insights into the emergence of adult-like functional dynamics during youth and their role in supporting cognition.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

We observed a dramatic buildup of proteins within the body cavity or pseudocoelom of aged adults that was blunted by interventions that extend lifespan: caloric restriction (CR) and the reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway. Using a combination of microscopy, proteomic analysis, and validation with mutant strains, we identified vitellogenins as the key molecular components of the protein buildup in the pseudocoelom. Vitellogenins shuttle nutrients from intestine to embryos and are homologous to human apolipoprotein B, the causal driver of cardiovascular disease. We then showed that CR and knockdown of vitellogenins both extend lifespan by >60%, but their combination has no additional effect on lifespan, suggesting that CR extends the lifespan of C. elegans in part by inhibiting vitellogenesis.

While significant advances have been made in elucidating the anterior-posterior (AP) axis patterning across well-studied bilaterian lineages, our understanding of the conservation of AP-patterning gene expression in underexplored protostomes with a phylogenetically informative position remains limited. Chaetognaths, a group of marine invertebrates, form a clade with Gnathifera as a sister to the remaining Lophotrochozoa, occupying an early-diverging branch of the spiralian lineage. Their phylogenetic position provides potentially valuable evolutionary insights into whether the AP patterning reflects conserved bilaterian mechanisms or reveals distinct lineage-specific adaptations. Here, we investigate the expression patterns of anterior nervous system markers (otx, nk2.1, six3/6) and Hox genes in post-embryonic stages of the chaetognath Spadella cephaloptera using fluorescence whole-mount in situ hybridization. We identify expression domains of anterior-patterning genes in the cerebral ganglion and head structures, consistent with their conserved role in anterior central nervous system (CNS) specification in bilaterians. Additionally, we describe a staggered expression pattern of Hox genes, including previously undescribed central (Sce-med6) and posterior class (Sce-postC and Sce-postD), along the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and post-anal tail. Our results demonstrate that chaetognaths exhibit the most extensive repertoire of Hox genes among protostomes, within metazoans only surpassed by chordates. All AP patterning genes are expressed in a staggered manner, with Hox gene expression absent in the head region. This pattern resembles the conserved expression profile inferred for the last common bilaterian ancestor and is only rudimentarily visible in other spiralians, including annelids and mollusks. Posterior Hox genes including the newly discovered postC and postD genes are absent in the hitherto investigated gnathiferan sister groups such as rotifers. The absence of a postanal tail in rotifers and other gnathiferans, combined with the expression of posterior Hox genes in the elongated postanal tail region, suggests their involvement in the formation of this unique chaetognath structure. Posterior flexibility of Hox genes, as previously hypothesized for chordates, likely contributed to the formation of the chaetognath tail during the early Cambrian period.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

This study explores the mechanisms of redox homeostasis in such niches and investigates myeloid-like blood progenitor cells that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and moderate it developmentally. Our findings reveal that during lymph gland development, as the blood-progenitor cells oxidize pyruvate via the TCA cycle leading to the generation of ROS, these cell also de novo synthesize GSH to counter excessive ROS and ensure redox balance. GABA metabolism, through GABA-shunt, restricts pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and consequently TCA rate. This allows a metabolic route to sustain serine levels in these cells which is the rate limiting precursor controlling de novo GSH production. Disruption of GABA metabolism leads to a metabolic imbalance, characterized by excessive PDH activity, heightened TCA rate leading to impaired serine/GSH production and overall ROS dysregulation. Overall, the study presents a unique metabolic state whereby, in the blood-progenitor cells, by keeping PDH and TCA activity in check and promoting serine/GSH generation, GABA metabolism establishes a metabolic framework that optimises the use of ROS in blood-progenitors, while ensuring redox homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Here we use Caenorhabditis species to study neuron-type robustness, plasticity and evolution, using VC4 and VC5 cholinergic motoneurons as models. In C. elegans, we found that epigenetic silencing through histone 3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) is necessary to suppress the expression of the serotonin reuptake gene mod-5/Sert and a serotonergic phenotype in these cells. In contrast, we observed that VC4 and VC5 neurons in the Angaria group of species of the Caenorhabditis genus have evolved an intense serotonergic staining. This phenotype is caused by the emergence of a new enhancer in the mod-5/Sert locus, which has been recruited to the ancestral neuron-type gene regulatory network. Enhancer transfer from C. angaria is sufficient to impose a constitutive serotonergic fate in C. elegans. Remarkably, acquiring this new trait modulates egg-laying responses to high levels of exogenous serotonin, which can be found in specific environments. Finally, we discovered that the repression of the serotonergic fate in C. elegans VC4 and VC5 neurons is indeed a plastic trait that can be adjusted in specific environmental growth conditions to elicit egg-laying behaviours similar to those observed in Angaria species. Our work identifies gene regulatory mechanisms that coordinate the generation of robust neuron-type-specific programs with plastic gene expression responses.

Here, we show that neither paradigm fully accounts for telomere length inheritance, which also depends on a parent-of-origin effect on telomere elongation in the early embryo. By reciprocally crossing mouse strains with different telomere lengths, we find that telomeres elongate in hybrid embryos only when maternal telomeres are short and paternal telomeres are long. In the reciprocal cross, telomeres shorten. These differences in embryonic telomere elongation, which emerge before zygotic genome activation, predict adult telomere length. Moreover, when telomeres do elongate, we find molecular signatures of a recombination-based mechanism of telomere elongation, called the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway, previously suggested to elongate telomeres in the pre-implantation embryo. We propose that ALT is triggered by a combination of genetic asymmetry in telomere length and epigenetic asymmetry between maternal and paternal chromosomes in the zygote. Our findings offer new insight into the complex interaction of genetic and epigenetic determinants of telomere length inheritance.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

The estrogen-related receptor (ERR) subfamily of orphan nuclear receptors are major transcriptional regulators of metabolism. In mammals, ERRs have roles in regulating mitochondrial biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, as well as stem cell maintenance. The sole Drosophila ERR ortholog promotes larval growth by establishing a metabolic state during the latter half of embryogenesis. In addition, ERR is required in adult Drosophila males to coordinate glycolytic metabolism with lipid synthesis and within the testis to regulate spermatogenesis gene expression and fertility. Despite extensive work characterizing of the role of ERR in Drosophila metabolism, whether ERR has a conserved requirement in regulating stem cell behavior has been understudied. To determine whether ERR regulates stem cell activity in Drosophila, we used the established adult female germline stem cell (GSC) lineage as a model. We found that whole-body ERR knockout in adult females using conditional heat shock-driven FLP-FRT recombination significantly reduces egg production and decreases GSC number. In addition, we found that ERR activity is required cell-autonomously in the adult female germline for maintenance of GSCs; whereas ERR regulation of GSCs is independent of its activity in adult female adipocytes. Our results highlight an ancient and conserved role for ERRs in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal.

SUMMARYTissue function and regeneration are dependent on stem cell populations, which relies on the coordination of energy homeostasis between multiple tissues within an organism. Zike et al report that the estrogen-related receptor (ERR) is required in adult Drosophila females to maintain germline stem cell number in the ovary to promote egg production. Furthermore, ERR regulation of stem cell maintenance is dependent on its cell autonomous role in the germline, but not through adipocyte-specific ERR activity. These findings demonstrate that the sole Drosophila ERR has a conserved role in regulating stem cell lineages (similar as the mammalian ERR{beta} ortholog) and can be used as a model to understand regulation of stem cell lineages as well as metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Within Arthropoda, evidence suggests that Pax6 genes are necessary for the specification of eyes in myriapods, crustaceans, and insects. However, recent data have argued that Pax6 genes lack a role in the development of the eyes in Chelicerata (=arachnids, horseshoe crabs, and sea spiders). An alternative hypothesis argues that the absence of Pax6 expression in developing chelicerate eyes could be explained by an earlier role for these genes in patterning eye precursor cells. The arachnid mite Archegozetes longisetosus lacks eyes, however it retains two Pax6 paralogs in its genome. By leveraging these aspects of A. longisetosus, we tested the hypothesis that ancestrally chelicerates did not use Pax6 genes to pattern their eyes but rather used them to pattern the central nervous system. We reasoned that if we observed comparable expression patterns of Pax6 genes in A. longisetosus in comparison to those in arachnids that have retained eyes, then this would support the hypothesis that Pax6 genes were not ancestrally used for eye specification in chelicerates.

ResultsWe followed the expression of canonical arthropod retinal determination genes to confirm that A. longisetosus does not develop vestigial eyes. We found that the expression of the Pax6 paralogs was consistent with their roles in the development of the ocular region and central nervous system. By co- staining for these genes simultaneously with the conserved head patterning gene orthodenticle, we also observed early expression patterns of these genes in the protocerebrum of early A. longisetosus embryos that are comparable to those arachnids with embryonic eyes.

ConclusionsOur data provide support for the hypothesis that Pax6 genes were not ancestrally used to pattern chelicerate eyes. The expression patterns of Pax6 genes in A. longisetosus were comparable to those of other arachnids that have eyes. This suggests that the retention of Pax6 genes in A. longisetosus is due to their ancestral, non-eye patterning roles. Further supporting this hypothesis is our observation that A. longisetosus does not pattern vestigial eyes. Lastly, our data suggests that the Pax6 genes, with orthodenticle, acted to specify the ancestral arachnid protocerebrum.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we explore the phenotypic disparity and mechanical properties of the lower jaw in Pelagiaria, a morphologically diverse but relatively small clade of open-ocean fishes which are hypothesized to have radiated near the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) mass extinction event. We found that body elongation and diet are not significantly correlated with jaw shape, but that habitat depth and tooth type are. Mechanical advantage (MA) is significantly correlated with mandible shape, with jaw-closing MA being most strongly correlated. Pelagiarian jaw shapes fall broadly into six morphotypes, of which two show significantly higher closing MA than other groups, despite differing substantially in shape. The high morphological disparity of pelagiarian mandible shape was established very early in their evolutionary history, and high levels of disparity have been maintained over tens of millions of years; this is consistent with the hypothesis that Pelagiaria represents an ancient adaptive radiation. Our results demonstrate both the mechanical and morphological diversity of the pelagiarian mandible and highlight the crucial role that morphological diversification has played in the trophic radiation of this clade.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Our previous studies have identified epidermal stem cells (ESCs) as critical for wound healing and HS remodeling, with its extracellular vesicles (EVs) playing a vital role. However, the specific mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we first discovered that ESC-EVs could effectively induce the mesenchymal-epidermal transition (MET) of HS fibroblasts (HSFs) and inhibit their biological activity. Furthermore, by next-generation sequencing and multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 system, we elucidated that this therapeutic effect is mediated by the miR-200 family (miR-200s) encapsulated in ESC-EVs, which targeted and inhibited ZEB1 and ZEB2 in HSFs. This vital role and mechanism have been thoroughly validated in both in vitro cell experiments and in vivo rat tail HS (RHS) models. These findings not only shed light on a previously unidentified mechanism of ESC-EVs for HS, but also provide potential novel targets and strategies for its precise treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Here, we asked whether any heterochromatic histone marks are present on the Xi in naive B cells, and whether Xist RNA is required for their deposition and retention following stimulation. We find that the Xi in naive B cells is depleted for H2AK119Ub and H3K9me3 but enriched for DNA methylation and H3K27me3, which maintain an Xist RNA-dependent epigenetic memory of XCI. Upon stimulation, Xist-independent H3K27me3 and Xist-dependent H2AK119Ub modifications accumulate across the Xi with temporal and spatial specificity.

Blocking integrin signaling severely reduced the self-renewal of the PGC, indicating that a PGC-matrix interaction is an essential process for self-renewal. We investigated the properties of somatic cell differentiated PGCs and expression analyses suggested that the PGCs undergo a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition caused by excess PGC-matrix interactions. Finally, we conducted a long-term culture of chicken PGCs with matrix components, resulting in significant induction of their somatic conversion. These results suggested that a high level of PGC-matrix interaction can cause somatic conversion, whilst a moderate level is essential for their proliferation.

In vitro analyses suggest SMO signaling is allosterically enhanced by combinatorial ligand binding to these pockets but in vivo evidence of SMO allostery is lacking. Herein, we map an AA binding pocket at the top of the 7TM bundle and show that its disruption attenuates SHH and sterol-stimulated SMO induction. A knockin mouse model of compromised AA binding reveals that homozygous mutant mice are cyanotic, exhibit high perinatal lethality, and show congenital heart disease.

Here, we fine-tune the mechanical environment of murine gastruloids, three-dimensional in vitro models of early embryogenesis, by embedding them in bioinert hydrogels with precisely tunable stiffness and timing of application. This approach reveals that external constraints can selectively influence transcriptional profiles, patterning, or morphology, depending on the level and timing of mechanical modulation. Gastruloids embedded in ultra-soft hydrogels (< 30 Pa) elongate robustly, preserving both anteroposterior patterning and transcriptional profiles. In contrast, embedding at higher stiffness disrupts polarization while leaving gene expression largely unaffected. Conversely, earlier embedding significantly impacts transcriptional profiles independently of polarization defects, highlighting the uncoupling of patterning and transcription. These findings suggest that distinct cellular states respond differently to external constraints. Live imaging and cell tracking demonstrate that impaired cell motility underlies polarization defects, underscoring the role of mechanical forces in shaping morphogenesis independently of transcriptional changes. By allowing precise control over external mechanical boundaries, our approach provides a powerful platform to dissect how physical and biochemical factors interact to orchestrate early embryonic development.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

BO modelling in Dravet Syndrome, a late-onset epileptic ND, represents a great challenge since BO variability accumulates with time, when phenotype shows in vitro. Leveraging deep learning, we developed ImPheNet, a predictive tool grounded in BO live imaging datasets. ImPheNet accurately classified phenotypes and assessed drug toxicity in BO derived from DS, revealing differences between genotypes and upon antiseizure drug exposure.

Traditionally, research has largely focused on Radial Glial Cells (RGCs), which produce neurons and glia. However, recent findings revealed that the progenitor landscape is more complex and heterogeneous than previously understood. Emerging evidence indicates that NG2 glia, also known as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), may contribute to generating other cell types, including neurons and astrocytes. This suggests that NG2 glia, or a specific subset, may act as multipotent NPCs, expanding their role in brain development beyond their known lineage.

We explore the cellular, molecular, and functional differences between NG2- and GFAP- expressing progenitors (NG2-NPCs and GFAP-NPCs) across different developmental stages. Using in-utero electroporation and StarTrack technology, we examined whether these progenitors represent distinct populations and analyzed how their differences influence their functional roles based on cell fate decisions. Our findings uncover functional divergence between NG2-NPCs and GFAP-NPCs, particularly regarding their cell fate decisions. While both populations contribute to the formation of neurons and glial cells, the progeny of NG2-NPCs and GFAP-NPCs differ markedly in their contributions to neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Further, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of NG2-NPCs and GFAP-NPCs to elucidate the molecular basis for these functional differences. This study demonstrates distinct gene expression profiles. While NG2-NPCs show enrichment for genes associated with neurogenesis and synaptic transport, GFAP-NPCs displayed upregulation of genes involved in progenitor cell maintenance. This indicates that each progenitor type is governed by distinct molecular programs, shaping their contributions to brain architecture and function. In summary, our findings underscore the divergent roles of NG2-NPCs and GFAP-NPCs in driving cellular diversity and functional maturation in brain development, providing new insights into how these progenitor populations contribute to neural diversity and brain function.

During development of the Drosophila oocyte, interactions between di_erent somatic follicle cell types and the germline-derived nurse cells and the future oocyte are crucial for coordinating oogenesis. However, the molecular basis of their interaction throughout enormous morphological changes remains largely unexplored. During late oogenesis, nurse cells transfer their cytoplasmic content into the oocyte, while anterior follicle cells (AFCs) must closely envelop the nurse cells to induce phagoptosis and remove their remnants. We identify E-cadherin-based spot junctions as novel adhesive complexes at this essential soma-germline interface. AFCs reorganize their E-cadherin from intraepithelial adherens junctions to their apical surface to form interlineage spot junctions with nurse cells, representing a switch in adhesive and thus mechanical coupling. The distribution and density of these junctions is stably organized, even as the interface undergoes dramatic size changes. Additionally, we show that these junctions integrate into a microvilli-rich nurse cell surface, influencing microvilli architecture. Importantly, disruption of E-cadherin spot junctions impairs nurse cell enveloping. Our findings reveal a switch from intra-lineage to inter-lineage mechanical coupling that is driven by the formation of E-Cadherin spot junctions and highlights their essential role in ensuring robust soma-germline coupling and coordination during nurse cell dumping in late oogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Quantitative methods and tools have emerged as valuable mechanisms to address this issue; however, the stochasticity of HSCs presents significant challenges for mathematical modeling, especially when bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental validation. In this work, we have built a flexible and user-friendly stochastic dynamical and spatial model for long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) and short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs) that captures experimentally observed cellular variability and heterogeneity. Our model implements the behavior of LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs and predicts their homeostatic dynamics. Furthermore, our model can be modified to explore various biological scenarios, such as stress-induced perturbations mediated by apoptosis, and successfully implement these conditions. Finally, the model incorporates spatial dynamics, simulating cell behavior in a 2D environment by combining Brownian motion with spatially graded parameters.

The placenta, a key organ at the maternal-fetal interface, responds to maternal obesity and regulates fetal growth. To investigate the molecular features of physiological adaptation, we perform single-nuclei RNA-seq on human placentas and compared the transcriptomic profiles of women with obesity delivering appropriate-or large-for-gestational age (i.e., AGA and LGA) babies with those from normal-weight healthy controls delivering AGA babies. Commonness-score metric is developed to identify responses attributable to maternal obesity effects or fetal growth. We find hypoxia and induction of TNF- signaling in syncytiotrophoblasts, while the receptor tyrosine kinases are down-regulated in cytotrophoblasts in maternal obesity irrespective of fetal growth. Notably, we identify that the fine-tune of PI3K-AKT and MAPK cascade signaling pathways in cytotrophoblasts underlies AGA versus LGA. Hofbauer cells upregulate immunometabolic genes specifically in LGA outcomes and also express most of the ligands detected only in placentas of LGA. Finally, we also use a novel microfluidic organs-on-a-chip device fabricated for co-culturing adipose spheroids and trophoblast organoids.

We show that distal colonic stem cells uniquely require NOX1-generated ROS to maintain a relatively oxidized state that promotes stem cell self-renewal.

Our studies therefore provide a basis for understanding regeneration dynamics and disease propensity in the distal large intestine.

This switch is ""flipped"" by the expression of genes that promote male- or female-specific development. Many lineages have evolved sex chromosomes that act as primary signals for sex determination. However, haplodiploidy (males are haploid and females are diploid), which occurs in ca. 12% of animal species, is incompatible with sex chromosomes. Haplodiploid taxa must, therefore, rely on other strategies for sex determination. One mechanism, ""complementary sex determination"" (CSD), uses heterozygosity as a proxy for diploidy. In CSD, heterozygosity at a sex determination locus triggers female development, while hemizygosity or homozygosity permits male development. CSD loci have been mapped in honeybees and two ant species, but we know little about their evolutionary history. Here, we investigate sex determination in the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi. We identified a 46kb candidate CSD locus at which all females are heterozygous, but diploid males are homozygous for either allele. As expected for CSD loci, the candidate locus has more alleles than most other loci, resulting in a peak of nucleotide diversity. This peak negligibly affects the amino acid sequences of protein-coding genes, suggesting that heterozygosity of a non-coding genomic sequence triggers female development. This locus is distinct from the CSD locus in honeybees but homologous to a CSD locus mapped in two distantly related ant species, implying that this molecular mechanism has been conserved since a common ancestor that lived approximately 112 million years ago.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Using both polymorphism- and divergence-based inference approaches, we quantify fine-scale mutation and recombination rate maps, study the demographic and selective processes additionally shaping variation on the X chromosome, and compare these estimates to those recently inferred from the autosomes in this species. Results suggest that an equal sex ratio is most consistent with observed patterns of variation, and that no sex-specific demographic patterns are needed to fit the empirical site frequency spectrum. Further, reduced rates of recombination were observed relative to the autosomes as would be expected, whereas mutation rates were inferred to be similar. Utilizing the estimated population history together with the mutation and recombination rate maps, we evaluated evidence for both recent and recurrent selective sweeps as well as balancing selection across the X chromosome, finding no significant evidence supporting the action of these episodic processes. Overall, these analyses provide new insights into the evolution of the X chromosome in this species, which represents one of the earliest splits in the primate clade.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

In annelids, segmentation occurs at different developmental stages through a variety of processes, yet the molecular pathways remain underexplored. Aiming to compare segmentation patterns in ontogeny and phylogeny, we analysed the expression of Avi-en (homologous to engrailed) and Avi-wnt1 in the nereidid polychaete Alitta virens. Using in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and cell proliferation assays, we mapped the spatiotemporal expression of these genes across embryonic, larval, and postlarval stages. We found that Avi-en was expressed in solid lateral domains early in the unsegmented protrochophore stage and progressed through a metameric pattern, while Avi-wnt1 expression appeared later, also aligning with segmental boundaries. At the nectochaete stage, the posterior domain of Avi-en expression in the growth zone expanded and splitted into two due to increased cell proliferation. The postlarval segment primordium then developed progressively, culminating in the activation of Avi-wnt1 at the posterior border. According to available published data, the revealed pattern of gradual segment formation is unique to nereidids. The observed divergence in gene expression and cell proliferation across annelids suggests that segmentation in bilaterians did not arise from a common ancestral mechanism. Our study enhances future progress in understanding the evolution of body patterning by providing a foundation for future comparisons.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Traditionally considered non-essential in terminally differentiated cells, recent evidence suggests that centrosomes play vital roles in specialized cellular contexts. In mammalian neurons, centrosome-mediated microtubule remodeling is essential for axon elongation, with centrosome dysfunction leading to axonal misrouting and growth defects. Although active centrosomes have been detected in the tracheal terminal cells of Drosophila melanogaster, their activity in neurons in vivo has not been observed. Their gradual loss during embryogenesis has been reported as non-essential for organogenesis, as adult flies can eclose without centrioles.

To investigate centrosome activity in neurons, we revisited Drosophila Sas-4 mutants, which exhibit centrosome loss (CL), and observed that 50% of homozygous mutant individuals fail to hatch as larvae. We analysed their development, focusing on the expressivity and penetrance of nervous system phenotypes, and examined centriole localization in neurons. Our findings confirm the presence of centrosomes in motor and sensory neurons in Drosophila and their localization near the nascent axon. CL conditions resulted in axonal misrouting and muscle developmental abnormalities. Targeted downregulation of Sas-4 in the pioneer motor neurons aCC and RP2 induced axon guidance errors, indicating an autonomous role for centrosomes in axonal navigation. Colocalization of acetylated- and {gamma}-tubulin with centrioles in motor neurons further confirmed the presence of functional centrosomes in these cells. Analysis of motor axons revealed that CL leads to axonal tortuosity, a characteristic associated with neurodegeneration. This is the first direct association of CL with axonal morphological phenotypes, highlighting the role of centrosomes in neuronal development and their broader influence on nervous system structure and function.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Here, we use an automated algebraic method to systematically screen for Turing networks capable of generating diverse spatial patterns from noise, including periodic static waves, traveling waves and noise-amplifying patterns. We organize these networks into a topological atlas--a higher-level graph where nodes represent Turing networks linked together when they differ by only one regulatory interaction. In this atlas, Turing networks are arranged into distinct clusters showing a remarkable correspondence between network topology and self-organizing behaviors. Using an analytical approach, we identify the specific regulatory feedbacks that characterize each behavior. Moreover, we discover that different clusters are interconnected by multifunctional networks that can transition between behaviors upon feedback modulation. Among these networks, we find a new class of multiphase Turing networks capable of altering the phase of periodic wave patterns depending on the parameters, and networks that can transition between static and oscillatory Turing behaviors. The atlas further highlights the crucial role of feedback on immobile nodes in regulating pattern formation speed and precision by canalizing system noise. Overall, our study provides a novel framework to study the evolution and development of multicellular self-organization through changes in network topology and feedback modulation. This offers insights into how genetic regulatory networks can be tuned to drive pattern formation in developmental biology and in stem cell systems like embryoids and organoids.

Significance StatementBy employing an automated algebraic method, Regueria and Marcon construct a topological atlas that categorizes Turing networks based on their ability to produce periodic patterns, traveling waves, or noise amplifying patterns. The atlas identifies distinct topological clusters linked by multi-functional networks that can transition between behaviors through feedback modulation. Key findings highlight how modulation of regulatory cycle strength in time or space can promote transition between static and oscillatory periodic pattern. The study also reveals the importance of feedback on immobile nodes in managing noise and influencing pattern formation. Overall the topological atlas offers a new framework for examining the evolution and development of multicellular self-organization.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of long COVID on working memory using a single rapid online anonymous survey and working memory quiz. We analyzed working memory scores in relation to long COVID status (clinically diagnosed, self-reported, and non-long COVID), age, number of COVID-19 infections and long COVID duration, and subjective ratings of brain fog severity and overall life impact of symptoms. The study recruited 1064 participants aged 16 to over 85 years (83% from the United Kingdom) with 39% reporting long COVID. The results demonstrate that long COVID significantly impairs working memory, with the greatest deficits observed in clinically diagnosed cases. In addition, we found that working memory declined with age and multiple COVID-19 infections particularly in the diagnosed long COVID group. Moreover, individuals in the diagnosed long COVID group reported experiencing the most severe brain fog and the greatest impact of long COVID symptoms on their lives, and both of these factors were strongly correlated with lower memory scores. Participants who had been living with long COVID for a longer duration had lower memory scores. However, this relationship was likely influenced by the SARS-CoV-2 variant, as individuals with prolonged long COVID symptoms were more likely to have been infected with earlier variants (alpha and wild-type) which are linked to more severe disease outcomes. Our results suggest that long COVID is associated with significant working memory impairments, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions and support strategies for those with long COVID to address memory problems.","NA","medrxiv",1738793368553

Substantial work over the past century has pursued the generation of ever-more accurate maps of regional boundaries, using either expert judgement or data-driven clustering of functional, connectional, and/or architectonic properties. However, these approaches are often purely descriptive, have limited generalizability, and do not elucidate the underlying generative mechanisms that shape the regional organization of the brain. Here, we develop a novel approach that leverages a simple, hierarchical principle for generating a multiscale parcellation of any brain structure in any mammalian species using only its geometry. We show that this approach yields regions at any resolution scale that are more homogeneous than those defined in nearly all existing benchmark brain parcellations in use today across hundreds of anatomical, functional, cellular, and molecular brain properties measured in humans, macaques, marmosets, and mice. We additionally show how our method can be generalized to previously unstudied mammalian species for which no parcellations exist. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach captures the essence of a simple, hierarchical reaction-diffusion mechanism, in which the geometry of a brain structure shapes the spatial expression of putative patterning molecules linked to the formation of distinct regions through development. Our findings point to a highly conserved and universal influence of geometry on the regional organization of the mammalian brain.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

We sought to investigate whether symptom severity is influenced by changes in sex hormones over the menstrual cycle, or by hormonal contraception.

MethodsWe carried out a retrospective analysis of menstrual and symptom data, prospectively collected via the Visible app from individuals with long COVID, ME/CFS, or both, who had regular menstrual cycles, between 7th September 2022 and 6th March 2024. Mixed-effects models were used to examine associations between symptom severity, menstrual cycle phase and contraception type.

Findings948 users were included; 100% of users were female and 92.6% identified as women. The most tracked symptoms were fatigue (99{middle dot}5% of users), brain fog (88{middle dot}3%), headaches (85{middle dot}1%) and muscle aches (78{middle dot}6%). All menstrual cycle phases showed a modest, but significant, improvement compared to the menstrual phase, most markedly the early luteal (IRR = 0{middle dot}963, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}958-0{middle dot}968), but also the follicular (IRR = 0{middle dot}985, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}981-0{middle dot}990) and late luteal phases (IRR = 0{middle dot}980, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}974- 0{middle dot}985). Crashes (sudden and severe worsening of symptoms following exertion) were significantly more frequent during menstruation than in other phases. Users of combined hormonal contraception (n=70) had a statistically significant reduction in overall symptom score (OR = 0{middle dot}827, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}690-0{middle dot}992) and crash incidence (OR = 0{middle dot}548, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}350-0{middle dot}856) compared to those not using contraception (n=786).

InterpretationMenstruation is associated with worsened symptoms in long COVID and ME/CFS. Users of combined hormonal contraception report a lower symptom burden than non-users, suggesting a modulatory role of ovarian hormones. These findings could empower menstruating people living with long COVID and ME/CFS to anticipate cyclical changes in symptoms and plan their activities accordingly, and could also inform their use of contraception.

Increasingly that goal is understood as requiring huge numbers of people to be sequenced from every broadly-defined genetic ancestry group, so as not to miss ""ancestry-specific variants."" Here, we argue that this focus is unwarranted. We start with first principles considerations, based on models of mutation-drift-selection balance, which suggest highly pathogenic mutations should be at similarly low frequencies across ancestry groups. Severe disease mutations tend to be strongly deleterious, and thus evolutionarily young, and are kept at relatively constant frequency through recurrent mutation. Therefore, highly pathogenic alleles are shared identical by descent within extended families, not broad ancestry groups, and sequencing more people should yield similar numbers regardless of ancestry. We illustrate these points using gnomAD genetic ancestry groupings, and show that the classes of variants most likely to be highly pathogenic, notably sets of loss of function alleles at strongly constrained genes, conform well to these predictions. While there are many important reasons to diversify genomic research, strongly deleterious alleles will be found at comparable rates in people of all ancestries, and the information they provide about human biology is shared across ancestries.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368553

Analysis of archaellum encoding loci and predicted structures show remarkable similarity to the archaellum machinery. Moreover, using cryoEM single particle analysis, we solved the structure of the bacterial archaellum from Litorilinea aerophila, demonstrating the successful expression and assembly of this machinery in Bacteria and its function in swimming motility.

C. elegans extracts activated MAMP-triggered immune responses in Arabidopsis Col-0. Through chromatography-based purification, we identified a secreted trehalase and pinpointed a conserved peptide region essential for its MAMP activity. A corresponding peptide from root-knot nematode trehalase enabled the identification of lectin receptor kinases LecRK-V.5 and LecRK-V.6 as key components in immune induction. Notably, this peptide region is conserved across insect and fungal pathogens, with LecRK-Vs required for immune responses to these peptides, highlighting the role of LecRK-V-mediated mechanism for broad-spectrum pathogen detection via trehalase-derived peptides.

A proper error analysis for time series data leads to significantly wider confidence intervals than the official evaluation. In addition to vaccination and seasonality, only few NPIs - such as restrictions in public spaces - can be confidently associated with variations in [R](t), but even then effect sizes have large uncertainties. Furthermore, due to multicollinearity in NPI activation patterns, it is difficult to distinguish potential effects of NPIs in public spaces from other interventions that came into force early, such as physical distancing.

We experimentally screened 176 ultracompact CRISPR systems found in metagenomic data and applied protein engineering approaches to enhance the editing efficiency of NanoCas. The optimized NanoCas exhibits potent editing capabilities across various cell systems and tissues in vivo when administered via adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. This is accomplished despite NanoCas being approximately one-third the size of conventional CRISPR nucleases.

We further tested the efficacy of our NanoCas system in vivo in non-human primates (NHPs) resulting in editing levels above 30% in muscle tissues. The compact size of NanoCas, in combination with robust nuclease editing, opens the door for single-AAV editing of non-liver tissues in vivo, including the use of newer editing modalities such as reverse transcriptase (RT) editing, base editing, and epigenetic editing.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368554

Based on Proteobacteria, bacterial BAM is also structurally conserved, with an essential BamAD core and up to three auxiliary periplasmic lipoproteins of poorly defined function. Here we show, using structural biology, quantitative proteomics and functional assays, that the BAM complex is radically different within the Bacteroidetes, a large and important phylum widely distributed within the environment and animal microbiomes. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of BAM complexes from the human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and the human oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis show similar, seven-component complexes of [~]325 kDa in size with most of the mass in the extracellular space. In addition to canonical BamA and BamD, the complexes contain an integral OM protein named BamF that is essential and intimately associated with BamA, as well as four surface-exposed lipoproteins (SLPs) named BamG-J. Together, BamF-J form a large, extracellular dome that likely serves as an assembly cage for the {beta}-barrel-SLP complexes that are a hallmark of the Bacteroidetes. Our data suggest that BAM functionality in Bacteroidetes is substantially expanded from that in Proteobacteria and underscores the importance of studying other phyla for a more complete understanding of fundamental biological processes.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368554

Here, we compare traditional binary DEG classification with a rank-based method, grounded in Bayesian statistics, using a published yeast dataset comprising over 40 replicates. This analysis reveals how the choice of thresholds and number of replicates results in discrepancies between studies and potentially interesting genes being overlooked. Furthermore, by comparing wild-type with wild-type samples, we show how variability in gene expression can be mistaken for differential expression.

Analyses of 962 Ultra-Conserved Elements (UCEs) with concatenation (IQ-TREE) and multispecies coalescent approaches (ASTRAL) resulted in highly supported topologies in recovering the monophyly of Eurytomidae and its four subfamilies. The taxonomy of Eurytomidae, and in particular the large subfamily Eurytominae, needs major revisions as most large genera are recovered as para- or polyphyletic, and the erection of multiple new genera is required in the future to accommodate these taxa. Here, we synonymize the genera Cathilaria (C. certa, C. globiventris, C. opuntiae, and C. rigidae) and the monotypic Aiolomorphus rhopaloides within Tetramesa syn. nov., Parabruchophagus (P. kazakhstanicus, P. nikolskaji, P. rasnitsyni, P. saxatilis, and P. tauricus) and Exeurytoma (E. anatolica, E. caraganae, and E. kebanensis) within Bruchophagus syn. nov..

Using all-optical methods in mice navigating virtual reality, we show that novel environments trigger a transient increase in VIP interneuron activity, which facilitates rapid place field formation and stable spatial map construction. Bidirectional optogenetic manipulation --suppressing or upregulating VIP interneuron activity-- modulates the speed of spatial map formation and alters signatures of behavioral timescale plasticity (BTSP), a mechanism critical for place field induction. Both insufficient and excessive VIP interneuron activity impair reward-seeking behavior specifically in novel environments, revealing that a precise balance of VIP activity is essential for spatial learning. Our findings demonstrate that VIP interneurons gate a temporal window for place cell plasticity, mediating the impact of environmental novelty on hippocampal remapping and spatial memory.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368554

Despite this, B1 cells were not effective at presenting Ag to activate cognate T cells or at killing phagocytosed bacteria.

The trafficking of cargoes, such as organelles and proteins, is particularly challenging within the long projections of neurons, which, in the case of axons, can be more than four orders of magnitude longer than cell bodies. It is therefore unsurprising that disruptions in axonal transport have been reported across neurological diseases. A decline in this essential process has also been identified in many aging models, perhaps compounding age-related neurodegeneration. Via intravital imaging, we recently determined that, despite a reduction in overall motility, the run speed and displacement of anterograde mitochondrial transport were unexpectedly enhanced in aged mouse peripheral nerves. Here, to determine how aging impacts a different axonal cargo, we evaluated in vivo trafficking of signalling endosomes in motor axons of mouse sciatic nerves from 3 to 22 months. Contrasting with mitochondria, we did not detect alterations in signalling endosome speed, but found a consistent rise in pausing that manifested after 18 months. We then treated muscles with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which regulates axonal transport of signalling endosomes in motor neurons; however, we observed no change in the processivity defect at 22 months, consistent with downregulation of the BDNF receptor TrkB at the neuromuscular junction. Together, these findings indicate that aging negatively impacts signalling endosome trafficking in motor axons likely through dampened BDNF signalling at the motor neuron-muscle interface.

The availability of tools that can reliably and efficiently generate and store sequencing read summary statistics has become critical.

ResultsAs part of the effort by the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) to generate high-quality reference genomes at scale, we sought to address the community need for efficient sequencing data evaluation by developing rdeval, a standalone tool to quickly compute and dynamically display sequencing read metrics. Rdeval can either run on the fly or store key sequence data metrics in read  sketches, with dramatic compression gains. Statistics can then be efficiently recalled from sketches for additional processing. Rdeval can convert fa*[.gz] files to and from other popular formats including BAM and CRAM for better compression. Overall, while CRAM achieves the best compression, the gain is marginal, and BAM achieves the best compromise between data compression and accessing speed. Rdeval also generates a detailed visual report with multiple data analytics that can be exported in various formats. We showcase rdevals functionalities using human and VGP read data from different sequencing platforms and species. For PacBio long-read sequencing, our analysis shows dramatic improvements both in read length and quality over time, and a benefit of additional coverage for genome assembly.

Availability and implementationRdeval is implemented in C++ for data processivity and in R for data visualization. Precompiled releases (Linux, MacOS, Windows) and commented source code for rdeval are available under MIT license at https://github.com/vgl-hub/rdeval. Documentation is available using ReadTheDocs (https://rdeval-documentation.readthedocs.io). Rdeval is also available in Bioconda and in Galaxy (https://usegalaxy.org). An automated test workflow ensures the consistency of software updates.

Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 integrates innate immune signals following diet-induced obesity to promote glucose homeostasis through the induction of mitophagy. Whereas TRAF6 was dispensable for glucose homeostasis and pancreatic {beta}-cell function under basal conditions, TRAF6 was pivotal for insulin secretion, mitochondrial respiration, and increases in mitophagy following metabolic stress in both mouse and human islets. Indeed, TRAF6 was critical for the recruitment and function of machinery within both the ubiquitin-mediated (Parkin-dependent) and receptor-mediated (Parkin-independent) mitophagy pathways upon metabolic stress. Intriguingly, the effect of TRAF6 deficiency on glucose homeostasis and mitophagy was fully reversed by concomitant Parkin deficiency. Thus, our results implicate a role for TRAF6 in the cross-regulation of both ubiquitin- and receptor- mediated mitophagy through the restriction of Parkin. Together, we illustrate that {beta}-cells engage innate immune signaling to adaptively respond to a diabetogenic environment.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368554

In particular, it allows inference of the unfolded site-frequency spectrum (uSFS). The most widely used approaches are based on outgroup data. However, for studies on species for which closely related outgroups are difficult to obtain, information on many sites of interest may be missed due to alignment problems. Here, we present PolarBEAR (Polarization By Estimation of the Ancestral recombination graph), a method that uses the local genealogies from the ancestral recombination graph (ARG) to infer ancestral states. We show that PolarBEAR can reach high accuracy in polarization and uSFS estimation using simulations under several scenarios. This accuracy, however, heavily depends on the ARG used as input. It is maximal when the true ARGs is used, but can be very low depending on the ARG reconstruction method employed. We also applied our method to human population data and compared it with the outgroup-based method est-sfs. Although our method could not infer the ancestral state with high confidence at certain positions, it obtained results for positions that est-sfs could not polarize due to missing outgroup data. The polarization results of the two methods were highly consistent at positions inferred by both methods. The two methods inferred similar uSFS, with PolarBEAR estimating slightly fewer high-frequency derived alleles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PolarBEAR is robust to the mutation model used, while est-sfs exhibits a bias in the presence of heterogeneous base composition. PolarBEAR can complement outgroup-based methods, or replace them when no appropriate outgroup sequence is available.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368554

KAN modules are incorporated into current state-of-the-art models to assess their impact on predictive performance. Additionally, we introduce a novel interpretation method, specifically designed for KANs, to identify relevant input features for a given prediction, addressing a current limitation in KANs. Our evaluation demonstrates that the integration of KANs significantly enhances predictive performance compared to the state-of-the-art deep learning models, with up to a 4.35% increase in micro-averaged F1 score and a 4.1% increase in macro-averaged F1 score. Moreover, our novel interpretation method not only enhances the predictions trustworthiness but also facilitates the discovery of motif sites within enzyme sequences.

Using fragment-based drug discovery we identified starting points for development of VatD inhibitors. X-ray crystallography screening revealed three primary fragment-binding sites on VatD. In the acetyl binding subsite, fragments stabilized distinct conformational states in critical residues, His82 and Trp121. In the antibiotic binding site, two fragments formed interactions that could be leveraged for competitive inhibition. Elaborations of these fragments showed weak inhibition of VatD activity, indicating potential for further optimization. These findings establish initial hits that could restore streptogramin efficacy by targeting VatD directly, providing a structural foundation for inhibitor development against resistant bacterial strains.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368554

One possible explanation, known as the great plate count anomaly, is metabolic dependencies among community members. However, systematic studies of these interactions in communities like soil are missing, hindering advances in understanding these ecologically important ecosystems. Here, we address this issue by systematically analysing 6,931 bacterial isolates of 27 soil microbial communities. We find that the growth of up to 50% of all community members depended essentially on supplementation with amino acids, vitamins, or nucleotides. In 73% of cases, supplementation with multiple amino acids was necessary. Genomic analysis of 62 strains revealed that accumulation of insertion sequences and specific gene loss was associated with the observed auxotrophies. Finally, genome-scale metabolic models, computational analyses, and cocultivation experiments demonstrated that other co-occurring genotypes complemented the metabolic needs of auxotrophs, thus facilitating their growth. Our results demonstrate that soil bacteria exist within integrated metabolic networks, which hampers their cultivation.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368554

Transmission is enabled through the movement of cattle between herds, as indicated from Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI) data. We estimate the rates of under-reporting by state and present the anticipated rates of positivity for cattle tested at the point of exportation over time. We investigate the likely impact of intervention methods to date on the underlying epidemiological dynamics, demonstrating that current interventions have had insufficient impact, preventing only a mean 175.2 reported outbreaks. Our model predicts that the majority of the disease burden is, as of January 2025, concentrated within West Coast states, due to the network of cattle movements and distribution of the respective dairy populations. We quantify the extent of uncertainty in the scale of the epidemic, highlighting the most pressing data streams to capture, and which states are most expected to see outbreaks emerge next, with Arizona and Wisconsin at greatest risk. Our model suggests that dairy herd outbreaks will continue to be a significant public health challenge in 2025, and that more urgent, farm-focused, biosecurity interventions and targeted surveillance schemes are sorely needed.","NA","medrxiv",1738793368554

In previous work, we predicted a fourth RBD epitope based on allosteric conformational perturbations measured by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) upon complexation with the canonical spike protein target, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). We subsequently identified a pan-neutralizing antibody (ICO-hu104) with the predicted epitope, however, as the epitope was somewhat distant from the hACE2 binding interface, and our previous work limited to the spike RBD, the neutralization mechanism was unclear. Using HDX-MS, we investigated the binding of ICO-hu104 to the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from Wuhan, Delta and Omicron variants. We demonstrate that binding of ICO-hu104 at its epitope results in an increase in deuterium uptake in the distant HR1 domain for variants of concern, which in a biological context could be indicative of destabilisation of the helices within this region, promoting S1 shedding or failure of helical extension during S2-mediated fusion. This is supported by our computational modelling, highlighting propagation of allosteric effects to the S2 coiled-coil region. Collectively, this work demonstrates an alternative neutralization mechanism for ICO-hu104 which is distinct from its first-generation predecessors and thus opens alternative avenues targeting non-RBD epitopes through assessment of allosteric perturbations.

Leading theories propose that education reduces brain decline in aging, enhances tolerance to brain pathology, or that it does not affect cognitive decline but rather reflects higher early-life cognitive function. To test these theories, we analyzed 407.356 episodic memory scores from 170.795 participants >50 years, alongside 15.157 brain MRIs from 6.472 participants across 33 Western countries. More education was associated with better memory, larger intracranial volume and slightly larger volume of memory-sensitive brain regions. However, education did not protect against age-related decline or weakened effects of brain decline on cognition. The most parsimonious explanation for the results is that the associations reflect factors present early in life, including propensity of individuals with certain traits to pursue more education. While education has numerous benefits, the notion that it provides protection against cognitive or brain decline is not supported.","NA","medrxiv",1738793368554

However, excessive NET formation may damage organs during sepsis. We investigated the association between NETs and sepsis outcomes, including mortality and acute kidney injury (AKI).

MethodsWe analysed levels of H3.1 nucleosomes in 971 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock from the SISPCT trial (Effect of Sodium Selenite Administration and Procalcitonin-Guided Therapy on Mortality in Patients With Severe Sepsis or Septic Shock). We evaluated associations between H3.1 levels and mortality and the need for renal replacement therapy using multivariable Cox regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses.

ResultsWe analysed 971 critically ill patients with complete data including admission H3.1 levels. 443 patients (45.6%) presented with sepsis, 520 (53.6%) had septic shock, and eight patients had an unknown diagnosis as defined by Sepsis-3. Admission H3.1 levels were higher in patients with septic shock than with sepsis (median 921.84 vs 432.71 ng/mL; p<0.001). Admission H3.1 levels were higher in non-survivors, and in a univariate Cox analysis, each log-10 increase in H3.1 was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.86 (95% confidence interval 1.41-2.47, p<0.05). H3.1 was also higher in patients requiring renal replacement therapy with septic shock vs sepsis (1832 ng/mL vs 801.4 ng/mL, p=0.01) and demonstrated a dose-response relationship with the severity of AKI.

ConclusionElevated levels of H3.1 nucleosomes at admission are independently associated with mortality and severe kidney dysfunction requiring renal replacement therapy.

However, only a minority of patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) benefit from ICI, and the determinants of response remain largely unknown. To better understand the factors influencing patient outcome, we assembled a longitudinal cohort with tissue from multiple timepoints, including primary tumor, pre-treatment metastatic tumor, and on-treatment metastatic tumor from 117 patients treated with ICI (nivolumab) in the phase II TONIC trial. We used highly multiplexed imaging to quantify the subcellular localization of 37 proteins in each tumor. To extract meaningful information from the imaging data, we developed SpaceCat, a computational pipeline that quantifies features from imaging data such as cell density, cell diversity, spatial structure, and functional marker expression. We applied SpaceCat to 678 images from 294 tumors, generating more than 800 distinct features per tumor. Spatial features were more predictive of patient outcome, including features like the degree of mixing between cancer and immune cells, the diversity of the neighboring immune cells surrounding cancer cells, and the degree of T cell infiltration at the tumor border. Non-spatial features, including the ratio between T cell subsets and cancer cells and PD-L1 levels on myeloid cells, were also associated with patient outcome. Surprisingly, we did not identify robust predictors of response in the primary tumors. In contrast, the metastatic tumors had numerous features which predicted response. Some of these features, such as the cellular diversity at the tumor border, were shared across timepoints, but many of the features, such as T cell infiltration at the tumor border, were predictive of response at only a single timepoint. We trained multivariate models on all of the features in the dataset, finding that we could accurately predict patient outcome from the pre-treatment metastatic tumors, with improved performance using the on-treatment tumors. We validated our findings in matched bulk RNA-seq data, finding the most informative features from the on-treatment samples. Our study highlights the importance of profiling sequential tumor biopsies to understand the evolution of the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the temporal and spatial dynamics underlying patient responses and underscoring the need for further research on the prognostic role of metastatic tissue and its utility in stratifying patients for ICI.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368554

Whilst aspects of quantitative agreement have been achieved for flat monolayers, the most striking features of tissue morphogenesis -- such as symmetry breaking, folding and invagination -- concern surfaces with complex curved geometries. As yet, however, characterizing such complex behaviors in three dimensions has been frustrated due to the absence of proper image analysis methods; current state-of-the-art methods almost exclusively rely on two-dimensional (2D) intensity projections of multiple image planes, which superimpose data and lose geometric information that can be crucial. Here, we describe an analysis pipeline that properly captures the nematic order of tissue surfaces of arbitrary geometry, which we demonstrate in the context of in vitro multicellular aggregates, and in vivo zebrafish hearts. For the former, we correlate the number of topological defects with the aggregates surface area and verify theoretical predictions, whilst for the latter, we link biological properties to physical concepts (Laplace pressure) through spatio-temporal correlations of the heart geometry with fluorescence signals of intracellular proteins. Our analysis enables access to the  hidden third dimension of conventional image acquisition via stacked 2D planes and highlights how such characterizations can deliver meaningful physical insight.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368555

Retrons typically comprise a reverse transcriptase, a template noncoding RNA that is partially reverse transcribed into RT-DNA, and a toxic effector. The reverse transcriptase, noncoding RNA, and RT-DNA complex sequester the toxic effector until triggered by phage infection, at which point the toxin is released to induce cell death. Due to their ability to produce single-stranded DNA in vivo, retrons have also been engineered to produce donor templates for genome editing in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the current repertoire of experimentally characterized retrons is limited, with most retrons sourced from clinical and laboratory strains of bacteria. To better understand retron biology and natural diversity, and to expand the current toolbox of retron-based genome editors, we developed a pipeline to isolate retrons and their bacterial hosts from a variety of environmental samples. Here, we present six of these novel retrons, each isolated from a different host bacterium. We characterize the full operon of these retrons and test their ability to defend against a panel of E. coli phages. For two of these retrons, we further unravel their mechanism of defense by identifying the phage genes responsible for triggering abortive infection.

Anatomical, physiological, and functional modularities of LC-NE pathways involving the mouse basal forebrain (BF) and pontine reticular nucleus (PRN) were tested. We found partial anatomical segregation between the LC->PRN and LC->BF circuits. Extracellular NE dynamics in BF and PRN exhibited distinct sound-evoked activation during sleep, including a fast sound-evoked NE peak specific to PRN. Causal optogenetic interrogation of LC efferent pathways, by retro-ChR2 activation or PdCO silencing of synapses in target regions, revealed a pivotal role for early LC->PRN activity in driving arousal and sound-evoked awakenings. Together, our results uncover a prominent role for early LC-NE PRN activity in connecting sensory and arousal pathways and establish LC heterogeneity in regulating arousal.

The helicase RECQL5 has been proposed as an important factor to help safeguard the genome, and is the only member of the human RecQ helicase family that directly binds to RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) and affects its progression. RECQL5 mitigates transcription stress and genome instability in cells, yet the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unclear. Here, we employ cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of stalled Pol II elongation complexes (ECs) bound to RECQL5. Our structures reveal the molecular interactions stabilizing RECQL5 binding to the Pol II EC and highlight its role as a transcriptional roadblock. Additionally, we find that RECQL5 can modulate the Pol II translocation state. In its nucleotide-free state, RECQL5 mechanically twists the downstream DNA in the EC, and upon nucleotide binding, it undergoes a conformational change that allosterically induces Pol II towards a post-translocation state. We propose this mechanism may help restart Pol II elongation and therefore contribute to reduction of transcription stress.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368555

Coinfection is restricted by a mechanism known as superinfection exclusion (SIE), which prohibits the infection of a previously infected cell by a related virus after a period of time. SIE regulates coinfection for many different viruses, but its relevance to the infection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was unknown. In this study, we investigated this using a pair of SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses encoding distinct fluorescent reporter proteins. We show for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 coinfection of individual cells is limited temporally by SIE. We defined the kinetics of the onset of SIE for SARS-CoV-2 in this system, showing that the potential for coinfection starts to diminish within the first hour of primary infection, and then falls exponentially as the time between the two infection events is increased. We then asked how these kinetics would affect the potential for coinfection with viruses during a spreading infection. We used plaque assays to model the localised spread of SARS-CoV-2 observed in infected tissue, and showed that the kinetics of SIE restrict coinfection, and therefore sites of possible genetic exchange, to a small interface of infected cells between spreading viral infections. This indicates that SIE, by reducing the likelihood of coinfection of cells, likely reduces the opportunities for genetic exchange between different strains of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is an underappreciated factor in shaping SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368555

Traditional methods include fluorescent protein fusion (e.g., GFP) or organic fluorophores linked to ligands targeting the protein of interest. However, these approaches often introduce functional disruptions or ligand-associated biological effects. Herein, we address these challenges by developing covalent fluorescent probes for endogenous tubulin, a critical cytoskeletal protein involved in processes such as cell movement, division, and biomolecule trafficking. Using well-known tubulin binder cabazitaxel and cell permeable fluorophore silicon-rhodamine--as a basis, we introduce a novel biocompatible cleavable linker containing a sulfonium center. This allowed the construction of the optimized probe, 6-SiR-o-C9-CTX, demonstrating excellent cell permeability, fluorogenic properties, and the ability to covalently label tubulin across various human cell lines. Importantly, the targeting moiety could be washed out while preserving tubulin staining, ensuring minimal disruption of tubulin function. This labeling technique is compatible with STED nanoscopy in both live and fixed cells, offering a powerful high-resolution imaging tool.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368555

Here, we introduce FastCCC, a permutation-free framework that enables scalable, robust, and reference-based analysis for identifying critical CCCs and uncovering biological insights. FastCCC relies on fast Fourier transformation-based convolution to compute p-values analytically without permutations, introduces a modular algebraic operation framework to capture a broad spectrum of CCC patterns, and can leverage atlas-scale single cell references to enhance CCC analysis on user-collected datasets. To support routine reference-based CCC analysis, we constructed the first human CCC reference panel, encompassing 19 distinct tissue types, over 450 unique cell types, and approximately 16 million cells. We demonstrate the advantages of FastCCC across multiple datasets, most of which exceed the analytical capabilities of existing CCC methods. In real datasets, FastCCC reliably captures biologically meaningful CCCs, even in highly complex tissue environments, including differential interactions between endothelial and immune cells linked to COVID-19 severity, dynamic communications in thymic tissue during T-cell development, as well as distinct interactions in reference-based CCC analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368555

In the current study, we evaluated the relative contributions of action, agent, and scene features in predicting cortical activity while participants viewed a 1-hour nature documentary. We tested four sets of model features: semantic vectors capturing the observed action, agent, and scene features derived from an annotation of the stimulus, as well as low-level visual motion-energy features. We used banded ridge regression to fit vertex-wise encoding models from the combination of all four sets of features. While each set of features predicted neural activity in the expected areas, the action features predicted more widespread activity. A variance partitioning analysis revealed that the action features captured the most unique variance in neural activity across ten times as many cortical vertices as the agent or scene features. Our findings suggest that cortical activity during dynamic, natural vision is dominated by features for understanding the actions of others.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368555

To understand the basis for this, we determined a 3 [A] resolution structure of human SPIN90-Arp2/3 complex nucleating actin filaments. Our structure shows that SPIN90 dimerises via a 3-helix bundle and interacts with two Arp2/3 complexes. Each SPIN90 molecule binds both Arp2/3 complexes to promote their activation. Our analysis demonstrates that single filament nucleation by Arp2/3 is mechanistically more like branch formation than previously appreciated. The dimerisation domain in SPIN90 orthologues is conserved in metazoans, suggesting that this mode of bidirectional nucleation is a common strategy to generate anti-parallel actin filaments.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368555

However, functional characterization of smRNAs remains limited by the scale and simplicity of phenotypic readouts. Recently, single-cell perturbation screening methods, which link CRISPR-mediated genetic perturbations to rich transcriptomic profiling, have emerged as foundational and scalable approaches for understanding gene functions, mapping regulatory networks, and revealing genetic interactions. However, a comparable approach for probing the regulatory consequences of smRNA perturbations is lacking. Here, we present Decoy-seq as an extension of this approach for high-content, single-cell perturbation screening of smRNAs. This method leverages U6-driven tough decoys (TuD), which form stable duplexes with their target smRNAs, for inhibition in the cell. Lentiviral-encoded TuDs are compatible with conventional single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, allowing joint identification of the smRNA perturbation in each cell and its associated transcriptomic profile. We applied Decoy-seq to 336 microRNAs (miRNAs) and 196 tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) in a human breast cancer cell line, demonstrating its ability to uncover complex regulatory pathways and novel functions of these smRNAs. Notably, we show that tRFs influence mRNA polyadenylation and regulate key cancer-associated processes, such as cell cycle progression and proliferation. Therefore, Decoy-seq provides a powerful framework for exploring the functional roles of smRNAs in normal physiology and disease, and holds promise for accelerating future discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368555

A protein language model was fine-tuned on this data to correlate sequence variation with ligand binding behavior.

Although micro-arousals are an inherent feature of both human and animal sleep, knowledge about the neural correlates of micro-arousals across the cortical column is sparse. We here developed an algorithm for automatic detection of micro-arousals based on EMG activity and used it to explore how micro-arousals modulate laminar neural activity in the motor cortex, and how this relationship is affected by sleep pressure in mice. Our analysis showed that micro-arousals were associated with a general suppression of local field potential (LFP) power across the cortical column. Slow wave activity (SWA, 1-4 Hz) immediately after micro-arousals was tightly correlated with sleep pressure and even surpassed average SWA levels during NREM sleep in sleep deprived animals. In addition, analysis of single-channel firing showed that some channels exhibited increased activity immediately prior to micro-arousals, while others exhibited decreased activity. This study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying micro-arousals and identifies a new link between micro-arousals and sleep homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1738793368555

Yet, modern recording probes have limited power to resolve neuron type. Here, we leverage the well-characterized architecture of the cerebellar circuit to perform expert identification of neuron type from extracellular recordings in behaving non-human primates. Using deep-learning classifiers we evaluate the information contained in readily accessible extracellular features for neuron identification. Waveform, discharge statistics, anatomical layer, and functional interactions each can inform neuron labels for a sizable fraction of cerebellar units. Together, as inputs to a deep-learning classifier, the features perform even better. Our tools and methodologies, validated during smooth pursuit eye movements in the cerebellar floccular complex of awake behaving monkeys, can guide expert identification of neuron type during cerebellar-dependent tasks in behaving animals across species. They lay the groundwork for characterization of information processing in the cerebellar cortex.

To investigate the genetic basis of these differences, an interspecific recombinant hybrid (rUSH) with the mating type system of S. reilianum was generated. rUSH exhibited extensive in-planta proliferation, showing a S. reilianum-like phenotype at all developmental stages except teliospore formation. Transcriptome profiling revealed that expression of pathogenicity-related effector gene orthologs was induced in rUSH, but not in a wild-type hybrid control. Multiple transcriptome comparisons identified 253 differentially expressed one-to-one effector orthologs with distinct regulatory patterns, including cis-, trans-, and rUSH-specific regulation. Functional analysis via CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis uncovered three novel virulence factors among the rUSH-specific regulated effectors.

We propose a diffusion transformer, dnaSORA, for learning these features. dnaSORA has generative capacity similar to Stable Diffusion but for DNA point clouds. The models architecture is novel because it is unified; thus, it also functions as a discriminator that uses a frozen latent representation for classification. dnaSORA transfer learns from synthetic data emulating real genome point clouds to classify misrepresented tokens in C. elegans Hawaiian data at state-of-the-art 0.3 Mb resolution. Pre-training large genome models typically requires expensive and difficult-to-obtain genomes. However, our solution provides nearly unlimited synthetic training data at negligible compute costs. Inference for new token assignments (e.g., new diseases) requires genomes from several dozen rather than thousands of individuals.

In this study, we examined immunological profiles of people living with ME/CFS by flow cytometry, focusing on cytotoxic cells, to determine whether people with mild/moderate (n= 43) or severe ME/CFS (n=53) expressed different immunological markers. We found that people with mild/moderate ME/CFS had increased expression of cytotoxic effector molecules alongside enhanced proportions of early-immunosenescence cells, determined by the CD28-CD57- phenotype, indicative of persistent viral infection. In contrast, people with severe ME/CFS had higher proportions of activated circulating lymphocytes, determined by CD69+ and CD38+ expression, and expressed more pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN{gamma}, TNF and IL-17, following stimulation in vitro, indicative of prolonged non-specific inflammation. These changes were consistent across different cell types including CD8+ T cells, mucosal associated invariant T cells and Natural Killer cells, indicating generalised altered cytotoxic responses across the innate and adaptive immune system. These immunological differences likely reflect different disease pathogenesis mechanisms occurring in the two clinical groups, opening up opportunities for the development of prognostic markers and stratified treatments.

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1738793368555
