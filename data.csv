Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded. We report the value of wastewater sequencing to track avian influenza.","NA","medrxiv",1715637898703

It forms a right-handed helical barrel consisting of 22 pairs of Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 subunits, with a diameter of 32 nm its wider end and 19 nm at its narrower end. Oligomerization is stabilized by the C-terminus, which forms two helical layers linked by a {beta}-strand, and coiled-coil domains that enable strong charge-charge inter-subunit interactions. Flotillin interacts with membranes at both ends; through its SPFH1 domains at the wide end and the C-terminus at the narrow end, facilitated by hydrophobic interactions and lipidation. The inward tilting of the SPFH domain, likely triggered by phosphorylation, suggests its role in membrane curvature induction, which could be connected to its proposed role in clathrin-independent endocytosis. The structure suggests a shared architecture across the family of SPFH proteins and will promote further research into Flotillin's roles in cell biology.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

However, it remains challenging to accommodate more than ~10 samples per experiment without substantial departure from trusted, established protocols involving accessible instrumentation. Here, we describe a 96-sample western blot that conforms to standard 96-well plate dimensional constraints and has little operational deviation from standard western blotting. The main differences are that (i) submerged polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is operated horizontally (similar to agarose gels) as opposed to vertically, and (ii) a 6 mm thick gel is used, with 2 mm most relevant for membrane transfer (vs ~1 mm typical). Results demonstrate both wet and semi-dry transfer are compatible with this gel thickness. The major tradeoff is reduced molecular weight resolution, due primarily to less available migration distance per sample. We demonstrate proof-of-principle using gels loaded with molecular weight ladder, recombinant protein, and cell lysates. We expect the 96-well western blot will increase reproducibility, efficiency, and capacity for biological characterization relative to established western blots.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703
"Pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape post-COVID-19 caused by ptxP3 macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis MT28 clone in China: a genomic epidemiology study","10.1101/2024.04.16.24305932","medrxiv",39.2,32.2,32.2,32.7,39.2,"Fu, P.; Yan, G.; Li, Y.; Li, X.; Ke, Y.; Qiu, S.; Wu, S.; Shi, X.; Qin, J.; Zhou, J.; Lu, G.-P.; Yang, C.; Wang, C.","Chuanqing Wang","Children\'s Hospital of Fudan University","2024-04-23","2","PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","cc_no","infectious diseases","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2024/04/23/2024.04.16.24305932.source.xml","BackgroundThe upsurge of pertussis post-COVID-19 and expansion of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) pose significant public health challenges worldwide. China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

FundingNational Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2701800 and 2022YFC2304700), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82202567 and 32270003), Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2022278), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (23QA1410500), and Shanghai municipal three-year action plan for strengthening the construction of the public health system (2023-2025) GWVI-2.1.2.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1715637898703

This study, involving 23 healthy university students, used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore how VR exercise affects working memory, a key executive function, and its underlying neural mechanisms. Our findings indicate that a 10-min VR exercise session improved mood (arousal and vitality level) and working memory task performance (3-back task) more effectively than exercise or rest alone. Furthermore, the results confirmed that increased vitality from exercise and VR exercise interventions was associated with improved 3-back task performance. However, specific brain regions contributing to this enhancement remain unidentified. These results highlight VR exercise as the optimal exercise program for enhancing working memory function by increasing vitality level. These insights underscore VRs potential as a novel exercise modality with benefits extending beyond exercise adherence to potentially preventing dementia and depression.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

As the synaptic and transcriptional changes that follow an acute cocaine exposure are mostly resolved within a few days, the molecular changes that encode the long-term cellular memory of the exposure within DNs remain unknown. To investigate whether a single cocaine exposure induces long-term changes in the 3D genome structure of DNs, we applied Genome Architecture Mapping and single nucleus transcriptomic analyses in the mouse midbrain. We found extensive rewiring of 3D genome architecture at 24 hours past exposure which remains or worsens by 14 days, outlasting transcriptional responses. The cocaine-induced chromatin rewiring occurs at all genomic scales and affects genes with major roles in cocaine-induced synaptic changes. A single cocaine exposure triggers extensive long-lasting changes in chromatin condensation in post-synaptic and post-transcriptional regulatory genes, for example the unfolding of Rbfox1 which becomes most prominent 14 days post exposure. Finally, structurally remodeled genes are most expressed in a specific DN sub-type characterized by low expression of the dopamine auto-receptor Drd2, a key feature of highly cocaine-sensitive cells. These results reveal an important role for long-lasting 3D genome remodelling in the cellular memory of a single cocaine exposure, providing new hypotheses for understanding the inception of drug addiction and 3D genome plasticity.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

The genetics, biophysics and evolution of hydrophobic cores are not well understood, in part because of a lack of systematic experimental data on sequence combinations that do - and do not - constitute stable and functional cores. Here we randomize protein hydrophobic cores and evaluate their stability and function at scale. The data show that vast numbers of amino acid combinations can constitute stable protein cores but that these alternative cores frequently disrupt protein function because of allosteric effects. These strong allosteric effects are not due to complicated, highly epistatic fitness landscapes but rather, to the pervasive nature of allostery, with many individually small energy changes combining to disrupt function. Indeed both protein stability and ligand binding can be accurately predicted over very large evolutionary distances using additive energy models with a small contribution from pairwise energetic couplings. As a result, energy models trained on one protein can accurately predict core stability across hundreds of millions of years of protein evolution, with only rare energetic couplings that we experimentally identify limiting the transplantation of cores between highly diverged proteins. Our results reveal the simple energetic architecture of protein hydrophobic cores and suggest that allostery is a major constraint on sequence evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

Here, we present a cell-impermeable small molecule fluorophore, termed Rhobo6, that turns on and red shifts upon reversible binding to glycans. Given that most ECM components are densely glycosylated, the dye enables wash-free visualization of ECM, in systems ranging from in vitro substrates to in vivo mouse mammary tumors. Relative to existing techniques, Rhobo6 provides a broad substrate profile, superior tissue penetration, nonperturbative labeling, and negligible photobleaching. This work establishes a straightforward method for imaging the distribution of ECM in live tissues and organisms, lowering barriers for investigation of extracellular biology.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

DesignNationwide cohort studies, using target trial emulation.

SettingDenmark, Finland, and Sweden, from 1 October 2023 to 29 February 2024.

ParticipantsIndividuals aged [&ge;]65 years who had previously received at least four covid-19 vaccine doses. Main outcome measures: Cumulative incidences of covid-19 hospital admission and death for 12 weeks after immunisation (defined as 1 week after vaccination) among recipients of an XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences.

ResultsDuring autumn and winter 2023-2024, a total of 1,867,448 1:1 matched pairs of XBB-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and non-recipients were included (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years). The comparative vaccine effectiveness was 60.6% (95% confidence interval, 46.1% to 75.1%) against covid-19 hospital admission (930 v 2,551 events) and 77.9% (69.2% to 86.7%) against covid-19 related death (301 v 1,326 events) at 12 weeks of follow-up. This corresponded to 191.1 (95% confidence interval, 50.2 to 332.1) covid-19 hospital admissions and 109.2 (100.2 to 118.1) deaths prevented per 100,000 individuals vaccinated with an XBB.1.5-containing vaccine. The comparative vaccine effectiveness was similar across sex, age (65-74/[&ge;]75 years), number of previous covid-19 vaccine doses received, and seasonal influenza vaccination co-administration subgroups and periods of either omicron XBB- or BA.2.86-sublineage dominance. While the protection was highest during the first weeks after vaccination, it was well-preserved at end of week 12 of follow-up.

ConclusionAmong adults aged [&ge;]65 years, vaccination with a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine reduced the rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death during autumn and winter 2023-2024 across three Nordic countries.","NA","medrxiv",1715637898703

We performed a deep-sequencing experiment using PacBio HiFi reads to obtain metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from a pooled human gut microbiome. We performed long-read metagenome assembly using two methods (hifiasm-meta, metMDBG), used improved bioinformatic and proximity ligation binning strategies to cluster contigs and identify MAGs, and developed a novel framework to compare and consolidate MAGs (pb-MAG-mirror). We found proximity ligation binning yielded more MAGs than bioinformatic binning, but our novel comparison framework resulted in higher MAG yields than either binning strategy individually. In total, from 255 Gbp of total HiFi data we produced 595 total MAGs (including 175 high-quality MAGs) using hifiasm-meta, and 547 total MAGs (including 277 high-quality MAGs) with metaMDBG. Hifiasm-meta assembled almost twice as many strain-level MAGs as metaMDBG (246 vs. 156), but both assembly methods produced up to five strains for a species. Approximately 85% of the MAGs were assigned to known species, but we recovered >35 high-quality MAGs that represent uncultured diversity. Based on strict similarity scores, we found 125 MAGs were unequivocally shared across the assembly methods at the strain level, representing ~22% of the total MAGs recovered per method. Finally, we detected more total viral sequences in the metaMDBG assembly versus the hifiasm-meta assembly (~6,700 vs. ~4,500). Overall, we find the use of HiFi sequencing, improved metagenome assembly methods, and complementary binning strategies is highly effective for rapidly cataloging microbial genomes in complex microbiomes.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

While immune elicitors trigger changes in plasmodesmal aperture, it is unknown how this contributes towards a full immune response. To investigate this, we developed two transgenic lines with which we could induce plasmodesmal closure independently of immune elicitors. Thus, we used the over-active CALLOSE SYNTHASE3 allele icals3m and the C-terminus of PDLP1 to drive callose deposition at plasmodesmata in response to estradiol treatment. These lines showed different degrees of plasmodesmal closure but both showed upregulation of the expression of stress responsive genes, the accumulation of salicylic acid and enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 in response to estradiol treatment. Enhanced resistance was not correlated with perturbation of the flg22-triggered ROS burst or MAPK signaling. Enhanced plasmodesmal closure using icals3m also led to the measurable accumulation of starch and sugars, decreased leaf growth, and induced leaf senescence. Additionally, induction of plasmodesmal closure using icals3m led to hypersusceptibility to Botrytis cinerea. We conclude that plasmodesmal closure itself can activate stress signaling, raising questions of how this occurs, what signal carries this information and whether these responses occur in all circumstances when plasmodesmata close across plant physiology.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

The ability to synchronize movements requires 1) detecting a steady rhythmic pulse, or beat, out of a stream of complex sounds, 2) projecting this rhythmic pattern forward in time to predict future input, and 3) timing motor commands in anticipation of predicted future beats. Here, we demonstrate that the macaque is capable of synchronizing taps to a subjective beat in real music, and even spontaneously chooses to do so over alternative strategies. This contradicts the influential ""vocal learning hypothesis"" that musical beat synchronization is only possible in species with complex vocalizations such as humans and some songbirds. We propose an alternative view of musical beat perception and synchronization ability as a continuum onto which a wider range of species can be mapped depending on their ability to perform and coordinate the general abilities listed above through association with reward.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

CryoEM has revolutionized structure determination of large proteins and their complexes, but a vast majority of proteins that underlie human diseases are small (<50 kDa) and usually beyond its reach due to low signal-to-noise images and difficulties in particle alignment. Current strategies to overcome this problem increase the overall size of small protein targets using scaffold proteins that bind to the target, but are limited by inherent flexibility and not being bound to their targets in a rigid manner, resulting in the target being poorly resolved compared to the scaffolds. Here we present an iteratively engineered molecular design for transforming Fabs (antibody fragments), into conformationally rigid scaffolds (Rigid-Fabs) that, when bound to small proteins (~20 kDa), can enable high-resolution structure determination using cryoEM. This design introduces multiple disulfide bonds at strategic locations, generates a well-folded Fab constrained into a rigid conformation and can be applied to Fabs from various species, isotypes and chimeric Fabs. We present examples of the Rigid Fab design enabling high-resolution (2.3-2.5 Angstroms) structures of small proteins, Ang2 (26 kDa) and KRAS (21 kDa) by cryoEM. The strategies for designing disulfide constrained Rigid Fabs in our work thus establish a general approach to overcome the target size limitation of single particle cryoEM.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

However, the factors that support and broadly regulate these processes across developmental stages are largely unknown. Here, we find that IL34, a neuron-derived cytokine, is upregulated in development and plays a critical role in supporting and maintaining neuroprotective, mature microglia in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of mice. We show that IL34 mRNA and protein is upregulated in neurons in the second week of postnatal life and that this increase coincides with increases in microglia number and expression of mature, homeostatic markers, e.g., TMEM119. We also found that IL34 mRNA is higher in more active neurons, and higher in excitatory (compared to inhibitory) neurons. Genetic KO of IL34 prevents the functional maturation of microglia and results in an anxiolytic phenotype in these mice by adulthood. Acute, low dose blocking of IL34 at postnatal day (P)15 in mice decreased microglial TMEM119 expression and increased aberrant microglial phagocytosis of thalamocortical synapses within the ACC. In contrast, viral overexpression of IL34 early in life (P1-P8) caused early maturation of microglia and prevented microglial phagocytosis of thalamocortical synapses during the appropriate neurodevelopmental refinement window. Taken together, these findings establish IL34 as a key regulator of neuron-microglia crosstalk in postnatal brain development, controlling both microglial maturation and synapse engulfment.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

Within developing endochondral bones, chondrocytes at growth plate edges transition to osteoblasts, adipocytes, and other connective tissue in the marrow cavity, and in diseases such as Multiple Osteochondromas (MO) chondrocytes form abnormally around growth plates and contribute to ectopic bone. On the other hand, the inability to form new chondrocytes to maintain damaged joints contributes to the high incidence of osteoarthritis. In order to assess the ability of zebrafish to regenerate cartilage, we developed a nitroreductase-based cartilage ablation model. Following ablation at larval to adult stages, we observed new chondrocytes forming around the dead cartilage matrix, with cartilage outgrowths in ablated endochondral bones resembling the exostoses of MO. By generating a perichondrium-restricted hyal4:GFP transgenic line, we show that new chondrocytes arise from the perichondrium surrounding the ablated cartilage. In addition, we observe enriched expression of the retinoic acid (RA) synthesis gene aldh1a2 in the perichondrium following ablation, and the RA degrading enzyme gene cyp26b1 in newly forming chondrocytes. Consistent with RA signaling suppressing chondrogenesis, treatment with the RA receptor gamma agonist palovarotene, which has been used to treat MO, prevented ablation-induced chondrogenesis. Although we find that BMP signaling is also required for ablation-induced chondrogenesis, we show a distinct role for RA signaling in suppressing sox9a expression and chondrogenesis. Moreover, palovarotene resulted in a near complete loss of growth plates in uninjured zebrafish, which was due to the precocious dedifferentiation and exit of chondrocytes from the growth plate. Our findings suggest a common chondrocyte suppressive role of RA signaling within the developing growth plates and regenerating perichondrium, which may explain the growth plate defects observed when using RA agonists to treat MO.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

Such effort-based decision making is an essential component of motivation, in which the dopaminergic system plays a key role. Depression in Parkinson's disease (PD) is common, disabling and has poor outcomes. Motivational symptoms such as apathy and anhedonia, are prominent in PD depression and related to dopaminergic loss. We hypothesised that dopamine-dependent disruption in effort-based decision-making contributes to depression in PD. In the present study, an effort-based decision-making task was administered to 62 patients with PD, with and without depression, ON and OFF their dopaminergic medication across two sessions, as well as to 34 patients with depression and 29 matched controls on a single occasion. During the task, on each trial, participants decided whether to accept or reject offers of different levels of monetary reward in return for exerting varying levels of physical effort via grip force, measured using individually calibrated dynamometers. The primary outcome variable was choice (accept/decline offer), analysed using both logistic mixed-effects modelling and a computational model which dissected the individual contributions of reward and effort on depression and dopamine state in PD. We found PD depression was characterised by lower acceptance of offers, driven by markedly lower incentivisation by reward (reward sensitivity), compared to all other groups. Within-subjects analysis of the effect of dopamine medication revealed that, although dopamine treatment improves reward sensitivity in non-depressed PD patients, this therapeutic effect is not present in PD patients with depression. These findings suggest that disrupted effort-based decision-making, unresponsive to dopamine, contributes to PD depression. This highlights reward sensitivity as a key mechanism and treatment target for PD depression that potentially requires non-dopaminergic therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, .1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

We found that the yeast membrane protein Yet3, the homolog of human BAP31, is localized to multiple ER contact sites. We show that Yet3 interacts with all the enzymes of the post-squalene ergosterol biosynthesis pathway and recruits them to create sterol-rich domains. Increasing sterol levels at ER contacts causes its depletion from the plasma membrane leading to a compensatory reaction and altered cell metabolism. Our data shows that Yet3 provides on-demand sterols at contacts thus shaping organellar structure and function.

Conceivably, this could occur if plastic responses are coincidentally optimal to both past and novel cues (i.e., are pre-adaptive) or if they are transferred to novel cues during adaptation. Past plastic phenotype values could also become fixed and genetically co-opted during adaptation to the new environment. To uncover the role of past-cue plasticity in adaptation, we tested gene expression plasticity responses of two parallel mine-waste adapted Silene uniflora populations and their closest coastal relatives. Plants were exposed to the past and novel-cues of salt and zinc, which revealed that during adaptation to mine-waste plasticity to salt diminishes. Despite this, our results show that ancestral plasticity to salt has a substantial impact on subsequent adaptation to zinc. For a third of genes that have evolved zinc plasticity in mine populations, salt plasticity has been transferred to the zinc response. Furthermore, a quarter of fixed expression differences between mine and coastal populations were similar to ancestral salt responses. Alongside evidence that ancestral plasticity to novel cues can facilitate adaptation, our results provide a clear indication that ancestral past-cue plasticity can also play a key role in rapid, parallel adaptation to novel habitats.

Significance StatementThe role of phenotypic plasticity in promoting adaptation is hotly debated, with conflicting evidence for the benefits of ancestral plasticity in newly encountered environments. Here, we present an alternative mode by which ancestral plasticity can promote adaptation. We investigated whether phenotypic plasticity towards environmental cues that are experienced only in ancestral habitats (past-cue plasticity) can significantly contribute towards rapid adaptation to completely distinct cues. We show that, in the maritime plant species, Silene uniflora, past-cue plasticity to salt has made a substantial contribution to rapid adaptation to heavy-metal pollution in newly encountered habitats. This phenomenon has broad implications for the capacity and predictability of species to persist in the face of anthropogenic environmental change.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

Limited understanding of the phage infection process hampers our ability to utilize phages to their full therapeutic potential. To understand phage infection dynamics we performed proteomics on Enterococcus faecalis infected with the phage VPE25. We discovered numerous uncharacterized phage proteins are produced during phage infection of Enterococcus faecalis. Additionally, we identified hundreds of changes in bacterial protein abundances during infection. One such protein, enterococcal gelatinase (GelE), an fsr quorum sensing regulated protease involved in biofilm formation and virulence, was reduced during VPE25 infection. Plaque assays showed that mutation of either the fsrA or gelE resulted in plaques with a halo morphology and significantly larger diameters, suggesting decreased protection from phage infection. GelE-associated protection during phage infection is dependent on the murein hydrolase regulator LrgA and antiholin-like protein LrgB, whose expression have been shown to be regulated by GelE. Our work may be leveraged in the development of phage therapies that can modulate the production of GelE thereby altering biofilm formation and decreasing E. faecalis virulence.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

A key member of the divisome is FtsZ which forms a ring-like structure (Z-ring) to mark the division site through its association with Z-ring anchors. Synchronized movement of Z-ring filaments and peptidoglycan synthesis along the axis of division help generate a division septum to separate the daughter cells. Thus, FtsZ needs to be linked to the PG synthesis machinery. GpsB is a highly conserved protein among the members of the Firmicutes phylum which has been shown to regulate cell wall synthesis through interaction with penicillin binding proteins. Previously published data from our lab established GpsB as a member of the divisome which directly interacts with FtsZ in Staphylococcus aureus. More specifically, we showed that GpsB binds to FtsZ by recognizing the R-X-X-R sequence in its C-terminal tail (CTT) region. As the GpsB recognition sequence is also present in Bacillus subtilis, we speculated that GpsB-FtsZ interaction might occur in this organism as well. In support of our prediction, previous studies reported that disruption of gpsB and ezrA or gpsB and ftsA is deleterious. Given that both EzrA and FtsA are known Z-ring anchors, we hypothesized that in the absence of other FtsZ anchors, GpsB can fulfill this role in B. subtilis. Our data, taken together, conclusively shows that GpsB is a Z-ring anchor in B. subtilis and this role of GpsB only becomes apparent in the absence of other FtsZ anchoring proteins. Based on the conserved nature of the R-X-X-R sequence in FtsZ-CTT, we also tested GpsB-FtsZ interaction in Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes and show that this recognition motif dependent interaction is present in the former but not the latter. Our results suggest the possibility of R-X-X-R independent interaction in L. monocytogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Thus, it appears that GpsB may serve as an accessory Z-ring anchor in multiple organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

We designed small single domain immunogens, under 130 residues, that simultaneously present three distinct and irregular motifs from respiratory syncytial virus. These motifs together comprise nearly half of the designed proteins, and hence the overall folds are quite unusual with little global similarity to proteins in the PDB. Despite this, X-ray crystal structures confirm the accuracy of presentation of each of the motifs, and the multi-epitope design yields improved cross-reactive titers and neutralizing response compared to a single-epitope immunogen.

MethodsIn a prospective cohort study in England, we assessed associations of self-reported heavy or prolonged bleeding and menstrual pain with school absences and attainment, adjusting for potential confounders.

FindingsOf 2,698 participants, 36% reported heavy or prolonged bleeding and 56% reported menstrual pain. Heavy or prolonged bleeding was associated with missing 1{middle dot}7 additional days of school per year (16{middle dot}58%; 95% CI: 9{middle dot}43, 24{middle dot}20), and 48% higher odds of being persistently absent ([&ge;]10% absent) (OR 1{middle dot}48; 95% CI: 1{middle dot}45, 1{middle dot}52). Menstrual pain was associated with missing 1{middle dot}2 additional days of school per year (12{middle dot}83%; 95% CI: 6{middle dot}14, 19{middle dot}95), and 42% higher odds of being persistently absent (OR 1{middle dot}42; 95% CI: 1{middle dot}39, 1{middle dot}46). Heavy or prolonged bleeding was associated with lower scores in compulsory examinations taken at age 16 (-5{middle dot}7 points; 95% CI: -10{middle dot}1, -1{middle dot}2, equating to one lower grade), and with 27% lower odds of achieving five standard passes (OR 0{middle dot}73; 95% CI: 0{middle dot}71, 0{middle dot}75). There was less evidence of an association between menstrual pain and examination scores (-3{middle dot}14 points; 95% CI: - 7{middle dot}46, 1{middle dot}17), but menstrual pain was associated with 16% lower odds of achieving five standard passes (OR 0{middle dot}84; 95 CI: 0{middle dot}81, 0{middle dot}86).

As most data have been limited to chaired and typically head-restrained animals, the synergistic interactions of different motor actions/plans inherent to active sensing e.g. eyes, head, posture, movement, etc. on visual perception are largely unknown. To address this considerable gap in knowledge, we developed an innovative wireless head-mounted eye tracking system called CEREBRO for small mammals, such as marmoset monkeys. Our system performs Chair-free Eye-Recording using Backpack mounted micROcontrollers. Because eye illumination and environment lighting change continuously in natural contexts, we developed a segmentation artificial neural network to perform robust pupil tracking in these conditions. Leveraging this innovative system to investigate active vision, we demonstrate that although freely-moving marmosets exhibit frequent compensatory eye movements equivalent to other primates, including humans, the predictability of the visual system is enhanced when animals are freely-moving relative to when they are head-fixed. Moreover, despite increases in eye/head-motion during locomotion, gaze stabilization actually improved over periods when the monkeys were stationary. Rather than impair vision, the dynamics of gaze stabilization in freely-moving primates has been optimized over evolution to enable active sensing during natural exploration.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

In this work, we demonstrate that rhodopsin-based GEVIs (FRET-opsin) can be used under two-photon illumination when their peculiar light intensity dependence of kinetics and sensitivity are considered. We rationally engineer a fully genetically-encoded, rhodopsin-based voltage indicator with the brightest known fluorophore AaFP1, Jarvis, and demonstrate its utility under both one- and two-photon illumination. We also showed two-photon usability of the similar FRET-opsin sensor pAce. Our comparison of 2P scanless with fast 2P scanning illumination revealed that the latter approach is less suitable for this class of indicators and, on the contrary, both sensors responded well when scanless approaches were used. Furthermore, utilising Jarvis, we demonstrated high-fidelity, high-SNR action potential detection at kilohertz-imaging rates both in mouse hippocampal slices and in zebrafish larvae.

Our findings reveal that senEVs play a pivotal role in orchestrating the rapid clearance of senescent cells and suppressing tumor recurrence. In the absence of senEVs, recruitment of MHC-II+ antigen presenting cells into the senescence microenvironment was significantly impaired. Additionally, inhibition of senEV release redirected the primary target of senescent cell signaling from antigen presenting cells to neutrophils. Furthermore, antigen presenting cells recruited and activated CCR2+ TH17 cells, resulting in the inhibition of B cell activation. Through multimodal transcriptional and proteomic analyses, we identified six ligands specific to senEVs, implicating their involvement in promoting cell adhesion. Collectively, our findings suggest that senEVs complement the activity of secreted inflammatory mediators by recruiting and activating distinct immune cell subsets, thus facilitating the efficient clearance of senescent cells.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) offers a potential solution. Given a nanoscale map of two putative interaction partners, it should be possible to assign molecules either to the class of coupled pairs or to the class of non-coupled bystanders. Here, we developed a probabilistic algorithm that allows accurate determination of both the absolute number and the proportion of molecules that form coupled pairs. The algorithm calculates interaction probabilities for all possible pairs of localized molecules, selects the most likely interaction set, and corrects for any spurious colocalizations. Benchmarking this approach across a set of simulated molecular localization maps with varying densities (up to [~]50 molecules m-2) and localization precisions (5 to 50 nm) showed typical errors in the identification of correct pairs of only a few percent. At molecular densities of [~]5-10 molecules m-2 and localization precisions of 20-30 nm, which are typical parameters for SMLM imaging, the recall was [~]90%. The algorithm was effective at differentiating between non-interacting and coupled molecules both in simulations and experiments. Finally, it correctly inferred the number of coupled pairs over time in a simulated reaction-diffusion system, enabling determination of the underlying rate constants. The proposed approach promises to enable direct visualization and quantification of intermolecular interactions using SMLM.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

Thus far, we know little about the structuring of community functionality and the coupling between taxonomy and function over seasonal environmental gradients. To address this, we employed autonomous sampling devices and in situ sensors to investigate the taxonomic and functional dynamics of a pelagic Arctic Ocean microbiome over a four-year period. We demonstrate that the dominant prokaryotic and microeukaryotic populations exhibit recurrent, unimodal fluctuations each year, with community gene content following the same trend. The recurrent dynamics within the prokaryotic microbiome are structured into five temporal modules that represent distinct ecological states, characterised by unique taxonomic and metabolic signatures and connections to specific microeukaryotic populations and oceanographic conditions. For instance, Cand. Nitrosopumilus and the machinery to oxidise ammonia and reduce nitrite are signatures of early polar night, along with Radiolarians. In contrast, late summer is characterised by Amylibacter, sulfur compound metabolism and diverse Haptophyta lineages. Exploring the composition of modules further along with their degree of functional redundancy and the structuring of genetic diversity within functions over time revealed seasonal heterogeneity in environmental selection processes. In particular, we observe strong selection pressure on a functional level in spring while late polar night features weaker selection pressure that likely acts on an organismal level. By integrating taxonomic, functional, and environmental information, our study provides fundamental insights into how microbiomes are structured under pronounced environmental variability in understudied, yet rapidly changing polar marine ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

These upgraded analyses are a nice demonstration of the strong impact of climatic conditions on annual insect biomass. However, Muller et al. conclusion that ""temporal variation in weather conditions explained most of the temporal changes in insect biomass whereas temporal changes in habitat conditions played only a minor role"" was overstated. Here we argue that their methodological approach was unsuitable to draw such conclusion, because of omitted variable bias. We show that more appropriate analyses produce a pattern opposite to the main conclusion of Muller et al.: there is a significant temporal decline in insect biomass not explained by weather conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

However, most existing methods for this purpose are primarily tailored for noisy sequencing data with error rates exceeding 5%, often collapsing true variants in repeats and haplotypes. Alternatively, some methods are heavily optimized for PacBio HiFi reads, leaving a gap in methods specifically designed for Nanopore R10 reads basecalled with high accuracy or super accuracy models, which typically have error rates below 2%. Here, we introduce DeChat, a novel approach specifically designed for Nanopore R10 reads. DeChat enables repeat- and haplotype-aware error correction, leveraging the strengths of both de Bruijn graphs and variant-aware multiple sequence alignment to create a synergistic approach. This approach avoids read overcorrection, ensuring that variants in repeats and haplotypes are preserved while sequencing errors are accurately corrected. Benchmarking experiments reveal that reads corrected using DeChat exhibit substantially fewer errors, ranging from several times to two orders of magnitude lower, compared to the current state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, the application of DeChat for error correction significantly improves genome assembly across various aspects.

Bacteria have similarly evolved immunity proteins that sense certain components of their viral predators known as bacteriophages. Although different immunity proteins can recognize different phage-encoded triggers, individual bacterial immunity proteins have only been found to sense a single trigger during infection, suggesting a one-to-one relationship between bacterial PRRs and their ligands. Here, we demonstrate that the anti-phage defense protein CapRelSJ46 in Escherichia coli can directly bind and sense two completely unrelated and structurally different proteins using the same sensory domain, with overlapping but distinct interfaces. Our results highlight the remarkable versatility of an immune sensory domain, which may be a common property of anti-phage defense systems and enable them to keep pace with their rapidly evolving viral predators. We found that Bas11 phages harbor both trigger proteins that are sensed by CapRelSJ46 during infection, and we demonstrate that such phage can only fully evade CapRelSJ46 defense when both triggers are mutated. Our work reveals how a bacterial immune system that senses more than one trigger can help prevent phages from easily escaping detection, and it may allow detection of a broader range of phages. More generally, our findings illustrate unexpected multifactorial sensing by bacterial defense systems and complex coevolutionary relationships between them and their phage-encoded triggers.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

Despite this, the full extent of rubisco diversity and the biology of organisms that employ it for carbon fixation are still emerging, particularly in unlit ecosystems like the deep sea. Results: Here, we generate fifteen deeply-sequenced metagenomes along a spatially-resolved transect off the California coast, and combine them with globally-distributed public data to examine the diversity, distribution, and metabolic features of rubisco-encoding organisms from the dark water column. Organisms with rubisco were detected in the vast majority of all samples, spanning over 1,000 species groups and together comprising up to ~20% of the total microbial community. At 150 meters and below, potential for carbon fixation via rubisco was dominated by just two orders of gammaproteobacteria and SAR324, encoding either the form I or II rubisco. Many of these organisms also possessed genes for the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds, which may energetically support carbon fixation. Transcriptomic profiling in the epi- and mesopelagic suggested that all major forms of rubisco can be highly expressed in the deep water column, but are not done so constitutively, consistent with metabolic flexibility. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the genetic potential to fix carbon via rubisco is significant and spatially widespread in the dark ocean. We identify several rubisco-encoding species groups that are particularly abundant and cosmopolitan, highlighting the key role they may play in deep-sea chemoautotrophy and the global marine carbon cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

The clamp loader CTF18 interacts with the leading strand polymerase Pol {varepsilon} and loads PCNA onto primer/template DNA using its RFC pentameric module. Here, we provide a structural characterization of the human CTF18 complex and its interaction with PCNA. Our cryo-EM data support that the Ctf8 and Dcc1 subunits of CTF18, which form the regulatory module interacting with Pol {varepsilon}, are flexibly tethered to the RFC module. A 2.9 [A] cryo-EM structure shows the RFC module bound to PCNA in an auto-inhibited conformation similar to the canonical RFC loader, marking the initial step of the clamp-loading reaction. The unique RFC1 large subunit of CTF18, which shows high relative mobility, is anchored to PCNA through an atypical low-affinity PIP box in the AAA+ domain and engages the RFC5 subunit using a novel {beta}-hairpin at the disordered N-terminus. These dual interactions may allow CTF18 RFC1 to outcompete the canonical RFC1 subunit while recycling the RFC2-3-4-5 subunits. Our results suggest that CTF18 comprises two structurally independent modules that cooperate in loading PCNA onto the leading strand for replication by Pol {varepsilon}.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

Whereas p53 binding to its cognate recognition sequence is strongly associated with transcriptional activation, p63 can mediate both activation and repression. How the DNA sequence of p63-bound gene regulatory elements is linked to these varied activities is not yet understood. Here, we use massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) in a range of cellular and genetic contexts to investigate the influence of DNA sequence on p63-mediated transcription. Most regulatory elements with a p63 response element motif (p63RE) activate transcription, with those sites bound by p63 more frequently or adhering closer to canonical p53 family response element sequences driving higher transcriptional output. The most active regulatory elements are those also capable of binding p53. Elements uniquely bound by p63 have varied activity, with p63RE-mediated repression associated with lower overall GC content in flanking sequences. Comparison of activity across cell lines suggests differential activity of elements may be regulated by a combination of p63 abundance or context-specific cofactors. Finally, changes in p63 isoform expression dramatically alters regulatory element activity, primarily shifting inactive elements towards a strong p63-dependent activity. Our analysis of p63-bound gene regulatory elements provides new insight into how sequence, cellular context, and other transcription factors influence p63-dependent transcription. These studies provide a framework for understanding how p63 genomic binding locally regulates transcription. Additionally, these results can be extended to investigate the influence of sequence content, genomic context, chromatin structure on the interplay between p63 isoforms and p53 family paralogs.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

In striate and extrastriate cortex, the gain of neural responses tracked the priority of memoranda. Higher-priority memoranda were decoded with smaller error and lower uncertainty. Moreover, these neural differences predicted behavioral differences in memory prioritization. Remarkably, trial-wise variability in the magnitude of delay activity in frontal cortex predicted differences in decoded precision between low and high-priority items in visual cortex.

To address conservation imperatives such as this, researchers have increasingly relied on conservation genomics to identify populations of particular concern. However, many of these genomic approaches necessitate high-quality genomes. While the advent of next generation sequencing technologies and the resulting reduction of associated costs have led to the proliferation of genomic data and high-quality reference genomes, global discrepancies in genomic sequencing capabilities often result in biological samples from biodiverse host countries being exported to facilities in the Global North, creating inequalities in access and training within genomic research. Here, we present the first reference genome for the endangered red-fronted brown lemur (Eulemur rufifrons) from sequencing efforts conducted entirely within the host country using portable Oxford Nanopore sequencing. Using an archived E. rufifrons specimen, we conducted long-read, nanopore sequencing at the Centre ValBio Research Station near Ranomafana National Park, in rural Madagascar, generating over 750 Gb of sequencing data from 10 MinION flow cells. Exclusively using this long-read data, we assembled 2.21 gigabase, 20,330-contig nuclear assembly with an N50 of 98.9 Mb and a 17,108 bp mitogenome. The nuclear assembly had 31x average coverage and was comparable in completeness to other primate reference genomes, with a 95.47% BUSCO completeness score for primate-specific genes. As the first reference genome for E. rufifrons and the only annotated genome available for the speciose Eulemur genus, this resource will prove vital for conservation genomic studies while our efforts exhibit the potential of this protocol to address research inequalities and build genomic capacity.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

Pollinators such as bees often modify how they handle flowers with experience and such learning is generally assumed to increase collection of floral food rewards. The complexity of flower morphology also affects how quickly pollinators learn and recall how to access floral rewards from a given flower type. Because learning to handle a flower can increase extraction of food rewards (such as pollen) and often involves the pollinator altering how it interacts with the flower's reproductive organs, pollinator learning could affect pollination success. Yet how pollinator cognition and flower morphology interact to affect pollination success is unknown. We therefore asked how learning and memory of flower handling by pollen-foraging generalist bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) varied among four morphologically distinct flower types (Phacelia campanularia, Exacum affine, Solanum elaeagnifolium, and Erythranthe guttata) and affected pollen collection and pollen deposition on these flowers. We found that bees learned and remembered how to handle some flower types more quickly than others. Learning typically involved development of motor routines unique to each flower type. While bees invariably learned to improve pollen collection, how quickly bees learned and remembered each flower type did not affect pollen collection. Surprisingly, pollen deposition on flowers was not affected by bee foraging experience. Thus, even though learning benefits the bee, it does not alter female (and potentially male) fitness benefits for the plant. We discuss potential reasons for these patterns and consequences for bee behavior and flower evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

Subsequent suppression of oxidative metabolism restrains this metabolic-epigenetic support of proinflammatory gene transcription to enforce tolerance, an immunosuppressed state of innate immune memory. Identifying biology that promotes or counters these metabolic-epigenetic changes will inform therapeutic approaches to influence proinflammatory, antimicrobial, and immunosuppressed myeloid cellular states. Here, we demonstrate that Coenzyme A (CoA) is a ""metabolic adjuvant"", as supplying exogenous CoA to macrophages both enhances the magnitude of TLR-driven proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses, and reverse tolerance, via promotion of oxidative metabolism. Extracellular CoA, which we isotopically trace to show its direct uptake by macrophages, works synergistically with tonic TLR signaling, which we demonstrate is a critical regulator of nutrient uptake, metabolism, histone acetylation, and gene expression in macrophages. Together, TLR signaling and exogenous CoA promote mitochondrial glucose oxidation, acetyl-CoA production, and TLR target gene-specific histone acetylation, enhancing metabolic-epigenetic support of proinflammatory transcriptional programming. Exogenous CoA unlocks tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-dependent TLR agonist anti-tumor activity in an in vivo breast cancer model, and promotes macrophage restriction of the intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila in vitro via an Irg1-dependent antimicrobial state of CoA-augmented itaconate biosynthesis. Our findings demonstrate direct acquisition of intact extracellular CoA, and the ability of this exogenously supplemented metabolic cofactor to augment a key oxidative metabolic-epigenetic pathway supporting proinflammatory and antimicrobial macrophage phenotypes.

To address this, we employed a multimodal, data-driven approach integrating intracranial electroencephalography, pain self-reports, and facial expression quantification to characterize the neural and behavioral correlates of naturalistic acute pain in twelve epilepsy patients undergoing continuous monitoring with neural and audiovisual recordings. High self-reported pain states were associated with elevated blood pressure, increased pain medication use, and distinct facial muscle activations. Using machine learning, we successfully decoded individual participants' high versus low self-reported pain states from distributed neural activity patterns (mean AUC = 0.70), involving mesolimbic regions, striatum, and temporoparietal cortex. High self-reported pain states exhibited increased low-frequency activity in temporoparietal areas and decreased high-frequency activity in mesolimbic regions (hippocampus, cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex) compared to low pain states. This neural pain representation remained stable for hours and was modulated by pain onset and relief. Objective facial expression changes also classified self-reported pain states, with results concordant with electrophysiological predictions. Importantly, we identified transient periods of momentary pain as a distinct naturalistic acute pain measure, which could be reliably differentiated from affect-neutral periods using intracranial and facial features, albeit with neural and facial patterns distinct from self-reported pain. These findings reveal reliable neurobehavioral markers of naturalistic acute pain across contexts and timescales, underscoring the potential for developing personalized pain interventions in real-world settings.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

Strikingly, late-wave dynamics were modulated by stimulus value and correlated with task performance. Mechanistically, the late wave component was i) modulated by motor feedback, ii) complemented by a sparse ensemble pattern across layer 2/3, which a balanced-state network model reconciled via inhibitory stabilization, and iii) aligned to regenerative Layer-5 apical dendritic Ca2+ events.

Mammals express only one PPTase, thought to localize to the cytoplasm: aminoadipate semialdehyde dehydrogenase phosphopantetheinyl transferase (AASDHPPT); raising the question of how mitochondrial proteins are 4'PP-modified. We found that AASDHPPT is required for mitochondrial respiration and oxidative metabolism via the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) pathway. Moreover, we discovered that a pool of AASDHPPT localizes to the mitochondrial matrix via an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence contained within the first 13 amino acids of the protein. Our data show that mitochondrial localization of AASDHPPT is required to support mtFAS function, and further identify two variants in Aasdhppt that are likely pathogenic in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

DNA-based biosignal encoders alter genomic or plasmid DNA in a signal dependent manner. Current approaches involve the signal of interest affecting a DNA edit by interacting with a signal specific promoter which then results in expression of the effector molecule (DNA altering enzyme). Here, we present the proof of concept of a biosignal encoding system where the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) acts as the effector molecule upon directly interacting with the signal of interest. A template independent DNA polymerase (DNAp), TdT incorporates nucleotides at the 3'OH ends of DNA substrate in a signal dependent manner. By employing CRISPR-Cas9 to create double stranded breaks in genomic DNA, we make 3'OH ends available to act as substrate for TdT. We show that this system can successfully resolve and encode different concentrations of various biosignals into the genomic DNA of HEK-293T cells. Finally, we develop a simple encoding scheme associated with the tested biosignals and encode the message ""HELLO WORLD"" into the genomic DNA of HEK-293T cells at a population level with 91% accuracy. This work demonstrates a simple and engineerable system that can reliably store local biosignal information into the genomes of mammalian cell populations.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

Here we engineer H2A.Z sequence variants from diverse eukaryotes into a single host, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, to understand H2A.Zs transcriptional impact. We show that H2A.Z sequences representing more than a billion years of evolution encode functional variation attributable to as little as single amino acid substitutions in the unstructured loop 2 (L2) region of H2A.Zs core domain. We show that L2 binds elongation factor Spt6, with L2 sequence influencing its binding to Spt6 and whether it promotes or restricts transcription elongation. In this way, the H2A.Z-Spt6 interaction clarifies H2A.Zs fundamental regulatory function, providing a direct physical and functional linkage between transcription and its chromatinized template across eukaryotes.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the plausible mechanisms of HCQ actions behind its observed mixed effect. Key Results: We demonstrate that CQ-treatment significantly up-regulates mesenchymal markers and SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in cultured endothelial cells. Conclusions & Implications: The detrimental effect of HCQ in seriously ill COVID-19 patients might be due to CQ-induced increased expression of endothelial ACE2 exacerbating the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study warrants further investigation in animal models and humans and caution while prescribing HCQ to patients with an impaired renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, such as in hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, or chronic kidney disease; particularly with ACE-inhibitors or statin therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898703

Here, we have studied the role of the Drosophila ortholog of DYRK1A, Minibrain (Mnb), in brain development. The neuroblasts (neural stem cells) that eventually give rise to differentiated neurons in the adult brain are formed from a specialized tissue in the larval optic lobe called the neuroepithelium, in a tightly regulated process. Molecular marker analysis of mnb mutants revealed alterations in the neuroepithelium and neuroblast regions of developing larval brains. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS), we identified the novel Mnb binding partners Ral interacting protein (Rlip) and RALBP1 associated Eps domain containing (Reps). Rlip and Reps physically and genetically interact with Mnb, and the three proteins may form a ternary complex. Mnb phosphorylates Reps, and human DYRK1A binds to the Reps orthologs REPS1 and REPS2. Furthermore, Mnb engages the small GTPase Ras-like protein A (Rala) to regulate brain and wing development.

The biological mechanisms driving the IBC phenotype are relatively undefined, partially due to a lack of comprehensive, large-scale genomic studies and limited clinical cohorts. Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 2457 patients with metastatic breast cancer who underwent targeted tumor-only DNA-sequencing was performed at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Clinicopathologic, single nucleotide variant (SNV), copy number variant (CNV) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) comparisons were made between clinically confirmed IBC cases within a dedicated IBC center versus non-IBC cases. Results: Clinicopathologic differences between IBC and non-IBC cases were consistent with prior reports, including IBC being associated with younger age at diagnosis, higher grade, and enrichment with hormone receptor (HR)-negative and HER2-positive tumors. The most frequent somatic alterations in IBC involved TP53 (72%), ERBB2 (32%), PIK3CA (24%), CCND1 (12%), MYC (9%), FGFR1 (8%) and GATA3 (8%). A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a significant enrichment in TP53 SNVs in IBC; particularly in HER2-positive and HR-positive disease which was associated with worse outcomes. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) did not differ substantially between IBC and non-IBC cases and a pathway analysis revealed an enrichment in NOTCH pathway alterations in HER2-positive disease. Conclusion: Taken together, this study provides a comprehensive, clinically informed landscape of somatic alterations in a large cohort of patients with IBC. Our data support higher frequency of TP53 mutations and a potential enrichment in NOTCH pathway activation, but overall; a lack of major genomic differences. These results both reinforce the importance of TP53 alterations in IBC pathogenesis as well as their influence on clinical outcomes; but also suggest additional analyses beyond somatic DNA-level changes are warranted.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

Proteins from the SMAX1- and SMXL78-clades of this family are targeted for degradation after karrikin or strigolactone perception, triggering downstream responses. We investigated how SMXL proteins control development. SMXL7 can partially replicate SMAX1 function in seeds and seedlings, but SMAX1 cannot replace SMXL7 in shoot branching control. Therefore, the distinct roles of these genes arise from differences in protein activity more than expression. Analysis of chimeras and domain deletions of SMAX1 and SMXL7 proteins revealed that an N-terminal domain is necessary and sufficient to specify developmental functions. We screened 158 transcription factors for interactions with SMAX1. The N-terminal domain is necessary and/or sufficient for the majority of candidate interactions. These discoveries enable cross-wiring of karrikin and strigolactone control of plant development and lay a foundation for understanding how SMXL proteins evolved functional differences.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

Immune cells, including T cells infiltrate the islets and gradually destroy the beta cells. Human islet-infiltrating CD4+ T cells recognize peptide epitopes derived from proinsulin, particularly C-peptide. Hybrid Insulin peptides (HIPs) are neoepitopes formed by the fusion of two peptides derived from beta-cell granule proteins and are known to be the targets of pathogenic CD4+ T cells in the NOD mouse and human islet-infiltrating CD4+ T cells. Proinsulin is widely recognized as a central antigen in T1D, but its role in forming HIPs is unclear. We developed a method to functionally screen TCRs derived from human islet-infiltrating CD4+ T cells and applied this to the identification of new proinsulin-derived HIPs. We generated a library of 4,488 candidate HIPs formed by fusion of proinsulin fragments and predicted to bind to HLA-DQ8. This library was screened against 109 islet-infiltrating CD4+ T-cell TCRs isolated from four organ donors who had T1D. We identified 13 unique HIPs recognized by 9 different TCRs from two organ donors. HIP specific T-cell avatars responded specifically to a peptide extract from human islets. These new HIPs predominantly stimulated CD4+ T-cell proliferation in PBMCs from people with T1D in contrast to HLA-matched controls. This is the first unbiased functional, islet-infiltrating T-cell based, screen to identify proinsulin derived HIPs. It has revealed many new HIPs and a central role of proinsulin C-peptide in their formation.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

Consequently, to maintain genome stability, aneuploidy must inhibit hPSC proliferation, but the mechanisms are unknown. Here, we surprisingly find that homogeneous aneuploid populations of hPSCs proliferate unlike aneuploid non-transformed somatic cells. Instead, in mosaic populations, cell non-autonomous competition between neighboring diploid and aneuploid hPSCs eliminates less fit aneuploid cells. Aneuploid hPSCs with lower Myc or higher p53 levels relative to diploid neighbors are outcompeted but conversely gain a selective advantage when Myc and p53 relative abundance switches. Thus, although hPSCs frequently missegregate chromosomes and inherently tolerate aneuploidy, Myc- and p53-driven cell competition preserves their genome integrity. These findings have important implications for the use of hPSCs in regenerative medicine and for how diploid human embryos are established despite the prevalence of aneuploidy during early development.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

We find that both perform exceptionally well. Beagles median switch error rate (SER) (after excluding single SNP switches) in white British trios from UKB is 0.026% compared to 0.00% for European ancestry 23andMe research participants; 55.6% of European ancestry 23andMe research participants have zero non-single SNP switches, compared to 42.4% of white British trios. South Asian ancestry 23andMe research participants have the highest median SER amongst the 23andMe populations, but it is still remarkably low at 0.46%. We also investigate the relationship between identity-by-descent (IBD) and SER, finding that switch errors tend to occur in regions of little or no IBD segment coverage.

SHAPEIT and Beagle excel at  intra-chromosomal phasing, but lack the ability to phase across chromosomes, motivating us to develop an inter-chromosomal phasing method, called HAPTIC (HAPlotype TIling and Clustering), that assigns paternal and maternal variants discretely genome-wide. Our approach uses identity-by-descent (IBD) segments to phase blocks of variants on different chromosomes. HAPTIC represents the segments a focal individual shares with their relatives as nodes in a signed graph and performs bipartite clustering on the signed graph using spectral clustering. We test HAPTIC on 1022 UKB trios, yielding a median phase error of 0.08% in regions covered by IBD segments (33.5% of sites). We also ran HAPTIC in the 23andMe database and found a median phase error rate (the rate of mismatching alleles between the inferred and true phase) of 0.92% in Europeans (93.8% of sites) and 0.09% in admixed Africans (92.7% of sites). HAPTICs precision depends heavily on data from relatives, so will increase as datasets grow larger and more diverse. HAPTIC enables analyses that require the parent-of-origin of variants, such as association studies and ancestry inference of untyped parents.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

This paper aims to provide a summary from several ongoing and completed studies to share initial insights into the time trend and spatial distribution, the links we have observed between level of mpox cases with population density and the presence of professional sex workers (PSW) in bars within affected heath areas of Kamituga health zone. We also seek to share our initial observations on the novel characteristics of this new and emergent strain. Methods Consenting patients admitted with mpox-like symptoms to the Kamituga hospital were recruited to an observational cohort study to understand the clinical characteristics and household perceptions and treatment seeking behaviours. We mapped the demographic and clinical characteristics of all individuals between September 2023 and April 2024. Findings 371 (suspected) mpox cases were admitted to the Kamituga hospital. There were slightly more female than male cases (192/371 [52%] versus 179/371, [48%], and cases were reported from 15 health area. The majority of cases were reported in Mero (115/371 [31%]), followed by Kimbangu (65/371[18%]), Kabukungu (63/371[17%]), Asuku (47/371 [13%]), Soluluyu (19/371 [5,12%]), Katunga (17/371 [4,58%]), Kalingi, Poudriere (12/371 [3,23%]) respectively , and Poly Afia (7/371 [1,89%]). During this period, 4 deaths occurred and 4 out of 8 women who were pregnant had fetal loss . Three healthcare workers acquired infection when caring for patients.. In depth case ascertainment showed that 88,4 % of patients reported recent visits to bars for (professional) sexual interactions as a likely source of infection. Our findings suggest that the epidemic in South Kivu is driven by ttransmission in a network of professional sex workers, working in bars. The continued spread of the mpox virus in Kamituga health zone and other health zones of South -Kivu points at a critical need for cross border surveillance, and the potential for rapid vaccination of sex workers as potential intervention. Interpretation These data suggest that the rapid transmission of mpox virus is related to interactions with professional sex workers (PSW) in bars within densely populated health areas. The expanding number of cases and the recent spillover to 16 other nearby health zones of South -Kivu including a health district bordering Rwanda and Burundi stresses the need for cross border surveillance. In addition, enhanced response action is needed, including vaccinationand health eduction programmes to limit further escalation and stop this outbreak,","NA","medrxiv",1715637898704

In mature root regions, endodermal cells coat their cell surface in a hydrophobic polymer termed suberin, which blocks solute transport across the plasma membrane. Intriguingly, specific cells adjacent to the water-conducting xylem remain unsuberized. These are termed passage cells based on the assumption that they create a passage for nutrient influx into vasculature in the otherwise sealed-off root regions. The identity and function of passage cells remain unknown, but their presence proposes the existence of individual identities within the endodermis. In this study, we probe this by performing an in-depth investigation of passage cells and endodermal suberization in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Our work identifies the transcription factor MYB68 as a key regulator of suberization and endodermal lineage-specification related to passage cell formation. Through transcriptional profiling of myb68 mutants, we unravel genes with passage cell-associated expression that suggest a function in cation homeostasis. Collectively, our findings create a framework for a deeper understanding of radial cell identities within the endodermis and highlight that dynamic spatiotemporal patterning is an important physiological feature of root ground tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

Serine integrases can perform the necessary molecular steps, but only if their natural target site is first installed into the recipient genome by other methods. A more elegant approach would be to directly reprogram the serine integrase itself to target a desired site endogenous to the genome that is different from the natural recognition site of the integrase. Here, we describe the development of a platform of Modular Integrases (the MINT platform), a versatile protein-guided genome editing method that can facilitate site-directed targeted integration of synthetic DNA into chromosomal sites. Through a combination of structural modeling, directed evolution, and screening in human cells we have reprogrammed the specificity of the serine integrase Bxb1. We then utilized these reprogrammed Bxb1 variants to enable precise integration of kilobase-sized constructs into multiple endogenous locations within the human genome with up to 35% efficiency and promising genome-wide specificity. We demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the MINT platform by retargeting Bxb1 to the human TRAC and AAVS1 loci where wild-type Bxb1 has no detectable activity.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

Here, we conducted functional assessments and deep molecular phenotyping in the aging mouse to demonstrate that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) treatment attenuates body-wide age-related changes. Apart from improvements in physical and cognitive performance, the age-counteracting effects are prominently evident at multiple omic levels. These span the transcriptomes and DNA methylomes of various tissues, organs and circulating white blood cells, as well as the plasma metabolome. Importantly, the beneficial effects are specific to aged mice, not young adults, and are achieved with a low dosage of GLP-1RA which has a negligible impact on food consumption and body weight. The molecular rejuvenation effects exhibit organ-specific characteristics, which are generally heavily dependent on hypothalamic GLP-1R. We benchmarked the GLP-1RA age-counteracting effects against those of mTOR inhibition, a well-established anti-aging intervention, observing a strong resemblance across the two strategies. Our findings have broad implications for understanding the mechanistic basis of the clinically observed pleiotropic effects of GLP-1RAs, the design of intervention trials for age-related diseases, and the development of anti-aging-based therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

These viruses have spread across the Americas causing morbidity and mortality in both wild and domestic birds as well as some mammalian species, including cattle. Many surveillance programs in wildlife as well as commercial poultry operations have detected these viruses. Here we conducted surveillance of avian species in the urban environment in New York City. We detected highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in six samples from four different bird species and performed full genome sequencing. Sequence analysis showed the presence of multiple different genotypes. Our work highlights that the interface between animals and humans that may give rise to zoonotic infections or even pandemics is not limited to rural environments and commercial poultry operations but extends into the heart of our urban centers.

ImportanceWhile surveillance for avian influenza viruses is often focused on migratory routes and their associated stop-over locations, or commercial poultry operations, many bird species - including migratory birds - frequent or live in urban green spaces and wetlands. This brings them into contact with a highly dense population of humans and pets providing an extensive urban animal-human interface in which the general public may have little awareness of circulating infectious diseases. This study focuses on virus surveillance at this interface, combined with culturally responsive science education and community outreach.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

CTP binding and hydrolysis enable ParB to slide on DNA and to bridge and condense DNA, thereby dictating the size and dynamics of the tripartite ParABS complex. Several other evolutionarily distinct systems can also segregate DNA, although the full diversity of bacterial DNA partition systems is not yet known. Here, we identify a CTP-independent ParABS system that maintains a conjugative plasmid SCP2 in the filamentous bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. We demonstrate that an SCP2 ParB-like protein, ParT, loads onto DNA at an 18-bp parS site and diffuses away to the adjacent DNA despite lacking an apparent CTPase domain and detectable NTPase activity. We further show that parS DNA stimulates ParT transition from loading to a diffusing state to accumulate on DNA, and ParT activates the ATPase activity of its cognate partner protein ParA. We also identify numerous structural homologs of ParT, suggesting that CTP-independent diffusion on DNA might be widespread in bacteria despite being previously unappreciated. Overall, our findings uncover a CTP-independent DNA translocation as an alternative and unanticipated mechanism for the assembly of a bacterial DNA segregation complex and suggest that CTP binding and hydrolysis is not a fundamental feature of ParABS-like systems.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

How the changes in SAM shape and identity are coordinated is poorly understood. Using genetics, confocal microscopy and RNA sequencing, we show that reciprocal repression of the APETALA2 (AP2) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) transcription factors in the SAM is crucial in coupling these processes. During vegetative development, AP2 represses SOC1 transcription to delay floral transition. Later, SOC1 is activated during floral transition in response to environmental cues and represses AP2 transcription. However, during floral transition and prior to its stable repression by SOC1, AP2 rapidly promotes an increase in the size, and changes in the morphology, of the SAM. Thus, direct reciprocal repression of AP2 and SOC1 couples floral transition and changes in SAM morphology, which initiate inflorescence development.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

It relies on multiple sequence alignments of highly variable virus sequences and enables automatic pan-specific primer design for qPCR or tiled amplicon whole genome sequencing.

The varVAMP software guarantees pan-specificity by two means: it designs primers in regions with minimal variability and introduces degenerate nucleotides into primer sequences to compensate for common sequence variations. We demonstrate varVAMPs utility by designing and evaluating novel pan-specific primer schemes suitable for sequencing the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, Hepatitis E virus, rat Hepatitis E virus, Hepatitis A virus, Borna-disease-virus-1, and Poliovirus. Moreover, we established highly sensitive and specific Poliovirus qPCR assays that could potentially simplify current Poliovirus surveillance.

We performed single-cell-RNAseq-analysis of FACS-isolated early placodal cells, making up less than 0.4% of cells within the embryo. Differential expression analysis in comparison to epidermal cells analysed in parallel generated a repertoire of genes highly upregulated within placodal cells prior to morphogenetic changes. Furthermore, clustering and pseudo-time analysis of single-cell-sequencing data identified dynamic expression changes along the morphogenetic timeline. Our dataset provides a comprehensive resource for future studies of a simple but highly conserved morphogenetic process of tube morphogenesis. Unexpectedly, we identified a subset of genes that, although initially expressed in the very early placode, then became selectively excluded from the placode but not the surrounding epidermis, including hth, grainyhead and tollo/toll-8. We show that maintaining tollo expression severely compromised the tube morphogenesis. tollo is likely switched off to not interfere with key Tolls/LRRs that are expressed and function in the placode.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

Our study set out to investigate how a limitation of executive resources impacts natural language prediction on multiple timescales in a novel dual-task paradigm, and how this impact is modulated by age. Participants (N = 175; 18-85 years) read short newspaper articles, presented word by word in varying font colours. This self-paced reading task was either performed in isolation or paired with a competing n-back task (1-back or 2-back) on the words' font colour. We measured word-level reading time and block-level reading comprehension as well as n-back performance. To quantify word predictability, we estimated word surprisal on four distinct timescales (i.e., context lengths ranging from words to paragraphs) using a large language model. Under high cognitive load, adults aged 60 and over benefited most from high word predictability. Our results show that independent of timescale, higher cognitive load diminishes the benefits of high word predictability on reading time, suggesting language predictions draw on executive resources.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

Nanopore direct RNA sequencing combined with our recent tool, Mod-p ID, enables psi mapping, transcriptome-wide, without chemical derivatization of the input RNA and/or conversion to cDNA. This method is highly efficient for detecting changes in positional psi occupancies across cell types, which can inform our understanding of the impact on gene expression. We sequenced, mapped, and compared the positional psi occupancy across six immortalized human cell lines derived from diverse tissue types. We found that lung-derived cells have the highest proportion of psi, while liver-derived cells have the lowest. Further, among a list of highly conserved sites across cell types, most are TRUB1 substrates and fall within the coding sequence. Interestingly, we identify cell type-specific sites of psi modification in ubiquitously expressed genes. We validate these sites by ruling out single-nucleotide variants, analyzing current traces, and performing enzymatic knockdowns of psi synthases. Finally, we characterize sites with multiple psi modifications on the same transcript (hypermodification type II) and found that these can be conserved or cell type-specific. Among these, we discovered examples of multiple psi modifications within the same k-mer for the first time and analyzed the effect on current distribution. Our data support the hypothesis that motif sequence and the presence of psi synthase are insufficient to drive modifications and that cell-type specific trans-acting factors play a major role in driving pseudoruridylation.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

By integrating triplet-state quenchers into the MemBright dyes featuring cyanine chromophores and amphiphilic zwitterion anchors, PK Mem dyes exhibited a three-fold reduction in phototoxicity and a more than four-fold improvement in photostability in imaging experiments. These dyes enable 2D and 3D imaging of live or fixed cancer cell lines and a wide range of primary cells, at the same time pair well with various fluorescent markers. PK Mem dyes can be applied to neuronal imaging in brain slices and in vivo two-photon imaging. The gentle nature of PK Mem palette enables ultralong-term recording of cell migration and cardiomyocyte beating. Notably, PK Mem dyes are optically compatible with STED/SIM imaging, which can handily upgrade the routine of time-lapse neuronal imaging, such as growth cone tracking and mitochondrial transportations, into nanoscopic resolutions.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

DesignThis case series study analyzed adverse event (AE) reports submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database following RSVPreF immunization from September 1, 2023, to February 23, 2024.

SettingVAERS, as a national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system, provides insights into the safety profile of the RSVPreF vaccine in a real-world setting.

ParticipantsSurveillance data included all AE reports submitted to VAERS for pregnant individuals following vaccination.

ExposureReceipt of RSVPreF vaccine among pregnant individuals in the U.S.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresDescriptive statistics assessed all AE reports with RSVPreF, including frequency, gestational age at vaccination, time to AE onset, and serious report proportions. The Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) was utilized, estimating the information component (IC) to identify disproportionate reporting of RSVPreF-event pairs.

ResultsVAERS received 77 reports pertained to RSVPreF vaccination in pregnant individuals, with 42 (54.55%) classified as serious. The most reported non-pregnancy-specific AEs were headache, injection site erythema, and injection site pain. Preterm birth was the most frequently reported pregnancy-specific AE, followed by preterm premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, cervical dilatation, and hemorrhage during pregnancy. The median time from immunization to reported preterm birth was 3 days, with two-thirds of cases within a week. Disproportionality analysis indicated a significant signal for various AEs, particularly highlighting preterm birth with an IC of 2.18 (95%CI, 1.54-2.63), suggesting that reports of preterm birth associated with RSVPreF vaccination occurred more frequently than statistically expected.

ConclusionsWhile reported AEs were generally consistent with the safety profile observed in prelicensure studies, this study highlights ongoing concern about preterm birth among pregnant individuals following RSVPreF vaccination. Comprehensive longitudinal follow-up, including prospective pregnancy registries and infant follow-up studies is urgently required.","NA","medrxiv",1715637898704

However, we and others have shown that LNPs induce severe inflammation, and massively aggravate pre-existing inflammation. Here, using structure-function screening of lipids and analyses of signaling pathways, we elucidate the mechanisms of LNP-associated inflammation and demonstrate solutions. We show that LNPs hallmark feature, endosomal escape, which is necessary for RNA expression, also directly triggers inflammation by causing endosomal membrane damage. Large, irreparable, endosomal holes are recognized by cytosolic proteins called galectins, which bind to sugars on the inner endosomal membrane and then regulate downstream inflammation. We find that inhibition of galectins abrogates LNP-associated inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo. We show that rapidly biodegradable ionizable lipids can preferentially create endosomal holes that are smaller in size and reparable by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway. Ionizable lipids producing such ESCRT-recruiting endosomal holes can produce high expression from cargo mRNA with minimal inflammation. Finally, we show that both routes to non-inflammatory LNPs, either galectin inhibition or ESCRT-recruiting ionizable lipids, are compatible with therapeutic mRNAs that ameliorate inflammation in disease models. LNPs without galectin inhibition or biodegradable ionizable lipids lead to severe exacerbation of inflammation in these models. In summary, endosomal escape induces endosomal membrane damage that can lead to inflammation. However, the inflammation can be controlled by inhibiting galectins (large hole detectors) or by using biodegradable lipids, which create smaller holes that are reparable by the ESCRT pathway. These strategies should lead to generally safer LNPs that can be used to treat inflammatory diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

Timely identification of the fetal red blood cell antigen genotype for the antigen to which the pregnant person is alloimmunized is vital for determining fetal risk for HDFN and guiding management. Presently in the US, recommended care is to determine fetal antigen genotype with reproductive partner testing and/or amniocentesis. This approach has many limitations, including availability of reproductive partner testing, risk of nonpaternity, and low uptake of invasive testing such as amniocentesis. These barriers to obtaining fetal antigen genotype information lead to pregnancies not at risk for HDFN undergoing burdensome monitoring and, in some cases, unnecessary intervention. PCR-based qualitative cfDNA analysis for fetal antigen genotyping is available in Europe, however, it is offered at later gestational ages, may require a repeat sample, has a higher frequency of inconclusive results for individuals of non-European ancestry, and entails logistical challenges related to shipping and insurance coverage for patients in the US. The availability of a NGS-based quantitative cfDNA analysis for fetal antigen genotyping in the US that is robust for diverse populations and applicable for singleton and twin pregnancies starting at 10 weeks gestation presents an opportunity to assess performance.

MethodsPatients with alloimmunized pregnancies undergoing clinical fetal antigen cfDNA analysis were recruited to the study along with the neonates resulting from the pregnancies. The laboratory issued the results prospectively as a part of clinical care. After delivery, neonatal buccal swabs were sent to an outside laboratory, blinded to the fetal cfDNA results, for antigen genotyping, and the results were compared. Concordance was reported for the fetal antigen cfDNA analysis for antigens to which the pregnant person was alloimmunized as well as for all antigens for which the pregnant person was genotype negative.

ResultsWe observed complete concordance between the fetal antigen cfDNA analysis result and neonatal genotypes for 503 calls, for 100% sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV across a racial and ethnically diverse cohort.

ConclusionThis study demonstrates that cfDNA analysis for determining fetal antigen genotype is more accurate than real-life application of the current recommendations, ie., partner testing and amniocentesis, in a diverse US population. In addition, this noninvasive approach reduces barriers to obtaining timely, accurate information about fetal antigen genotype. These results support the routine implementation of fetal antigen cfDNA analysis to guide care of alloimmunized pregnancies in the US.","NA","medrxiv",1715637898704

While RdRp is the target of several viral inhibitors, the active site has several pitfalls when translating in vitro inhibitors to the clinic. The highly polar residues within the active site often necessitate the use of highly polar or charged compounds, especially when designing nucleoside analog inhibitors, posing significant challenges in optimizing drug-likeness and membrane permeability for clinical efficacy. Here, we investigated the broad-spectrum potential of the allosteric Thumb-1 cryptic site of the RdRp, which to date has only been adequately studied in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). To explore this potential antiviral target, we used a suite of bioinformatics techniques, including homology modeling and multiple sequence alignments, to reveal the conserved landscape of the Thumb-1 site across +ssRNA viruses. We then used ChemPrint, our Mol-GDL (Molecular-Geometric Deep Learning) machine learning model to predict drug inhibition of the Thumb-1 site in RdRp across +ssRNA viruses. Here, we identify MDL-001 as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate with favorable properties that enable oral and once-a-day dosing. We also show how the cryptic nature of the Thumb-1 site masks itself to conventional virtual screening techniques, like docking, where activity prediction is heavily based on solving or predicting an accurate structure of the open pocket. This study demonstrates the utility of this approach in drug discovery for broad-spectrum antivirals that target the Thumb-1 site.

Lay SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThis paper addresses the challenge of developing broad-spectrum antivirals against +ssRNA viruses, which include pathogens like HCV and SARS-CoV-2. The highly conserved RdRp Thumb-1 site across these viruses is identified as a potential target for broad spectrum antiviral drugs, which would be vital tools in prophylactic and therapeutic responses to future viral threats.

MethodologyUtilizing bioinformatics and deep learning (through our proprietary AI platform called GALILEO), the study maps the conserved landscape of the RdRp Thumb-1 site across a range of human pathogenic +ssRNA viruses and screens for potential inhibitory compounds.

Key DiscoveriesMDL-001 emerges as a potential broad-spectrum non-nucleoside antiviral drug candidate and the RdRp Thumb-1 site exists as a family of targets, many of which may be targetable by a single drug.

Impact and ImplicationsThe discovery that the Thumb-1 site of RdRp can be targeted by small molecules for antiviral activity against a range of +ssRNA viruses.

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1715637898704

Recent research has highlighted the therapeutic potential of psychoactive substances and especially 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), in alleviating trauma symptoms in chronic patients. However, little is known regarding the consequences of trauma that is acutely experienced under the influence of psychoactive substances. Here we investigated the acute experiences and peritraumatic processing of 657 survivors from the high-casualty terror attack at the Supernova music festival in Israel on October 7th, 2023. Data were collected four to twelve weeks following the TE. Approximately two-thirds of survivors were under the influence of psychoactive substances at the time of the TE, offering a tragic and unique natural experiment on the impact of psychoactive compounds on TE processing. Our findings reveal that individuals who experienced the trauma while under the influence of MDMA demonstrated significantly improved intermediate outcomes compared to those who were under the influence of other substances or no substances at all. Specifically, the MDMA group reported increased feelings of social support, more social interactions and enhanced quality of sleep during the peritraumatic period, yielding reduced levels of mental distress and reduced PTSD symptom severity. These novel findings suggest that the influence of MDMA during the TE may carry protective effects into the peritraumatic period, possibly mediated through the known effects of MDMA in reducing negative emotions and elevating prosociality. These protective effects in turn may mitigate the development of early psychopathology-related symptoms. Current preliminary results underscore the need for further understanding of the cognitive and physiological processes by which psychedelic substances intersect with trauma recovery processes.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704

Stress-induced exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following translational shutoff is thought to cause condensation by allowing new multivalent RNA-dependent interactions, with RNA length and associated interaction capacity driving increased condensation. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNA species condense in response to multiple unrelated stresses in budding yeast, length plays a minor role, and instead, stress-induced transcripts are preferentially excluded from condensates, enabling their selective translation. Using both endogenous genes and reporter constructs, we show that translation initiation blockade, rather than resulting ribosome-free RNA, causes condensation. These translation initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are biochemically detectable even when stress granules, defined as microscopically visible foci, are absent or blocked. TIICs occur in unstressed yeast cells, and, during stress, grow before the appearance of visible stress granules. Stress-induced transcripts are excluded from TIICs primarily due to the timing of their expression, rather than their sequence features. Together, our results reveal a simple system by which cells redirect translational activity to newly synthesized transcripts during stress, with broad implications for cellular regulation in changing conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1715637898704
