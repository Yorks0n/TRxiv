It is therefore critical to track this virus using genomic surveillance. However, the complex patterns of viral genomic diversity make it challenging to use the existing genotype classification system. Here we propose adding two sub-genotypic levels of virus classification, named major and minor lineages. These lineages have high thresholds for phylogenetic distance and clade size, rendering them stable between phylogenetic studies. We present an assignment tool to show that the proposed lineages are useful for regional, national and sub-national discussions of relevant DENV diversity. Moreover, the proposed lineages are robust to classification using partial genome sequences. We provide a standardized neutral descriptor of DENV diversity with which we can identify and track lineages of potential epidemiological and/or clinical importance.

We combined single-cell biosensor imaging with functional perturbations to investigate the regulation of oncogenic signalling in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. We find that despite the constant presence of the mutant oncogene, ERK signalling exhibits pulsatile dynamics, with pulse characteristics determined by the endocytic machinery. Analysis of drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs) revealed that, after an initial phase of complete pathway shut-down, signalling was rewired leading to renewed ERK pulses that drive cell cycle progression. FAK- and SRC-regulated adhesion complexes replace mutant EGFR as the driver of reactivated ERK pulses in DTPs, yet they remain controlled by the membrane trafficking machinery. We show that DTPs rely on additional survival pathways including YAP signalling, and that the phosphatase PTPRS represents a key node in therapy resistant cells, coordinating regulation of ERK, the cytoskeleton, and YAP.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

The hippocampus is widely hypothesized to bind together otherwise abstract combinations of stimuli to represent such latent contexts, and to allow their use to support the process of hidden state inference. Yet, direct evidence for this remains limited. Here we show that the CA1 area of the ventral hippocampus is necessary for mice to perform hidden state inference during a 2-armed bandit task. vCA1 neurons robustly differentiate between the two abstract contexts required for this strategy in a manner similar to the differentiation of spatial locations, despite the contexts being formed only from past probabilistic outcomes. These findings offer insight into how latent contextual information is used to optimize decision-making processes, and emphasize a key role of the hippocampus in hidden state inference.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

All animals with bilateral symmetry inherited a genome structure from their last common ancestor that has been highly conserved in some taxa but seemingly unconstrained in others. However, the evolutionary forces driving these differences and the processes by which they emerge have remained largely uncharacterized. Here we analyze genome organization across the phylum Annelida using 23 chromosome-level annelid genomes. We find that while most annelids have maintained the conserved bilaterian genome structure, a group containing leeches and earthworms possesses completely scrambled genomes. We develop a rearrangement index to quantify the extent of genome structure evolution and show leeches and earthworms to have the most highly rearranged genomes of any currently sampled bilaterian. We further show that bilaterian genomes can be classified into two distinct categories--high and low rearrangement--largely influenced by the presence or absence, respectively, of chromosome fission events. Our findings demonstrate that animal genome structure can be highly variable within a phylum and reveal that genome rearrangement can occur both in a gradual, stepwise fashion or as rapid, all-encompassing changes over short evolutionary timescales.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

Here, as proof of concept, we searched for viral remnants in sequencing reads of Neanderthal genome data by mapping to adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus, which are double stranded DNA viruses that may establish lifelong latency and can, produce persistent infections. The reconstructed ancient viral genomes of adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus revealed conserved segments, with nucleotide similarity to extant viral genomes, and variable regions in coding regions with substantial divergence to extant close relatives. Sequencing reads mapped to extant viral genomes showed deamination patterns of ancient DNA and that these ancient viral genomes showed divergence consistent with the age of these samples ({approx}50,000 years) and viral evolutionary rates (10-5 to 10-8 substitutions/site/year). Analysis of random effects shows that the Neanderthal mapping to genomes of extant persistent viruses is above the expected by random similarities of short reads. Also, negative control with a nonpersistent DNA virus does not yield statistically significant assemblies. This work demonstrates the feasibility of identifying viral genome remnants in archaeological samples with signal-to-noise assessment.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, .1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

SummaryAmong 47561 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine was 23% effective against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1716242711152

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded. We report the value of wastewater sequencing to track avian influenza.","NA","medrxiv",1716242711152

This is a case of sound-symbolism, known as the Bouba-Kiki effect. Studies on four-months infants suggest that this effect might constitute a predisposed perceptual mechanism. However, these studies suffered from the impossibility of ruling out a fast experience-driven origin of the effect resulting from infants' speed of learning, their sensitivity to environmental regularities, and the large number of sound-symbolic associations to which they are precociously exposed when interacting with adults. To better describe its ontogeny and fill in this gap, we tested the Bouba-Kiki effect in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). Being a precocial species, chicks can be tested on the very early days of life, allowing for a virtually total control of their experience before test. Three-day-old chicks (n=42) first learned to circumnavigate a panel to obtain a food reward. Then, they were presented with two identical panels, one depicting a spiky shape, and one depicting a round shape, while hearing either the sound 'Bouba' or 'Kiki'. We recorded which panel chicks chose with either sound, in a total of 24 trials. Chicks preferred the panel with the spiky shape when hearing the 'Kiki' sound, and that with the round shape when hearing the 'Bouba' sound. Results from naive baby chicks hint at a predisposed mechanism for matching the two dimensions of shape and sound that may be widespread across species.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

The ability to synchronize movements requires 1) detecting a steady rhythmic pulse, or beat, out of a stream of complex sounds, 2) projecting this rhythmic pattern forward in time to predict future input, and 3) timing motor commands in anticipation of predicted future beats. Here, we demonstrate that the macaque is capable of synchronizing taps to a subjective beat in real music, and even spontaneously chooses to do so over alternative strategies. This contradicts the influential ""vocal learning hypothesis"" that musical beat synchronization is only possible in species with complex vocalizations such as humans and some songbirds.

In particular, the contribution of the stromal microenvironment to pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis requires further exploration. Here, we report the stromal roles of the synaptic protein Netrin G1 Ligand (NGL-1) in pancreatic cancer, uncovering its pro-tumor functions in cancer-associated fibroblasts and in immune cells. We observed that the stromal expression of NGL-1 inversely correlated with patient overall survival. Moreover, germline knockout (KO) mice for NGL-1 presented decreased tumor burden, with a microenvironment that is less supportive of tumor growth. Of note, tumors from NGL-1 KO mice produced less immunosuppressive cytokines and displayed an increased percentage of CD8+ T cells than those from control mice, while preserving the physical structure of the tumor microenvironment. These effects were shown to be mediated by NGL-1 in both immune cells and in the local stroma, in a TGF-{beta}-dependent manner. While myeloid cells lacking NGL-1 decreased the production of immunosuppressive cytokines, NGL-1 KO T cells showed increased proliferation rates and overall polyfunctionality compared to control T cells. CAFs lacking NGL-1 were less immunosuppressive than controls, with overall decreased production of pro-tumor cytokines and compromised ability to inhibit CD8+ T cells activation. Mechanistically, these CAFs downregulated components of the TGF-{beta} pathway, AP-1 and NFAT transcription factor families, resulting in a less tumor-supportive phenotype. Finally, targeting NGL-1 genetically or using a functionally antagonistic small peptide phenocopied the effects of chemotherapy, while modulating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), rather than eliminating it. We propose NGL-1 as a new local stroma and immunomodulatory molecule, with pro-tumor roles in pancreatic cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

Through cytokine screening, we identified that interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}), a key mediator of inflammation, inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1{beta} activates RhoA/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions that prevents syncytia formation.

A subset of tissues affected in RSTS have their origin in neural crest cells, prompting our exploration into the role of KAT3 in neural crest development. Our zebrafish RSTS models generated by knocking down or mutating ep300a and cbpa genes, reveal defects in neural crest migration and its derived tissues when KAT3 genes are perturbed. We also demonstrate that the effects on neural crest can be reversed by HDAC inhibition in in morphant embryos. KAT3 knockdown causes downregulation of EMT regulators, snai1b and snai2. Snai2 is known to repress cdh6b in neural crest cells facilitating their delamination from neural tube and migration. We generated RSTS patient-derived iPSC line and differentiated them into neural crest cells in vitro. We show that role of KAT3 proteins in neural crest migration is conserved in human iPSC derived neural crest cells. Our findings make a case for classifying RSTS as a neurocristopathy.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

In Gabon, Anopheles coluzzii, a major African malaria mosquito is found along an ecological gradient, including a sylvatic population, away of any human presence. This study delves into the genomic signatures of local adaptation of populations adapted to distinct environments including the urban area of Libreville, and two proximate sites 10km apart in the La Lope National Park (LLP), a village and its sylvatic neighborhood. Whole genome re-sequencing of 96 mosquitoes unveiled 8764;5.7millions high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms. Coalescent-based demographic analyses suggest an 8764;8,000-year-old divergence between Libreville and La Lope populations, followed by a secondary contact (8764;4,000 ybp) resulting in asymmetric effective gene flow. The urban population displayed reduced effective size, evidence of inbreeding, and strong selection pressures to the adaptation to urban settings, as suggested by the hard selective sweeps associated with genes involved in detoxification and insecticide resistance. In contrast, the two geographically proximate LLP populations showed larger effective size, and distinctive genomic differences in selective signals, notably soft-selective sweeps on the standing genetic variation. Although neutral loci and chromosomal inversions failed to discriminate between LLP populations, our findings support that microgeographic adaptation can swiftly emerge through selection on standing genetic variation despite high gene flow. This study contributes to the growing understanding of evolution of populations in heterogeneous environments amid ongoing gene flow and how major malaria mosquitoes adapt to human.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

In this manuscript we introduce PSAURON (Protein Sequence Assessment Using a Reference ORF Network), a novel software tool developed to assess the quality of protein-coding gene annotations. Utilizing a machine learning model trained on a diverse dataset from over 1000 plant and animal genomes, PSAURON assigns a score to coding DNA or protein sequence that reflects the likelihood that the sequence is a genuine protein coding region. PSAURON scores can be used for genome-wide protein annotation assessment as well as the rapid identification of potentially spurious annotated proteins. Validation against established benchmarks demonstrates PSAURON's effectiveness and correlation with recognized measures of protein quality, highlighting its potential use as a general-purpose method to evaluate gene annotation.

However, unintended bystander editing beyond the target nucleotide poses a challenge to their translation into effective therapies. While many efforts have been made in the design of a universal enzyme with minimal bystander editing, the context dependent activity represents a major challenge for base editing-based therapies. In this work, we designed a sequence-specific guide RNA library with 3 prime-extensions and detected guides that were able to reduce bystander and increase editing efficiency in a context dependent manner. The best candidate was later used for phage assisted non-continuous evolution to find a new generation of precise base editors. Simultaneously, we use protein language models trained on massive protein sequence datasets to find the evolutionarily plausible mutational patterns that can improve deaminase activity and precision. Both strategies provide a collection of precise TadA variants that not only drastically reduced bystander edits, but also was not in detriment of on-target activity. Our findings introduce a guide/enzyme parallel engineering pipeline, which lays the foundation for the development of new personalized genome editing strategies, ultimately enhancing the safety and precision of this groundbreaking technology.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

While EBV-IM is mostly self-limiting, symptoms like fatigue may persist over several months or even result in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). This large clinical observational study aimed at identifying risk factors for protracted courses of EBV-IM in young people. Methods: A cohort of N=200 children, adolescents, and young adults with acute primary EBV infection was recruited from hospitals and private practices. Data on the patients' medical history as well as clinical and laboratory parameters were collected at a baseline visit (V1) within four weeks after symptom onset (Tonset) and at two follow-up visits (V2 and V3) one and six months after Tonset. Risk factors for protracted symptoms at V3 were modeled using multivariable logistic regressions. Results: Protracted symptoms were observed in 55/183 (30.1%) and protracted fatigue in 34/181 (18.8%) patients at V3. A medical history indicating an increased susceptibility to infectious diseases as well as distinct severe IM symptoms, e.g. severe gastrointestinal symptoms, were significantly associated with protracted disease [OR: 2.31; P=0.011 and OR: 3.42; P=0.027] and with chronic fatigue [OR: 2.98; P=0.006 and OR: 3.54; P=0.034], respectively. Occurrence of twelve or more clinical and laboratory parameters until and including V1 discriminated between fatigue and no fatigue at V3 [OR 2.43, P=0.033]. Conclusion: A clinical history of immune dysregulation as well as distinct severe IM symptoms might predict protracted post-viral disease and thus help in the identification of young patients at risk.","NA","medrxiv",1716242711152

To validate our approach, we employed the tagless LysoIP to enrich lysosomes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from fresh blood of patients with CLN3 disease, a neurodegenerative LSD. Metabolic profiling of isolated lysosomes showed massive accumulation of glycerophosphodiesters (GPDs) in patients' lysosomes. Interestingly, a patient with a milder phenotype and genotype displayed lower accumulation of lysosomal GPDs, consistent with their potential role as disease biomarkers.

This has led the World Health Organization and the CDC to categorize MDR A. baumannii as a top priority for the research and development of new antibiotics. Colistin is the last-resort antibiotic to treat carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. Not surprisingly, reintroduction of colistin has resulted in the emergence of colistin-resistant strains. Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used to treat pain and inflammation associated with arthritis. In this work, we show that diclofenac sensitizes colistin-resistant A. baumannii clinical strains to colistin, in vitro and in a murine model of pneumonia. Diclofenac also reduced the colistin MIC of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed an upregulation of oxidative stress-related genes and downregulation of type IV pili induced by the combination treatment. Notably, the concentrations of colistin and diclofenac effective in the murine model were substantially lower than those determined in vitro, implying a stronger synergistic effect in vivo compared to in vitro. A pilA mutant strain, lacking the primary component of the type IV pili, became sensitive to colistin in the absence of diclofenac. This suggest that the downregulation of type IV pili is key for the synergistic activity of these drugs in vivo and indicates that colistin and diclofenac exert an anti-virulence effect. Together, these results suggest that the diclofenac can be repurposed with colistin to treat MDR A. baumannii.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

To address this challenge, we developed STRACK, an unbiased framework to longitudinally trace clonal gene expression and expansion dynamics before and after acquisition of cancer mutations. We studied two different leukemia driver mutations, Dnmt3a-R882H and Npm1cA, and found that the response to both mutations was highly variable across different stem cell states. Specifically, a subset of differentiation-biased stem cells, which normally become outcompeted with time, can efficiently expand with both mutations. Npm1c mutations surprisingly reversed the intrinsic bias of the clone-of-origin, with stem-biased clones giving rise to more mature malignant states. We propose a clonal reaction norm, in which pre-existing clonal states show different cancer phenotypic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

Proliferation and migration of adult reactive astrocytes after injury is considered very limited. However, the regenerative behavior of individual astrocytes following selective astroglial loss, as seen in astrocytopathies, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, remains unexplored. Here, we performed longitudinal in vivo imaging of cortical astrocytes after focal astrocyte ablation in mice. We discovered that perilesional astrocytes develop a remarkable plasticity for efficient lesion repopulation. A subset of mature astrocytes transforms into reactive progenitor-like (REPL) astrocytes that not only undergo multiple asymmetric divisions but also remain in a multinucleated interstage. This regenerative response facilitates efficient migration of newly formed daughter cell nuclei towards unoccupied astrocyte territories. Our findings define the cellular principles of astrocyte plasticity upon focal lesion, unravelling the REPL phenotype as a fundamental regenerative strategy of mature astrocytes to restore astrocytic networks in the adult mammalian brain. Promoting this regenerative phenotype bears therapeutic potential for neurological conditions involving glial dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

To resolve this challenge, we developed mosGraphGen (multi-omics signaling graph generator), a novel computational tool that generates multi-omics signaling graphs of individual samples by mapping the multi-omics data onto a biologically meaningful multi-level background signaling network. With mosGraphGen, AI model developers can directly apply and evaluate their models using these mos-graphs.

Here we show that in Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, simple animals with just 302 neurons, memories are preserved on ice and in lithium salt. C. elegans nematodes can form associative memories, which are typically forgotten quickly. We discovered that when placed on ice, worms delay forgetting of specific olfactory memories by at least 8-fold. Delayed forgetting was canceled completely when the worms were gradually adapted to low temperatures, owing to a genetically-encoded program that turns acclimated worms cold-tolerant. RNA-seq, mutant analyses, and pharmacological assays revealed that regulation of membrane properties switches cold-induced delayed forgetting ON and OFF, and, remarkably, that lithium delays forgetting only in cold-sensitive but not cold-tolerant worms. We found that downregulation of the diacylglycerol pathway in the AWC sensory neurons is essential for lithium-mediated delayed forgetting, and using neuronal activity recordings located the memory trace to the downstream AIY interneurons. We suggest that the awesome genetic tractability of C. elegans might be harnessed to study the effects of lithium and cold temperatures on the brain, why it influences psychiatric disorders, and even more fundamentally how memory is stored and lost.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

Herein, we deconvoluted the signals induced by LNP and mRNA that instruct dendritic cells (DCs) to promote Tfh cell differentiation. We demonstrated that the nucleoside-modified mRNA drives the production of type I interferons that act on DCs to induce their maturation and the induction of Th1-biased Tfh responses. Conversely, LNP favors the acquisition of a Tfh cell-inducing program in DCs, a stronger Th2 polarization in Tfh cells, and allows for rapid mRNA translation by DCs within the draining lymph node. Our work unravels distinct adjuvant features of mRNA and LNP necessary for the induction of Tfh cells, with implications for vaccine design.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

Despite the progress in mapping protein-protein interactions we lack knowledge of how they differ between tissues.

Here, we have compiled 7873 proteomic samples measuring protein levels in 11 human tissues and use these to define an atlas with tissue-specific protein associations. This method recapitulates known protein complexes and the larger structural organization of the cell. Interactions of stable protein complexes are well preserved across tissues, while signaling and metabolic interactions show larger variation. Further, we find that less than 18% of differences between tissues are estimated to be due to differences in gene expression while cell-type specific cellular structures, such as synaptic components, represent a significant driver of differences between tissues. We further supported the brain protein association network through co-fractionation experiments in synaptosomes, curation of brain derived pull-down data and AlphaFold2 models. Together these results illustrate how this brain specific protein interaction network can functionally prioritize candidate genes within loci linked to brain disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

However, there is usually no reliable method for estimating the prevalence of non-microbial reads in a metagenome, forcing many analysis techniques to make the often-faulty assumption that all reads are microbial. For instance, the success of metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) recovery efforts is assessed by the number of reads mapped to recovered MAGs, a procedure which will underestimate the true fidelity if eukaryotic reads are present. Here we present SingleM microbial_fraction (SMF), a scalable algorithm that robustly estimates the number of bacterial and archaeal reads in a metagenome, and the average microbial genome size. SMF does not use eukaryotic reference genome data and can be applied to any Illumina metagenome. Based on SMF, we propose the Domain-Adjusted Mapping Rate (DAMR) as an improved metric to assess microbial genome recovery from metagenomes. We benchmark SMF on simulated and real data, and demonstrate how DAMRs can guide genome recovery. Applying SMF to 136,284 publicly available metagenomes, we report substantial variation in microbial fractions and biome-specific patterns of microbial abundance, providing insights into how microorganisms and eukaryotes are distributed across Earth. Finally, we show that substantial amounts of human host DNA sequence data have been deposited in public metagenome repositories, possibly counter to ethical directives that mandate screening of these reads prior to release. As the adoption of metagenomic sequencing continues to grow, we foresee SMF being a valuable tool for the appraisal of genome recovery efforts, and the recovery of global patterns of microorganism distribution.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

Loss of L2hgdh activity in humans induces ectopic L-2HG accumulation, resulting in neurodevelopmental defects, altered immune cell function, and enhanced growth of clear cell renal cell carcinomas. To better understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie these disease pathologies, we used the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the endogenous functions of L2hgdh. Our studies revealed that while L2hgdh is not essential for growth or viability under standard culture conditions, L2hgdh mutants are hypersensitive to hypoxia and expire during the reoxygenation phase with severe disruptions of mitochondrial metabolism. Moreover, we find that the fly renal system (Malpighian tubules; MTs) is a key site of L2hgdh activity, as L2hgdh mutants that express a rescuing transgene within the MTs survive hypoxia treatment and exhibit normal levels of mitochondrial metabolites. We also demonstrate that even under normoxic conditions, L2hgdh mutant MTs experience significant metabolic stress and are sensitized to aberrant growth upon Egfr activation. Overall, our findings present a model in which renal L2hgdh activity limits systemic L-2HG accumulation, thus indirectly regulating the balance between glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, enabling successful recovery from hypoxia exposure, and ensuring renal tissue integrity.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

We find that the ""Twist Ancient DNA"" assay provides robust enrichment of ~1.2M target SNPs without introducing allelic bias that may interfere with downstream population genetics analyses. Additionally, we show that pooling up to 4 sequencing libraries and performing two rounds of enrichment is both reliable and cost-effective for libraries with less than 27% endogenous DNA content.

Although such host-induced gene silencing is well-documented, the molecular mechanisms by which RNAs can move from the cytoplasm of plant cells across the plasma membrane of both the host cell and fungal cell are poorly understood. Indirect evidence suggests that this RNA transfer may occur at a very early stage of the infection process, prior to breach of the host cell wall, suggesting that silencing RNAs might be secreted onto leaf surfaces. To assess whether Arabidopsis plants possess a mechanism for secreting RNA onto leaf surfaces, we developed a protocol for isolating leaf surface RNA separately from intercellular (apoplastic) RNA. This protocol yielded abundant leaf surface RNA that displayed an RNA banding pattern distinct from apoplastic RNA, suggesting that it may be secreted directly from the leaf surface rather than exuded through stomata or hydathodes. Notably, this RNA was not associated with either extracellular vesicles or protein complexes; however, RNA species longer than 100 nucleotides could be pelleted by ultracentrifugation. Pelleting was inhibited by the divalent cation chelator EGTA, suggesting that these RNAs may form condensates on the leaf surface. These leaf surface RNAs are derived almost exclusively from Arabidopsis, but come from diverse genomic sources, including rRNA, tRNA, mRNA, intergenic RNA, microRNAs, and small interfering RNAs, with tRNAs especially enriched. We speculate that endogenous leaf surface RNA plays an important role in the assembly of distinct microbial communities on leaf surfaces.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

Its protein binding is unpredictable, particularly among critically ill patients who may experience unexpectedly elevated free concentrations. We sought to identify the clinical consequences and determinants of occult free valproate toxicity in critically ill adults. Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) who were receiving valproate and had concurrent total and free valproate concentrations measured. We examined whether valproate concentrations were independently associated with adverse drug effects (ADEs) including thrombocytopenia, hepatotoxicity, hyperammonemia, and pancreatic injury. Determinants of occult toxicity were also identified using logistic mixed-effects models, adjusting for age, weight, albumin, propofol and aspirin use, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Occult toxicity was defined as a free valproate concentration that was discordant with total concentration (e.g., supratherapeutic free concentration associated with therapeutic total concentration). Results: 311 unique patients (mean age 58 [{+/-}17] years, 36% female, 31% non-white, and 29% on valproate prior to admission) with 550 concurrent free and total valproate concentration pairs met inclusion criteria. The median (IQR) total valproate concentration was 46 mcg/mL (34-63) and the median free valproate concentration was 17 mcg/ml (11-23); median free fraction was 35% (25-63%). Eighty-four percent of total valproate concentrations represented occult free toxicity; a therapeutic total with a supratherapeutic free valproate concentration was the most common pattern (32% of concentration pairs). Each 2.5 mcg/mL increase in free valproate concentration was associated with thrombocytopenia (adjusted unit odds 1.15, 95% CI 1.05-1.26) and hepatotoxicity (adjusted unit odds 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1.18). Albumin concentration (adjusted odds; aOR 0.17, 95% CI 0.08-0.36), BUN (aOR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09-1.70), and propofol exposure (aOR 3.06, 95% CI 1.38-6.79) were associated with occult toxicity. Conclusion: Free valproate concentrations should be measured in critically ill patients because it is associated with ADEs and is often underrepresented by total concentrations. Most critically ill patients are at risk, especially those with hypoalbuminemia, uremia, and lipid exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1716242711152

In zebrafish, this reprogramming step is achieved by the pioneer factors Nanog, Pou5f3, and Sox19b (NPS). Yet, it remains unclear whether cells lacking this reprogramming step are directed towards wild type states or towards novel developmental canals in the Waddington landscape of embryonic development. Here we investigate the developmental fate of embryonic cells mutant for NPS by analyzing their single-cell gene expression profiles. We find that cells lacking the first developmental reprogramming steps can acquire distinct cell states. These states are manifested by gene expression modules that result from a failure of nuclear reprogramming, the persistence of the maternal program, and the activation of somatic compensatory programs. As a result, most mutant cells follow new developmental canals and acquire new mixed cell states in development. In contrast, a group of mutant cells acquire primordial germ cell-like states, suggesting that NPS-dependent reprogramming is dispensable for these cell states. Together, these results demonstrate that developmental reprogramming after fertilization is required to differentiate most canonical developmental programs, and loss of the transient totipotent state canalizes embryonic cells into new developmental states in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

Proteolysis-Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) exemplify this strategy, exploiting heterobifunctional molecules to induce ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. The clinical advancement of PROTACs underscores their potential in therapeutic intervention, with numerous projects progressing through clinical stages. However, monitoring subtle changes in protein abundance induced by TPD molecules demands highly sensitive assays. Nano-luciferase (nLuc) fusion proteins, or the NanoBiT technology derived from it, offer a robust screening platform due to their high sensitivity and stability. Despite these advantages, concerns have arisen regarding potential degradation artifacts introduced by tagging systems due to the presence of lysine residues on them, prompting the development of alternative tools. In this study, we introduce HiBiT-RR and nLucK0, variants devoid of lysine residues, to mitigate such artifacts. Our findings demonstrate that HiBiT-RR maintains similar sensitivity and binding affinity with the original HiBiT. Moreover, the comparison between nLucWT and nLucK0 constructs reveals variations in degradation patterns induced by certain PROTAC molecules, emphasizing the importance of choosing appropriate tagging systems to ensure the reliability of experimental outcomes in studying protein degradation processes.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

Here, we developed Protein Origin, Trafficking And Targeting to Organelle Mapping (POTATOMap), by combining trafficking synchronization and proximity-labelling based proteomics, to unravel the trafficking routes and interactome of the biosynthetic lysosomal membrane protein LAMP1 at specified time points. This approach, combined with advanced microscopy, enabled us to identify the neuronal domain-specific trafficking machineries of biosynthetic LAMP1.

Once activated by DNA breaks, PARP1 and PARP2 generate poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) chains on themselves and other substrates to promote DNA single-strand break repair (SSBR). PARP1 can be activated by diverse DNA lesions, whereas PARP2 specifically recognizes 5' phosphorylated nicks. They can be activated independently and provide mutual backup in the absence of the other. However, whether PARP1 and PARP2 have synergistic functions in DNA damage response remains elusive. Here, we show that PARP1 and the PAR chains generated by PARP1 recruit PARP2 to the vicinity of DNA damage sites through the scaffold protein XRCC1. Using quantitative live-cell imaging, we found that loss of XRCC1 markedly reduces irradiation-induced PARP2 foci in PARP1-proficient cells. The central BRCT domain (BRCT1) of XRCC1 binds to the PAR chain, while the C-terminal BRCT domain (BRCT2) of XRCC1 interacts with the catalytic domain of PARP2, facilitating its localization near the breaks. Together, these findings unveil a new function of XRCC1 in augmenting PARP2 recruitment in response to PARP1 activation and explain why PARP1, but not PARP2, is aggregated and hyperactivated in XRCC1-deficient cells.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711152

We also estimate the potential number of lives saved if CCP had been deployed for 100% of hospitalized patients or used in 15% to 75% of outpatients. Depending on the assumptions modeled in stratified analyses, CCP was estimated to have saved between 16,187 and 66,160 lives. The ideal use of CCP might have saved as many as 215,195 lives while preventing 1,136,880 hospitalizations.

KRAS mutations were 3.8-fold more common in adenocarcinomas of never smokers from North America and Europe, while a 1.6-fold higher prevalence of EGFR and TP53 mutations was observed in adenocarcinomas from East Asia. Signature SBS40a, with unknown cause, was found in most samples and accounted for the largest proportion of single base substitutions in adenocarcinomas, being enriched in EGFR-mutated cases. Conversely, the aristolochic acid signature SBS22a was almost exclusively observed in patients from Taipei. Even though LCINS exposed to secondhand smoke had an 8.3% higher mutational burden and 5.4% shorter telomeres, passive smoking was not associated with driver mutations in cancer driver genes or the activities of individual mutational signatures. In contrast, patients from regions with high levels of air pollution were more likely to have TP53 mutations while exhibiting shorter telomeres and an increase in most types of somatic mutations, including a 3.9-fold elevation of signature SBS4 (q-value=3.10E-05), previously linked mainly to tobacco smoking, and a 76% increase of clock-like signature SBS5 (q-value=5.00E-05).

We perform an assessment of nucleotide sequence and alignment-based de novo protein-coding detection tools. The controls we use exclude any previous training dataset and include coding exons as a positive set and length-matched intergenic and shuffled sequences as negative sets. Our work demonstrates that several widely used tools are neither accurate nor computationally efficient for the protein-coding sequence detection problem.

Our results show that the extra dimension from conserved and variable nucleotides in alignments have a significant advantage over single sequence approaches. These results highlight significant limitations in existing protein-coding annotation tools that are widely used for lncRNA annotation.

Both clades demonstrated improved in vitro fitness compared with the parental 5a.2 clade as measured through plaque formation, infectious virus production in human nasal epithelial cells, and receptor binding diversity. Both clades also showed reduced neutralization by serum from healthcare workers vaccinated in the 2022-23 Northern Hemisphere influenza season compared to the vaccine strain. To investigate the phenotypic impact of individual clade-defining mutations, recombinant viruses containing single HA mutations were generated on a 5a.2 genetic background. The 5a.2a mutation Q189E improved plaque formation and virus replication, but was more efficiently neutralized by serum from individuals vaccinated in 2022-23. In contrast, the 5a.2a mutation E224A and both 5a.2a.1 mutations P137S and K142R impaired aspects of in vitro fitness but contributed significantly to antigenic drift.

Several different interaction concepts exist, but there is no consensus on how interactions should be quantified and integrated in community growth theory. Here we expand on existing concepts of real-time measurements of pure culture microcolony growth to develop and benchmark coculture microcolony experiments, and show how these can both parametrize growth kinetic and interspecific interaction effects. We follow surface growth by time-lapse microscopy of fluorescently tagged Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas veronii under substrate competition with succinate, or under substrate indifference with D-mannitol and putrescine. Monoculture-grown microcolonies showed substrate concentration dependent expansion rates as expected from Monod relations, whereas individual microcolony yields were strongly dependent on densities and spatial positioning of founder cells. Maximum specific growth rates in cocultures under substrate competition were diminished by ca. 15%, which was seeding-density independent. The collective P. putida population dominated growth over that of P. veronii, but with 27% yield loss under competition compared to monoculture growth; and 90% for that of P. veronii. Incidental local reversal of competition was observed where P. veronii microcolonies profited at the detriment of P. putida, and between 9 and 43% of P. veronii microcolonies grew bigger than expected from bulk competition, depending on seeding density. Simulations with a cell-agent Monod surface growth model suggested that colony expansion rate decrease in competitive coculture is caused by metabolite cross-feeding, which was supported by exometabolite analysis during and after growth of the strains on their individual or swapped supernatant. Coculture microcolony growth experiments thus provide a flexible platform for analysis of kinetic and interspecific interactions, expanding from individual microcolony phenotypic effects to averaged behaviour across all microcolony pairs.

While the range of applications of inertial devices spans medical diagnostics, bioprocessing or water engineering to mention a few, translation is still impeded by the lack of clear understanding of cell interactions in such devices. This often leads to bespoke designs that take years of development and characterisation for one targeted application, and limited tools for informed optimisation. A more fundamental knowledge of inertial behaviours is key to future translational works and impact, by enabling a deeper understanding of inertial forces in biological systems. Towards this goal, this paper focuses on high-throughput morphological phenotyping of the single-celled, flagellated parasite Leishmania mexicana to better understand how variations in cell body length, width and flagellated status impact the focusing patterns of highly non-spherical cells in curved inertial devices. Some of the key findings in this study include: i) not all organelles, such as flagella, will alter focusing if the body shape is conserved, ii) the impact of cell shape is specific to a channel design and slight changes in e.g., cell confinement can completely change focusing patterns, iii) elongated prolate-like cells align in different orientations depending on their lateral position with a curved channel and iv) despite variabilities observed in focusing patterns for elongated versus rounder cell phenotypes, large morphological variations can be completely overcome at high Reynolds numbers so that all phenotypes tightly focus at a single position (here towards the channel outer wall). This last finding, in particular, may open new avenues for highly efficient cell enrichment processes, such as for the detection of pathogens in water.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711153

Accelerated protein synthesis and disordered cell metabolism in cancer cells greatly increase the risk of translation errors. ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) is a recently discovered mechanism for resolving ribosome collisions caused by frequent translation stalls. The role of the RQC pathway in cancer initiation and progression remains controversial and confusing. In this study, we investigated the pathogenic role of mitochondrial stress-induced protein carboxyl-terminal terminal alanine and threonine tailing (msiCAT-tailing) in glioblastoma (GBM), which is a specific RQC response to translational arrest on the outer mitochondrial membrane. We found that msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins frequently exist in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Ectopically expressed msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5a) protein increases the mitochondrial membrane potential and blocks mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) formation/opening. These changes in mitochondrial properties confer resistance to staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis in GBM cells. Therefore, msiCAT-tailing can promote cell survival and migration, while genetic and pharmacological inhibition of msiCAT-tailing can prevent the overgrowth of GBM cells.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711153

RhoA is almost identical to RhoB and RhoC, all of which are molecular targets of specific bacterial toxins. Searching for new treatments to modulate Rho-dependent endothelial integrity, we demonstrate that the selective and simultaneous activation of these three Rho GTPases with a chimeric recombinant toxin does not induce cell contraction but enhances microvascular endothelial barrier function in response to pathological inflammatory challenges in vitro and in vivo. This pro-barrier effect is specifically mediated by RhoC, whose activity is increased by cell confluence. The uniqueness of RhoC relies on an arginine residue (R188) within its hypervariable region that determines its junctional localization, high homeostatic activity, and barrier-protective function, in contrast to the permeability-inducing, low homeostatic activity of RhoA and RhoB. Quantitative proteomics and high-resolution confocal microscopy revealed that RhoC regulates perijunctional actomyosin and the expression of myosin light chain proteins. Thus, harnessing the activity of RhoC represents a potential therapy for strengthening endothelial barriers during pathological inflammation.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711153

These neurological symptoms frequently persist for months (post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 or PASC). The molecular origins of neuro-COVID and how it contributes to PASC are unknown, however a growing body of research highlights that the self-assembly of protein fragments from SARS-CoV-2 into amyloid nanofibrils may play a causative role. Previously, we identified two fragments from the proteins Open Reading Frame 6 (ORF6) and ORF10 that self-assemble into neurotoxic amyloid assemblies. Here we further our understanding of the self-assembly mechanisms and nano-architectures formed by these fragments as well as performing a more in-depth study of the biological responses of co-cultured neurons. By solubilising the peptides in a fluorinated solvent we eliminate insoluble aggregates in the starting materials (seeds) that change the polymorphic landscape of the assemblies. The resultant assemblies are dominated by structures with higher free energies (e.g. ribbons and amorphous aggregates) that are less toxic to cultured neurons. We also show the first direct evidence of cellular uptake by viral amyloids.

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

Critical next steps are to infer which and how many cell types are truly causal for a disease (after accounting for co-regulation across cell types), and to understand how individual variants impact disease risk through single or multiple causal cell types. Here, we propose CT-FM and CT-FM-SNP, two methods that leverage cell-type-specific cREs to fine-map causal cell types for a trait and for its candidate causal variants, respectively. We applied CT-FM to 63 GWAS summary statistics (average N = 417K) using nearly one thousand cRE annotations, primarily coming from ENCODE4. CT-FM inferred 81 causal cell types with corresponding SNP-annotations explaining a high fraction of trait SNP-heritability (~2/3 of the SNP-heritability explained by existing cREs), identified 16 traits with multiple causal cell types, highlighted cell-disease relationships consistent with known biology, and uncovered previously unexplored cellular mechanisms in psychiatric and immune-related diseases. Finally, we applied CT-FM-SNP to 39 UK Biobank traits and predicted high confidence causal cell types for 2,798 candidate causal non-coding SNPs. Our results suggest that most SNPs impact a phenotype through a single cell type, and that pleiotropic SNPs target different cell types depending on the phenotype context.

Genes involved in several aspects of cytokinin transport have been characterized, but a large part of the elaborate system remains elusive. In this study, we have identified ABCC4 as a cytokinin efflux transporter gene. Using a transient expression system in tobacco leaves, we screened Arabidopsis transporter genes and isolated ATP-BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTER C4 (ABCC4). Further validation through drug-induced expression in Arabidopsis and heterologous expression in budding yeast revealed that ABCC4 effluxes the active form of cytokinins. During the seedling stage, ABCC4 was highly expressed in roots, and its expression was up-regulated in response to cytokinin application. Loss-of-function mutants of ABCC4 displayed enhanced primary root elongation, similar to mutants impaired in cytokinin biosynthesis or signaling, which was suppressed by exogenous trans-zeatin treatment. In contrast, overexpression of the gene led to suppression of root elongation. These results suggest that ABCC4 plays a role in the efflux of active cytokinin, thereby contributing to root growth regulation. Our findings contribute to unraveling the many complexities of cytokinin flow and enhance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying root system development in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711153

In this process, SQSTM1/p62 and NBR1 drive cargo condensation, while TAX1BP1, which binds to NBR1 recruits the autophagy machinery to facilitate autophagosome biogenesis at the condensates. The mechanistic basis for the TAX1BP1 mediated switch from cargo collection to its sequestration is unclear. Here we show that TAX1BP1 is not a constitutive component of the condensates. Its recruitment correlates with the induction of autophagosome biogenesis. TAX1BP1 is sufficient to recruit the TBK1 kinase via the SINTBAD adapter. We define the NBR1 - TAX1BP1 binding site, which is adjacent to the GABARAP/LC3 interaction site and demonstrate that the recruitment of TAX1BP1 to cargo mimetics can be enhanced by an increased ubiquitin load.

In medical education, research conducted in 2016 found that authors were influenced by multiple factors such as a journal's prestige and its mission. However, since this research was conducted the publishing landscape has shifted to include a broader variety of journals, an increased threat of predatory journals, and new publishing models. This study updates and expands upon how medical education authors decide which journal to submit to with the aim of describing the motivational factors and journal characteristics that guide authors' decision making. Methods: The authors conducted five qualitative focus groups in which twenty-two medical education authors and editors participated. During the focus groups participants were engaged in a discussion about how they select a journal to submit their manuscripts. Audio from all focus groups was transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed using codebook thematic analysis. Results: Participants considered multiple factors when selecting a target journal. Factors included a journal's impact, the scope of a journal, journal quality, and technical factors (e.g., word limits). Participants also described how social factors influenced their process and that open access plays a role that could both encourage or deter submission. Discussion: The findings describe the motivational factors and influential signals that guide authors in their journal selection decision making. These findings confirm, extend, and update journal selection factors reported in medical education and other disciplines.

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

FundingNational Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2701800 and 2022YFC2304700), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82202567 and 32270003), Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2022278), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (23QA1410500), and Shanghai municipal three-year action plan for strengthening the construction of the public health system (2023-2025) GWVI-2.1.2.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1716242711153

Here, we tested unrefined AF2 models prospectively, comparing experimental hit-rates and affinities from large library docking against AF2 models vs the same screens targeting experimental structures of the same receptors. In retrospective docking screens against the {sigma}2 and the 5-HT2A receptors, the AF2 structures struggled to recapitulate ligands that we had previously found docking against the receptors experimental structures, consistent with published results. Prospective large library docking against the AF2 models, however, yielded similar hit rates for both receptors versus docking against experimentally-derived structures; hundreds of molecules were prioritized and tested against each model and each structure of each receptor. The success of the AF2 models was achieved despite differences in orthosteric pocket residue conformations for both targets versus the experimental structures. Intriguingly, against the 5-HT2A receptor the most potent, subtype-selective agonists were discovered via docking against the AF2 model, not the experimental structure. To understand this from a molecular perspective, a cryoEM structure was determined for one of the more potent and selective ligands to emerge from docking against the AF2 model of the 5-HT2A receptor. Our findings suggest that AF2 models may sample conformations that are relevant for ligand discovery, much extending the domain of applicability of structure-based ligand discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711153

ObjectiveTo evaluate febrile seizure risk following monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination among children aged 2-5 years.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThe primary analysis evaluated children who had a febrile seizure outcome in the 0-1 days following COVID-19 vaccination. A self-controlled case series analysis was performed in three commercial insurance databases to compare the risk of seizure in the risk interval (0-1 days) to a control interval (8-63 days).

ExposureReceipt of dose 1 and/or dose 2 of monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was febrile seizure (0-1 day risk interval).

AnalysisA conditional Poisson regression model was used to compare outcome rates in risk and control intervals and estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analyses were used to pool results across databases.

ResultsThe primary meta-analysis found a statistically significant increased incidence of febrile seizure, in the 0-1 days following mRNA-1273 vaccination compared to the control interval (IRR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.35 to 4.69, risk difference (RD)/100,000 doses = 3.22 (95%CI -0.31 to 6.75)). For the BNT162b2 vaccination, the IRR was elevated but not statistically significant (IRR: 1.41, 95%CI: 0.48 to 4.11, RD/100,000 doses = -0.25 (95%CI -2.75 to 2.24).

Conclusions and RelevanceAmong children aged 2-5 years, the analysis showed a small elevated incidence rate ratio of febrile seizures in the 0-1 days following the mRNA-1273 vaccination. Based on the current body of scientific evidence, the safety profile of the monovalent mRNA vaccines remains favorable for use in young children.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAmong children aged 2-5 years, is the risk of febrile seizure elevated immediately following monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination compared with a later period after vaccination?

FindingsIn this self-controlled case series that included participants aged 2-5 years from three commercial insurance databases, the incidence rate ratio of febrile seizures was significantly elevated in the 0-1 days following mRNA-1273 administration. Absolute risk was small.

MeaningThe incidence of febrile seizures was elevated immediately following vaccination with the monovalent mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 2-5 years. Based on the current body of evidence, the safety profile of monovalent mRNA vaccines remains favorable for use in young children.","NA","medrxiv",1716242711153

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711153

While RdRp is the target of several viral inhibitors, the active site has several pitfalls when translating in vitro inhibitors to the clinic. The highly polar residues within the active site often necessitate the use of highly polar or charged compounds, especially when designing nucleoside analog inhibitors, posing significant challenges in optimizing drug-likeness and membrane permeability for clinical efficacy. Here, we investigated the broad-spectrum potential of the allosteric Thumb-1 cryptic site of the RdRp, which to date has only been adequately studied in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). To explore this potential antiviral target, we used a suite of bioinformatics techniques, including homology modeling and multiple sequence alignments, to reveal the conserved landscape of the Thumb-1 site across +ssRNA viruses. We then used ChemPrint, our Mol-GDL (Molecular-Geometric Deep Learning) machine learning model to predict drug inhibition of the Thumb-1 site in RdRp across +ssRNA viruses. Here, we identify MDL-001 as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate with favorable properties that enable oral and once-a-day dosing. We also show how the cryptic nature of the Thumb-1 site masks itself to conventional virtual screening techniques, like docking, where activity prediction is heavily based on solving or predicting an accurate structure of the open pocket. This study demonstrates the utility of this approach in drug discovery for broad-spectrum antivirals that target the Thumb-1 site.

Lay SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThis paper addresses the challenge of developing broad-spectrum antivirals against +ssRNA viruses, which include pathogens like HCV and SARS-CoV-2. The highly conserved RdRp Thumb-1 site across these viruses is identified as a potential target for broad spectrum antiviral drugs, which would be vital tools in prophylactic and therapeutic responses to future viral threats.

MethodologyUtilizing bioinformatics and deep learning (through our proprietary AI platform called GALILEO), the study maps the conserved landscape of the RdRp Thumb-1 site across a range of human pathogenic +ssRNA viruses and screens for potential inhibitory compounds.

Key DiscoveriesMDL-001 emerges as a potential broad-spectrum non-nucleoside antiviral drug candidate and the RdRp Thumb-1 site exists as a family of targets, many of which may be targetable by a single drug.

Impact and ImplicationsThe discovery that the Thumb-1 site of RdRp can be targeted by small molecules for antiviral activity against a range of +ssRNA viruses.

DesignThis case series study analyzed adverse event (AE) reports submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database following RSVPreF immunization from September 1, 2023, to February 23, 2024.

SettingVAERS, as a national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system, provides insights into the safety profile of the RSVPreF vaccine in a real-world setting.

ParticipantsSurveillance data included all AE reports submitted to VAERS for pregnant individuals following vaccination.

ExposureReceipt of RSVPreF vaccine among pregnant individuals in the U.S.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresDescriptive statistics assessed all AE reports with RSVPreF, including frequency, gestational age at vaccination, time to AE onset, and serious report proportions. The Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) was utilized, estimating the information component (IC) to identify disproportionate reporting of RSVPreF-event pairs.

ResultsVAERS received 77 reports pertained to RSVPreF vaccination in pregnant individuals, with 42 (54.55%) classified as serious. The most reported non-pregnancy-specific AEs were headache, injection site erythema, and injection site pain. Preterm birth was the most frequently reported pregnancy-specific AE, followed by preterm premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, cervical dilatation, and hemorrhage during pregnancy. The median time from immunization to reported preterm birth was 3 days, with two-thirds of cases within a week. Disproportionality analysis indicated a significant signal for various AEs, particularly highlighting preterm birth with an IC of 2.18 (95%CI, 1.54-2.63), suggesting that reports of preterm birth associated with RSVPreF vaccination occurred more frequently than statistically expected.

ConclusionsWhile reported AEs were generally consistent with the safety profile observed in prelicensure studies, this study highlights ongoing concern about preterm birth among pregnant individuals following RSVPreF vaccination. Comprehensive longitudinal follow-up, including prospective pregnancy registries and infant follow-up studies is urgently required.","NA","medrxiv",1716242711153

CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711153

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1716242711153

To localize the ancestral and geographical origins of the Yamnaya among the diverse Eneolithic people that preceded them, we studied ancient DNA data from 428 individuals of which 299 are reported for the first time, demonstrating three previously unknown Eneolithic genetic clines. First, a ""Caucasus-Lower Volga"" (CLV) Cline suffused with Caucasus hunter-gatherer (CHG) ancestry extended between a Caucasus Neolithic southern end in Neolithic Armenia, and a steppe northern end in Berezhnovka in the Lower Volga. Bidirectional gene flow across the CLV cline created admixed intermediate populations in both the north Caucasus, such as the Maikop people, and on the steppe, such as those at the site of Remontnoye north of the Manych depression. CLV people also helped form two major riverine clines by admixing with distinct groups of European hunter-gatherers. A ""Volga Cline"" was formed as Lower Volga people mixed with upriver populations that had more Eastern hunter-gatherer (EHG) ancestry, creating genetically hyper-variable populations as at Khvalynsk in the Middle Volga. A ""Dnipro Cline"" was formed as CLV people bearing both Caucasus Neolithic and Lower Volga ancestry moved west and acquired Ukraine Neolithic hunter-gatherer (UNHG) ancestry to establish the population of the Serednii Stih culture from which the direct ancestors of the Yamnaya themselves were formed around 4000BCE. This population grew rapidly after 3750-3350BCE, precipitating the expansion of people of the Yamnaya culture who totally displaced previous groups on the Volga and further east, while admixing with more sedentary groups in the west. CLV cline people with Lower Volga ancestry contributed four fifths of the ancestry of the Yamnaya, but also, entering Anatolia from the east, contributed at least a tenth of the ancestry of Bronze Age Central Anatolians, where the Hittite language, related to the Indo-European languages spread by the Yamnaya, was spoken. We thus propose that the final unity of the speakers of the ""Proto-Indo-Anatolian"" ancestral language of both Anatolian and Indo-European languages can be traced to CLV cline people sometime between 4400-4000 BCE.

Genetic reconstruction of the ancestry of Pontic-Caspian steppe and West Asian populations points to the North Caucasus-Lower Volga area as the homeland of Indo-Anatolian languages and to the Serednii Stih archaeological culture of the Dnipro-Don area as the homeland of Indo-European languages. The Caucasus-Lower Volga people had diverse distal roots, estimated using the qpAdm software on the left barplot, as Caucasus hunter-gatherer (purple), Central Asian (red), Eastern hunter-gatherer (pink), and West Asian Neolithic (green). Caucasus-Lower Volga expansions, estimated using qpAdm on the right barplot as disseminated Caucasus Neolithic (blue)-Lower Volga Eneolithic (orange) proximal ancestries, mixing with the inhabitants of the North Pontic region (yellow), Volga region (yellow), and West Asia (green).

Recent research has highlighted the therapeutic potential of psychoactive substances and especially 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), in alleviating trauma symptoms in chronic patients. However, little is known regarding the consequences of trauma that is acutely experienced under the influence of psychoactive substances. Here we investigated the acute experiences and peritraumatic processing of 657 survivors from the high-casualty terror attack at the Supernova music festival in Israel on October 7th, 2023. Data were collected four to twelve weeks following the TE. Approximately two-thirds of survivors were under the influence of psychoactive substances at the time of the TE, offering a tragic and unique natural experiment on the impact of psychoactive compounds on TE processing. Our findings reveal that individuals who experienced the trauma while under the influence of MDMA demonstrated significantly improved intermediate outcomes compared to those who were under the influence of other substances or no substances at all. Specifically, the MDMA group reported increased feelings of social support, more social interactions and enhanced quality of sleep during the peritraumatic period, yielding reduced levels of mental distress and reduced PTSD symptom severity. These novel findings suggest that the influence of MDMA during the TE may carry protective effects into the peritraumatic period, possibly mediated through the known effects of MDMA in reducing negative emotions and elevating prosociality. These protective effects in turn may mitigate the development of early psychopathology-related symptoms. Current preliminary results underscore the need for further understanding of the cognitive and physiological processes by which psychedelic substances intersect with trauma recovery processes.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711153

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711153

These viruses have spread across the Americas causing morbidity and mortality in both wild and domestic birds as well as some mammalian species, including cattle. Many surveillance programs in wildlife as well as commercial poultry operations have detected these viruses. Here we conducted surveillance of avian species in the urban environment in New York City. We detected highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in six samples from four different bird species and performed full genome sequencing. Sequence analysis showed the presence of multiple different genotypes. Our work highlights that the interface between animals and humans that may give rise to zoonotic infections or even pandemics is not limited to rural environments and commercial poultry operations but extends into the heart of our urban centers.

ImportanceWhile surveillance for avian influenza viruses is often focused on migratory routes and their associated stop-over locations, or commercial poultry operations, many bird species - including migratory birds - frequent or live in urban green spaces and wetlands. This brings them into contact with a highly dense population of humans and pets providing an extensive urban animal-human interface in which the general public may have little awareness of circulating infectious diseases. This study focuses on virus surveillance at this interface, combined with culturally responsive science education and community outreach.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711153

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1716242711153

Although many research groups have contributed image processing tools for these tasks, a lack of standardisation and inter-operability represents a barrier for newcomers to the field. Here, we present an image processing pipeline for electron tomography data in RELION-5, with functionality ranging from the import of unprocessed movies to the automated building of atomic models in the final maps. Our explicit definition of metadata items that describe the steps of our pipeline has been designed for inter-operability with other software tools and provides a framework for further standardisation.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711153

Stress-induced exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following translational shutoff is thought to cause condensation by allowing new multivalent RNA-dependent interactions, with RNA length and associated interaction capacity driving increased condensation. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNA species condense in response to multiple unrelated stresses in budding yeast, length plays a minor role, and instead, stress-induced transcripts are preferentially excluded from condensates, enabling their selective translation. Using both endogenous genes and reporter constructs, we show that translation initiation blockade, rather than resulting ribosome-free RNA, causes condensation. These translation initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are biochemically detectable even when stress granules, defined as microscopically visible foci, are absent or blocked. TIICs occur in unstressed yeast cells, and, during stress, grow before the appearance of visible stress granules. Stress-induced transcripts are excluded from TIICs primarily due to the timing of their expression, rather than their sequence features. Together, our results reveal a simple system by which cells redirect translational activity to newly synthesized transcripts during stress, with broad implications for cellular regulation in changing conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711153

However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.","NA","biorxiv",1716242711153
