This paper aimed to assess a multitude of cardiac signs, symptoms, and conditions, as well as focused on patients with and without congenital heart defects (CHDs), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the post-acute cardiovascular outcomes among children and adolescents after COVID-19.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 19 US childrens hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and September 2023. Every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry. Absolute risks of incident post-acute COVID-19 sequelae were reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by contrasting COVID-19-positive with COVID-19-negative groups using a Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through propensity scoring stratification.

ResultsA total of 1,213,322 individuals under 21 years old (mean[SD] age, 7.75[6.11] years; 623,806 male [51.4%]) were included. The absolute rate of any post-acute cardiovascular outcome in this study was 2.32% in COVID-19 positive and 1.38% in negative groups. Patients with CHD post-SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks of any cardiovascular outcome (RR, 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-1.80), including increased risks of 11 of 18 post-acute sequelae in hypertension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias), myocarditis, other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest), thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain and palpitations). Those without CHDs also experienced heightened cardiovascular risks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.69), covering 14 of 18 conditions in hypertension, arrhythmias (ventricular arrhythmias and premature atrial or ventricular contractions), inflammatory heart disease (pericarditis and myocarditis), other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock), thrombotic disorders (pulmonary embolism and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and syncope).

ConclusionsBoth children with and without CHDs showed increased risks for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the need for targeted monitoring and management in the post-acute phase.

Clinical Perspective sectionO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIWe investigated the risks of 18 post-acute COVID-19 cardiovascular outcomes in the pediatric population without Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in over 1 million patients, stratified by congenital heart defects (CHD) status.
C_LIO_LIWe extended the follow-up period beyond previous pediatric studies, ensuring every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry.
C_LIO_LIWe included a comprehensive cross-section of the US pediatric population across various healthcare settings including primary, specialty, and emergency care, as well as testing and inpatient facilities.
C_LI

What are the clinical implications?O_LIWithin the post-acute phase, children and adolescents previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at statistically significant increased risk of incident cardiovascular outcomes, including hypertension, ventricular arrhythmias, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, thromboembolism, chest pain, and palpitations. These findings are consistent among patients with and without CHDs.
C_LIO_LIAwareness of the heightened risk of cardiovascular disorders after COVID-19 can lead to a timely referral, investigations, and management of these conditions in children and adolescents.

Here, we report a broad survey of plasmids from hundreds of academic and industrial labs worldwide. We show that nearly half of them contained design and/or sequence errors. For transfer plasmids used in making AAV vectors, which are widely used in gene therapy, about 40% carried mutations in ITR regions due to their inherent instability, which is influenced by flanking GC content. We also list genes difficult to clone into plasmid or package into virus due to their toxicity. Our finding raises serious concerns over the trustworthiness of lab-made plasmids, which parallels the underappreciated mycoplasma contamination and misidentified mammalian cell lines reported previously, and highlights the need for community-wide standards to uphold the quality of this ubiquitous reagent in research and medicine.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

In order to determine the N, the usual approach is to perform a power calculation, which involves understanding the variability between samples and the expected effect size. Here, we focused on bulk RNA-seq experiments, which have become ubiquitous in biology, but which have many unknown or difficult to estimate parameters, and so the required analyses to determine the minimum N is typically lacking. We therefore performed two N=30 profiling studies between wild-type mice and mice in which one copy of a gene had been deleted, to determine how many mice would be required to minimize false positives and to maximize true discoveries found in the N of 30 experiment. Results from experiments with N=4 or less are shown to be highly misleading, given the substantial false positive rate, and the lack of discovery of genes later found with higher N. For a cut-off of 2-fold expression differences, we found that an N of 6-7 mice was required to consistently decrease the false positive rate to below 50%, and that ""more is always better"" when it came to discovery rates - an N of 8-12 is significantly better in lowering the false positive rate.

A common method to reduce false discovery rate in underpowered experiments is to raise the fold cutoff or increase the stringency of the P-value and include only highly perturbed, highly significant genes. We show that while this strategy is no substitute for increasing the N of the experiment, because it results in consistently inflated effect sizes and a substantial drop in sensitivity. These data should be helpful to others in choosing their Ns, since its often not practical to do such large studies for every mouse model.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

Even with broad-scale efforts to characterize the effects of molecular perturbations and interpret gene coexpression, it remains challenging to infer the architecture of gene regulation in a precise and efficient manner. Key properties of GRNs, like hierarchical structure, modular organization, and sparsity, provide both challenges and opportunities for this objective. Here, we seek to better understand properties of GRNs using a new approach to simulate their structure and model their function. We produce realistic network structures with a novel generating algorithm based on insights from small-world network theory, and we model gene expression regulation using stochastic differential equations formulated to accommodate modeling molecular perturbations. With these tools, we systematically describe the effects of gene knockouts within and across GRNs, finding a subset of networks that recapitulate features of a recent genome-scale perturbation study. With deeper analysis of these exemplar networks, we consider future avenues to map the architecture of gene expression regulation using data from cells in perturbed and unperturbed states, finding that while perturbation data are critical to discover specific regulatory interactions, data from unperturbed cells may be sufficient to reveal regulatory programs.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) induces superior or similar health-promoting skeletal muscle and whole-body adaptations compared to prolonged, moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). However, the exercise intensity-specific signaling pathways underlying HIIT versus MICT are unknown. Ten healthy male participants completed bouts of work- and duration-matched HIIT and MICT cycling in randomized crossover trials. Mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic analysis of human muscle biopsies mapped acute signaling responses to HIIT and MICT, identifying 14,931 phosphopeptides and 8,509 phosphosites. Bioinformatics uncovered >1,000 phosphosites significantly regulated by HIIT and/or MICT, including 92 and 348 respective HIIT-specific phosphosites after 5 and 10 min and >3,000 total phosphosites significantly correlated with plasma lactate. This first human muscle HIIT signaling network map has revealed rapid exercise intensity-specific regulation of kinases, substrates and pathways that may contribute to HIIT's unique health-promoting effects.","NA","medrxiv",1720908304229

These assemblies often include novel species that are poorly represented in reference databases creating a need for a tool that can annotate both well-described and novel taxa, and can run at scale. Here, we present mettannotator - a comprehensive Nextflow pipeline for prokaryotic genome annotation that identifies coding and non-coding regions, predicts protein functions, including antimicrobial resistance, and delineates gene clusters. The pipeline summarises the results of these tools in a GFF (General Feature Format) file that can be easily utilised in downstream analysis or visualised using common genome browsers. Mettannotator has been tested on both novel and known taxa, and used across Ensembl Bacteria and MGnify. Here, we show how it works on 29 prokaryotic phyla, both isolate and metagenome-assembled genomes, and present metrics on its performance in comparison to other tools.

Yet the dynamics of accessory genome evolution are very poorly understood, in contrast to the core genome where diversification is readily described by mutations and homologous recombination. Here, we tackle this problem for the case of very closely related genomes. We comprehensively describe genome evolution within n=222 genomes of E. coli ST131, which likely shared a common ancestor around one hundred years ago. After removing putative recombinant diversity, the total length of the phylogeny is 6000 core genome mutations. Within this diversity, we find 22 modifications to core genome synteny and estimate around 2000 structural changes within the accessory genome, i.e. one structural change for every 3 core genome mutations. 63% of loci with structural diversity could be resolved into individual gain and loss events with ten-fold more gains than losses, demonstrating a dominance of gains due to insertion sequences and prophage integration. Our results suggest the majority of synteny changes and insertions in bacterial genomes are likely deleterious and only persist for a short time before being removed by purifying selection.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

To address this, we formed a multi-lab collaboration using a shared, open-source behavioral task and experimental apparatus. Experimenters in ten laboratories repeatedly targeted Neuropixels probes to the same location (spanning secondary visual areas, hippocampus, and thalamus) in mice making decisions; this generated a total of 121 experimental replicates, a unique dataset for evaluating reproducibility of electrophysiology experiments. Despite standardizing both behavioral and electrophysiological procedures, some experimental outcomes were highly variable. A closer analysis uncovered that variability in electrode targeting hindered reproducibility, as did the limited statistical power of some routinely used electrophysiological analyses, such as single-neuron tests of modulation by task parameters. Reproducibility was enhanced by histological and electrophysiological quality-control criteria. Our observations suggest that data from systems neuroscience is vulnerable to a lack of reproducibility, but that across-lab standardization, including metrics we propose, can serve to mitigate this.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

Protracted withdrawal is characterized by negative affective behaviors such as heightened anxiety, irritability, dysphoria, and anhedonia, which pose a significant risk factor for relapse. While the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and mu-opioid recep-tors (MORs) are critical for opioid reinforcement, the specific contributions of VTA-MOR neurons in mediating protracted withdrawal-induced negative affect is not fully understood. In our study, we elucidate the role of VTA-MOR neurons in mediating negative affect and altered brain-wide neuronal activities following opioid exposure and withdrawal in male and female mice. Utilizing a chronic oral mor-phine administration model, we observe increased social deficit, anxiety-related, and despair-like behaviors during protracted with-drawal. VTA-MOR neurons show heightened neuronal FOS activation at the onset of withdrawal and connect to an array of brain regions that mediate reward and affective processes. Viral re-expression of MORs selectively within the VTA of MOR knockout mice demon-strates that the disrupted social interaction observed during protracted withdrawal is facilitated by this neural population, without affect-ing other protracted withdrawal behaviors. Lastly, VTA-MORs contribute to heightened neuronal FOS activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in response to an acute morphine challenge, suggesting their unique role in modulating ACC-specific neuronal activity. These findings identify VTA-MOR neurons as critical modulators of low sociability during protracted withdrawal and highlight their potential as a mechanistic target to alleviate negative affective behaviors associated with opioid withdrawal.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

It may be targeted in inflammatory diseases and provides rationale to consider the immunological state of patients with mitochondrial disease.

Lipid metabolism is fundamental to CD4+ T cell metabolism yet remains poorly understood across subsets. Therefore, we performed targeted in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screens to identify lipid-associated genes essential for T cell subset functions. These screens established mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) genes Mecr, Mcat and Oxsm as highly impactful. Of these, the inborn error of metabolism gene Mecr was most dynamically regulated. Effector and memory T cells were reduced in Mecrfl/fl; Cd4cre mice, and MECR was required for activated CD4+ T cells to efficiently proliferate, differentiate, and survive. Mecr-deficient T cells also had decreased mitochondrial respiration, reduced TCA intermediates, and accumulated intracellular iron, which contributed to cell death and sensitivity to ferroptosis. Importantly, Mecr-deficient T cells exhibited fitness disadvantages in inflammatory, tumor, and infection models. mtFAS and MECR thus play important roles in activated T cells and may provide targets to modulate immune functions in inflammatory diseases. The immunological state of MECR- and mtFAS-deficient patients may also be compromised.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

CpE binds selectively to membrane protein receptors called claudins on the apical surfaces of small intestinal epithelium. Claudins normally construct tight junctions that regulate epithelial paracellular transport but are hijacked from doing so by CpE and are instead led to form claudin/CpE small complexes. Small complexes are building blocks for assembling oligomeric {beta}-barrel pores that penetrate the plasma membrane and induce gut cytotoxicity. Here we present structures of CpE in complexes with its native claudin receptor in humans, claudin-4, at 4.0 and 2.8 [A] using cryogenic electron microscopy. The structures reveal the overall architecture of the small complex, that the small complex can be kinetically trapped, and resolve its key features; like the residues used in claudin/CpE complex binding, the orientation of CpE relative to the membrane, and CpE-induced structural changes to claudin-4. Further, the structures allude to the biophysical procession from small complex to cytotoxic {beta}-barrel pore used by CpE during pathogenesis and the role of trypsin in this process. In full, this work elucidates the structure and mechanism of claudin-bound CpE pore assembly and provides strategies to obstruct its formation to treat CpE-induced gastrointestinal diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

Homologous recombination (HR) is preferred to repair DSBs when a nearby sister chromatid ensures an error-free template. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this preference extends into anaphase and telophase (late mitosis; late-M), despite sister chromatids having been pulled apart. Previously, we identified the nuclear envelope (NE) protein Msc1 as important for late-M DSB repair. Here, we report that Msc1 faces the NE lumen, and its depletion leads to DSB-independent over-compartmentalization of the nucleus, which hampers approximation of sister loci after DSB. Depletion of Msc1 also leads to nuclear pore complex mislocation, a phenotype shared by the highly conserved NE healing complex ESCRT-III. Critically, we show that both Msc1 and ESCRT-III also ensure DSB repair in G2/M, and that there is synergism between Msc1 and the ESCRT-III subunit Snf7. These findings highlight the essential role of NE health in DSB repair.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state.

Nevertheless, microgravity has a significant impact on humans. Immune and red blood cells utilize hematic or lymphatic streams (bio-fluid) as their primary mode of transport, and these streams have been identified as a significant concern under microgravity. This study aims to quantitatively address the puzzle of how cells are influenced by gravity when they are suspended in bio-fluid. The Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) approach was used to model blood and the cell by applying gravity as an external force along the vertical axis and varied from 0g to 2g during parameter sweeps. It was observed that the cell undergoes shape change and spatially aligns under the influence of gravity, and this was quantified with metrics such as Elongation and Deformation indices, pitch angle, and normalized center of mass. The Elongation Index and the normalized center of mass declined linearly with the applied gravity. Correlation analysis showed a strong correlation between applied gravity and the aforementioned variables. Forces exerted on the solid, specifically drag, shear stress, and solid forces, declined in magnitude as the gravitational force exerted on the cell was increased. Further analysis showed that increasing gravity affected the cells velocity, leading to extended proximity near the wall and increased viscous interaction with the surrounding fluid particles, triggering a shape change. This study marks a significant step in understanding gravitys effects on blood cells.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

While the evolution of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses to avoid humoral immunity is well characterized, relatively little is known about the evolution of innate immune antagonism phenotypes in these viruses. Numerous studies have established that only a small subset of infected cells is responsible for initiating the type I and type III interferon (IFN) response during IAV infection, emphasizing the importance of single cell studies to accurately characterize the IFN response during infection. We developed a flow cytometry-based method to examine transcriptional changes in IFN and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression at the single cell level. We observed that NS segments derived from seasonal H3N2 viruses are more efficient at antagonizing IFN signaling but less effective at suppressing IFN induction, compared to the pdm2009 H1N1 lineage. We compared a collection of NS segments spanning the natural history of the current seasonal IAV lineages and demonstrate long periods of stability in IFN antagonism potential, punctuated by occasional phenotypic shifts.

A recent application of this technique was used in a high-profile analysis in JAMA Internal Medicine to estimate the effect of cefepime, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, on mortality in severe infection. There has been ongoing concern that piperacillin-tazobactam, another broad-spectrum antibiotic with greater anaerobic activity might be inferior to cefepime, however this has not been shown in randomized controlled trials. The authors used an international shortage of piperacillin-tazobactam as an instrument, as during this shortage period, cefepime was used as an alternative. The authors report a strong mortality effect (5% absolute increase) with piperacillin-tazobactam. In this paper, we closely examine this estimate and find it is likely conditional on inclusion of a control variable (metronidazole usage). Inclusion of this variable is highly likely to lead to collider bias, which we show via simulation. We then generate estimates unadjusted for metronidazole which are much closer to the null and may represent residual confounding or confounding by indication. We highlight the ongoing challenge of collider bias in empirical IV analyses and the potential for large biases to occur. We finally suggest the authors consider including these unadjusted estimates in their manuscript, as the large increase in mortality reported with piperacillin-tazobactam is unlikely to be true.","NA","medrxiv",1720908304229

MDCs are triggered by perturbations in mitochondrial lipid and protein content, as well as increases in intracellular amino acids. Here, we sought to understand how amino acids trigger MDCs. We show that amino acid-activation of MDCs is dependent on the functional state of mitochondria. While amino acid excess triggers MDC formation when cells are grown on fermentable carbon sources, stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis blocks MDC formation. Moreover, amino acid elevation depletes TCA cycle metabolites in yeast, and preventing consumption of TCA cycle intermediates for amino acid catabolism suppresses MDC formation.

These results demonstrate that amino acids stimulate MDC formation by perturbing mitochondrial metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

This study tested whether canonical additive and multiplicative neural computations, well-described in sensory systems, generalize to the corticospinal pathway during human action preparation. We used non-invasive brain stimulation to measure corticospinal input-output across varying action preparation contexts during instructed-delay finger response tasks. Goal-directed action preparation was marked by increased multiplicative gain of corticospinal projections to task-relevant muscles and additive suppression of corticospinal projections to non-selected and task-irrelevant muscles. Individuals who modulated corticospinal gain to a greater extent were faster to initiate prepared responses. Our findings provide physiological evidence of combined additive suppression and gain modulation in the human motor system. We propose these computations support action preparation by enhancing the contrast between selected motor representations and surrounding background activity to facilitate response selection and execution.

Significance statementNeural computations determine what information is transmitted through brain circuits. We investigated whether the motor system uses computations similar to those observed in sensory systems by noninvasively stimulating the corticospinal pathway in humans during movement preparation. We discovered that corticospinal projections to behaviorally relevant muscles exhibit nonlinear gain computations, while projections to behaviorally irrelevant muscles exhibit linear suppression. Notably, individuals with stronger signatures of these computations had faster motor responses. Our findings suggest that certain computational principles generalize to the human motor system and serve to enhance the contrast between relevant and background neural activity.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

These hotspots operate in tandem to optimize both receptor binding for effective infection and immune evasion efficiency, thereby maintaining overall viral fitness. The lack of molecular details on structure, dynamics and binding energetics of the latest FLiRT and FLuQE variants with the ACE2 receptor and antibodies provides a considerable challenge that is explored in this study. We combined AlphaFold2-based atomistic predictions of structures and conformational ensembles of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike complexes with the host receptor ACE2 for the most dominant Omicron variants JN.1, KP.1, KP.2 and KP.3 to examine the mechanisms underlying the role of convergent evolution hotspots in balancing ACE2 binding and antibody evasion. Using the ensemble-based mutational scanning of the spike protein residues and computations of binding affinities, we identified binding energy hotspots and characterized molecular basis underlying epistatic couplings between convergent mutational hotspots. The results suggested that the existence of epistatic interactions between convergent mutational sites at L455, F456, Q493 positions that enable to protect and restore ACE2 binding affinity while conferring beneficial immune escape. To examine immune escape mechanisms, we performed structure-based mutational profiling of the spike protein binding with several classes of antibodies that displayed impaired neutralization against BA.2.86, JN.1, KP.2 and KP.3. The results confirmed the experimental data that JN.1, KP.2 and KP.3 harboring the L455S and F456L mutations can significantly impair the neutralizing activity of class-1 monoclonal antibodies, while the epistatic effects mediated by F456L can facilitate the subsequent convergence of Q493E changes to rescue ACE2 binding.

The evolutionary history of angiosperms (flowering plants) is characterised by a highly accelerated rate of diversification, which Darwin referred to as an ""abominable mystery"" 2. Here we show, by analysing the transcriptomes from eight organs across seven species, that angiosperm protein-coding gene expression patterns evolve rapidly: within 45 million years, expression levels of orthologous genes diverged so strongly that they are more similar between different organs within a species than between what are considered homologous organs from different species. This finding differs from previous observations in mammals, which demonstrated that organ-dependent gene expression levels are largely conserved 3, 4, 5. Among the angiosperm organs, meristems and leaves show the highest degree of expression conservation, whereas stamen and pollen transcriptomes diverge rapidly. Examining changes in the expression level of functionally related genes, we found low rates for those involved in key cellular, metabolic and developmental processes. In contrast, particularly high rates were observed for genes that are involved in the response to endogenous and external stimuli, presumably reflecting an adaptive response of flowering plants to ever-changing environments. Our work reveals that the evolution of gene expression progresses at different rates in angiosperms and mammals, and provides a comprehensive resource to perform cross-kingdom comparative studies of transcriptome evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

Here, we analyze the potential of AlphaFold3 in correct reproduction of amyloid structures, which are an example of multimeric proteins characterized by polymorphism and low representation in protein structure databases. Results: We show that AlphaFold3 is capable of producing amyloid-like assemblies that have a high similarity to experimental structures, although its results are impacted by the number of monomers in the predicted fibril. It produces structurally diverse models of some amyloid proteins, which could reflect their polymorphism observed in nature. We hypothesize that the lower emphasis on multiple sequence analysis (MSA) in AlphaFold3 improves the results quality, since for this class of proteins sequence homology is not necessary for their structural similarity. Notably, the structural landscape obtained from the modeling does not reflect the real one governed by thermodynamics, which does not hamper modeling amyloid proteins. Finally, AlphaFold3 opens the door to fast structural modeling of fibril-like structures, including their polymorphic nature.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

DesignObservational study.

Setting204 countries and territories.

Data sourcesGlobal Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 and Our World in Data.

Main outcome measuresAll-cause and COVID-19-specific age-standardized years lived with disability (YLD) rates and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC).

ResultsGlobally, the burden of GBS significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, age-standardized YLD rates were 0.86 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 0.56 to 1.24) per 100,000 people in 2020, rising to 1.75 (95% UI: 1.12 to 2.54) per 100,000 people in 2021, reflecting an EAPC of 70.35% (95% UI: 38.73 to 109.06) from 2019 to 2021. Regionally, the highest age-standardized YLD rates in 2020 and 2021 were observed in the high-income Asia Pacific and central Latin America, respectively, while the lowest rates were found in East Asia for both years. Age-standardized YLD rates rose 3.7 times faster in countries with a low socio-demographic index (SDI) versus countries with a high SDI (103.21% per year (95% UI: 71.10 to 141.35%) vs 28.02% per year (11.46 to 47.03)). Males generally had higher YLD rates across all age groups, with the highest disparity in those aged 80 and above. During the first two years of the pandemic, the increase in YLD rates was more pronounced in females and younger populations aged 15-29 years. A statistically negative correlation was observed between COVID-19 vaccination coverage and the GBS burden, with increases in full vaccination coverage per 100 people leading to decreases in all-cause YLD rates by 0.0070 and COVID-19-specific YLD rates by 0.0128 per 100,000 people.

ConclusionPredominantly driven by the surge of COVID-19 cases, the burden of GBS significantly increased during the first two years of the pandemic, especially in those countries with lower SDI levels. Greater increases in the GBS burden were observed in females and younger populations (15-29 years). Importantly, the benefits of vaccination outweighed the risks in controlling the post-COVID-19 GBS burden, although significant disparities in vaccination coverage existed between countries. These findings offer robust evidence facilitating public education and transparent communication on COVID-19 vaccination and highlight the urgency for targeted control measures to manage the burden of post-infection complications, such as GBS, during future COVID-19 waves or other potential pandemics.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICGuillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disease, and respiratory and gastrointestinal infections are the major triggering factors.

From 1990 to 2019, the burden of GBS was relatively low, with negligible changes observed in most countries and territories.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination on the burden of GBS remains not fully understood.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the global age-standardized years lived with disability (YLD) related to GBS increased by 70.30% annually, and low socio-demographic index (SDI) regions experienced the most rapid GBS burden increment (103.21%).

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was the primary factor contributing to the increased burden of GBS during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Improving vaccination coverage was the most effective measure to reduce the post-COVID-19 burden of GBS, and each additional fully vaccinated person (per hundred people) decreased the COVID-19-specific age-standardized YLD of GBS by 0.0128 per 100,000 population.","NA","medrxiv",1720908304229

However, how exactly the PT invades the receptive synergid is unknown as the spatial relationship between these two cells is unclear. To better understand this process we performed 3D live imaging of PT reception in Arabidopsis thaliana. Upon arrival at the filiform apparatus (FA), a region rich in membrane folds at the micropylar pole of the synergids, the PT gradually deforms the FA before it rapidly grows into the receptive synergid. Upon penetration, the membrane of the receptive synergid invaginates and envelopes the PT. We termed this newly discovered structure the peri-tubular membrane (PRM). We show that, in feronia mutants disrupting PT reception, the PT still enters the receptive synergid, forming a normal PRM. This results in extensive invagination of the synergid membrane without sperm release. We show that PRM formation is associated with a cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) spike of high amplitude in the PT and flooding of [Ca2+]cyt in the synergids. In PTs lacking AUTOINHIBITED Ca2+ ATPASE9 activity, PTs have lower amplitude [Ca2+]cyt spiking and the PTs frequently fail to penetrate the synergid. Our findings suggest that synergid penetration and the non-cell autonomous control of PT rupture are distinct regulated processes required for fertilization in flowering plants.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

Informed by invasive tract-tracing measurements, the cortex exhibits marked interareal variation in connectivity profiles to reveal the heterogeneity across cortical areas. However, it remains unclear about the organizing principles possibly shared by genetics and cortical wiring to manifest the spatial heterogeneity across the cortex. Instead of considering a complex one-to-one mapping between genetic coding and interareal connectivity, we hypothesized the existence of a more efficient way that the organizing principles are embedded in genetic profiles to underpin the cortical wiring space. Leveraging on the vertex-wise tractography in diffusion-weighted MRI, we derived the global connectopies to reliably index the organizing principles of interareal connectivity variation in a low-dimensional space, which specifically captured three dominant topographic patterns along the dorsoventral, rostrocaudal, and mediolateral axes of the cortex. More importantly, we demonstrated that the global connectopies converge to the gradients of vertex-by-vertex genetic correlation matrix on the phenotype of cortical morphology and the cortex-wide spatiomolecular gradients. By diving into the genetic profiles, we found the critical role of genes scaffolding the global connectopies were related to brain morphogenesis and enriched in radial glial cells before birth and excitatory neurons after birth. Taken together, our findings demonstrated the existence of a genetically determined space to encode the interareal connectivity variation, which may give new insights into the links between cortical connections and arealization.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

However, recent discoveries have revealed that a significant burden of disease heritability in common autoinflammatory disorders and coronary artery disease is mediated through genetic variation modifying post-transcriptional modification of RNA through adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing. This common RNA modification is catalyzed by ADAR enzymes, where ADAR1 edits specific immunogenic double stranded RNA (dsRNA) to prevent activation of the double strand RNA (dsRNA) sensor MDA5 (IFIH1) and stimulation of an interferon stimulated gene (ISG) response. Multiple lines of human genetic data indicate impaired RNA editing and increased dsRNA sensing to be an important mechanism of coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Here, we provide a crucial link between observations in human genetics and mechanistic cell biology leading to progression of CAD. Through analysis of human atherosclerotic plaque, we implicate the vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) to have a unique requirement for RNA editing, and that ISG induction occurs in SMC phenotypic modulation, implicating MDA5 activation. Through culture of human coronary artery SMCs, generation of a conditional SMC specific Adar1 deletion mouse model on a pro-atherosclerosis background, and with incorporation of single cell RNA sequencing cellular profiling, we further show that Adar1 controls SMC phenotypic state, is required to maintain vascular integrity, and controls progression of atherosclerosis and vascular calcification.

Strikingly, many elongation factors, previously thought to travel processively with RNAPII, display transient residence times, suggesting highly dynamic interactions rather than constant association. Systematic screening of RNAPII-associated factors shows that truncation of RNAPII-CTD substantially reduces U1 snRNP residence time and decreases intron retention in ribosomal protein genes, providing insights into how CTD length influences co-transcriptional splicing.

Using a spatial memory task in rats, we simultaneously recorded ensembles from hippocampal CA1 and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to address this question. We found that task behaviors best aligned with low-dimensional, shared subspaces between these regions, rather than local activity in either region. Critically, both network oscillations and speed modulated the structure and performance of this communication subspace. Contrary to expectations, theta coherence did not better predict CA1-PFC shared activity, while theta power played a more significant role. To understand the communication space, we visualized shared CA1-PFC communication geometry using manifold techniques and found ring-like structures. We hypothesize that these shared activity manifolds are utilized to mediate the task behavior.

However, the early SC injury response preceding the repair state remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Sarm1, a key regulator of axon degeneration, is expressed in SCs and has a critical role in the early SC injury response. Leveraging the fact that Sarm1 deletion impairs the SC transition to the repair state, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to compare the transcriptional responses of wild-type and Sarm1 knockout SCs 24 hours after nerve injury. Remarkably, Sarm1-deficient SCs, unlike wild-type SCs, showed increased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and the TCA cycle. These findings were functionally validated, revealing that Sarm1 knockout SCs displayed increased mitochondrial respiration in response to injury. Intriguingly, Sarm1 knockout SCs also exhibited enhanced axon protection compared to wild-type SCs in an in vitro model of axon degeneration. We propose that Sarm1 gates the transition of SCs from a protective, oxidative phosphorylation-dependent state (which we term Protection Associated Schwann Cells or PASCs) to a glycolytic, pro-regenerative repair phenotype after injury. Our findings challenge the prevailing view of Sarm1 as an exclusively axon-autonomous regulator of degeneration and reveal a paradigm shift in understanding the role of Sarm1 in the SC injury response, with broad implications for the treatment of peripheral neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

The resulting paired-end alignments enable direct and independent assignment of reads to polyadenylation sites, which bypasses complexities and limitations of conventional approaches but does not consistently improve read mapping rates compared to single-end alignment. We also characterize low-level artifacts and arrive at an adjusted adapter trimming and alignment workflow that significantly improves the alignment of sequence data from Element and Illumina, particularly in the context of extended read lengths. Our analyses confirm that Element avidity sequencing is an effective alternative to Illumina sequencing for standard single-cell RNA-seq, particularly for polyadenylation site analyses but do not rule out the potential for similar performance from other emerging platforms.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

This has permitted the early detection of outbreaks but has been insufficient for single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-level analysis due to lower read accuracy than Illumina sequencing. This study aimed to determine whether Haplotype-aware ERRor cOrrection (HERRO) of ONT data could permit high-resolution comparison of outbreak isolates. Methods: We used ONT simplex reads from isolates involved in a recent outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in our neonatal unit. The raw sequence data were re-basecalled and adapter-trimmed using Dorado v0.7.0. The simplex reads then underwent HERRO correction. The resulting genome assemblies and phylogenies were compared with previous analyses (using Dorado v0.3.4, no HERRO correction and data generated by Illumina sequencing). Results: Five of nine outbreak isolates were included in the analysis. The remaining four isolates had insufficient read lengths (N50 values <10,000 bp) and did not provide complete chromosome coverage after HERRO correction. The average chromosome sequencing depth for nanopore data was 147 x (range: 44&-220x) with an average read N50 of 12,215 bp (interquartile range (IQR): 11,439-12,711 bp). The median pairwise SNV distance between outbreak isolates from the original investigation was 51 SNVs (range: 40-68), which decreased to 3 SNVs (range: 1-15) with HERRO correction. Illumina sequencing generated a median SNV distance of 2 (range: 0-13). The resulting standalone ONT HERRO-corrected phylogeny was almost indistinguishable from the standalone Illumina-generated phylogeny. Conclusions: The addition of HERRO correction meant isolates from this MRSA outbreak could be resolved to a level on par with Illumina sequencing. ONT data following HERRO correction represents a viable standalone option for high-resolution genomic analysis of hospital outbreaks, provided sufficient read lengths can be generated.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

We have recently shown associations for CHIP with acute kidney injury and with kidney function decline in the general population, with stronger associations for CHIP driven by mutations in genes other than DNMT3A (non-DNMT3A CHIP). Longitudinal kidney function endpoints in individuals with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CHIP have been examined in two previous studies, which reported conflicting findings and were limited by small sample sizes.

MethodsIn this study, we examined the prospective associations between CHIP and CKD progression events in four cohorts of CKD patients (total N = 5,772). The primary outcome was a composite of 50% kidney function decline or kidney failure. The slope of eGFR decline was examined as a secondary outcome. Mendelian randomization techniques were then used to investigate potential causal effects of CHIP on eGFR decline. Finally, kidney function was assessed in adenine-fed CKD model mice having received a bone marrow transplant recapitulatingTet2-CHIP compared to controls transplanted wild-type bone marrow.

ResultsAcross all cohorts, the average age was 66.4 years, the average baseline eGFR was 42.6 ml/min/1.73m2, and 24% had CHIP. Upon meta-analysis, non-DNMT3A CHIP was associated with a 59% higher relative risk of incident CKD progression (HR 1.59, 95% CI: 1.02-2.47). This association was more pronounced among individuals with diabetes (HR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.03-1.62) and with baseline eGFR [&ge;] 30 ml/min/1.73m (HR 1.80, 95% CI: 1.11-2.90). Additionally, the annualized slope of eGFR decline was steeper among non-DNMT3A CHIP carriers, relative to non-carriers ({beta} -0.61 {+/-} 0.31 ml/min/1.73m2, p = 0.04). Mendelian randomization analyses suggested a causal role for CHIP in eGFR decline among individuals with diabetes. In a dietary adenine mouse model of CKD, Tet2-CHIP was associated with lower GFR as well as greater kidney inflammation, tubular injury, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.

ConclusionNon-DNMT3A CHIP is a potentially targetable novel risk factor for CKD progression.","NA","medrxiv",1720908304229

Previously, we reported an active CCR6 structure in complex with its cognate chemokine CCL20, revealing the molecular basis of CCR6 activation mediated by CCL20. Here, we present two inactive CCR6 structures determined by cryo-EM in ternary complexes with different allosteric antagonists, CCR6/SQA1/OXM1 and CCR6/SQA1/OXM2. OXM1 and OXM2 are oxomorpholine (OXM) analogues which are highly selective for CCR6 and disrupt the molecular network critical for receptor activation by binding to an extracellular allosteric pocket within the transmembrane domain. A U-shaped conformation stabilized by intramolecular interactions was revealed by structural and NMR studies of active OXM analogues. SQA1 is a squaramide (SQA) derivative with close-in analogues that were previously reported to be antagonists of CCR6 and other chemokine receptors. Our structures reveal an intracellular pocket occupied by SQA1 that overlaps with the G protein binding site. In addition, SQA1 stabilizes a closed conformation of the intracellular pocket, a hallmark of the inactive state of GPCRs. Minimal communication was found between the two allosteric pockets. Overall, our work provides new evidence of the versatility of GPCR antagonism by small molecules, complementing previous knowledge on CCR6 activation, and sheds light on drug discovery approaches to target CCR6 for autoimmune disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

To investigate if specific trait-associated variation show enrichment during particular periods of human evolution, we combine genome wide association study (GWAS) data from 70 traits, spanning multiple categories including AI-based image-derived morphological phenotypes of the brain, heart, and skeletal tissues with data from 12 different evolutionary regions obtained from comparative functional genomics, multi-species alignments from long read sequencing, and ancient DNA reflecting 4 different major evolutionary divergence points. These regions cover epigenetic differences in the brain between humans and rhesus macaques, various human accelerated regions (HARs) including regions from the Zoonomia Project, ancient selective sweeps, and Neanderthal introgressed alleles. Using two complementary approaches to examine enrichment between GWAS loci and genomic regions, we show that more phenotypes are enriched in earlier periods of divergence of humans with macaques and chimps, and less so during the divergence with Neanderthals. These traits span respiratory, dermatological, reproductive, metabolic, and psychiatric domains along with skeletal and brain imaging traits, consistent with striking morphological changes between humans and other primates. Among brain imaging traits, we observe an enrichment of SNPs associated with the longitudinal fasciculus in human-gained epigenetic elements since macaques, the visual cortex in HARs, and the thalamus proper in Neanderthal introgressed alleles, implying associated functions such as language processing, decision making, relay of sensory signals, and motor control are enriched at different evolutionary depths.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

However, whether individual neurons also embed information about their own anatomical location within their spike patterns remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that machine learning models can predict a neuron's anatomical location across multiple brain regions and structures based solely on its spiking activity. Analyzing high-density recordings from thousands of neurons in awake, behaving mice, we demonstrate that anatomical location can be reliably decoded from neuronal activity across various stimulus conditions, including drifting gratings, naturalistic movies, and spontaneous activity. Crucially, anatomical signatures generalize across animals and even across different research laboratories, suggesting a fundamental principle of neural organization. Examination of trained classifiers reveals that anatomical information is enriched in specific interspike intervals as well as responses to stimuli. Within the visual isocortex, anatomical embedding is robust at the level of layers and primary versus secondary but does not robustly separate individual secondary structures. In contrast, structures within the hippocampus and thalamus are robustly separable based on their spike patterns. Our findings reveal a generalizable dimension of the neural code, where anatomical information is multiplexed with the encoding of external stimuli and internal states. This discovery provides new insights into the relationship between brain structure and function, with broad implications for neurodevelopment, multimodal integration, and the interpretation of large-scale neuronal recordings. Immediately, it has potential as a strategy for in-vivo electrode localization.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

It holds that a rigorous study of conscious experience requires a transition in the subject from the ""natural attitude"" (NA) to the ""phenomenological attitude"" (PA). NA describes our ordinary stance, in which our attention is directed at external objects and events. PA is a distinctive, reflective stance in which our attention is directed at our conscious experience itself. Despite its theoretical importance in philosophy and science of consciousness, the neural mechanisms underlying PA remain unknown. To clarify this point, we developed a novel behavioral task in which participants alternate between NA and PA in relation to their stimulus-evoked subjective experiences. Participants are presented with two sentences and requested to identify the one that best captures their experience. These sentences are designed to induce either NA or PA. We found that participants had lower error rates but slower reaction times in the PA condition compared to the NA condition, suggesting a difference beyond task difficulty. Using fMRI, we also found that multivoxel activation patterns in the premotor cortex, posterior parietal cortex, supplementary motor area, and cerebellum successfully classified the task conditions. Furthermore, the activation strength in these regions was lower in the PA condition, indicating that PA depends on neural processes that suppress action-related information. These findings provide the first evidence for the neural signature of PA, contributing to a better understanding of phenomenological method and its underlying neural mechanisms.

Significance statementPhenomenology is one of the most promising approaches to study conscious experience. A key step is a transition from the natural attitude (NA)--where our attention is directed at external objects and events--to the phenomenological attitude (PA)--where our attention is directed toward our conscious experience itself. However, the neural processes underlying PA remain unclear. This study aimed to clarify this point by analyzing fMRI signals measured during a cognitive task that forced participants to repeatedly alternate between NA and PA. We observed that multiple action-related brain regions exhibited different activation patterns between NA and PA. Our findings provide the first neuroscientific evidence that illuminates the core process of the phenomenological method.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

The underlying mechanism--whether infection risk is due to a direct effect of PPIs on the gut microbiome or changes in gastrointestinal pH--has remained unclear.

To disentangle both possibilities, we studied the impact of the proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole and pH changes on key members of the human gut microbiome and stool-derived microbial communities from different donors in vitro. We then developed a custom multiple-bioreactor system to grow a model human microbiome community in chemostat mode and tested the effects of omeprazole exposure, pH changes, and their combination on C. difficile growth within this community.

Our findings show that changes in pH significantly affect the gut microbial communitys biomass and the abundances of different strains, leading to increased C. difficile growth within the community. However, omeprazole treatment alone did not result in such effects. These findings imply that the higher risk of C. difficile infection following proton-pump inhibitor therapy is probably because of alterations in gastrointestinal pH rather than a direct interaction between the drug and the microbiome. This understanding paves the way for reducing infection risks in proton-pump inhibitor therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

However, we know little about how meristems initiate from non-meristematic cells. The haploid body of bryophytes develops from unicellular spores in isolation from the parental plant, which allows all stages of development to be observed. We discovered that the Marchantia spore undergoes a series of precisely oriented cell divisions to generate a flat prothallus on which a meristem later develops de novo. The young sporeling comprises an early cell mass. One cell of the early cell mass elongates and undergoes a formative division that produces the prothalloblast, which initiates prothallus formation. A symmetric division of the prothalloblast followed by two transverse divisions generate a four-celled plate that expands into a flat disc through oblique divisions in three of the four plate cell-derived quadrants. One quadrant gives rise to a flat flabellum. A notch with a meristem and apical stem cell develops at the margin of the flabellum. The transcription factor MpC3HDZ is a marker of the first flat prothallus structure and polarises to the dorsal tissues of flabella and meristems. Mpc3hdz mutants are defective in setting up dorsoventrality and thallus body flatness.

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1720908304229

However, how these three structures work together is not fully understood. Recently, it has been suggested that reinforcement learning may be implemented not only in the basal ganglia but also in the cerebellum, as the activity of cerebellar climbing fibers represents reward prediction error. If the same learning mechanism via reward prediction error occurs simultaneously in the basal ganglia and cerebellum, it remains unclear how these two regions co-function. Here, we recorded neuronal activity in the output of cerebellum and basal ganglia, the cerebellar nuclei and substantia nigra pars reticulata, respectively, from ChR2 transgenic rats with high-density Neuropixels probes while optogenetically stimulating the cerebral cortex point-by-point. The temporal response patterns could be categorized into two classes in both cerebellar nuclei and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Among them, the fast excitatory response of the cerebellar nuclei due to the input of mossy fibers and the inhibitory response of the substantia nigra pars reticulata via the direct pathway were synchronized. This coincidence, reproduced in a spiking network simulation based on connectome data, was expected to synchronously activate the cerebral cortex via the thalamus. To further investigate the significance of this synchronous positive feedback, we constructed a reservoir model that mimics the time course of the activity dynamics of cerebral cortex and temporal responses of cerebellar nuclei and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Plasticity of both parallel fiber inputs to Purkinje cell and corticostriatal synapses onto the striatal neurons of the direct pathway was essential for successful learning of a reinforcement learning task. Notably, learning was inhibited when the timing of the cerebellar or basal ganglia output was delayed from the real data by 10 ms; the larger this delay, the slower the learning rate. This necessary temporal precision was observed only when the cerebral cortex operated in the {beta}-to-{gamma} frequency range. These results indicate that coordinated output of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, with input from the cerebral cortex in a narrow frequency band, facilitates brain-wide synergistic reinforcement learning. Thus, our findings contribute to a holistic understanding of the interactions among the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

Analysis of 13C-labeled FAs in hepatocytes lacking mitochondrial D-{beta}-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1) revealed a partial reliance on mitochondrial conversion of D-{beta}OHB to acetoacetate (AcAc) for cytoplasmic DNL contribution, whereas FA elongation from ketone bodies was fully dependent on cytosolic acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS). Ketone bodies were essential for polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) homeostasis in hepatocytes, as loss of AACS diminished both free and esterified PUFAs. Ketogenic insufficiency depleted liver PUFAs and increased triacylglycerols, mimicking human MASLD, suggesting that ketogenesis supports PUFA homeostasis, and may mitigate MASLD-MASH progression in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

Most current methods for genome-wide profiling of DNA-bound proteins, such as ChIP-seq and CUT&Tag, use conventional IgG antibodies to bind target protein(s), which limits their applicability to targets for which high affinity and high specificity antibodies are available. Here we describe NanoTag, a novel method derived from CUT&Tag that is IgG-free and uses a nanobody to profile DNA-protein interactions. NanoTag is based on an anti-GFP nanobody-Tn5 transposase fusion that allows mapping GFP-tagged proteins associated with chromatin in a fast and cost-effective manner. We demonstrate the utility of NanoTag by profiling the histone mark H3K4me3 via its binding partner TATA box-binding protein-associated factor 3 (TAF3) and the transcription factors Nanog and CTCF in mouse embryonic stem cells expressing GFP-tagged targets. For the targets examined, NanoTag data shows high correlation to CUT&Tag data and displays a similarly high signal-to-noise ratio. Overall, NanoTag provides a flexible, IgG-free and cost-effective method to generate high resolution DNA-binding profiles in cells or tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

Depression is associated with immunological and metabolic alterations, but immunometabolic characteristics of developmental trajectories of depressive symptoms remain unclear. Using depressive symptoms scores measured on 10 occasions between ages 10 and 25 years in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n=7302), we identified four distinct trajectories: low-stable (70% of the sample), adolescent-limited (13%), adulthood-onset (10%) and adolescent-persistent (7%). We examined associations of these trajectories with: i) anthropometric, cardiometabolic and psychiatric phenotypes using multivariable regression (n=1709-3410); ii) 67 blood immunological proteins and 57 metabolomic features using empirical Bayes moderated linear models (n=2059 and n=2240 respectively); and iii) 28 blood cell counts and biochemical measures using multivariable regression (n=2256). Relative to the low-stable group, risk of depression and anxiety in adulthood was higher for all other groups, especially in the adolescent-persistent (ORdepression=22.80, 95% CI 15.25-34.37; ORGAD=19.32, 95% CI 12.86-29.22) and adulthood-onset (ORdepression=7.68, 95% CI 5.31-11.17; ORGAD=5.39, 95% CI 3.65-7.94) groups. The three depression-related trajectories vary in their immunometabolic profile, with evidence of little or no alterations in the adolescent-limited group. The adulthood-onset group shows widespread classical immunometabolic changes (e.g., increased immune cell counts and insulin resistance), while the adolescent-persistent group is characterised by higher BMI both in childhood and adulthood with few other immunometabolic changes. These findings point to distinct mechanisms and intervention opportunities for adverse cardiometabolic profile in different groups of young people with depression.","NA","medrxiv",1720908304229

Two major methodologies exist to study these fluctuations: an objective approach that identifies ""in-the-zone"" states of consistent response times (RTs) and ""out-of-the-zone"" states of erratic RTs and a subjective approach that asks participants whether they are on-task or mind wandering. Although both approaches effectively predict attentional lapses, it remains unclear whether they capture the same or distinct attentional fluctuations. We combined both approaches within a single sustained attention task requiring frequent responses and response inhibition to rare targets to explore their consistency (N=40). Behaviorally, both objective out-of-the-zone and subjective mind-wandering states were associated with more attentional lapses. However, the percentage of time spent out-of-the-zone did not differ between on-task and mind-wandering periods and both objective and subjective states independently predicted error-proneness, suggesting that the two methods do not capture the same type of attention fluctuations. Whereas attentional preparation before correct inhibitions was greater during out-of-the-zone compared to in-the-zone periods, preparation did not differ by subjective state. In contrast, post-error slowing differed by both objective and subjective states, but in opposite directions: slowing was observed when participants were objectively out-of-the-zone or subjectively on-task. Overall, our results provide evidence that objective and subjective approaches capture distinct attention fluctuations during sustained attention tasks. Integrating both objective and subjective measures is crucial for fully understanding the mechanisms underlying our ability to remain focused.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

There is emerging evidence that the chronic MSK pain and associated symptoms in PCS have similarities to Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS). This study aimed to characterise PCS related new-onset chronic MSK pain and its overlap with Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS).

MethodsPatients with new-onset chronic MSK pain following COVID-19 infection were enrolled and the nature of pain and associated symptoms captured using the C19-YRS (Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale). FMS assessment was conducted as part of standard clinical examination using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2010 criteria. Diagnosis of FMS was made when they meet the standard criteria of (1) Widespread Pain Index (WPI) [&ge;] 7 and Symptoms Severity (SS) score [&ge;] 5, or WPI is 3-6 and SS score [&ge;] 9, (2) symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months, and (3) the patient does not have a disorder that would otherwise explain the symptoms.

ResultsEighteen patients, twelve of whom were female, with an average age of 49.6 (SD 11.8) years and a Body Mass Index of 31.7 (SD 8.6) were enrolled. The average duration of symptoms from COVID-19 infection to assessment was 27.9 (SD 6.97) months. The new-onset chronic pain was widespread, primarily manifesting as muscle pain. Thirteen (72.2%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for FMS, with an average WPI score of 8.8 and an average SS score of 8.2, indicating a high level of pain and significant adverse impact on their quality of life.

ConclusionThe study found that 72.2% of the patients with new-onset chronic MSK pain following COVID-19 infection met the criteria for FMS. These findings support the hypothesis that FMS may develop as a long-term sequela of a viral infection, underscoring the need for further research into post-viral long-term conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1720908304229

During the pandemic, it became apparent that ancestry was associated with COVID-19 severity and morbidity, such that individuals of African descent tended to have worse outcomes than other populations. One factor that may influence COVID-19 outcomes is the circulating proteomic response to infection. This study examines how different ancestries had differential circulating protein levels in response to severe COVID-19 infection.

Methods4,979 circulating proteins from 1,272 samples were measured using the SomaScan platform. We used a linear mixed model to assess the ancestry-specific association between the level of each protein and severe COVID-19 illness, accounting for sex, age, and days since symptom onset. We then compared each ancestry-specific effect size of severe COVID-19 illness on protein level to one another in a pairwise manner to generate Z-scores. These Z-scores were then converted into p-values and corrected for multiple comparisons using a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate of 5%.

ResultsComparing ancestries, we found that 62% of the tested proteins are associated with severe COVID-19 in European-ancestry individuals, compared to controls. We found that 45% and 22% of the tested proteins were different between COVID-19 infected and control individuals in people of African and East Asian ancestry, respectively. There was a strong correlation in effect size between ancestries. We found that individuals of European and African ancestry had the most similar response with a Pearson correlation of 0.868, 95% CI [0.861, 0.875] while European and East Asian ancestries had a Pearson correlation of 0.645, 95% CI [0.628, 0.661] and, East Asian and African ancestries had a Pearson correlation of 0.709, 95% CI [0.695, 0.722]. However, we found 39 unique proteins that responded differently (FDR < 0.05) between the three ancestries.

ConclusionsExamining 4,979 protein levels in 1,272 samples, we identified that the majority of measured proteins had similar responses to infection across individuals of European, African and East Asian ancestry. However, there were 39 proteins that may have a differential response to infection, when stratified by ancestry. These proteins could be investigated to assess whether they explain the differences in observed severity of COVID-19 between ancestral populations.","NA","medrxiv",1720908304229

This inherent catalytic feature of condensates derives from the electrochemical environments and the electric fields at interfaces that are direct consequences of phase separation. The condensates we studied were capable of catalyzing diverse hydrolysis reactions, including hydrolysis and radical-dependent breakdown of ATP whereby ATP fully decomposes to adenine and multiple carbohydrates. This distinguishes condensates from naturally occurring ATPases, which can only catalyze the dephosphorylation of ATP. Interphase and interfacial properties of condensates can be tuned via sequence design, thus enabling control over catalysis through sequence-dependent electrochemical features of condensates. Incorporation of hydrolase-like synthetic condensates into live cells enables activation of transcriptional circuits that depend on products of hydrolysis reactions. Inherent catalytic functions of condensates, which are emergent consequences of phase separation, are likely to affect metabolic regulation in cells.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

While the aetiology of Parkinsons disease remains elusive, the degeneration of the dopamine - producing nigrostriatal neurons, along with the accumulation of alpha-synuclein, are pathophysiological hallmarks. The impairment of motor functions, a consequence of the involvement of the thalamic-frontal loop, dominates the overt clinical picture. However, more recent findings clarified that the symptoms are more widespread, and cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunctions are also common. Accordingly, neuroimaging studies show that, even in early disease, structural and functional alterations are not confined to the motor areas. This suggests that the effects of the nigro-striatal neurodegeneration are not restricted to the motor areas alone but, rather, they modify the behavior of the brain on a large scale. Understanding how the local degeneration of dopaminergic neurons affects the whole brain dynamics remains an open question.

The purpose of this study is to understand how the ability of the nigrostriatal pathways to support a dopaminergic stimulation affects the brain as a whole. To this end, we leverage simultaneous recordings from EEG and deep electrodes placed near the subthalamic nuclei (STN) from 10 Parkinsonian patients, acquired both before and after administration of L-Dopa. We used the topography of the spreading of aperiodic waves over a large scale (i.e. neuronal avalanches), utilizing the recently described avalanche transition matrix (ATM), to characterize the brain dynamics. To simulate the effect of L-Dopa in silico, we deployed a mechanistic neural-mass model derived from the adaptive quadratic integrate-and-fire model (aQIF) of individual neurons that has been extended to include dopamine concentration as a variable. Each parcelled brain region is equipped with a neural mass and then coupled according to the empirical connectomes, where connections can be either excitatory, inhibitory, or dopaminergic. Then, the whole-brain dynamics have been simulated for different configurations, i.e., for different dopaminergic tones. This way, we obtained a numerical prediction of the expected dynamics (in terms of properties of the ATMs), as observed in the deep electrodes and the EEG, given different dopaminergic tones. Then, in a Bayesian set-up, we used a class of deep neural networks to ""invert"" the model and infer the most likely dopaminergic tone given the empirically observed dynamics. For all ten patients, we correctly inferred that the dopaminergic tone was higher given the dynamics observed after administration of L-Dopa, and lower before. In other words, we could distinguish and quantify the dopaminergic tone from the electrophysiological data if the subjects had orally taken L-Dopa. This was achieved by integrating the background (anatomical and dynamical) knowledge into model prediction about the physiology of dopamine (as opposed to training a classifier to distinguish empirical data). Finally, we carried out a diagnostic for the validation of the model, as well as a further description of the simulated dopamine dynamics.","NA","medrxiv",1720908304229

The extent to which this depends on how different INs process excitatory signals along their dendrites is poorly understood. Here, we reveal that the functional specialization of two major populations of cortical INs is determined by the unique association of different dendritic integration modes with distinct synaptic organization motifs. We found that somatostatin (SST)-INs exhibit NMDAR-dependent dendritic integration and uniform synapse density along the dendritic tree. In contrast, dendrites of parvalbumin (PV)-INs exhibit passive synaptic integration coupled with proximally enriched synaptic distributions. Theoretical analysis shows that these two dendritic configurations result in different strategies to optimize synaptic efficacy in thin dendritic structures. Yet, the two configurations lead to distinct temporal engagement of each IN during network activity. We confirmed these predictions with in vivo recordings of IN activity in the visual cortex of awake mice, revealing a rapid and linear recruitment of PV-INs as opposed to a long-lasting integrative activation of SST-INs. Our work reveals the existence of distinct dendritic strategies that confer distinct temporal representations for the two major classes of neocortical INs and thus dynamics of inhibition.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

This problem often has multiple solutions that cannot be distinguished based on current maximum parsimony principles alone. Current algorithms use ad hoc criteria to select among these solutions, and decide, a priori, what patterns of metastatic spread are more likely, which is itself a key question posed by studies of metastasis seeking to use these tools. Here we introduce Metient, a freely available open-source tool which proposes multiple possible hypotheses of metastatic spread in a cohort of patients and rescores these hypotheses using independent data on genetic distance of metastasizing clones and organotropism. Metient adapts Gumbel-softmax gradient estimators, to quickly map out a Pareto front of migration histories that cover the range of histories that are parsimonious under some criteria. Given a cohort of patients, Metient can calibrate its parsimony criteria, thereby identifying shared patterns of metastatic dissemination in the cohort. Compared with the current state-of-the-art, Metient recovers more migration histories, is more accurate, and is more than 40x faster. Reanalyzing metastasis in 169 patients based on 490 tumors, Metient automatically identifies cancer type-specific trends of metastatic dissemination in melanoma, high-risk neuroblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Metients reconstructions usually agree with semi-manual expert analysis, however, in 24 patients, Metient identifies more plausible migration histories than experts, and thus finds that polyclonal seeding of metastases is more common than previously reported.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

The availability of large collections of bacterial genomes has made genome-wide association studies (GWAS) a common approach for this purpose. The need to employ multiple software tools for data pre- and post-processing limits the application of these methods by experienced bioinformaticians. To address this issue, we have developed a pipeline to perform bacterial GWAS from a set of assemblies and annotations, with multiple phenotypes as targets. The associations are run using five sets of genetic variants: unitigs, gene presence/absence, rare variants (i.e. gene burden test), gene cluster specific k-mers, and all unitigs jointly. All variants passing the association threshold are further annotated to identify overrepresented biological processes and pathways. The results can be further augmented by generating a phylogenetic tree and by predicting the presence of antimicrobial resistance and virulence associated genes. We tested the microGWAS pipeline on a previously reported dataset on E. coli virulence, successfully identifying the causal variants, and providing further interpretation on the association results. The microGWAS pipeline integrates the state-of-the-art tools to perform bacterial GWAS into a single, user-friendly, and reproducible pipeline, allowing for the democratization of these analyses.

SARS-CoV-2 internalization occurs via S-protein-mediated cell binding followed either by direct fusion with the plasma membrane or endocytosis and subsequent fusion with the endosomal membrane. Despite the crucial role of virus internalization, the precise kinetics of the processes involved remains elusive. We developed a pipeline, which combines live-cell microscopy and advanced image analysis, for measuring the rates of multiple internalization-associated molecular events of single SARS-CoV-2-virus-like particles (VLPs), including endosome ingression, pH change, and nucleocapsid release. Our live-cell imaging experiments demonstrate that only a few minutes after binding to the plasma membrane, VLPs ingress into Rab5-negative endosomes via Dynamin-dependent scission. Less than two minutes later, the pH of VLPs drops below 5 followed by an increase in VLP speed, yet these two events are not interrelated. Nucleocapsid release from the VLPs occurs with similar kinetics to the pH drop, suggesting that VLP fusion occurs during endosome acidification. Neither Omicron mutations nor abrogation of the S protein polybasic cleavage site altered the rate of VLP internalization events, indicating that they do not affect these processes. Finally, we observe that VLP internalization occurs two to three times faster in VeroE6 than in A549 cells, which may contribute to the greater susceptibility of the former cell line to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, our precise measurements of the kinetics of VLP internalization-associated processes shed light on their contribution to the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cells. Time-lapse videos of the studied internalization events can be accessed in the dedicated COVIDynamics database.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

The efficiency of reverse transcription is a major limiting step for retron technologies, but we lack systematic knowledge of how to improve or maintain reverse transcription efficiency while changing the retron sequence for custom DNA production. Here, we test thousands of different modifications to the retron-Eco1 ncRNA and measure DNA production in pooled variant library experiments, identifying regions of the ncRNA that are tolerant and intolerant to modification. We apply this new information to a specific application: the use of the retron to produce a precise genome editing donor in combination with a CRISPR-Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease (an editron). We use high-throughput libraries in S. cerevisiae to additionally define design rules for editrons. We extend our new knowledge of retron DNA production and editron design rules to human genome editing to achieve the highest efficiency retron-Eco1 editrons to date.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

However, biologically contaminated pipette tips must undergo several washing and sterilization steps before being reused or recycled. Grenova Solutions provides such a decontamination station called TipNovus, which has been implemented by academic and government research labs to reuse pipette tips in sensitive biological assays. Despite this success, the high initial purchasing cost of these washing stations deter many laboratories from incorporating it into their workflow. Additionally, researchers are reluctant to reuse pipette tips due to concerns that the washing process may not thoroughly remove all contaminants. To mitigate these concerns, considering the University of Texas at Austin as an example, we performed a cost-benefit analysis of employing a university-wide washing station. We estimated that only single-time reuse of the pipette tips could result in a 100% return on investment from the equipment purchase cost within 3 months. Then, with our pilot experiments, we confirmed the TipNovus washing steps to be 100% efficient in sterilizing pipette tips contaminated with T7 bacteriophage, enabling their reuse in bacteriophage functionality assays. Finally, we proposed an alternative and more convenient autoclave-based sterilization method to decontaminate pipette tips.

On the other hand, many preclinical self-administration and choice experiments employ fixed unit doses and mandatory timeouts after doses (known as discrete dimension procedures). These restrictions fail to consider the distinct pharmacokinetic properties of heroin and cocaine, leading to uniform and comparable behaviors (including drug-taking patterns). This uniformity contrasts sharply with the significantly different ways humans use heroin and cocaine, which are characterized by highly individualized drug use behaviors. Here, we introduce a no-timeout procedure that overcomes this limitation (continuous dimension procedure).

We analyzed the heroin and cocaine taking- and seeking-patterns and estimated drug-brain levels in the presence or absence of timeout between drug injections. We further assessed how absence of timeout and the availability of drug or social peer (access time to the two rewards) affect drug preference. Removing the timeout had a profound effect on pattern of heroin taking and seeking, promoting the emergence of burst-like drug intake and social withdrawal as revealed by a discrete choice procedure. On the other hand, timeout removal had a lesser impact on cocaine taking and seeking and did not impact social preference. By removing timeout during self-administration and increasing the access time during choice resulted in a self-administration procedure that more closely mimic human heroin intake, offering a platform to identify novel medications.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

However, despite extensive experimental work focused on this regulation, quantifying SF regulatory activity in a form that can be readily applied to new analyses remains a challenge. Here we present an interpretable regression model, KATMAP, which explicitly models splicing changes upon SF knockdown in terms of changes in SF binding across the transcriptome and the resulting loss of regulation. This allows us to learn an SFs positional activity and predict the factors regulatory impact on individual exons, yielding regulatory models consistent with prior literature and highly reproducible across knockdowns of the same SF in different cell types, even generalizing well to related species. We leverage this generalizability to distinguish direct targets from the indirect effects of knockdown, and identify the secondary SFs responsible for these widespread indirect effects. We further uncover evidence of cooperative regulation between RBFOX and QKI. The generality of our statistical framework means it could be extended to the study of RNA regulation and processing beyond splicing.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

The huge number of scientific articles with the term arousal (~50.000) highlights the importance of the concept but also explains why such a vast literature has never been systematically reviewed so far. Here, we leverage the tools of natural language processing to probe the nature of arousal in a data-driven, comprehensive manner. We show that arousal comes in seven varieties: cognitive, emotional, physiological, sexual, related to stress disorders, to sleep, or to sleep disorders. We then ask whether domain-general arousal exists, and run meta-analyses of the brain imaging literature to reveal that all varieties of arousal, except arousal in sleep disorders for lack of data, converge onto a cortical arousal network composed of the pre-supplementary motor area and the left and right dorsal anterior insula. More precisely, we find that activity in dysgranular insular area 7, the region with the highest convergence across varieties of arousal is also specific to arousal. Our results show that arousal corresponds to a construct at least partially shared across different domains of neuroscience and identify the domain-general cortical arousal network. Novel taxonomies of arousal reconciling seemingly opposing views on what arousal is should thus include domain-general arousal as a central component.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

The increased trend towards long term continuous neural recordings have spurred efforts to realize active commutators that can sense the torsional stress and actively rotation the slip ring to alleviate torsional stresses. Current solutions however require addition of sensing modules. Here we report on an active translating commutator that uses computer vision (CV) algorithms on behavioral imaging videos captured during the experiment to track the animals position and heading direction in real-time and uses this information to control the translation and rotation of a slipring commutator to accommodate for accumulated mouse heading orientation changes and position.

Here, we focus on B vitamin exchange in coastal marine bacterial communities that degrade particulate organic matter and find that natural seawater communities are vitamin limited. While almost a third of bacterial isolates from these communities are B vitamin auxotrophs, the pioneering degraders that first arrive on particles are vitamin producers that likely support auxotrophs through cross-feeding.

We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1720908304229

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

It is estimated that 783 million by 2045 will live with diabetes worldwide, 90% of those cases are type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a multifaceted disease, its treatment requires a holistic approach, beyond single target medications with high efficacy. There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

The striped variety has attracted particular attention for its intricate and unpredictable patterns. A good understanding of the mechanism that drives the striped pattern formation of the broken tulips has been missing since the 17th century. It is known since 1928 that these patterned tulips suffer from a viral infection by the tulip breaking virus. Here, we present a mathematical model to understand how a virus infection of the petals can lead to stripes, thereby solving a 350 year old mystery. The model, which describes the viral inhibition of pigment expression (anthocyanins) and their interaction with viral reproduction, incorporates a pattern formation mechanism identified as an activator-substrate mechanism, similar to the well-known Turing instability, working together with a Wolperts positional information mechanism. The model is solved on a growing tulip petal shaped domain, whereby we introduce a new method to describe the tulip petal growth explicitly. This work contributes to the theory of pattern formation of reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains applied to the fields of virology and botany.","NA","biorxiv",1720908304229

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1720908304229

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.
