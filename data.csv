While oral NR supplementation has demonstrated safety and bioavailability in multiple animal and human studies, the effects of intravenous NR (NR IV) are far less understood. Until now, pharmaceutical grade NR was not available for injection research. Objectives: Given that intravenous administration may offer advantages in certain conditions and contexts, a systematic investigation of the clinical effects of NR IV is warranted. Methods: The present randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, pilot clinical study was initiated with the primary aim of investigating the safety, tolerability, and the blood NAD+-boosting efficacy of an acute, single dose of NR IV (500 mg, test), NAD+ IV (500 mg, active comparator), oral NR (500 mg, bridge), and saline IV (placebo control) in generally healthy adult participants. The study consisted of two parts; data from 37 and 16 participants in the first and second phases, respectively, were analyzed. Results: No significant differences in vital signs were detected across groups. In comparison to NAD+ IV, NR IV was associated with fewer and less severe adverse experiences during the infusion; no attributable adverse events were reported through the 14-day follow-up period for any treatment groups. Further, the mean tolerable infusion time for NR IV was 75% less than that of NAD+ IV. No clinically meaningful changes in blood chemistry markers were described in the NR IV condition, whereas an increase in white blood cell counts and neutrophils was observed in the NAD+ IV condition, suggesting the presence of an inflammatory response. Finally, NR IV appeared to promote the most robust increases in NAD+ concentration as measured by dried blood spot analyses, with peak NAD+ levels increasing by 20.7% relative to baseline, and acutely outperforming NAD+ IV (p <0.01) and oral NR (p<0.01) at the 3-hr timepoint. Conclusion: This is the first study to clinically evaluate NR IV. Overall, acute intravenous infusions of 500 mg NR were safe in the study participants with no attributable adverse events and only minor and transient infusion-related experiences. In comparison to NAD+ IV, NR IV had a faster infusion time with superior tolerability. At 3 hours post-infusion, blood NAD+ levels were significantly higher in the NR IV group compared to the NAD+ IV group. Future studies in larger populations are needed to validate these results.","NA","medrxiv",1718316526069

While established viability-resolved metagenomic approaches are labor-intensive as well as biased and lacking in sensitivity, we here introduce a new fully computational framework that leverages nanopore sequencing technology to assess microbial viability directly from freely available nanopore signal data. Our approach utilizes deep neural networks to learn features from such raw nanopore signal data that can distinguish DNA from viable and dead microorganisms in a controlled experimental setting. The application of explainable AI tools then allows us to robustly pinpoint the signal patterns in the nanopore raw data that allow the model to make viability predictions at high accuracy. Using the model predictions as well as efficient explainable AI-based rules, we show that our framework can be leveraged in a real-world application to estimate the viability of pathogenic Chlamydia, where traditional culture-based methods suffer from inherently high false negative rates. This application shows that our viability model captures predictive patterns in the nanopore signal that can in principle be utilized to predict viability across taxonomic boundaries and indendent of the killing method used to induce bacterial cell death. While the generalizability of our computational framework needs to be assessed in more detail, we here demonstrate for the first time the potential of analyzing freely available nanopore signal data to infer the viability of microorganisms, with many applications in environmental, veterinary, and clinical settings.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526069

However, to be included in national NCS inventories, governments must first quantify the kelp-derived carbon stocks and fluxes leading to carbon sequestration. Here, we present a blueprint for assessing the national carbon sequestration capacity of kelp forests in which data synthesis and Bayesian hierarchical modelling enable estimates of kelp forest carbon production, storage, and export capacity from limited data. Applying this blueprint to Canadas extensive coastline, we find kelp forests store an estimated 1.4 Tg C in short-term biomass and produce 3.1 Tg C yr-1 with modest carbon fluxes to the deep ocean. Arctic kelps had the highest carbon stocks and production capacity, while Pacific kelps had greater carbon fluxes overall due to their higher productivity and export rates. Our transparent, reproducible blueprint represents an important step towards accurate carbon accounting for kelp forests.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526069

Proposed drivers of remarkable longevity include high vegetable intake, strong social connections, and genetic markers. Here, we reveal new predictors of remarkable longevity and  supercentenarian status. In the United States, supercentenarian status is predicted by the absence of vital registration. The state-specific introduction of birth certificates is associated with a 69-82% fall in the number of supercentenarian records. In Italy, England, and France, which have more uniform vital registration, remarkable longevity is instead predicted by poverty, low per capita incomes, shorter life expectancy, higher crime rates, worse health, higher deprivation, fewer 90+ year olds, and residence in remote, overseas, and colonial territories. In England and France, higher old-age poverty rates alone predict more than half of the regional variation in attaining a remarkable age. Only 18% of  exhaustively validated supercentenarians have a birth certificate, falling to zero percent in the USA, and supercentenarian birthdates are concentrated on days divisible by five: a pattern indicative of widespread fraud and error. Finally, the designated  blue zones of Sardinia, Okinawa, and Ikaria corresponded to regions with low incomes, low literacy, high crime rate and short life expectancy relative to their national average. As such, relative poverty and short lifespan constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status and support a primary role of fraud and error in generating remarkable human age records.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526069

A multitude of evolutionary pressures, including the minimization of metabolic costs while maximizing communication efficiency, contribute to shaping the structure and dynamics of these networks. However, how communication efficiency is characterized depends on the assumed model of communication dynamics. Traditional models include shortest path signaling, random walker navigation, broadcasting, and diffusive processes. Yet, a general and model-agnostic framework for characterizing optimal neural communication remains to be established. Our study addresses this challenge by assigning communication efficiency through game theory, based on a combination of structural data from human cortical networks with computational models of brain dynamics. We quantified the exact influence exerted by each brain node over every other node using an exhaustive multi-site virtual lesioning scheme, creating optimal influence maps for various models of brain dynamics. These descriptions show how communication patterns unfold in the given brain network if regions maximize their influence over one another. By comparing these influence maps with a large variety of brain communication models, we found that optimal communication most closely resembles a broadcasting model in which regions leverage multiple parallel channels for information dissemination. Moreover, we show that the most influential regions within the cortex are formed by its rich-club. These regions exploit their topological vantage point by broadcasting across numerous pathways, thereby significantly enhancing their effective reach even when the anatomical connections are weak. Our work provides a rigorous and versatile framework for characterizing optimal communication across brain networks and reveals the most influential brain regions and the topological features underlying their optimal communication.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526069

The rapid structural changes seen in plasmid genomes present considerable challenges to evolutionary and epidemiological analysis. Typical approaches are either low resolution (replicon typing) or use shared k-mer content to define a genetic distance. However this distance can both overestimate plasmid relatedness by ignoring rearrangements, and underestimate by over-penalising gene gain/loss. Therefore a model is needed which captures the key components of how plasmid genomes evolve structurally - through gene/block gain or loss, and rearrangement. A secondary requirement is to prevent promiscuous transposable elements (TEs) leading to over-clustering of unrelated plasmids. We choose the ""Double Cut and Join Indel"" model, in which plasmids are studied at a coarse level, as a sequence of signed integers (representing genes or aligned blocks), and the distance between two plasmids is the minimum number of rearrangement events or indels needed to transform one into the other. We show how this gives much more meaningful distances between plasmids. We introduce a software workflow pling (https://github.com/iqbal-lab-org/pling), which uses the DCJ-Indel model, to calculate distances between plasmids and then cluster them. In our approach, we combine containment distances and DCJ-Indel distances to build a TE-aware plasmid network. We demonstrate superior performance and interpretability to other plasmid clustering tools on the ""Russian Doll"" dataset and a hospital transmission dataset.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526069

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1718316526069

Defining the contribution of each cell type to the computational and cognitive processes that are guided by the cortex is essential for understanding its function in health and disease. We use transcriptomic and epigenomic cortical cell type taxonomies from mice and humans to define marker genes and enhancers, and to build genetic tools for cortical cell types. Here, we present a large toolkit for selective targeting of cortical populations, including mouse transgenic lines and recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors containing genomic enhancers. We report evaluation of tens of new transgenic lines and of >680 different enhancer AAVs covering all major subclasses of cortical cells, with many achieving a high degree of specificity, comparable with existing transgenic lines. We find that the transgenic lines based on marker genes can provide exceptional specificity and completeness of cell type labeling, but frequently require generation of a triple-transgenic cross for best usability/specificity. On the other hand, enhancer AAVs are easy to screen and use, and can be easily modified to express diverse cargo, such as recombinases. However, their use depends on the titer and delivery method. The tools reported here as well as the scaled process of tool creation provide an unprecedented resource that should enable diverse experimental strategies towards understanding mammalian cortex and brain function.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526069

At the core of this pathway is the cGAS-dependent production of the intra- and extra-cellular messenger 23-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which activates STING and leads to IRF3-dependent expression of cytokines and interferon. Despite its relevance to monitor viral and bacterial infections, cell death, and genome instability, the lack of specific live reporters has precluded spatio-temporal analyses of cGAS-STING signalling. Here, we generate a fluorescent cGAMP biosensor by engineering the functional interaction of activated STING and IRF3 at the Golgi. We show that cells encoding for the cGAMP biosensor react within 45 minutes, and in a time- and concentration-dependent manner to STING agonists and cGAMP. We demonstrate that the cGAMP biosensor is suitable for single cell characterisation of the dynamics of Herpes Simplex Virus 1 infection, mtDNA release upon apoptosis, and other sources of cytoplasmic dsDNA. Intriguingly, we show that STING signalling is not activated by ruptured micronuclei, suggesting that other cytosolic pattern recognition receptors underlie the interferon response upon chromosomal instability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the biosensor sensitivity is sufficient to report microenvironmental cGAMP, allowing to analyse how STING signalling spreads through neighbouring cells, including upon viral infection. Taken together, we provide a tool to easily monitor the activation cGAS-STING signalling pathway by live cell imaging, plate reader or immunofluorescence analyses; and to capture the spatio-temporal and heterogenous dynamics of the response to cGAMP.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526069

Morphogens are key examples, where the concentration and duration of morphogen exposure produce distinct cell fates that drive tissue patterning. Studying the dynamics of these processes has been challenging. Here, we establish an optogenetic system for morphogen production that enables the investigation of developmental patterning in vitro. Using a tunable light-inducible gene expression system, we generate long-range Shh gradients that pattern neural progenitors into spatially distinct progenitor domains mimicking the spatial arrangement of neural progenitors found in vivo during vertebrate neural tube development. With this system, we investigate how biochemical features of Shh and the presence of morphogen-interacting proteins affect the patterning length scale. We measure tissue clearance rates, revealing that Shh has an extracellular half-life of about 1h, and we probe how the level and duration of morphogen exposure govern the acquisition and maintenance of cell fates. The rate of Shh turnover is substantially faster than the downstream gene expression dynamics, indicating that the gradient is continually renewed during patterning. Together the optogenetic approach establishes a simple experimental system for the quantitative interrogation of morphogen patterning. Controlling morphogen dynamics in a reproducible manner provides a framework to dissect the interplay between biochemical cues, the biophysics of gradient formation, and the transcriptional programmes underlying developmental patterning.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526069

By studying these forces in adherent cells in culture, we found that neither pushing nor pulling forces propagate along microtubules to the centrosome. Inhibiting dyneins or disassembling microtubules did not disrupt the maintenance of the centrosome at the center of the cell. In contrast, the actomyosin contractile network appears to be responsible for the generation of a centripetal flow that drives the centrosome towards the center of the cell independently of the microtubules. Furthermore, we found that centering of the centrosome depends more on the reorganization of cell shape around the centrosome than on an effective centrosome displacement throughout the cytoplasm.

Genome mining revealed millions of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that encode their biosynthesis, and the major challenge is to predict the bioactivities of the molecules these BGCs specify, and how to elicit their expression. Here, we present an innovative strategy whereby we harness the power of regulatory networks combined with global gene expression patterns to predict BGC functions. Studying the regulon of iron master regulator DmdR1 in Streptomyces coelicolor combined with co-expression data and large-scale comparative genome analysis identified the novel desJGH gene cluster. Mutational and metabolomics analysis showed that desJGH is required for biosynthesis of the clinical drug desferrioxamine B. DesJGH thereby dictate the balance between the structurally distinct desferrioxamines B and E. We propose regulation-based genome mining as a promising approach to functionally prioritize BGCs to accelerate the discovery of novel bioactive molecules.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526069

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded.

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1718316526069

SARS-CoV-2 internalization occurs via S-protein-mediated cell binding followed either by direct fusion with the plasma membrane or endocytosis and subsequent fusion with the endosomal membrane. Despite the crucial role of virus internalization, the precise kinetics of the processes involved remains elusive. We developed a pipeline, which combines live-cell microscopy and advanced image analysis, for measuring the rates of multiple internalization-associated molecular events of single SARS-CoV-2-virus-like particles (VLPs), including endosome ingression, pH change, and nucleocapsid release. Our live-cell imaging experiments demonstrate that only a few minutes after binding to the plasma membrane, VLPs ingress into Rab5-negative endosomes via Dynamin-dependent scission. Less than two minutes later, the pH of VLPs drops below 5 followed by an increase in VLP speed, yet these two events are not interrelated. Nucleocapsid release from the VLPs occurs with similar kinetics to the pH drop, suggesting that VLP fusion occurs during endosome acidification. Neither Omicron mutations nor abrogation of the S protein polybasic cleavage site altered the rate of VLP internalization events, indicating that they do not affect these processes. Finally, we observe that VLP internalization occurs two to three times faster in VeroE6 than in A549 cells, which may contribute to the greater susceptibility of the former cell line to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, our precise measurements of the kinetics of VLP internalization-associated processes shed light on their contribution to the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cells. Time-lapse videos of the studied internalization events can be accessed in the dedicated COVIDynamics database.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526069

Our results demonstrate that Raman scattering overcomes autofluorescence as the predominant source of endogenous tissue background at illumination wavelengths as short as 892 nm. We highlight the versatility of SWIR Raman imaging through in vivo monitoring of whole-body tissue composition dynamics and non-invasive detection of fatty liver disease in mice, and identification of calcification and lipids in unfixed human atherosclerotic plaques. Moreover, our approach facilitates the visualization of nerves embedded in fatty tissue, a major advancement for surgical applications.

Microviruses are highly abundant in aquatic ecosystems and are prominent members of the mammalian gut microbiome, where their diversity has been linked to various chronic health disorders. Despite the clear importance of microviruses, little is known about the molecular mechanism of host infection. Here, we have characterized an exceptionally large microvirus, Ebor, and provide crucial insights into long-standing mechanistic questions. Cryogenic electron microscopy of Ebor revealed a capsid with trimeric protrusions that recognise lipopolysaccharides on the host surface. Cryogenic electron tomography of the host cell colonized with virus particles demonstrated that the virus initially attaches to the cell via five such protrusions, located at the corners of a single pentamer. This interaction triggers a stargate mechanism of capsid opening along the 5-fold symmetry axis, enabling delivery of the virus genome. Despite variations in specific virus-host interactions among different Microviridae family viruses, structural data indicate that the stargate mechanism of infection is universally employed by all members of the family. Startlingly, our data reveal a mechanistic link for the opening of relatively small capsids made out of a single jelly-roll fold with the structurally unrelated giant viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

The best studied bacterial protein gradient is the Min system of Escherichia coli. In rod-shaped bacteria the MinCD proteins prevent formation of minicells by inhibiting FtsZ polymerization close to the cell poles. In E. coli these proteins oscillate between cell poles within a minute, resulting in an increased MinCD concentration at the poles. This oscillation is caused by the interaction between MinD and the protein MinE, which form an ATP-driven reaction-diffusion system, whereby the ATPase MinD cycles between a monomeric cytosolic and a dimeric membrane attached states. Bacillus subtilis also has MinCD, but lacks MinE. In this case MinCD form a static gradient that requires the transmembrane protein MinJ, located at cell poles and cell division sites. A recent reaction-diffusion model was successful in recreating the MinD gradient in B. subtilis, assuming that MinD cycles between cytosol and membrane, like in E. coli. Here we show that the monomeric and dimeric states of B. subtilis MinD have comparable membrane affinities, that MinD interacts with MinJ as a dimer, and that MinJ is not required for membrane localization of MinD. Based on these new findings we tested different models, using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, and found that a difference in diffusion rate between the monomer and dimer, rather than a difference in membrane affinity, is important for B. subtilis MinCD gradient formation.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

Erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments often form during early mitosis, but are destabilized through the phosphorylation of outer kinetochore proteins by centromeric AURORA B kinase (ABK) and centrosomal AURORA A kinase (AAK), thus allowing for re-establishment of attachments until biorientation is achieved. MPS1-mediated phosphorylation of NDC80 has also been shown to directly weaken the kinetochore-microtubule interface in yeast. In human cells, MPS1 has been proposed to transiently accumulate at end-on attached kinetochores and phosphorylate SKA3 to promote microtubule release. Whether MPS1 directly targets NDC80 and/or promotes the activity of AURORA kinases in metazoans remains unclear. Here, we report a novel mechanism involving communication between kinetochores and centrosomes, wherein MPS1 acts upstream of AAK to promote error correction. MPS1 on pole-proximal kinetochores phosphorylates the C-lobe of AAK thereby increasing its activation at centrosomes. This proximity-based activation ensures the establishment of a robust AAK activity gradient that locally destabilizes mal-oriented kinetochores near spindle poles. Accordingly, MPS1 depletion from Drosophila cells causes severe chromosome mis-alignment and erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which can be rescued by tethering either MPS1 or constitutively active AAK mutants to centrosomes. Proximity-based activation of AAK by MPS1 also occurs in human cells to promote AAK-mediated phosphorylation of the NDC80 N-terminal tail. These findings uncover an MPS1-AAK cross-talk that is required for efficient error correction, showcasing the ability of kinetochores to modulate centrosome outputs to ensure proper chromosome segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells.

In particular, intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) are subject to phosphorylation as a means to modulate their interactions and functions. Toward understanding the relationship between phosphorylation in IDRs and specific functional outcomes, we must consider how phosphorylation affects the IDR conformational ensemble. Various experimental techniques are suited to interrogate the features of IDR ensembles; molecular simulations can provide complementary insights and even illuminate ensemble features that may be experimentally inaccessible. Therefore, we sought to expand the tools available to study phosphorylated IDRs by all-atom Monte Carlo simulations. To this end, we implemented parameters for phosphoserine (pSer) and phosphothreonine (pThr) into the OPLS version of the continuum solvent model, ABSINTH, and assessed their performance in all-atom simulations compared to published findings. We simulated short (< 20 residues) and long (> 80 residues) phospho-IDRs that, collectively, survey both local and global phosphorylation-induced changes to the ensemble. Our simulations of four well-studied phospho-IDRs show near-quantitative agreement with published findings for these systems via metrics including changes to radius of gyration, transient helicity, and persistence length. We also leveraged the inherent advantage of sequence control in molecular simulations to explore the conformational effects of diverse combinations of phospho-sites in two multi-phosphorylated IDRs. Our results support and expand on prior observations that connect phosphorylation to changes in the IDR conformational ensemble. Herein, we describe phosphorylation as a means to alter sequence chemistry, net charge and charge patterning, and intramolecular interactions, which can collectively modulate the local and global IDR ensemble features.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

However, development of such models has been hampered by the shortage of large expert-annotated datasets. Here, we used information from free-text radiology reports, rather than manual annotations, to develop a deep-learning-based pipeline for comprehensive detection of abdominal CT abnormalities. Methods In this multicenter retrospective study, we developed a deep-learning-based pipeline to detect abnormalities in the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and kidneys. Abdominal CT exams and related free-text reports obtained during routine clinical practice collected from three institutions were used for training and internal testing, while data collected from six institutions were used for external testing. A multi-organ segmentation model and an information extraction schema were used to extract specific organ images and disease information, CT images and radiology reports, respectively, which were used to train a multiple-instance learning model for anomaly detection. Its performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score against radiologists' ground-truth labels. Findings We trained the model for each organ on images selected from 66,684 exams (39,255 patients) and tested it on 300 (295 patients) and 600 (596 patients) exams for internal and external validation, respectively. In the external test cohort, the overall AUC for detecting organ abnormalities was 0.886. Whereas models trained on human-annotated labels performed better with the same number of exams, those trained on larger datasets with labels auto-extracted via the information extraction schema significantly outperformed human-annotated label-derived models.

However, there are more observable biomechanical compensation strategies within TUG that are indicative of underlying neuromuscular issues and movement priorities. In individuals with unilateral knee osteoarthritis, an increased trunk flexion during TUG is a common phenomenon, often attributed to muscle weakness and/or pain avoidance. Unfortunately, it is difficult to differentiate between these underlying causes using experimental studies alone. This study aimed to distinguish between muscle weakness and pain avoidance as contributing factors, using predictive neuromuscular simulations of the sit-to-walk movement. Muscle weakness was simulated by reducing the maximum isometric force of the vasti muscles (ranging from 20% to 60%), while pain avoidance was integrated as a movement objective, ensuring that peak knee load did not exceed predefined thresholds (2-4 times body weight). The simulations demonstrate that a decrease in muscular capacity led to greater trunk flexion, while pain avoidance led to slower movement speeds and altered muscle recruitments, but not to greater trunk flexion. Our predictive simulations thus indicate that increased trunk flexion is more likely the result of lack of muscular reserve rather than pain avoidance. These findings align with reported differences in kinematics and muscle activations between moderate and severe knee osteoarthritis patients, emphasizing the impact of severe muscle weakness in those with advanced knee osteoarthritis. The simulations offer valuable insights into the mechanisms behind altered movement strategies, potentially guiding more targeted treatment.","10.3389/fbioe.2024.1346365","medrxiv",1718316526070

Our data show that the increase in mitochondrial activity during embryogenesis does not require mitochondrial biogenesis, is not limited by metabolic substrates at early stages, and occurs without an increase in the abundance of respiratory chain complexes or their in vitro activity. Our analyses pinpoint a previously unexplored increase in mitochondrial-ER association during early stages in combination with changes in mitochondrial morphology at later stages as possible contributors to the rise in mitochondrial activity during embryogenesis.

Ideally, patient data are handled in a fully pseudonymised or anonymised way. However, this can make it difficult for medical researchers to access and analyze large datasets or to exchange data between hospitals. De-identifying medical free text is particularly difficult due to the diverse documentation styles and the unstructured nature of the data. However, recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), driven by the development of large language models (LLMs), have revolutionized the ability to extract information from unstructured text. Methods: We hypothesize that LLMs are highly effective tools for extracting patient-related information, which can subsequently be used to de-identify medical reports. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a benchmark study using eight locally deployable LLMs (Llama-3 8B, Llama-3 70B, Llama-2 7B, Llama-2 70B, Llama-2 7B ""Sauerkraut"", Llama-2 70B ""Sauerkraut"", Mistral 7B, and Phi-3-mini) to extract patient-related information from a dataset of 100 real-world clinical letters. We then remove the identified information using our newly developed LLM-Anonymizer pipeline. Results: Our results demonstrate that the LLM-Anonymizer, when used with Llama-3 70B, achieved a success rate of 98.05% in removing text characters carrying personal identifying information. When evaluating the performance in relation to the number of characters manually identified as containing personal information and identifiable characteristics, our system missed only 1.95% of personal identifying information and erroneously redacted only 0.85% of the characters. Conclusion: We provide our full LLM-based Anonymizer pipeline under an open source license with a user-friendly web interface that operates on local hardware and requires no programming skills. This powerful tool has the potential to significantly facilitate medical research by enabling the secure and efficient de-identification of clinical free text data on premise, thereby addressing key challenges in medical data sharing.","NA","medrxiv",1718316526070

Subsets of VTA VGluT2+ neurons are capable of co-transmitting glutamate and GABA (VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons), transmitting glutamate without GABA (VGluT2+VGaT- neurons), or co-transmitting glutamate and dopamine (VGluT2+TH+ neurons), but whether these molecularly distinct subpopulations show behavior-related differences is not wholly understood. We identified that neuronal activity of each VGluT2+ subpopulation is sensitive to reward value but signaled this in different ways. The phasic maximum activity of VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons increased with sucrose concentration, whereas VGluT2+VGaT- neurons increased maximum and sustained activity with sucrose concentration, and VGluT2+TH+ neurons increased sustained but not maximum activity with sucrose concentration. Additionally, VGluT2+ subpopulations signaled consummatory preferences in different ways. VGluT2+VGaT- neurons and VGluT2+TH+ neurons showed a signaling preference for a behaviorally-preferred fat reward over sucrose, but in temporally-distinct ways. In contrast, VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons uniquely signaled a less behaviorally-preferred sucrose reward compared with fat. Further experiments suggested that VGluT2+VGaT+ consummatory reward-related activity was related to sweetness, partially modulated by hunger state, and not dependent on caloric content or behavioral preference. All VGluT2+ subtypes increased neuronal activity following aversive stimuli but VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons uniquely scaled their magnitude and sustained activity with footshock intensity. Optogenetic activation of VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons during low intensity footshock enhanced fear-related behavior without inducing place preference or aversion. We interpret these data such that VTA glutamatergic subpopulations signal different elements of rewarding and aversive experiences and highlight the unique role of VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons in enhancing the salience of behavioral experiences.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

To emulate the complex chemical systems in biological cells, it is necessary to incorporate an increasing number of cellular functions into single compartments. Artificial organelles that spatially segregate reactions inside artificial cells will be beneficial in this context by rectifying biochemical pathways. In our study, we developed artificial cells featuring all-aqueous droplet-in-droplet structures that separate transcription and translation processes, mimicking the nucleus and cytosol in eukaryotic cells. This droplet-in-droplet architecture utilizes intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) to form coacervate droplets for the inner compartments, and aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) for the outer compartments, with the outer interfaces stabilized by colloidal emulsifiers. The inner droplet was designed to enrich DNA and RNA polymerase to conduct transcription, which was coupled to translation at the outer droplet, realizing the cascade reaction mediated by mRNA. We also demonstrate that these processes proceed independently within each artificial cell compartment, maintaining the correspondence between genotype and phenotype. The modular configuration of these artificial organelles could be extended to other enzymatic reactions. Coupled with the ease of manufacturing these artificial cells, which only requires simple agitation in an all-aqueous mixture, this approach provides a practical and accessible tool for exploring complex systems of artificial organelles within large ensembles of artificial cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

The study highlights two distinct periods: pre-COVID-19 and post-mask mandate. We used pediatric hospitalization records from January 2015 to December 2019 and March 2023 to February 2024 to reveal a notable rebound in respiratory viruses.

Moreover, the adenovirus infection in younger children was more prominent, while RSV expanded its prevalence to older children aged>6 years old and raised health concerns. The study underscores the potential long-term impacts of interrupted virus exposure on children's immune development and the need for vigilant monitoring of respiratory virus trends.

Actin function is regulated in part by posttranslational modifications. One such modification in non-muscle cells is arginylation, in which an arginine residue is added to the N-terminus of {beta}-actin. What is the structure of arginylated {beta}-actin (R-{beta}-actin), are its interactions with other proteins altered and what phenotypes result when R-{beta}-actin is the sole actin isoform present in the cell? Here we report the 4.2 [A] structure of ADP-bound human R-{beta}-actin filaments, the overall structure of which is nearly identical to the filaments made of non-arginylated actin. In vitro functional assays using isoform-pure actins with defined post-translational modifications reveal that the interaction between myosin-II and actin is altered upon actin arginylation, due to frequent detachment of myosin-II from R-actin filaments. In vivo, we find that replacement of the only actin gene in Schizosaccharomyces pombe with a synthetic gene encoding R-Sp-actin reduces Arp2/3-based actin patches while thickening the formin-induced actin. Furthermore, consistent with altered interactions between myosin-II and R-actin filaments, the assembly and constriction of cytokinetic actomyosin ring are perturbed in the R-Sp-actin cells. Thus, despite the overall structural similarity of arginylated and non-arginylated actin filaments, actin arginylation affects actin filament assortment into distinct subcellular structures and its interaction with myosin II.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

To simultaneously monitor different types of proteins at the single-molecule level, orthogonal fluorescent labeling methods with different photostable dyes are required. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a major class of drug targets, are prototypical membrane receptors that have been studied using single-molecule imaging techniques. Here we developed a method for labeling cell-surface GPCRs inspired by the HiBiT system, which utilizes the high affinity complementation between LgBiT and HiBiT fragments of the NanoLuc luciferase. We synthesized four fluorescence-labeled HiBiT peptides (F-FiBiTs) with a different color dye (Setau-488, TMR, SaraFluor 650 and SaraFluor 720). We constructed a multicolor total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy system that allows us to track four color dyes simultaneously. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we labeled an N-terminally LgBiT-fused GPCR (Lg-GPCR) with a mixture of the four F-FiBiTs and successfully tracked each dye within a cell at the single molecule level. The F-FiBiT-labeled Lg-GPCRs showed agonist-dependent changes in the diffusion dynamics and accumulation into the clathrin-coated pits as observed with a conventional method using a C-terminally HaloTag-fused GPCR. Taking advantage of luciferase complementation by the F-FiBiT and Lg-GPCRs, the F-FiBiT was also applicable to bioluminescence plate-reader-based assays. By combining existing labeling methods such as HaloTag, SNAP-tag, and fluorescent proteins, the F-FiBiT method will be useful for multicolor single-molecule imaging and will enhance our understanding of GPCR signaling at the single-molecule level.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

These regions, formed by highly similar tandem arrays, pose significant challenges for experimental and informatic study, impeding sequence-level descriptions essential for understanding genetic variation. Here, we report the assembly and variation analysis of such repetitive regions in Drosophila melanogaster, offering significant improvements to the existing community reference assembly. Our work successfully recovers previously elusive segments, including complete reconstructions of the histone locus and the pericentric heterochromatin of the X chromosome, spanning the Stellate locus to the distal flank of the rDNA cluster. To infer structural changes in these regions where alignments are often not practicable, we introduce landmark anchors based on unique variants that are putatively orthologous. These regions display considerable structural variation between different D. melanogaster strains, exhibiting differences in copy number and organization of homologous repeat units between haplotypes. In the histone cluster, although we observe minimal genetic exchange indicative of crossing over, the variation patterns suggest mechanisms such as unequal sister chromatid exchange. We also examine the prevalence and scale of concerted evolution in the histone and Stellate clusters and discuss the mechanisms underlying these observed patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

Beyond environmental factors, intragenomic conflict between genes inherited from the mother (matrigenes) versus the father (patrigenes) is also hypothesized to generate this plasticity. In honey bees, the Kinship Theory of Intragenomic Conflict predicts selection on patrigenes to enhance traits that result in fitness gained through reproduction, and thus patrigenes should favor the queen caste fate. Here, we conducted allele-specific transcriptome analyses on queen-destined larvae (QL) and worker-destined larvae (WL) at 192 hours post-fertilization (hpf), a critical stage for caste determination. Our findings reveal hundreds of genes with parent-of-origin effects (POEs), with significant patrigene-biased transcription in QL. Genes with POEs in honey bees resemble imprinted genes in other taxa in terms of genomic clustering, recombination rate, intron length and CpG density, and a subset are maintained from 24hpf eggs. Previous studies demonstrated that DNA methylation, the canonical regulatory mechanism underlying transcriptional POEs in placental mammals, angiosperms, and some insects, is not operating in honey bees or other social insects. We use allele-specific ChIP-seq analyses to demonstrate that POEs on caste-specific histone post-translational modification (HPTM) profiles of H3K27me3, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac are associated with POEs on transcription. Together, these findings suggest that parent-of-origin intragenomic conflicts may contribute broadly to phenotypic plasticity and may be associated with HPTMs, suggesting a ""non-canonical"" genomic imprinting-like system in social insects.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

This technique confirmed known long-range dynein and kinesin transport of peripheral VIFs and uncovered extensive bidirectional VIF motion within the perinuclear vimentin network, a region we had thought too densely bundled to permit such motility. To examine the nanoscale organization of perinuclear vimentin, we acquired high-resolution electron microscopy volumes of a vitreously frozen cell and reconstructed VIFs and microtubules within a ~50 um3 window.

Despite the need for speed, animals appear to only slowly learn to associate rewarded actions with predictive cues1-4. This slow learning is thought to be supported by a gradual expansion of predictive cue representation in the sensory cortex2,5. However, evidence is growing that animals learn more rapidly than classical performance measures suggest6-8, challenging the prevailing model of sensory cortical plasticity. Here, we investigated the relationship between learning and sensory cortical representations. We trained mice on an auditory go/no-go task that dissociated the rapid acquisition of task contingencies (learning) from its slower expression (performance) 7. Optogenetic silencing demon-strated that the auditory cortex (AC) drives both rapid learning and slower performance gains but becomes dispensable at expert. Rather than enhancement or expansion of cue representations9, two-photon calcium imaging of AC excitatory neurons throughout learning revealed two higher-order signals that were causal to learning and performance. First, a reward prediction (RP) signal emerged rapidly within tens of trials, was present after action-related errors only early in training, and faded at expert levels. Strikingly, silencing at the time of the RP signal impaired rapid learning, suggesting it serves an associative and teaching role. Second, a distinct cell ensemble encoded and controlled licking suppression that drove the slower performance improvements. These two ensembles were spatially clustered but uncoupled from underlying sensory representations, indicating a higher-order functional segregation within AC. Our results reveal that the sensory cortex manifests higher-order computations that separably drive rapid learning and slower performance improvements, reshaping our understanding of the fundamental role of the sensory cortex.

Despite the value of rapid learning in ecological environments, most laboratory models of rodent learning show that linking sensory cues with reinforced actions is a slow, gradual process1-4,10. An alternative view suggests that animals, including humans, rapidly infer relationships between cues, actions, and reinforcement (i.e. learning)6 even if they continue to make ongoing performance errors 7,8,11. Recent behavioral studies in rodents have begun to reconcile these views, arguing that latent task knowledge (i.e. discriminative contingencies) can emerge rapidly even though behavioral performance appears to improve only gradually7. How are these two dissociable behavioral processes--rapid acquisition of contingencies versus slower performance improvements--implemented in the brain?

An attractive brain region to consider is the sensory cortex as it is thought to subserve instrumental learning by enhancing or attenuating the representation of sensory cues that drive behavior. Plasticity of cue-related responses in the sensory cortex is thought to subserve learning as it mirrors the slow and gradual improvements in behavioral performance 1,2,5,10. This raises a fundamental challenge: if animals learn discriminative contingencies rapidly but cue representations in the sensory cortex change slowly1,2,9, the causal model linking cue-related plasticity to learning becomes problematic. One possible solution is that the sensory cortex plays a role beyond cue-related representational plasticity and directly represents high-order signals that associate reinforced actions with predictive cues. Here we focus on the auditory cortex (AC) and asked whether and how it plays a higher-order role in cue-guided learning.

We trained head-fixed, water-restricted mice to lick to a target tone (S+) for water reward and to withhold licking to a foil tone (S-) to avoid a timeout (auditory go/no-go task, Fig. 1a). We used simple pure tones to prevent the AC from being recruited for complex sensory processing. To confirm this, two-photon imaging of AC excitatory neurons showed that stimulus identity could accurately be decoded from AC activity from the first training day with no subsequent improvement throughout training (Supplementary Figure 1), suggesting that the AC was indeed not needed for perceptual sharpening in the task and thereby allowing us to identify possible associative functions. Performance was evaluated in each session in reinforced and non-reinforced ( probe) trials (Fig. 1b). Performance in probe trials revealed a rapid acquisition of task contingency knowledge which was only expressed much later in reinforced trials (Fig. 1c)7. Reinforcement feedback, although critical for learning, paradoxically masked the underlying task knowledge. By combining this behavioral procedure with optogenetics and longitudinal two-photon imaging, we aimed to determine how quickly animals learn stimulus-action contingencies and to define the fundamental role of the auditory cortex in sound-guided learning.

C_FIG The auditory cortex is the default pathway for sound-guided learningLesion studies have suggested that the AC may not be essential to learn or execute cue-guided tasks with simple sensory stimuli12-15. However, permanent lesions cannot determine whether the AC is normally used for, or causally produces16, learning in an intact brain. To address this, we exploited a transient silencing approach to prevent the recruitment of alternative pathways15,17-20 while also using a probabilistic design to allow assessment of learning as distinct from performance by measuring behavior on non-silenced trials, thereby avoiding direct effects of silencing on performance.

We examined the impact of bilateral cortical silencing of the AC throughout learning (Fig. 1a). We probabilistically silenced the AC on 90% of reinforced trials throughout learning ( light-on reinforced, Fig. 1d), leaving 10% of reinforced ( light-off reinforced) and 100% of probe trials ( light-off probe) with intact AC activity. Silenced trials were pseudo-randomly sequenced and equally split between S+ and S-. Silencing was achieved by shining blue light bilaterally through cranial windows implanted above the AC of double transgenic mice (n=8) expressing channel rhodopsin (ChR2) in parvalbumin (PV) interneurons14,21 (Fig. 1d). We confirmed that the excitatory network was effectively silenced using this approach by combining two-photon calcium imaging of excitatory neurons and full-field optogenetic stimulation in PV-ChR2 mice (Supplementary Figure 2). Control mice (n=8) received the same light stimulation but did not express ChR2. This experimental design allowed us to assay the impact of cortical silencing on performance (control vs PV-ChR2 performance on light-on reinforced trials) versus acquisition learning (control vs PV-ChR2 performance on light-off probe trials) and expression learning (control vs PV-ChR2 performance on light-off reinforced trials) (Fig. 1e).

Note that no fluorescence below the dura is detected in control mice.

C_FIG We first compared performance in light-on reinforced trials between PV-ChR2 and control mice (Fig. 1e) and observed a large performance impairment in PV-ChR2 mice (Fig. 1f,g). To address whether this performance reduction was accompanied by an impairment in rapid learning, we compared performance in PV-ChR2 and control animals in light-off probe trials (Fig. 1e,h-k) when the AC was not silenced and knowledge acquisition can be accurately measured7. Accuracy was lower during probe trials in PV-ChR2 mice (Fig. 1h), with delayed S+-response learning (Fig. 1i), lower discrimination (Fig. 1j), and longer lick latency on hit trials (Fig. 1k). Rapid acquisition of task knowledge was therefore impaired in PV-ChR2 mice.

Accuracy was also lower in reinforced light-off trials in PV-ChR2 mice (Fig. 1l,m). This remained true even after controlling for their slower task acquisition (Figs.1n, Supplementary Figure 3a-c). These impairments were also apparent in response latency and response vigor (Supplementary Figure 4). Together, these results suggest that the AC is the default pathway for sound-guided reward learning, even when not needed for perceptual sharpening.

The auditory cortex is used during learning but becomes dispensable at expert levelsWe next sought to understand the contribution of AC activity for the expression of the learned behavior as animals transitioned to expert performance. Transient inactivation of auditory cortex in expert animals has led to conflicting results, with some reports showing degradation of sound-guided behavior14,17,22,23 and others not14,24,25. We exploited our probabilistic silencing strategy and compared performance in light-on (AC silenced) versus light-off (AC functional) reinforced trials within subjects (Fig. 1o). Performance on these two trial types was similar at early periods of training, as performance was poor overall (Fig. 1p). As training progressed, performance remained poor on light-on trials but improved on light-off trials (Fig. 1p), demonstrating that the AC is used for task performance at early and intermediate time-point during learning. Surprisingly, this deficit in performance on light-on trials gradually waned (Fig. 1p,q), suggesting that while the AC was used during learning, it became dispensable once the mice had mastered the task.

These results could be explained by three alternative explanations. First, the optogenetic manipulation per se may not be interfering with a task-relevant process but instead could be  distracting the animal, necessitating more time to increase performance in light-on trials. We reasoned that bilateral silencing of another cortical region that is nominally unrelated to the task would serve as an important control. We bilaterally silenced the visual cortex throughout learning in PV-ChR2 mice and found no evidence of performance impairment in light-on trials (Supplementary Figure 5), demonstrating that the performance impairment was specific to AC silencing. Second, it is possible that AC silencing altered tone perception, increasing task difficulty at the perceptual level in light-on trials. Third, the reduction of impairment during light-on trials could be driven by a reduction of the silencing effect with time due, for example, to brain damage induced by repeated silencing. To address the second and third possibilities, we trained a separate cohort of PV-ChR2 mice without daily inactivation and, instead, inactivated the AC only after they reached expert performance (see Methods). We observed no impact from AC silencing (Figs.1r, Supplementary Figure 6)14.

C_FIG Altogether, these results show that the AC is engaged during learning but is dispensable at expert levels, potentially tutoring subcortical structures that take over once the associations are learned.

Unsupervised discovery of learning-related dynamics by low-rank tensor decompositionWe next sought to understand the nature and dynamics of auditory cortical activity underlying learning and performance. To do so, we performed longitudinal, two-photon calcium imaging of thousands of excitatory neurons in mice learning the auditory go/no-go task (n = 5). A separate group of water-restricted mice was passively exposed to two pure tones over the same duration but with no association with reinforcement (n = 3, see Methods; Supplementary Figure 7). This design allowed us to use the passive network as a base-case model to isolate learning-related neural dynamics.

Tonotopic mapping (tuning curve session) of the auditory cortex took place 5 days later under the two-photon microscope, followed by two days of lick training under the two-photon microscope. These two sessions also allowed for habituation to head fixation and context. Behavior sessions started the following day for 15 or 16 days, after which tonotopic mapping sessions took place at day +1, +7 and +15 post learning. b, One behavioral session consisted of three blocks of 80 or 100 trials, and a baseline session (no tone presented). Two groups of mice were imaged under the two-photon microscope: the Passive group (top; n = 3) was presented with two pure tones but was never rewarded (lick tube out), and the Learning group (n = 5) was rewarded (3{micro}l water drop) if licking in the response window after the S+ tone. Two probe blocks of 10 trials each were introduced in two of the three reinforced blocks. c, Trial structure. After a no-lick period of 1s, a 100-ms tone was played, followed by a 200-ms dead period and a[&le;] 2.5s response period. The length of the delay period was of 2s after a miss (M, no lick after S+) or a correct reject (CR, no lick after S-), 4s after a hit (H, lick after S+) and 7s after a false alarm (FA, lick after S-).

C_FIG We expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f under the CaMKII pro-moter, targeting AC layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. We imaged two planes[~] 50{micro}m apart (Fig. 2a), allowing us to record simultaneously hundreds of neurons per animal (n=7,137 neurons in 8 mice). All mice were passively presented with a series of pure tones (4 to 64kHz, quarter-octave spaced) to characterize auditory tuning properties within the local area of expression. We computed single-neuron tuning curves and then constructed a  best frequency map confirming the location in the AC (Fig. 2b). For each mouse, we chose two stimuli that were similarly represented in the recorded population and were 3/4 octaves apart (Fig. 2c). We used a custom head-fixation system that allowed for kinematic registration and tracked the activity of the same neurons across weeks, including pre- and post-learning tuning curve sessions (n = 4, 643 neurons in 8 mice, see Methods; Fig. 2d-g).

C_FIG From this high-dimensional dataset, we sought to identify single neurons and neuronal ensembles carrying learning-related information, resolve stimulus and non-stimulus related activity within a given trial, identify changes in representation across trials, and determine outcome-specific dynamics. To do so, we organized our data into a 4-dimensional array containing neurons x time in trial x trials across learning x trial outcome (Fig. 2h). To identify shared and distinct variability in neuronal populations recorded in passive mice (n = 2, 339,  passive network) and in learning mice (n = 2, 304,  learning network), we created a  megamouse by combining data from all mice and aligning neural activity to learning phase (n=4,643 neurons, see Methods; Fig. 2i; Supplementary Figure 8). We then used low-rank tensor decomposition to allow unsupervised identification of demixed, low-dimensional neural dynamics across multiple (> 2) dimensions26,27 (Supplementary Figure 9 and Supplementary Figure 10a,b; see Methods). The tensor decomposition revealed six neuronal dynamics, each characterized by the four factors of the original tensor (see Methods; Figs.2j, Supplementary Figure 10c,d, Supplementary Figure 11d). These six dynamics represented independent computations performed by the auditory cortical networks.

C_FIG Projecting the product of the decomposition into principal component subspace showed that learning and passive networks exhibit almost orthogonal dynamics (Fig. 2k; Supplementary Figure 10f,g) and that the neural dynamics of different trial types evolved further apart in the learning network than in the passive network (Supplementary Figure 10h,i). Importantly, we ensured that the identified dynamics were not driven by isolated mice (Supplementary Figure 10e). Therefore, decomposition of the megamouse tensor discovered distinct dynamics exhibited by passive versus learning networks.

For further analyses, we attributed each dynamic to individual neurons based on the neurons maximum weight ( unique participation; Fig. 2l; see Methods and Supplementary Figure 11). This allowed us to map the six dynamics onto six distinct cell ensembles, i.e. groups of neurons maximally encoding a particular network-specific dynamic (Fig. 2m and Supplementary Figure 11d). It is important to note that individual neurons (and corresponding ensembles) could exhibit mixed selectivity for the six dynamics, which allows an individual neurons to contribute to multiple, independent computations (Fig. 2n).

Learning counteracts tone-evoked habituation by maintaining stimulus selectivity in distinct cell populationsA prevailing view in sensory systems holds that sensory cortices subserve associative learning through plasticity of the cue representation5,28-36. This model posits that individual neurons (via changes in sensory tuning) and neural populations (via cortical map expansion) enhance the representation of behaviorally relevant cues for use by downstream regions37-39. These studies, however, measure neural tuning and map expansion outside of the task context in a  pre and  post learning design and infer that plasticity of cue representations reflects the mechanistic role of the sensory cortex. To assess this model, we initially focused on the cell ensembles that exhibited classical stimulus-evoked activity (Fig. 2j), namely cell ensembles 1-4.

We observed a prominent signature of stimulus-evoked habituation over hundreds to thousands of trials. This habituation dominated activity in passive networks, as seen in cell ensembles 1 and 2 which represented[~] 77% (1, 803/2, 339) of all passive cells (Fig. 3a,d). These neurons exhibited stimulus-evoked activation (cell ensemble 1) or suppression (cell ensemble 2), both of which decreased in amplitude over time (Fig. 3b-c,e-f). These cell ensembles were not stimulus selective and displayed the same dynamic in both stimulus 1 (S1) and stimulus 2 (S2) trials (Fig. 3b,e). These ensembles thus reflected the broad-based suppression of non-selective neurons after long-term repeated presentation of the same sounds.

C_FIG

Stimulus-evoked responses in learning networks were observed in cell ensembles 3 and 4 (Fig. 3g-j). This includes a high selectivity for the S- (cell ensemble 3) or S+ (cell ensemble 4) cues (Fig. 3g-j). Cell ensemble 3 consisted of 19% of the Learning cell population (Fig. 3g), and displayed a slight habituation but mainly a strong preference for the S- throughout learning (Fig. 3h), while cell ensemble 4 (12% of total learning cells; Fig. 3j) exhibited S+ selectivity throughout learning (Fig. 3j). Cell ensembles 3 and 4 were more tone responsive and tone selective than cell ensembles 1 and 2 (Fig. 3k,l). Stimulus-evoked activity analyses across days of all recorded neurons (n = 7, 137) also support these results (Supplementary Figure 12, Supplementary Figure 13). Therefore, learning counteracted tone-evoked habituation by maintaining distinct ensembles that encoded either the S+ or S- selectively.

C_FIG Learning was not associated with cortical map expansionTo directly test representational expansion and tuning shifts, we conducted a series of analyses focusing on stimulus-evoked responses before (pre-task) and after (post-task) learning, akin to classical measures of tuning and tonotopy. We computed the change in surface area occupied by S+ and S- preferring cells in tuning curve sessions, outside the task (Fig. 3m). Surprisingly, we observed no increase in the map-level representation of the S+ or S- after learning, and instead, observed a modest decrease (Fig. 3m-n). In addition to the best frequency representation, the fraction of neurons responding to the S+ and S- decreased (Fig. 3o) and the response amplitude of neurons that were initially tuned to the S+ and S- was lower after learning (Fig. 3p). Interestingly, while we observed no increase in representation to the S+ and S-, learning networks favored the representation of frequencies in between S+ and S-, but not higher or lower as seen in passive networks (Fig. 3n). Finally, using our passive networks as a base-case comparison, we calculated the local changes in the tonotopic map structure (Fig. 3q). Learning networks were surprisingly stable and exhibited less local changes than passive networks (Fig. 3r). These pre- vs post-learning changes in responsiveness and tonotopy thus mirrored the responsiveness observed online during learning (in dynamics 1 and 2) in a stable, tracked network (n=4,643 neurons, Fig. 3a-l), as well as when we include all neurons from each session (n=7,137 neurons) (Supplementary Figure 13). Altogether, our results suggest that cortical map expansion and changes in single-neuron tuning are unlikely to be the substrate for associative learning40,41.

Tone-restricted silencing only partially impairs learning and performanceWe next sought to understand the extent to which the maintenance of stimulus-selectivity by learning networks was important to learning and performing the task. We performed daily bilateral silencing of AC during stimulus presentation throughout learning (Supplementary Figure 14a). Tone-restricted AC silencing impaired task performance throughout learning (Supplementary Figure 14b-e), task acquisition (Supplementary Figure 14f-i), and online performance during learning, with gradual fading of the effect at expert performance (Supplementary Figure 14n-q). Accuracy and action rate were not affected in reinforced light-off trials (Supplementary Figure 14j-k), but PV-ChR2 mice lick more and faster to the S- (Supplementary Figure 14l-m), suggesting that tone-restricted AC silencing also impaired expression, but to a lesser extent than full-trial silencing. Altogether, these results showed that information carried by the AC network in the tone-evoked window is used during learning. Interestingly, tone-restricted silencing impacted learning less than full trial silencing across nearly all measures (Fig. 1, Supplementary Figure 14), suggesting that activity after the tone-evoked window was critical for rapid contingency acquisition and performance during learning.

C_FIG Rapid emergence of reward prediction activity in the auditory cortexThe sensory cortex is widely considered to be specialized for perception by interpreting complex sensory objects42,43 or adjusting representations of behaviorally-relevant stimuli2,33,37,44,45. Recent evidence, however, suggests that sensory cortical neurons directly encode non-sensory variables such as movement46-49, reward timing50-53, expectation54,55, and context23,45,56-63. Conjoint representations of sensory and non-sensory variables in the same network could further hone perception or, alternatively, subserve more integrative associative processes.

Inspection of the within-trial dynamics of learning-driven cell ensembles 5 and 6 suggested that these neurons exhibited non-canonical activity in the form of a signal that occurred late in the trial, delayed from the tone-evoked response (Fig. 2j). This late-in-trial signal increased over learning and was trial type selective (Fig. 2j). We next sought to further explore the encoding properties of these two cell ensembles. Cell ensemble 5 (n = 155 cells from the learning network), exhibited late-in-trial activity on hit trials (licking to the S+) that increased with learning (Fig. 4a). This delayed activity was not apparent on correct S-trials (correct reject, CR), where neurons exhibited classical stimulus-evoked response that habituated over learning (Fig. 4b).

C_FIG To understand the nature of the late-in-trial activity, we exploited our multiple trial types to disambiguate the contribution of sensory, motor, and reward signals. To assess whether the late-in-trial signal was a delayed form of sensory activity, we compared activity in hit trials to activity in trials where the same stimulus was presented but the mice did not lick and did not get rewarded (miss trials, Figs.1a and 4c-e). To ensure an appropriate comparison between hit and miss trials, we generated a balanced set of trials that were matched in number (given that miss trials were less frequent) and occurred within the same time period (given that the signal amplitude evolved with learning) (Supplementary Figure 15a). Cell ensemble 5 did not exhibit late-in-trial activity on miss trials (Fig. 4c-e), discarding the possibility that it reflected a delayed sensory response. We then asked whether this activity reflected reward consumption. We compared cell ensemble activity during hit trials in the reinforced context to the activity during hit trials in the probe context (Fig. 4f), where the mice expected reward and thus correctly licked to the S+ but the reward was omitted (Fig. 1b). We matched the number of trials between reinforced and probe contexts and controlled for within-session and across-session changes by comparing probe hit trials to reinforced hit trials immediately before and after the probe block (Fig. 4f). Strikingly, late-in-trial activity was preserved in probe trials (Fig. 4g,h), indicating that it did not reflect reward consumption. Finally, although movement has been reported to decrease auditory cortical activity46,64-66, we sought to understand the degree to which this late-in-trial signal could be driven by licking itself. To do this, we first exploited probe hit trials where the lick rate was strongly reduced compared to reinforced hit trials (Fig. 4i,j). We observed no difference in the late-in-trial neural signal and could thus conclude that the signal was not due to ongoing licking (Fig. 4i,j). Second, we tested the possibility that this late-in-trial signal was driven by the initiation of a lick bout as compared to the ongoing licking activity. We isolated spontaneous lick bouts in between training blocks and observed that the cell ensemble was not lick-responsive (Supplementary Figure 15b,c). In addition, if lick initiation drove this activity, we would also expect to see it on false alarm trials (incorrect licking to the S-). For this analysis, we focused on false alarms that occurred after task acquisition, as these errors are unlikely to be errors due to imperfect task knowledge. We observed no systematic late-in-trial activity on these trials (Supplementary Figure 15d) even though the licking pattern in false alarm trials was similar to that during probe hit trials (Supplementary Figure 15e). Taken together, the late-in-trial activity did not reflect stimulus, reward consumption, licking, nor lick initiation. Instead, these results showed that cell ensemble 5 encoded the higher-order process of reward prediction (RP).

We next sought to identify the precise moment when a contingency is formed by identifying the trials when this reward prediction signal emerged. Initially, these neurons exhibited classical tone-evoked responses but then abruptly and within only 40 hit trials, developed a robust reward prediction activity (Fig. 4k, Supplementary Figure 15f). This reward prediction signal continued to develop over Acquisition, strengthened during Expression, and then surprisingly receded at Expert level when learning is nominally complete (Fig. 4a,l, Supplementary Figure 15g). This longitudinal temporal dynamic mirrored our optogenetic results which demonstrates that the AC is the default pathway for learning but then becomes dispensable at expert levels. Altogether, these results show that a reward prediction signal rapidly emerges at the timescale of Acquisition in auditory cortical networks.

Revealing the underlying cognitive drivers of errorsIdentifying the cognitive drivers of errors is particularly challenging during learning 4. Errors during learning are typically considered  mistakes while discriminative contingencies (task knowledge) are still forming. However, errors arise not only from knowledge-related mistakes (for which animals incorrectly expect reward), but also from factors such as impulsivity, disengagement, and exploration (for which animals do not expect reward). While detailed behavioral inspection has been a promising route to uncover the nature of errors11, an alternative approach is to use neural activity itself. Given our findings of reward prediction encoding on correct trials, we hypothesized that the same signal would be present when animals make  knowledge-related errors, when animals incorrectly  expected rewards on S- trials. To address this, we first focused on the occasional false alarms (FA) that occurred during probe trials, as they reflected errors of task knowledge (Fig. 4m)7. Strikingly, we observed a robust reward prediction activity in these trials (Fig. 4n), strongly suggesting that animals were indeed expecting reward. We next reasoned that such knowledge errors should be present not only on probe trials, but also in a subset of reinforced trials, interspersed with non-knowledge errors. We classified individual FA trials in the reinforced context based on the presence of a reward prediction signal (see Methods; Supplementary Figure 16a). We identified a significant proportion of trials that exhibited robust reward prediction activity, but also many that did not (Fig. 4o, Supplementary Figure 16b). The reward prediction signal was identical to that observed in probe trials (Fig. 4o, Supplementary Figure 16d), providing further confidence that these were indeed knowledge errors. These data suggest that we could isolate knowledge errors using neural data, which was not possible from behavioral inspection alone (Supplementary Figure 16c). Interestingly, we found that knowledge errors were interspersed with errors that did not elicit reward prediction activity (Fig. 4p). Finally, we hypothesized that knowledge errors should predominantly occur during the Acquisition phase of behavior, when animals are still learning the discriminative contingencies. We computed the fraction of RP+ (knowledge-related errors) and RP-(non-knowledge errors) over time and found that RP+ errors peaked during the Acquisition phase of learning, and rarel","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

The mechanisms that drive persistence within minimal residual disease (MRD) remain poorly understood and therefore untargeted. Utilizing 13 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and clinical trial specimens of Ph+ ALL, we examined how genetic and transcriptional features co-evolve to drive progression during prolonged TKI response. Our work reveals a landscape of cooperative mutational and transcriptional escape mechanisms that differ from those causing resistance to first generation TKIs. By analyzing MRD during remission, we show that the same resistance mutation can either increase or decrease cellular fitness depending on transcriptional state. We further demonstrate that directly targeting transcriptional state-associated vulnerabilities at MRD can overcome BCR::ABL1 independence, suggesting a new paradigm for rationally eradicating MRD prior to relapse. Finally, we illustrate how cell mass measurements of leukemia cells can be used to rapidly monitor dominant transcriptional features of Ph+ ALL to help rationally guide therapeutic selection from low-input samples.

LRRK2 phosphorylates Rab GTPases within the Switch II domain whilst PINK1 directly phosphorylates Parkin and ubiquitin and indirectly induces phosphorylation of a subset of Rab GTPases. Herein we have crossed LRRK2 [R1441C] mutant knock-in mice with PINK1 knock-out (KO) mice and report that loss of PINK1 does not impact endogenous mutant LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation or vice versa. In addition, we observe that a pool of the Rab-specific, PPM1H phosphatase, is transcriptionally up-regulated and recruited to damaged mitochondria, independent of PINK1 or LRRK2 activity. Parallel signalling of LRRK2 and PINK1 pathways is supported by assessment of motor behavioural studies that show no evidence of genetic interaction in crossed mouse lines. Previously we showed loss of cilia in LRRK2 [R1441C] mice and herein we show that PINK1 KO mice exhibit a ciliogenesis defect in striatal cholinergic interneurons and astrocytes that interferes with Hedgehog induction of glial derived-neurotrophic factor (GDNF) transcription. This is not exacerbated in double mutant LRRK2 and PINK1 mice. Overall, our analysis indicates that LRRK2 activation or loss of PINK1 function along parallel pathways to impair ciliogenesis, suggesting a convergent mechanism towards PD.

In line with the pre-registered hypotheses, conflict and conflict adaptation effects were preserved during both altered arousal states. Overall task performance was markedly poorer during low arousal, but not for high arousal. Modelling behavioural dynamics with drift-diffusion analysis revealed evidence accumulation and non-decision time decelerated, and decisional boundaries became wider during low arousal, whereas high arousal was unexpectedly associated with a decrease in the interference of task-irrelevant information processing. These findings show how arousal differentially modulates cognitive control at both sides of normal alertness, and further validates drowsiness and physical exercise as key experimental models to disentangle the interaction between physiological fluctuations on cognitive dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

The mono-allelic CSF1R mutation causes adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), a lethal neurological disease and no rational cure in clinical trials. There are no animal models mimicking human ALSP. In this study, we first developed mouse models based on human ALSP hotspot mutations. We then utilized microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (Mr BMT) to replace the Csf1r-deficient microglia in ALSP mice by Csf1r-normal donor cells. With pathogenic gene correction, Mr BMT efficiently attenuated the pathologies. Previously, an ALSP patient received traditional bone marrow transplantation (tBMT) due to a misdiagnosis of metachromatic leukodystrophy. The disease progress was halted for 15 years with unknown reasons. We demonstrated that tBMT in ALSP is equivalent to or close to Mr BMT, achieving efficient microglia replacement and therefore attenuating the ALSP progress in the mouse model. Next, we applied tBMT to replace CSF1R-deficient microglia in human patients. Our clinical results show that after microglia replacement, the ALSP course is effectively halted.

However, the high-yield biochemical isolation and visualization of endogenous NLGNs have been hampered by the lack of efficient antibodies to these proteins. Thus, to reveal their sub-cellular distribution, binding partners, and synaptic function, NLGNs have been extensively manipulated using knock-down, knock-out, or over-expression approaches, overall leading to controversial results. As an alternative to the manipulation of NLGN expression level, we describe here the generation of a new transgenic mouse strain in which native NLGN1 was N-terminally tagged with a small biotin acceptor peptide (bAP) that can be enzymatically biotinylated by the exogenous delivery of biotin ligase. After showing that knock-in mice exhibit normal behavior as well as similar synaptic number, ultrastructure, transmission properties, and protein expression levels when compared to wild type counterparts, we exploited the fact that biotinylated bAP-NLGN1 can be selectively isolated or visualized using high-affinity streptavidin conjugates. Using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, we show that bAP-NLGN1 binds both PSD-95 and gephyrin and distributes equally well at excitatory and inhibitory synapses, challenging the historical view that NLGN1 is exclusively localized at excitatory synapses. Using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy, we further highlight that bAP-NLGN1 forms in the synaptic cleft a subset of nanodomains each containing a few NLGN1 dimers, while the number of nanodomains per synapse positively scales with the post-synapse size. Overall, our study not only provides a novel, extensively characterized transgenic mouse model which will be made available to the scientific community, but also an unprecedented view of the nanoscale organization of endogenous NLGN1.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

Carefully controlled experiments have suggested that populations of neurons in cortical auditory regions track temporal modulations within rhythmic acoustic signals, physiologically supporting perception of both music and speech. However, whether cortical tracking of music and speech extends to less controlled (i.e., naturalistic) signals remains contentious. Here, we investigated whether cortical tracking can be observed under more natural perceptual scenarios, and how stimulus type, frequency band or anatomical localization modulates this effect. We analyzed intracranial recordings from 30 subjects while they passively watched a movie where visual scenes were accompanied by either music or speech stimuli. Cross-correlation between brain and acoustic signals, along with density-based clustering analyses and linear mixed effect modeling, revealed both anatomically overlapping and functionally distinct mapping of the tracking effect as a function of stimulus type and frequency band. We observed widespread tracking of music and speech signals in the Slow Frequency Band (1-8Hz), with near zero temporal lags and high mixed-selectivity. In contrast, High Frequency Band (70-120Hz) tracking was higher during speech perception, was more densely concentrated in classical language processing areas, and showed a clear frontal-to-temporal gradient in lag values that was not observed during perception of musical stimuli. Our results highlight the recruitment of domain-general and domain-specific mechanisms during perception of naturalistic music and speech signals, as well as a complex interaction between cortical region and frequency band that shapes temporal dynamics during processing of hierarchically organized temporal structures in speech.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

This unique dimeric ATPase is proposed to drive the gliding motility. However, the mechanisms of force generation and transmission remain unclear. Here we present a 3.2 [A] resolution structure of the dimeric ATPase complex obtained by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM). The structure reveals an assembly distinct from known dimeric forms of F1Fo-ATPase, despite containing conserved F1-ATPase structures.

Under elevated temperatures, plant immunity is downregulated, putting them at risk of foliar pathogen attack. Manipulating plant defense hormones is one way to mitigate this detrimental effect. However, it is unclear how plant immunity interacts with plant microbiome assembly and how temperature will thus affect overall plant health and stability. We used chemical mutagenesis to identify a phenotypically healthy genotype of A. thaliana, CLLF, that compared to the wild type naturally recruits an altered leaf bacteriome, including unusually high bacteria loads. Simultaneously, CLLF hyperaccumulates salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonates, has constitutively upregulated systemic and innate defenses, and has increased resistance to necrotrophic fungal and hemi-biotrophic bacterial pathogens, indicating that pathogen immunity and non-pathogen recruitment function in parallel. Growth of specific non-pathogenic leaf bacteria on SA as a carbon source suggests the same hormones may even link the two processes. CLLF also showed high tolerance to heat stress in comparison to the wild type, but SA-associated defense processes are not downregulated under heat. Synthetic community (SynCom) experiments showed that when the taxonomic diversity of bacteria available to CLLF is artificially reduced, resilience to heat stress is compromised, leading to dysbiosis, but this does not occur with the full SynCom or in the wild type with any SynCom. Thus, the downregulation of defenses in response to heat may contribute to avoidance of dysbiosis caused by some leaf bacteria, but full bacteriome taxonomic diversity can restore balance.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

However, studies investigating the effects of environmental variation on mosquito traits have investigated environmental factors in isolation or in laboratory experiments that examine constant environmental conditions that often do not occur in the field. To address these limitations, we conducted a semi-field experiment in Athens, Georgia using the invasive Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus). We selected nine sites that spanned natural variation in impervious surface and vegetation cover to explore effects of the microclimate (temperature and humidity) on mosquitoes. On these sites, we manipulated conspecific larval density at each site. We repeated the experiment in the summer and fall. We then evaluated the effects of land cover, larval density, and time of season, as well as interactive effects, on the mean proportion of females emerging, juvenile development time, size upon emergence, and predicted per capita population growth (i.e., fitness). We found significant effects of larval density, land cover, and season on all response variables. Of most note, we saw strong interactive effects of season and intra-specific density on each response variable, including a non-intuitive decrease in development time with increasing intra-specific competition in the fall. Our study demonstrates that ignoring the interaction between variation in biotic and abiotic variables could reduce the accuracy and precision of models used to predict mosquito population and pathogen transmission dynamics, especially those inferring dynamics at finer-spatial scales across which transmission and control occur.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

We performed an array of (loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments, LC-MS/MS proteomics, X-ray diffraction) assays on vastus lateralis biopsies from diabetic patients and matched controls. Strikingly, our results highlight that the amount of muscle myosin molecules in SRX is higher and the related ATP demand lower in type II diabetes patients than in controls. These physiological changes are parallel with greater glycation levels on myosin heavy chains, and with remodelled sarcomeric proteins in the same type II diabetes patients. None of these (mal)adaptations were noticed in patients with type I diabetes. Altogether, our findings emphasize a complex molecular dysregulation of myosin SRX and ATP consumption in type II diabetes. Ultimately, pharmacological targeting of SRX could benefit whole-body metabolic health through the enhancement of energy expenditure.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

Bile acids (BA) support fat digestion and undergo microbial metabolization in the gut. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is an important modulator of the BA homeostasis. The capacity of inhibiting cancer-related processes when activated, make FXR an appealing therapeutic target. In this work, we assess the role of diet on the microbiota-BA axis and evaluate the role of FXR in disease progression. Results: Here we show that high fat diet (HFD) accelerated tumorigenesis in L2-IL1B mice (BE- and GEAC- mouse model) while increasing BA levels and enriching gut microbiota that convert primary to secondary BA. While upregulated in BE, expression of FXR was downregulated in GEAC in mice and humans. In L2-IL1B mice, FXR knockout enhanced the dysplastic phenotype and increased Lgr5 progenitor cell numbers. Treatment of murine organoids and L2-IL1B mice with the FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) deacelerated GEAC progression. Conclusion: We provide a novel concept of GEAC carcinogenesis being accelerated via the diet- microbiome-metabolome axis and FXR inhibition on progenitor cells. Further, FXR activation protected with OCA ameliorated the phenotype in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that FXR agonists have potential as differentiation therapy in GEAC prevention.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

Central to this, are the computational approaches of de novo assembly and genome binning that enable large-scale reference-independent recovery of microbial genomes from the metagenomic sequencing data. Despite the advancements in bioinformatics approaches to address the computational challenges inherent to these tasks, the limitation of computational resources continues to be a significant barrier to harvesting the full potential of these techniques. Consequently, there is a stressed need to devise strategies involving the fine-tuning of the employed parameters for the effective utilization of the available metagenomic tools. As most of the available metagenome assembly tools are based on the de Bruijn graph framework that relies on a parameter k, selecting an appropriate subset of k-mers has become a common approach in bioinformatics for efficient computations. In this study, we propose a reduced set of k-mers, optimized to strike a balance between computational efficiency and the quality of the high- and low-complexity metagenome assemblies. Utilizing this set of k-mers with MEGAHIT reduces the metagenome assembly time by half compared to the default set, thus greatly reducing the associated computational cost. In addition, it also brings the promise to improve large-scale genome binning studies that adopt this set in the future as we observed an increase in the total number of the recovered genomes as well as obtained higher proportions of high- and medium-quality genomes recovered from the reduced k-mers-based metagenome assemblies.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

(GAA)n repeat expansions are responsible for Friedreich's ataxia as well as late-onset cerebellar ataxias (LOCAs). Thus, the mechanisms of (GAA)n repeat expansions attract broad scientific attention. To investigate the role of DNA nicks in this process, we utilized a CRISPR-Cas9 nickase system to introduce targeted nicks adjacent to the (GAA)n repeat tract. We found that DNA nicks 5' of the (GAA)100 run led to a dramatic increase in both the rate and scale of its expansion in dividing cells. Strikingly, they also promoted large-scale expansions of carrier- and large normal-size (GAA)n repeats, recreating, for the first time in a model system, the expansion events that occur in human pedigrees. DNA nicks 3' of the (GAA)100 repeat led to a smaller but significant increase in the expansion rate as well. Our genetic analysis implies that in dividing cells, conversion of nicks into double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication followed by DSB or fork repair leads to repeat expansions. Finally, we showed that 5' strand nicks increase expansion frequency in non-dividing yeast cells, albeit to a lesser extent that in dividing cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

However, anatomical and functional gradients exist. It was recently shown that receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells change their shape along the dorso-ventral retinal axis. These variations likely reflect the non-uniform statistics of the visual environment which vary dramatically from ground to sky. Horizontal cells are the first visual interneurons and dictate the synaptic signaling between photoreceptors and bipolar cells by lateral interactions, thereby shaping the receptive fields of down-stream neurons. Thus, we asked whether regional specializations are present at this earliest stage of synaptic circuitry, i.e. at the level of horizontal cells. We analyzed horizontal cell density distributions, morphological properties, localization of gap junction proteins, and the spatial extent of horizontal cell electrical coupling across complete retinas. All of these horizontal cell key features were asymmetrically organized along the dorso-ventral axis. Dorsal horizontal cells were less densely distributed, had larger dendritic trees, and electrical coupling was more extensive than in their ventral counterparts. The steepest change along this gradient occurred at the opsin transition zone of photoreceptors, i.e. the mouse visual horizon. Therefore, our results show that the cellular and synaptic organization of the mouse visual system are adapted to the visual environment at the earliest possible level, and that horizontal cells are well suited to form the cellular substrate for the global gradient previously described for the receptive field structures of retinal ganglion cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

The Lesser Antillean iguana (Iguana delicatissima) experienced a drastic range decline strongly driven by hybridization with non-native green iguanas (NNGI, Iguana iguana species complex). With numerous NNGI populations within the Lesser Antilles, it is a matter of time before these arrive on the last I. delicatisisma inhabited islands, whereupon rapid in-situ identification of non-native and hybrid animals is essential. However, only a few scale and coloration characters allow in-situ identification of NNGI, which are compromised by introgression. Here we assessed the differentiating power of an additional 20 scale and length-dependent characteristics between the I. delicatissima population on St. Eustatius and the established NNGI population on St. Maarten, the main source of arriving stowaway iguanas on St. Eustatius. We identified 14 length-dependent characteristics that significantly differ between I. delicatissima and NNGIs, with multi-variate analysis showing clear morphospace separation and high assignment accuracy of predictive models (>91%). Additionally, the number of femorals and supra digital scales significantly differs between these iguanas. Morphospace knowledge of St. Eustatius' I. delicatissima now allows rapid identification of any divergent iguanas using easy to obtain measurements and meristics. Given intraspecific variation in I. delicatissima and green iguanas, we recommend that these characteristics are assessed and validated for other populations, including hybrid individuals. Our work demonstrates the urgent need to invest in baseline morphometric datasets to aid rapid in-situ conservation efforts once NNGI arrive and start to hybridize with I. delicatissima.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

In this study, we explored the effects of a brain intraventricular injection of Abetao on OLs and myelin in the developing spinal cord of zebrafish larvae. Using quantitative fluorescent in situ RNA hybridization assays, we demonstrated that Abetao altered myrf and mbp mRNA levels and the regional distribution of mbp during larval development, suggesting an early differentiation of OLs. Through live imaging of Tg(myrf:mScarlet) and Tg(mbp:tagRFP) zebrafish lines, both crossed with Tg(olig2:EGFP), we found that Abetao increased the number of myrf+ and mbp+ OLs in the dorsal spinal cord at 72 hpf and 5 dpf, respectively, without affecting total cell numbers. Furthermore, Abetao also increased the number of myelin sheaths per OL and the number of myelinated axons in the dorsal spinal cord compared to vehicle-injected control animals. Interestingly, the treatment of Abetao-injected zebrafish with the pan-PKC inhibitor Go6983 restored the aforementioned alterations in OLs and myelin to control levels.

Recent advancements in the field offer promising avenues for exploring the interplay between renal cells and immune cells and their role in the development of renal inflammation and diseases. This study describes the establishment of a human immunocompetent 3D in vitro co-culture model of the proximal tubule in a high-throughput microfluidic platform that can be used to study renal functionality and inflammatory processes. The model incorporated RPTEC in the top compartment and HUVECs in the bottom compartment cultured under flow and in direct contact with a collagen-I ECM gel resulting in the formation of polarized tubular structures. As an immune component, human primary monocytes of different donors were added to the lumen of the endothelium. Renal inflammation was successfully induced using complement activated serum (CAS) as evident by epithelial morphological changes, increased expression of adhesion molecules, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduced epithelial viability. Realtime migratory behavior of monocytes showed increased extravasation and migration towards the ECM and Renal compartment upon exposure to CAS with donor-to-donor differences observed. Finally, immune modulatory compounds showed efficacious inhibition of monocyte migration under inflammatory conditions in the microfluidic co-culture model. A successful co-culture model was established and can be applied to study renal functionality in health and disease but also for drug screening due to the compatibility of the platform with automation and relatively high throughput. Overall, the described proximal tubule model has high potential to fill the gap that currently exists to study renal inflammation preclinically.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

These range from the benign (white eyelashes) to the deadly (respiratory failure). The Human Phenotype Ontology has categorised all human phenotypic variation into a unified framework that defines the relationships between them (e.g. missing arms and missing legs are both abnormalities of the limb). This has made it possible to perform phenome-wide analyses, e.g. to prioritise which make the best candidates for gene therapies. However, there is currently limited metadata describing the clinical characteristics / severity of these phenotypes. With >17500 phenotypic abnormalities across >8600 rare diseases, manual curation of such phenotypic annotations by experts would be exceedingly labour-intensive and time-consuming. Leveraging advances in artificial intelligence, we employed the OpenAI GPT-4 large language model (LLM) to systematically annotate the severity of all phenotypic abnormalities in the HPO. Phenotypic severity was defined using a set of clinical characteristics and their frequency of occurrence. First, we benchmarked the generative LLM clinical characteristic annotations against ground-truth labels within the HPO (e.g. phenotypes in the  Cancer HPO branch were annotated as causing cancer by GPT-4). True positive recall rates across different clinical characteristics ranged from 89-100% (mean=96%), clearly demonstrating the ability of GPT-4 to automate the curation process with a high degree of fidelity. Using a novel approach, we developed a severity scoring system that incorporates both the nature of the clinical characteristic and the frequency of its occurrence. These clinical characteristic severity metrics will enable efforts to systematically prioritise which human phenotypes are most detrimental to human health, and best targets for therapeutic intervention.","NA","medrxiv",1718316526070

Finally, we use electrophysiological recordings and a scramblase assay in tissue culture to demonstrate that Tmem16E/Ano5 acts as a channel, while Tmem16F/Ano6 is a bifunctional ion channel and phospholipid scramblase.

This study uses modeling to investigate the range of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe) that can be achieved under FBDG compliance.

The study analyzed data collected in 2014 from 29,413 NutriNet-Sante participants to assess their adherence to the French FBDG. GHGe, cumulative energy demand (CED), and land occupation (LO) for organic and conventional foods were obtained from the DIALECTE database. Diets adequate in nutrients, culturally acceptable, and consistent with FBDG were modeled under different GHGe constraints. Environmental, nutritional, and health criteria were then calculated.

The average observed adequacy to FBDG was low (19%, SD=25%) and GHGe were 4.34 (SD=2.7%) kgCO2eq/d. The GHGe range of the diets varied from 1.16 to 6.99 kgCO2eq/d, depending up to [~]85% on the level of meat consumption. Similar associations were observed for CED, LO and Health Risk Score. At isoenergetic diets, the diet with the lowest emissions had a higher proportion of vegetables, whole grains, and plant-based substitutes. This diet had a lower CED, LO, and a greater proportion of organic foods when compared to the diet with the highest emissions.

While French dietary guidelines contribute, on average, to mitigating climate change and promoting health, this study emphasizes levers in recommended food consumption to more efficiently reduce diets GHGe and points to total meat as the critical issue to better account for pressure on climate change. Other environmental pressures should also be taken into account when designing dietary guidelines.

HighlightsO_LIThe average greenhouse gas emissions of the observed diets was 4.34 (SD=2.70) kgCO2eq/d with an energy intake of 2080 Kcal/d
C_LIO_LIThe diet that closely resembled the observed diet under the dietary guidelines, nutrient and acceptability constraints (TD model) had emissions of 5.15 kgCO2eq/d .
C_LIO_LIModeled diets that complied with dietary guidelines and nutrient and acceptability constraints had emissions ranging from 1.16 kgCO2eq/d (model MinGHGe) to 6.99 kgCO2eq/d (model MaxGHGe).
C_LIO_LIAll modeled diets had higher consumption levels of fruit, vegetable oils, pulses, and wholegrain products.
C_LIO_LIThe MinGHGe and MaxGHGe diets, and the range of identified models in between, differed in their level of beef/lamb, refined cereals, fruit, pork, and snack products.
C_LIO_LIThe level of meat, especially beef/lamb, explained most of the difference (up to {approx}85%) in GHGe across models.
C_LIO_LIThe level of total meat consumption varied progressively across models that imposed an increase in GHGe.

In the United States, ST131 acquired multiple antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and rapidly grew to its current high prevalence in healthcare settings. Notably, this coincided with the introduction and widespread use of antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones, suggesting AMR as the major driver of ST131s expansion. Yet, within ST131, there remains considerable diversity between strains in resistance profiles and their repertoires of virulence factors, stress factors, plasmids, and other accessory elements. Understanding which genomic features contribute to ST131s competitive advantage and their relative effects on population-level fitness therefore poses a considerable challenge. Here we use phylodynamic birth-death models to estimate the relative fitness of different ST131 lineages from bacterial phylogenies. By extending these phylodynamic methods to allow multiple genomic features to shape bacterial fitness, we further quantify the relative contribution of individual AMR genes to ST131s fitness. Our analysis indicates that while many genomic elements, including various AMR genes, virulence factors, and plasmids, have all contributed substantially to ST131s rapid growth, major increases in ST131s fitness are largely attributable to mutations in gyrase A that confer resistance to fluoroquinolones.

Author summaryST131 is a pandemic lineage of E. coli that has spread globally and is now responsible for a large percentage of blood and urinary tract infections that cannot be treated with many common antibiotics. While antibiotic resistance has undoubtedly given ST131 a competitive edge, the relative importance of resistance compared with other factors shaping a pathogens growth or transmission potential (i.e. fitness) is often difficult to measure in natural settings. Here, we present a method that allows us to look at the entire spectrum of factors determining a pathogens fitness and estimate the individual contribution of each component to pathogens overall fitness. Our results suggest that resistance to fluoroquinolones, a widely used class of antibiotics, provides ST131 with a disproportionately large fitness advantage relative to many other factors with more moderate fitness effects. Understanding what determines the fitness of ST131 therefore provides insights that can be used to curb the spread of resistance and monitor for emerging lineages with high pandemic potential due to shared fitness enhancing attributes.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

Gastric digestive-enzyme-secreting chief cells use paligenosis to reprogram into progenitor-like Spasmolytic-Polypeptide Expressing Metaplasia (SPEM) cells. Stage 1 of paligenosis is to downscale mature cell architecture via a process involving lysosomes. Here, we noticed that sulfated glycoproteins (which are metaplasia and cancer markers in mice and humans) were not digested during paligenosis but excreted into the gland lumen. Various genetic and pharmacological approaches showed that endoplasmic reticulum membranes and secretory granule cargo were also excreted and that the process proceeded in parallel with, but was independent lysosomal activity. 3-dimensional light and electron-microscopy demonstrated that excretion occurred via unique, complex, multi-chambered invaginations of the apical plasma membrane. As this lysosome-independent cell cleansing process does not seem to have been priorly described, we termed it ""cathartocytosis"". Cathartocytosis allows a cell to rapidly eject excess material (likely in times of extreme stress such as are induced by paligenosis) without waiting for autophagic and lysosomal digestion. We speculate the ejection of sulfated glycoproteins (likely mucins) would aid in downscaling and might also help bind and flush pathogens (like H pylori which causes SPEM) away from tissue.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

Clinical grading of disease strongly predicts recurrence and survival after surgery and is determined by morphological assessment of histological growth patterns in resected tumours. The molecular basis of growth pattern is poorly understood at present, as are the mechanisms linking growth pattern to recurrence and death. Interestingly, the two archetypal lethal morphologies, solid and micropapillary patterns, are characterised by their biphasic appearance. Both have an epithelial fraction which is in direct stromal contact, and a fraction which is not. This morphological variance seems likely to represent plasticity, and to be causally linked to mechanisms of virulence. To investigate the gene expression changes related to growth pattern both intra- and inter-tumoral, we applied spatial transcriptomics (Nanostring GeoMx DSP) to tissue microarray specimens of primary resected human lung adenocarcinoma. Using a variety of region-of-interest (ROI) selection strategies, we sampled 160 pure epithelial ROIs across 7 distinct morphological features of LUAD from 51 patients. Analyses of gene expression reveal fundamental trajectories connecting growth patterns, and crucial modes of plasticity which underly high-risk morphologies. These modes suggest mechanisms for the origins of growth pattern and mechanisms of virulence. Our work highlights dramatic divergence in gene expression programmes between highly lethal but morphologically diverse modes of tumour growth. Furthermore, it provides an explanation for how microscopically localised hypoxia in the primary tumour helps to establish and maintain survival strategies which ultimately determine morphology-specific mechanisms of tumour metastasis, suggesting new therapeutic vulnerabilities.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3, which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 and KP.2.3, which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

The nature of this contextual information is difficult to study, as responses to feedforward and top-down inputs overlap in time and are difficult to disentangle experimentally. To address this issue, we measured responses to natural images and partially occluded versions of these images in the visual cortex of mice. Assessing neuronal responses before and after familiarizing mice with the non-occluded images allowed us to study experience-dependent and stimulus-specific contextual responses in pyramidal cells (PyCs) in cortical layers 2/3 and 5 in the absence of feedforward input. Surprisingly, in the same retinotopic region of cortex, we found that separate populations of PyCs in layer 2/3 responded to occluded and non-occluded images. Responses of PyCs selective for occluded images were strengthened upon familiarization and decoding analysis revealed they contained image-specific information, suggesting that they signaled the absence of predicted visual stimuli. Responses of PyCs selective for non-occluded scenes were weaker for familiarized images but stronger for unfamiliar images, suggesting that these neurons signaled the presence of unpredicted visual stimuli. Layer 5 also contained PyCs preferring either feedforward or contextual inputs, but their responses were more complex and strengthening of responses to occluded images required task engagement. The results show that visual experience decreases the activity of neurons responding to known feedforward inputs but increases the activity of neurons responding to contextual inputs tied to expected stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

Reproductive aging is associated with decreased ovarian reserve, decreased quality of the remaining oocytes, and decreased production of the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone. With aging, both mouse and human ovaries become pro-fibrotic and stiff. However, whether stiffness directly impairs ovarian function, folliculogenesis, and oocyte quality is unknown. To answer this question, we cultured mouse follicles in alginate gels that mimicked the stiffness of reproductively young and old ovaries. Follicles cultured in stiff hydrogels exhibited decreased survival and growth, decreased granulosa cell viability and estradiol synthesis, and decreased oocyte quality. We also observed a reduction in the number of granulosa cell-oocyte transzonal projections. RNA sequencing revealed early changes in the follicle transcriptome in response to stiffness. Follicles cultured in a stiff environment had lower expression of genes related to follicle development and greater expression of genes related to inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling than follicles cultured in a soft environment. Altogether, our findings suggest that ovarian stiffness directly modulates folliculogenesis and contributes to the progressive decline in oocyte quantity and quality observed in women of advanced maternal age.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

Until recently the hippocampus appeared to implement a simple coding scheme for position, in which each neuron is assigned to a single region of space in which it is active. Recently, new experiments revealed that the tuning of hippocampal neurons to space is much less stereotyped than previously thought: in large environments, place cells are active in multiple locations and their fields vary in shape and size across locations, with distributions that differ substantially in different experiments. It is unknown whether these seemingly diverse observations can be explained in a unified manner, and whether the heterogeneous statistics can reveal the mechanisms that determine the tuning of neural activity to position. Here we show that a surprisingly simple mathematical model, in which firing fields are generated by thresholding a realization of a random Gaussian process, explains the statistical properties of neural activity in quantitative detail, in bats and rodents, and in one-, two-, and three-dimensional environments of varying sizes. The model captures the statistics of field arrangements, and further yields quantitative predictions on the statistics of field shapes and topologies, which we verify. Thus, the seemingly diverse statistics arise from mathematical principles that are common to different species and behavioral conditions. The underlying Gaussian statistics are compatible with a picture in which the synaptic connections between place cells and their inputs are random and highly unstructured.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

To uncover these rules, it is first necessary to find the binding sites within a regulatory region with high precision, and then to systematically modulate this binding site arrangement while simultaneously measuring the effect of this modulation on output gene expression. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), where the gene expression stemming from 10,000s of in vitro-generated regulatory sequences is measured, have made this feat possible in high-throughput in single cells in culture. However, because of lack of technologies to incorporate DNA libraries, MPRAs are limited in whole organisms.

Targeting GFP integrated in genome of Drosophila cell culture and whole animals as a case study, we show that the base editor AIDevoCDA1 stemming from sea lamprey fused to nCas9 is highly mutagenic. Surprisingly, longer gRNAs increase mutation efficiency and expand the mutating window, which can allow the introduction of mutations in previously untargetable sequences.

This method can be used to estimate and visualize p-values for individual features, allowing the researcher to identify a subset of features for which there is robust, statistical evidence of an effect.

Growing evidence supports a likely causal association between cardiovascular diseases and the presence of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), a cellular transdifferentiation process in which endothelial cells (ECs) partially lose their identity and acquire additional mesenchymal phenotypes. EC reprogramming represents an innovative strategy in regenerative medicine to prevent deleterious effects induced by cardiovascular diseases.

MethodsUsing a partial reprogramming of ECs, via overexpression of Oct-3/4, Sox-2, and Klf-4 (OSK) transcription factors, we aimed to bring ECs back to a youthful phenotype in hypertensive mice. Primary ECs were infected with lentiviral vectors (LV) containing the specific EC marker cadherin 5 (Cdh5) and the fluorescent reporter enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) with empty vector (LVCO) or with OSK (LV-OSK). Confocal microscopy and western blotting analysis were used to confirm the OSK overexpression. Cellular migration, senescence, and apoptosis were evaluated. Human aortic ECs (HAoECs) from male and female normotensive and hypertensive patients were analyzed after OSK or control treatments for their endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) levels, nitric oxide (NO), and genetic profile. Male and female normotensive (BPN/3J) and hypertensive (BPH/2J) mice were treated with an intravenous (i.v.) injection of LVCO or LV-OSK and evaluated 10 days post-infection. The blood pressure, cardiac function, vascular reactivity of small arteries, in vivo EGFP signal and EndMT inhibition were analyzed.

ResultsOSK overexpression induced partial EC reprogramming in vitro, and these cells showed endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-like features with lower migratory capability. OSK treatment of hypertensive BPH/2J mice normalized blood pressure and resistance arteries hypercontractility, via the attenuation of EndMT and elastin breaks. EGFP signal was detected in vivo in the prefrontal cortex of both BPN/3J and BPH/2J-treated mice, but OSK induced angiogenesis only in male BPN/3J mice. OSK-treated human ECs from hypertensive patients showed high eNOS activation and NO production, with low ROS formation.

Advances in artificial intelligence and infection modelling have enabled ICT teams to better predict and trace infection spread. However, it is notoriously difficult to replicate bacterial dissemination or validate prediction models in a laboratory setting due to a lack of effective in vivo models. In this work, we sought to develop Galleria mellonella as a model organism to replicate the dissemination of pathogens in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU). By combining this model organism with 3D printed models of a real hospital ICU, we are able to demonstrate that larvae do disseminate the multidrug resistant pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii within this ICU model and that it is possible to use this model to identify infection hotspots. Importantly, this model can also be used for intervention strategy testing as we also show that bacterial dissemination can be significantly mitigated by the introduction of antimicrobial wall surface coatings. This model provides a robust platform for the testing of antimicrobial surface coatings as well as the study of genetic determinants with a role in pathogen dissemination.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

This suggests a critical need to model the interaction between sensory feedback and intrinsic dynamics. Such models would also benefit the design of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that decode neural activity in real time, where both user learning and proficient control require feedback. Here we investigate the flexible feedback modulation of cortical dynamics and demonstrate its impact on BCI task performance and short-term learning. By training recurrent network models with real-time sensory feedback on a simple 2D reaching task, analogous to BCI cursor control, we show how previously reported M1 activity patterns can be reinterpreted as arising from feedback-driven dynamics. Next, by incorporating adaptive controllers upstream of M1, we make a testable prediction that short-term learning for a new BCI decoder is facilitated by plasticity of inputs to M1, including remapping of sensory feedback, beyond the plasticity of recurrent connections within M1. This input-driven dynamical structure also determines the speed of adaptation and learning outcomes, and explains a continuous form of learning variability. Thus, our work highlights the need to model input-dependent latent dynamics for motor control and clarifies how constraints on learning arise from both the statistical characteristics and the underlying dynamical structure of neural activity.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

The structure and diversity of virus populations affects disease progression and treatment outcomes. Next-generation sequencing allows detailed viral population analysis, but inferring diversity from error-prone reads is challenging. Here, we present VILOCA, a method for mutation calling and reconstruction of local haplotypes from short- and long-read viral sequencing data. Local haplotypes refer to genomic regions that have approximately the length of the input reads. VILOCA recovers local haplotypes by using a Dirichlet process mixture model to cluster reads around their unobserved haplotypes and leveraging quality scores of the sequencing reads. We assessed the performance of VILOCA in terms of mutation calling and haplotype reconstruction accuracy on simulated and experimental Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore data. On simulated and experimental Illumina data, VILOCA performed better or similar to existing methods. On the simulated long-read data, VILOCA is able to recover on average 82% of the ground truth mutations with perfect precision compared to only 64% recall and 90% precision of the second-best method. In summary, VILOCA provides significantly improved accuracy in mutation and haplotype calling, especially for long-read sequencing data, and therefore facilitates the comprehensive characterization of heterogeneous within-host viral populations.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

Most cases of PD are believed to arise from gene-environment interactions. Microbiome composition is altered in PD, and gut bacteria are causal to symptoms and pathology in animal models. To explore how the microbiome may impact PD-associated genetic risks, we quantitatively profiled nearly 630 metabolites from 26 biochemical classes in the gut, plasma, and brain of -synuclein-overexpressing (ASO) mice with or without microbiota. We observe tissue-specific changes driven by genotype, microbiome, and their interaction. Many differentially expressed metabolites in ASO mice are also dysregulated in human PD patients, including amine oxides, bile acids and indoles. Notably, levels of the microbial metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) strongly correlate from the gut to the plasma to the brain, identifying a product of gene-environment interactions that may influence PD-like outcomes in mice. TMAO is elevated in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid of PD patients. These findings uncover broad metabolomic changes that are influenced by the intersection of host genetics and the microbiome in a mouse model of PD.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

Initially studied in mammals and birds, recent findings have identified CMA in fish, reshaping our understanding of its evolution across metazoans. Given the exciting perspectives this finding offered, we have now developed the required tools to investigate and functionally asses that CMA function in a powerful fish genetic model: the zebrafish (Danio rerio). After adapting and validating a fluorescent reporter (KFERQ-Dendra2; previously used to track CMA in mammalian cells) in zebrafish primary embryonic cells, we first demonstrated CMA functionality in this fish species. Then, we developed a transgenic zebrafish line expressing the KFERQ-Dendra2 CMA reporter, enabling the real-time tracking of CMA activity in vivo. This model revealed heterogeneous CMA responses within tissues, highlighting the zebrafish as a valuable model for investigating tissue-specific and cell-scale variations in CMA. Moreover, a novel role for CMA has been uncovered, acting as a gatekeeper of sperm cell proteostasis, thereby playing a crucial role in the production of active and high-quality spermatozoa.

RNA sequencing on purified AML patient samples show TP53mut AML has higher expression of mevalonate pathway genes. We retrospectively identified a survival benefit in TP53mut AML patients who received chemotherapy concurrently with a statin, which inhibits the mevalonate pathway. Mechanistically, TP53mut AML resistance to standard AML chemotherapy, cytarabine (AraC), correlates with increased mevalonate pathway activity and a mitochondria stress response with increased mitochondria mass and oxidative phosphorylation. Pretreatment with a statin reverses these effects and chemosensitizes TP53mut AML cell lines and primary samples in vitro and in vivo. Mitochondria-dependent chemoresistance requires the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) branch of the mevalonate pathway and novel GGPP-dependent synthesis of glutathione to manage AraC-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS).

The integrated stress response (ISR) - comprising the four eIF2alpha kinases PERK, GCN2, PKR, and HRI - is a prominent stress-responsive signaling pathway that regulates mitochondrial morphology and function in response to diverse types of pathologic insult. This suggests that pharmacologic, stress-independent activation of the ISR represents a potential strategy to mitigate pathologic mitochondrial fragmentation associated with human disease. Here, we show that pharmacologic, stress-independent activation of the ISR kinases HRI or GCN2 promotes adaptive mitochondrial elongation and prevents mitochondrial fragmentation induced by the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Further, we show that stress-independent activation of these ISR kinases reduces mitochondrial fragmentation and restores basal mitochondrial morphology in patient fibroblasts expressing the pathogenic D414V variant of the pro-fusion mitochondrial GTPase MFN2 associated with neurological dysfunctions including ataxia, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss. These results identify pharmacologic, stress-independent activation of ISR kinases as a potential strategy to prevent pathologic mitochondrial fragmentation induced by disease-relevant chemical and genetic insults, further motivating the pursuit of highly selective ISR kinase-activating compounds as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction implicated in diverse human diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022).

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

Here, we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), a genome editing system that combines the programmability and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 with the RNA-mediated gene insertion capabilities of the human LINE1 (L1) element. CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1718316526070

It is therefore critical to track this virus using genomic surveillance. However, the complex patterns of viral genomic diversity make it challenging to use the existing genotype classification system. Here we propose adding two sub-genotypic levels of virus classification, named major and minor lineages. These lineages have high thresholds for phylogenetic distance and clade size, rendering them stable between phylogenetic studies. We present an assignment tool to show that the proposed lineages are useful for regional, national and sub-national discussions of relevant DENV diversity. Moreover, the proposed lineages are robust to classification using partial genome sequences. We provide a standardized neutral descriptor of DENV diversity with which we can identify and track lineages of potential epidemiological and/or clinical importance.

This is a case of sound-symbolism, known as the Bouba-Kiki effect. Studies on four-months infants suggest that this effect might constitute a predisposed perceptual mechanism. However, these studies suffered from the impossibility of ruling out a fast experience-driven origin of the effect resulting from infants speed of learning, their sensitivity to environmental regularities, and the large number of sound-symbolic associations to which they are precociously exposed when interacting with adults. To better describe its ontogeny and fill in this gap, we tested the Bouba-Kiki effect in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). Being a precocial species, chicks can be tested on the very early days of life, allowing for a virtually total control of their experience before test. Three-day-old chicks (n=42) first learned to circumnavigate a panel to obtain a food reward. Then, they were presented with two identical panels, one depicting a spiky shape, and one depicting a round shape, while hearing either the sound  Bouba or  Kiki. We recorded which panel chicks chose with either sound, in a total of 24 trials. Chicks preferred the panel with the spiky shape when hearing the  Kiki sound, and that with the round shape when hearing the  Bouba sound. Results from naive baby chicks hint at a predisposed mechanism for matching the two dimensions of shape and sound that may be widespread across species.","NA","biorxiv",1718316526070

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.
