Persistently elevated autoantibodies have been found in some individuals with long COVID (LC). Using a >21,000 human protein array, we identified diverse AAB targets in LC patients that correlated with their symptoms. Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness. Our findings suggest that targeting AABs could benefit some LC patients.","NA","medrxiv",1719180331439

We found that H5 from A/Texas/37/2024, an isolate from the dairy cow outbreak, has increased binding breadth to glycans bearing terminal a2,3 sialic acids, the avian receptor, compared to historical and recent 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses. We did not observe any binding to a2,6 sialic acids, the receptor used by human seasonal influenza viruses. We identified a single mutation outside of the receptor binding site, T199I, was responsible for increased binding breadth, as it increased receptor binding site flexibility. Together, these data show recent H5N1 viruses are evolving increased receptor binding breadth which could impact the host range and cell types infected with H5N1.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

Here, we characterize EVs produced by the dominant human gut methanogen, Methanobrevibacter smithii, which, unlike most archaea, contains a peptidoglycan cell wall. Using quantitative proteomics, we show that M. smithii EVs are enriched in various proteins responsible for chromatin structure, including histones, and DNA repair. Consistently, the M. smithii EVs carry DNA, with fragments covering the entire cellular chromosome. Notably, the EVs are strongly enriched in extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) molecules which originate from excision of a 2.9-kb chromosomal fragment and a proviral genome. The eccDNA encodes two of the key methanogenesis enzymes and could boost their expression inside the cells through the gene dosage effect. Furthermore, four of the top ten most abundant EV proteins are implicated in methanogenesis. Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) suggests that EVs are formed by budding from the cell membrane and are trapped under the cell wall prior to liberation through local disruptions in the cell wall. Collectively, our results reveal parallels with EV biogenesis in bacteria and suggest that M. smithii EVs facilitate the export of both cellular and viral DNA as well as key metabolic proteins in the gut environment, with potential impact on methane production.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

Based on conservation in the protein primary sequence, domain architecture, and three-dimensional structure, as well as common architectural features of the non-coding RNA components, we propose that programmable RNA modification emerged via exaptation of components derived from IS110-like transposons. Alongside recent studies highlighting the origins of CRISPR-Cas9 and Cas12 in IS605-family transposons, these findings underscore how recurrent domestication events of transposable elements gave rise to complex RNA-guided biological mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

Neonatal research offers a pivotal opportunity to address this long-standing debate. Given that postnatal environmental influences (e.g., gender socialisation) are minimal at birth, any sex differences observed at this stage can be more readily attributed to prenatal influences. Here, we assessed on-average sex differences in global and regional brain volumes in 514 newborns (236 birth-assigned females and 278 birth-assigned males) using data from the developing Human Connectome Project. On average, males had significantly larger intracranial and total brain volumes, even after controlling for birth weight. After controlling for total brain volume, females showed higher total cortical gray matter volumes, whilst males showed higher total white matter volumes. After controlling for total brain volume in regional comparisons, females had increased white matter volumes in the corpus callosum and increased gray matter volumes in the bilateral parahippocampal gyri (posterior parts), left anterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral parietal lobes, and right caudate nucleus. Males had increased gray matter volumes in the right medial and inferior temporal gyrus (posterior part) and right subthalamic nucleus. Effect sizes ranged from small for regional comparisons to large for global comparisons. While postnatal experiences likely amplify sex differences in the brain, our findings demonstrate that several global and regional on-average sex differences are already present at birth.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

The method is implemented in two stages: first, the pre-training stage that generates 3028 generic pathway aging models by integrating age-related genome-wide DNA methylation data with gene ontology and signaling pathway; second, the fine-tuning stage that produces 30280 disease-specific pathway aging models using DNA methylation profiling from 3263 samples across 10 age-related diseases. The Next Generation Aging Clock Models have demonstrated exceptional performance in predicting diseases. For example, the aging index of blood vessel endothelial cell migration can predict Atherosclerosis with an odds ratio of 80. Alzheimers disease can be predicted by the aging index of response to DNA damage stimulus, with an odds ratio of 3.1. Major Depressive Disorder can be predicted by the organization of the mitochondrion, with an odds ratio of 4.4. Breast cancer can be predicted by DNA repair, with an odds ratio of 3.4, and the severity of COVID-19 can be predicted by neutrophil degranulation, with an odds ratio of 8.5. Furthermore, the models have allowed the categorization of diseases into nucleus aging and cytoplasm aging types. The former includes Alzheimers disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, breast cancer, colon cancer, and osteoporosis. The latter includes Parkinsons disease, depression, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and COVID-19 severity. This innovative approach is expected to be a valuable tool for research into aging-related diseases and for personalized aging interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

The olfactory nerve is widely accepted as the neuroinvasive route by which the etiological agent SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain, but the trigeminal nerve is an often-overlooked additional route. Based on this consensus, we initially conducted a pilot experiment investigating the olfactory nerve route of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion via intranasal inoculation in AC70 human ACE2 transgenic mice. Notably, we found that the trigeminal ganglion is an early and highly efficient site of viral replication, which then rapidly spread widely throughout the brain where neurons were primarily targeted. Despite the extensive viral infection across the brain, obvious evidence of tissue pathology including inflammatory infiltration, glial activation, and apoptotic cell deaths were not consistently observed, albeit inflammatory cytokines were significantly induced. However, the expression levels of different genes related to neuronal function, including the neurotransmitter dopamine pathway as well as synaptic function, and markers of neuronal damage were altered as compared to mock-infected mice. Our findings suggest that the trigeminal nerve can be a neuroinvasive route complementary to the olfactory nerve and that the ensuing neuroinvasion presented a unique neuropathological profile. This study provides insights into potential neuropathogenic mechanisms utilized by coronaviruses.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

However, the resurgent interest in the drugs as therapeutics has also prompted a search for novel agents with more specific pharmacological activities than the rather promiscuous classical psychedelics. Here we present the results of an elaborate preclinical characterization of one such compound, LPH-5 [(S)-3-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)piperidine]. LPH-5 was found to be a potent partial agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) and to exhibit pronounced selectivity for this receptor over the related 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors in a range of functional assays. LPH-5 (0.375 - 12.0 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently induced head-twitch responses (HTR) in Sprague Dawley rats, with substantial 5-HT2AR engagement being observed at 0.5-1.0 mg/kg. Acute administration of LPH-5 (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced robust antidepressant-like effects in Flinders Sensitive Line rats and adrenocorticotropic hormone-treated Sprague Dawley rats, and LPH-5 (0.3 and 1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced significant effects in a recently developed Wistar Kyoto rat model proposed to reflect the long-term antidepressant-like effects produced by psychedelics in humans. In conclusion, selective 5-HT2AR activation, as mediated here by LPH- 5, seems to hold antidepressant potential, suggesting that this activity component is key for the beneficial effects of classical psychedelics. Hence, we propose that LPH-5 and other 5-HT2AR- selective agonists could hold potential as therapeutics in psychiatric disease as a new generation of psychedelic-derived antidepressant.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

Many proteins exert their functions through interactions with other proteins, and a significant challenge is designing these interactions effectively. While most efforts have focused on larger, more stable proteins, shorter peptides offer advantages such as lower manufacturing costs, reduced steric hindrance, and the ability to traverse cell membranes when cyclized. Here, we present an AI method to design novel linear and cyclic peptide binders of varying lengths based solely on a protein target sequence. Our approach does not specify a binding site or the length of the binder, making the procedure completely blind. We demonstrate that high-affinity binders can be selected directly from predicted confidence metrics, and adversarial designs can be avoided through orthogonal in silico evaluation, tripling the success rate. We selected a single designed linear sequence for lengths ranging from 8 to 20 residues and evaluated the affinity using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Of the sequences tested, 6 out of 13 (46%) displayed affinity with dissociation constants (Kd) in the micromolar range; the strongest binder had a Kd of 19 nM, and the weakest had a Kd of 7.9 M. Our protocol, EvoBind2 (https://github.com/patrickbryant1/EvoBind), enables binder design based solely on a protein target sequence, suggesting the potential for a rapid increase in the number of proteins that can be targeted for various biotechnological applications.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

We aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 serological responses to primary infection and vaccination in people who developed PCC versus those with an acute infection only.

MethodsParticipants (n=2,010) were a sub-cohort of the Virus Watch community cohort study in England who experienced mild-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infections, completed surveys on persistent symptoms, and provided monthly finger-prick blood samples for serology. We compared the likelihood of post-infection seroconversion using logistic mixed models and the trajectories of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) and anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies using linear mixed models.

ResultsParticipants who developed PCC (n=394) had 1.8x the odds of post-infection seroconversion for anti-N antibodies compared to those with an acute infection only (n=1616) (adjusted odds ratio= 1.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-2.90). Post-infection anti-N levels were persistently elevated in people with PCC (final log anti-N titres at 365 days 0.97, 95% CI 0.76-1.18) compared to those without (0.47, 95% CI 0.31-0.62). No differences were found in post-vaccination anti-S levels or trajectories before or after primary infection between participants with and without PCC; pre-vaccination anti-S responses could not be evaluated.

ConclusionPeople with PCC demonstrated greater and more persistent anti-N antibody responses following primary infection compared to those with an acute infection only.

In animals, complex sensory motor systems are primarily built around the fundamental cell types of muscles and neurons, though the evolutionary origin of these cells, and their integration, remains unclear. Here, in order to investigate sensory-behavior coupling in the closest relatives of animals, we established a line of the choanoflagellate, Salpingoeca rosetta, which stably expresses the calcium indicator RGECO1. Using this, we identify a novel cellular behavior associated with electrical signaling, in which ciliary arrest is coupled with apical-basal contraction of the cell. This behavior, and the associated calcium transients, are synchronized in the multicellular state and result in coordinated ciliary arrest and colony wide contraction, suggesting information is spread amongst the cells. Our work reveals fundamental insights into how choanoflagellates sense and respond to their environment and offer a new perspective into the integration of cellular and organism wide behavior in the closest protistan relatives of animals.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

The nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) is a brainstem structure proposed to receive signals from vagal afferents and relay them to brain networks for emotion regulation.

Despite the fundamental importance of BLTPs for cellular function, the architecture, composition, and lipid transfer mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Here, we present the subunit composition and the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the native LPD-3 BLTP complex isolated from transgenic C. elegans. LPD-3 folds into an elongated, rod-shaped tunnel whose interior is filled with ordered lipid molecules that are coordinated by a track of ionizable residues that line one side of the tunnel. LPD-3 forms a complex with two previously uncharacterized proteins, here named Intake and Spigot, both of which interact with the N-terminal end of LPD-3 where lipids enter the tunnel. Intake has three transmembrane helices, one of which borders the entrance to the tunnel; Spigot has one transmembrane helix and extends 80 angstroms along the cytosolic surface of LPD-3. Experiments in multiple model systems indicate that Spigot plays a conserved role in ER-PM contact site formation. Our LPD-3 complex structural data, together with molecular dynamics simulations of the transmembrane region in a lipid bilayer, reveal protein-lipid interactions that suggest a model for how the native LPD-3-complex mediates bulk lipid transport and provide a foundation for mechanistic studies of BLTPs.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

The prediction and analysis of gene essentiality can advance our understanding of basic life and human diseases, and further boost the development of new drugs. Wet lab methods for identifying cell essential genes are often costly, time-consuming, and laborious. As a complement, computational methods have been proposed to predict essential genes by integrating multiple biological data sources. Most of these methods are evaluated on model organisms. However, prediction methods for human essential genes are still limited and the relationship between human gene essentiality and different biological information still needs to be explored. In addition, exploring suitable deep learning techniques to overcome the limitations of traditional machine learning methods and improve prediction accuracy is also important and interesting. We propose a snapshot ensemble deep neural network method, DeEPsnap, to predict human essential genes. DeEPsnap integrates sequence features derived from DNA and protein sequence data with features extracted or learned from multiple types of functional data, such as gene ontology, protein complex, protein domain, and protein-protein interaction network. More than 200 features from these biological data are extracted/learned which are integrated together to train a series of cost-sensitive deep neural networks by utilizing multiple deep learning techniques. The proposed snapshot mechanism enables us to train multiple models without increasing extra training effort and cost. The experimental results of 10-fold cross-validation show that DeEPsnap can accurately predict human gene essentiality with an average AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) of 96.1%, the average AUPRC (Area under the Precision-Recall curve) of 93.82%, the average accuracy of 92.21%, and the average F1 measure about 80.62%. In addition, the comparison of experimental results shows that DeEPsnap outperforms several popular traditional machine learning models and deep learning models. We have demonstrated that the proposed method, DeEPsnap, is effective for predicting human essential genes.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

However, the differential roles of state vs. trait anxiety remain unclear, and underlying computational mechanisms have not been thoroughly characterized. In the present study, we investigated how a somatic (interoceptive) state anxiety induction influences learning and decision-making under uncertainty in individuals with clinically significant levels of trait anxiety. A sample of 58 healthy comparisons (HCs) and 61 individuals with affective disorders (iADs; i.e., depression and/or anxiety) completed a previously validated explore-exploit decision task, with and without an added breathing resistance manipulation designed to induce state anxiety. Computational modeling revealed a pattern in which iADs showed greater information-seeking (i.e., directed exploration; Cohens d=.39, p=.039) in resting conditions, but that this was reduced by the anxiety induction. The affective disorders group also showed slower learning rates across conditions (Cohens d=.52, p=.003), suggesting more persistent uncertainty. These findings highlight a complex interplay between trait anxiety and state anxiety. Specifically, while elevated trait anxiety is associated with persistent uncertainty, acute somatic anxiety can paradoxically curtail exploratory behaviors, potentially reinforcing maladaptive decision-making patterns in affective disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1719180331439

The structure of the resting state of NbNRC2 was recently revealed to be a homodimer. However, the sensor-activated state has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we used cryo-EM to determine the structure of sensor-activated NbNRC2, which forms a hexameric inflammasome-like structure known as resistosome. To confirm the functional significance of the hexamer, we mutagenized the interfaces involved in oligomerization and found that mutations in three nucleotide-binding domain interface residues abolish oligomerization and immune signalling. Comparative structural analyses between the resting state NbNRC2 homodimer and the sensor-activated homohexamer revealed significant structural rearrangements before and after activation, providing insights into NLR activation mechanisms. Furthermore, structural comparisons between the NbNRC2 hexamer and previously reported CC-NLR pentameric assemblies revealed features in NbNRC2 that allow for the integration of an additional protomer. We also used the NbNRC2 hexamer structure to assess the recently released AlphaFold 3 for the prediction of activated CC-NLR oligomers. This revealed that AlphaFold 3 allows for high-confidence modelling of the N-terminal 1-helices of NbNRC2 and other CC-NLRs, a region that has proven difficult to fully resolve using structural approaches.

During low arousal states such as slow wave sleep, the cortex is synchronized and dominated by low frequency rhythms coordinated across multiple regions. Although recent evidence suggests that GABAergic inhibitory neurons are key players in cortical state modulation, the in vivo circuit mechanisms coordinating synchronized activity among local and distant neocortical networks are not well understood. Here, we show that somatostatin and chondrolectin co-expressing cells (Sst-Chodl cells), a sparse and unique class of neocortical inhibitory neurons, are selectively active during low arousal states and are largely silent during periods of high arousal. In contrast to other neocortical inhibitory neurons, we show these neurons have long-range axons that project across neocortical areas. Activation of Sst-Chodl cells is sufficient to promote synchronized cortical states characteristic of low arousal, with increased spike co-firing and low frequency brain rhythms, and to alter behavioral states by promoting sleep. Contrary to the prevailing belief that sleep is exclusively driven by subcortical mechanisms, our findings reveal that these long-range inhibitory neurons not only track changes in behavioral state but are sufficient to induce both sleep-like cortical states and sleep behavior, establishing a crucial circuit component in regulating behavioral states.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

However, large size also poses biophysical challenges, especially regarding the transport of nutrients to all cells; these constraints are typically overcome through multicellular innovations (e.g., a circulatory system). Here we show that an emergent biophysical mechanism --- spontaneous fluid flows arising from metabolically-generated density gradients --- can alleviate constraints on nutrient transport, enabling exponential growth in nascent multicellular clusters of yeast lacking any multicellular adaptations for nutrient transport or fluid flow. Surprisingly, beyond a threshold size, the metabolic activity of experimentally-evolved snowflake yeast clusters drives large-scale fluid flows that transport nutrients throughout the cluster at speeds comparable to those generated by the cilia of extant multicellular organisms. These flows support exponential growth at macroscopic sizes that theory predicts should be diffusion limited. This work demonstrates how simple physical mechanisms can act as a 'biophysical scaffold' to support the evolution of multicellularity by opening up phenotypic possibilities prior to genetically-encoded innovations. More broadly, our findings highlight how co-option of conserved physical processes is a crucial but underappreciated facet of evolutionary innovation across scales.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

We hypothesized that the locus coeruleus (LC), as the primary source of cortical norepinephrine (NE) and promoter of cortical and sympathetic arousal, is well-positioned to mediate movement-arousal coupling. Here, using a combination of physiological recordings, fiber photometry, optogenetics, and behavioral tracking, we show that the LCNE activation is tightly coupled to the return of organized movements during waking from an anesthetized state. Moreover, in an awake animal, movement initiations are coupled to LCNE activation, while movement arrests, to LCNE deactivation. We also report that LCNE activity covaries with the depth of anesthesia and that LCNE photoactivation leads to sympathetic activation, consistent with its role in mediating increased arousal. Together, these studies reveal a more nuanced, modulatory role that LCNE plays in coordinating movement and arousal.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

To investigate how therse influence the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2, 2000 high quality, coding complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants collected pre-September, 2020, and from each subsequently appearing alpha, delta, BA.1, BA.2, BA.5, XBB, EG, HK and JN.1 lineages were downloaded from NCBI Virus in April, 2024. C->U transitions were the most common substitution during diversification of SARS-CoV-2 lineages over the 4-year observation period. A net loss of C bases and accumulation of Us occurred at a constant rate of approximately 0.2%-0.25% / decade. C->U transitions occurred in over a quarter of all sites with a C (26.5%; range 20.0%-37.2%), around 5 times more than observed for the other transitions (5.3%-6.8%). In contrast to an approximately random distribution of other transitions across the genome, most C->U substitutions occurred at statistically preferred sites in each lineage. However, only the most C->U polymorphic sites showed evidence for a preferred 5U context previously associated with APOBEC 3A editing. There was a similarly weak preference for unpaired bases suggesting much less stringent targeting of RNA than mediated by A3 deaminases in DNA editing. Future functional studies are required to determine editing preferences, impacts on replication fitness in vivo of SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses and impact on host tropism.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

A comparable manual workflow with one quarter the throughput maintained the same sensitivity. These micro-plaque assays can replace plaque assays as a new gold standard in phage biology.

Including 23andMe genetic evidence approximately doubles the number of target-indication pairs in the clinic that are supported by human genetics.

In contrast to conclusions from the recent publication of Minikel et al., we found that minor allele frequencies and effect sizes from GWAS influence the relative success estimates for program approvals, and that drug programs supported by rare and large effect associations have greater (3-4x) likelihood to be approved compared to common variant associations with small effects. Finally, improved gene mapping to identify the likely causal genes underlying genetic associations can result in up to 4-5x enrichment for trial success.

In the endoplasmic reticulum, two distinct metal ion dependent enzyme families (i.e., multifunctional lysyl hydroxylases-glucosyltransferases LH/PLODs and galactosyltransferases GLT25D/COLGALT) alternatively operate on collagen lysine side chains ultimately generating the highly conserved -(1,2)-glucosyl-{beta}-(1,O)-galactosyl-5-hydroxylysine pattern. Malfunctions in the collagen lysine post-translational modification machinery is linked to multiple developmental pathologies as well as extracellular matrix alterations causing enhanced cellular proliferation and invasiveness of several solid tumors, prompting for an in-depth characterization of LH/PLOD and GLT25D/COLGALT enzyme families. Here, we present an integrative molecular study of GLT25D1/COLGALT, highlighting an elongated head-to-head homodimeric assembly characterized by an N-terminal segment of each monomer wrapping around its dimerization partner. Each monomer encompasses two Rossman fold-type domains (GT1 and GT2) separated by an extended linker. Both domains were found capable of binding Mn2+ cofactors and UDP--galactose donor substrates, resulting in four candidate catalytic sites per dimer. Site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical studies identify the C-terminal GT2 domain as the functional GLT25D1/COLGALT1 catalytic site, highlighting an unprecedented Glu-Asp-Asp motif critical for metal ion binding, and suggesting structural roles for the N-terminal GT1 essential for correct quaternary structure assembly. Conversely, dimerization was not a requirement for GLT25D1/COLGALT1 enzymatic activity in vitro, suggesting that the elongated enzyme homodimer assembly, resembling that of LH/PLOD binding partners, could represent a functional hallmark for correct recognition and successful processing of collagen lysine residues.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

Spectral flow cytometry allows for high-dimensional analysis of immune cells, overcoming limitations of conventional flow cytometry. However, analyzing data from large antibody panels can be challenging using traditional bi-axial gating strategies. Here, we present a novel analysis pipeline designed to improve analysis of spectral flow cytometry. We employ this method to identify rare T cell populations in aging. We isolated splenocytes from young (2-3 months) and aged (18-19 months) female mice then stained these with a panel of 20 fluorescently labeled antibodies. Spectral flow cytometry was performed, followed by data processing and analysis using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment to perform batch correction, unsupervised clustering, dimensionality reduction, and differential expression analysis. Our analysis of 3,776,804 T cells from 11 spleens revealed 34 distinct T cell clusters identified by surface marker expression. We observed significant differences between young and aged mice, with certain clusters enriched in one age group over the other. Naive, effector memory, and central memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets exhibited age-associated changes in abundance and marker expression. Additionally, {gamma}{delta}T cell clusters showed differential abundance between age groups. By leveraging high-dimensional analysis methods borrowed from single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, we identified age-related differences in T cell subsets, providing insights into the immune aging process. This approach offers a robust, free, and easily implemented analysis pipeline for spectral flow cytometry data that may facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for age-related immune dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a multi-domain protein containing both a kinase and a GTPase, are a leading cause of the familial form of PD. Pathogenic LRRK2 mutations increase LRRK2 kinase activity. While the bulk of LRRK2 is found in the cytosol, the protein associates with membranes, where its Rab GTPase substrates are found, and, under certain conditions, with microtubules. Integrative structural studies using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have revealed the architecture of microtubule-associated LRRK2 filaments, and that formation of these filaments required LRRK2's kinase to be in the active-like conformation. Whether LRRK2 can interact with and form filaments on microtubules in its autoinhibited state, where the kinase domain conformation is inactive and the N-terminal LRR domain covers the kinase catalytic site, was not known. Using cryo-ET, we showed that full-length LRRK2 can oligomerize on microtubules in its autoinhibited state. Both WT-LRRK2 and PD-linked LRRK2 mutants formed filaments on microtubules. While these filaments are stabilized by the same interfaces seen in the active-LRRK2 filaments, we observed a new interface involving the N-terminal repeats that were disordered in the active-LRRK2 filaments. The helical parameters of the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are different from those reported for the active-LRRK2 filaments. Finally, the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are shorter, suggesting they are less stable.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

Pristionchus pacificus displays two types of feeding behaviours: predatory and bacterial feeding. Previously, we showed that the neurotransmitter serotonin plays important roles in regulating predatory feeding in P. pacificus. However, the role of other neurotransmitters in predatory feeding remains unclear. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we generated mutants of the dense-core vesicle (DCV)-based neuropeptide secretion system and genes related to seven neurotransmitters. Predatory assays revealed that the vesicular glutamate transporter Ppa-EAT-4, glutamic acid decarboxylase Ppa-UNC-25 which is involved in GABA synthesis, and the calcium-dependent activator protein for DCV secretion Ppa-UNC-31, play roles in predatory feeding behaviour. We assessed the pharyngeal movement necessary for predation as well as locomotion rate in these mutants. While the Ppa-eat-4 and Ppa-unc-31 mutants decreased predation movement, the Ppa-unc-25 mutant showed a reduction only in bacterial events compared to wild type animals. Additionally, Ppa-unc-25 and Ppa-unc-31 decreased in motor movement, potentially reducing predation efficiency. Together, these results suggest that glutamate, GABA and DCV secretion modulate feeding behaviours in P. pacificus.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway.

Despite being modular, composed of multiple zooids and supporting tissues, colonies function as a single physiological unit. A major question in the biology of colonies is the cellular mechanism of generating structurally and functionally distinct colony parts. The cnidarian Hydractinia establishes colonies with different types of zooids (polyps), interconnected by a gastrovascular system that is attached to the substrate and known as stolons. We obtained single cell transcriptomic profiles of ~200K Hydractinia cells, including isolated stolons and two polyp types. We characterised the major Hydractinia cell types and quantified their abundance across colony parts. Overall, we find that distinct colony parts are characterised primarily by distinct combinations of shared cell types and to a lesser extent by part-specific cell types. Therefore, we propose that both cell type combinations, as well as rarer cell type innovations, have been the main mechanism in the evolution of coloniality in cnidarians. We identified cell type-specific transcription factors (TFs) and gene networks expressed within these cell types. Notably, we discovered a previously unidentified, stolon-specific cell type, which expresses enzymes related to biomineralization and chitin synthesis, reminiscent of molluscan shell matrix proteins that may represent a crucial adaptation to the animal's habitat. In summary, the Hydractinia cell atlas elucidates the fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying coloniality.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

Although the exact mechanisms underlying its maturation remain elusive, spontaneous activity patterns in the retina, known as retinal waves, have been shown to contribute to this developmental process. Retinal waves exhibit complex spatio-temporal statistics and contribute to the establishment of circuit connectivity and function in the visual system, including the formation of retinotopic maps and the refinement of receptive fields in downstream areas such as the thalamus and visual cortex. Recent work in mice has shown that retinal waves have statistical features matching those of natural visual stimuli, such as optic flow, suggesting that they could prime the visual system for motion processing upon vision onset. Motivated by these findings, we examined whether artificial neural network (ANN) models trained on natural movies show improved performance if pre-trained with retinal waves. We employed the spatio-temporally complex task of next-frame prediction, in which the ANN was trained to predict the next frame based on preceding input frames of a movie. We found that pre-training ANNs with retinal waves enhances the processing of real-world visual stimuli and accelerates learning. Strikingly, even when matching the total training time by merely replacing initial training epochs on naturalistic stimuli with exposure to retinal waves, an ANN trained on retinal waves temporarily outperforms one trained solely on natural movies. Similar to observations made in biological systems, we also found that pre-training with spontaneous activity refines the receptive field of ANN neurons. Overall, our work sheds light on the functional role of spatio-temporally patterned spontaneous activity in the processing of motion in natural scenes, suggesting it acts as a training signal to prepare the developing visual system for adult visual processing.

Author summaryBefore the onset of vision, the retina generates its own spontaneous activity, referred to as retinal waves. This activity is crucial for establishing neural connections and, hence, ensuring the proper functionality of the visual system. Recent research has shown that retinal waves exhibit statistical properties similar to those of natural visual stimuli, such as the optic flow of objects in the environment during forward motion. We investigate whether retinal waves can prepare the visual system for motion processing by pre-training artificial neural network (ANN) models with retinal waves. We tested the ANNs on next-frame prediction tasks, where the model predicts the next frame of a video based on previous frames. Our results showed that ANNs pre-trained with retinal waves exhibit faster learning on movies featuring naturalistic stimuli.

However, there are major observable and unobservable confounding factors that can contribute to the estimated differences. Males have larger head sizes than females. Head size differences not only act as a confounding factor in studying sex differences in the brain, but also impact its anatomy and functioning. In this work, we seek to disentangle the effect of head size from sex in studying sex differentiated aging trajectories, its relation to canonical functional networks and cytoarchitectural classes, brain allometry, cognition. Using the UK Biobank (UKBB) neuroimaging data (N = 35,732 participants, 19,281 females, 44-82 years of age), we created a subsample (N = 11,294) where females (N = 5,657) and males were matched by their total intracranial volume (TIV) and age, a subsample that maintains the UKBB sample distribution, one matched only by age, and one that exaggerated the TIV difference between sexes. We then modeled the aging trajectories at both regional and vertex-wise levels in the four subsamples, and compared the estimations of the models. Our results show that when females and males have the same head size, the overall sex estimations tend towards zero, suggesting that most of the variability results from head size differences. Our approach also revealed bidirectional sex differences in brain neuroanatomy previously masked by the effect of head size. Further, the scaling relationship between regional and total brain volume remains fairly consistent across the lifespan and is not sex differentiated overall. We evaluated how the results of cognitive tests with perceived sex differences are influenced and explained by head size and found that although the correlation between TIV and cognitive scores is low, the matching process changes the direction of the effect sizes of differences between sexes in ""verbal and numerical reasoning"" and ""working memory"" cognitive domains. Taken together, employing a matching approach that is widely used in causal modeling studies, we provide new evidence for disentanglement of sex differences in the brain from head size as a biological confound.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

Increases in activity during a cognitive task are often assumed to reflect the processing of task-relevant information, while reductions can be interpreted as suppression of irrelevant activity to facilitate task goals. Here, we explore the relationship between task-induced increases and decreases in activity from a geometric perspective. Using a technique known as kriging, developed in earth sciences, we examined whether the spatial organisation of brain regions showing positive activity could be predicted based on the spatial layout of regions showing activity decreases (and vice versa). Consistent with this hypothesis we established the spatial distribution of regions showing reductions in activity could predict (i) regions showing task-relevant increases in activity in both groups of humans and single individuals; (ii) patterns of neural activity captured by calcium imaging in mice; and, (iii) showed a high degree of generalisability across task contexts. Our analysis, therefore, establishes that antagonistic relationships between brain regions are topographically determined, a spatial analog for the well documented anti-correlation between brain systems over time.

Significance StatementIt is well documented that brain activity changes in response to the demands of different situations, although what gives rise to the observed cortical activity patterns remains poorly understood. Using analytic tools from earth sciences, we examined whether the landscape of regional changes in activity emerge from a set of common topographical causes. Using only regions showing decreases in activity, we could predict the landscape of regions showing increases in activity using fMRI in humans and calcium imaging in mice. Our results suggest topographical principles determine the landscape of peaks and valleys in brain activity -- a spatial analog for the well documented anti-correlation between sets of brain regions over time.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

A pitch percept is formed by weighting different acoustic cues (e.g., signal fundamental frequency and inter-harmonic spacing) and contextual cues (expectation). How and when such cues are neurally encoded and integrated remains debated. In this study, twenty-eight participants listened to tone sequences with different acoustic cues (pure tones, complex missing fundamental tones, and ambiguous mixtures), placed in predictable and less predictable sequences, while magnetoencephalography was recorded. Decoding analyses revealed that pitch was encoded in neural responses to all three tone types, in the low-to-mid auditory cortex, bilaterally, with right-hemisphere dominance. The pattern of activity generalized across cue-types, offset in time: pitch was neurally encoded earlier for harmonic tones ([~]85ms) than pure tones ([~]95ms). For ambiguous tones, pitch emerged significantly earlier in predictable contexts, and could be decoded even before tone onset. The results suggest that a unified neural representation of pitch emerges by integrating independent pitch cues, and that context alters the dynamics of pitch generation when acoustic cues are ambiguous.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

We discovered that BMAL2 plays a role in the initiation, progression, post resection survival, and KRAS activity in PDAC. Functional analysis of BMAL2 target genes led us to hypothesize that it plays a role in regulating the response to hypoxia, a critical but poorly understood feature of PDAC physiology. Knockout of BMAL2 in multiple human PDAC cell lines revealed effects on viability and invasion, particularly under hypoxic conditions. Loss of BMAL2 also affected glycolysis and other metabolic processes. We found that BMAL2 directly regulates hypoxia-responsive target genes. We also found that BMAL2 is necessary for the stabilization of HIF1A upon exposure to hypoxia, but destabilizes HIF2A under hypoxia. These data demonstrate that BMAL2 is a master transcriptional regulator of hypoxia responses in PDAC and may serve as a long-sought molecular switch that distinguishes HIF1A- and HIF2A-dependent modes of hypoxic metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

One approach for treating these diseases is to bind small molecules to the structured RNAs. Both Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) are caused by a r(CUG) repeat expansion, or r(CUG)exp. The RNA folds into a hairpin structure with a periodic array of 1x1 nucleotide UU loops (5'CUG/3'GUC; where the underlined nucleotides indicate the Us in the internal loop) that sequester various RNA-binding proteins (RBP) and hence the source of its gain-of-function. Here, we report NMR-refined structures of single 5'CUG/3'GUC motifs in complex with three different small molecules, a di-guandinobenzoate (1), a derivative of 1 where the guanidino groups have been exchanged for imidazole (2), and a quinoline with improved drug-like properties (3). These structures were determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and simulated annealing with restrained molecular dynamics (MD). Compounds 1, 2, and 3 formed stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions with the 5'CUG/3'GUC motif. Compound 3 also formed van der Waals interactions with the internal loop. The global structure of each RNA-small molecule complexes retains an A-form conformation, while the internal loops are still dynamic but to a lesser extent compared to the unbound form. These results aid our understanding of ligand-RNA interactions and enable structure-based design of small molecules with improved binding affinity for and biological activity against r(CUG)exp. As the first ever reported structures of RNA r(CUG) repeats bound to ligands, these structures can enable virtual screening campaigns combined with machine learning assisted de novo design.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

The construction of standardized and reusable part libraries, their assembly into transcription units, and the subsequent assembly of multigene constructs is highly reliable and sustainable. Researchers can quickly construct derivatives of their assemblies or entire pathways, and importantly, the standardization of Golden Gate assemblies is compatible with laboratory automation. Most Golden Gate strategies rely on four nucleotide overhangs generated by commonly used Type IIS enzymes. However, reduction to three nucleotide overhangs allows the use of codons as fusion sites and reduces potential scar sequences. This is particularly important when studying biological functions, as additional nucleotides may alter the structure or stability of the transcribed RNA. To address this issue we use SapI, a Type IIS enzyme generating three nucleotide overhangs, for transcription unit assembly, allowing for codon-based fusion in coding sequences. We created a corresponding plasmid toolbox for basic part generation and transcription unit assembly, a workflow we term In-Cloning. In-Cloning is downstream compatible with the Modular Cloning standard developed by Sylvestre Marillonnet's group for standardized assembly of multigene constructs. However, the multigene construct plasmids may not be compatible for use with the model organism of choice. Therefore, we have developed a workflow called Out-Cloning to rapidly generate Golden Gate acceptor plasmids. Out-Cloning uses standardized plasmid parts that are assembled into Golden Gate acceptor plasmids using flexible linkers. This allows the systematic construction of acceptor plasmids needed to transfer assembled DNA into the organism of interest.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331439

Genome-wide knockout analyses indicated that supplementation with aspartate (ASP) or asparagine (ASN) could potentially ameliorate these metabolic deficiencies. Further metabolic assessments in Long COVID patients highlighted the significant downregulation of ASP in both blood and muscle, supporting our predictions.

We investigated the associations between genetic liability to sedentary behavior, sedentariness, and four main CVD outcomes: any CVD, hypertensive diseases, ischemic heart diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases.

MethodsLeisure screen time was used as a proxy for sedentary behavior. We developed a polygenic score for leisure screen time (PGS LST) based on over 890,000 genetic variants. We tested the validity of this score against self-reported LST in the older Finnish Twin Cohort (FTC, N=2,689, mean age of 60.5{+/-}3.7 years, 54.7% women) using linear regression. We examined the associations between PGS LST and register-based records of CVDs using survival models among FinnGen participants (N=293,250-333,012, 67.0{+/-}13.0 years at follow-up, 52.3% women). We replicated analyses in an independent cohort (Trondelag Health Study [HUNT], N=35,289, 64.0{+/-}13.1 years, 51.6% women) and explored if the associations persist following adjustments for socioeconomic status, body mass index, and smoking or are mediated via reduced physical activity.

ResultsIn the FTC, each standard deviation increase in PGS LST was associated with greater self-reported LST (hours/day) ({beta} = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.05-0.14). In FinnGen, each standard deviation increase in PGS LST was associated with a higher risk of incident CVD (hazard ratio: 1.05, [1.05-1.06]) (168,770 cases over 17,101,133 person-years).The magnitudes of association for three most common CVDs were 1.09 (1.08-1.09), 1.06 (1.05-1.07), and 1.05 (1.04-1.06) for hypertensive diseases, ischemic heart diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases, respectively. Those in the top decile of PGS LST had 21%, 35%, 26%, and 19% higher risk of any CVD, hypertensive diseases, ischemic heart diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases, respectively, than those in the bottom decile. Associations replicated in HUNT and remained independent of covariates except for cerebrovascular diseases. Besides direct effects, reduced physical activity served as a potential mediating pathway for the associations.

ConclusionsA higher genetic liability to sedentary behavior is associated with a greater risk of developing CVDs, although effect sizes with current PGS remain small. Our findings suggest that genetic liability to sedentary behavior is an underrecognized driver of common CVDs.

Clinical perspectiveWhat is new?

O_LIIt is not known whether a genetic liability to sedentary behavior is a mutual underlying factor for both sedentary behavior and incident cardiovascular disease at the population level.
C_LIO_LIWe observed that a higher polygenic score for leisure screen time was associated with more self-reported leisure screen time and a higher risk of common cardiovascular diseases.

What are the clinical implications?

O_LIThis study provides novel insights into the relationship between genetic predisposition to sedentary behavior and the development of cardiovascular diseases, shedding light on a previously underexplored aspect of disease etiology.
C_LIO_LIThese results may motivate health professionals to encourage sedentary persons to undertake at least some physical activity.

Traditional alignment-based methods, though widely used, are computationally intense and reliant on extensive reference databases, often failing to detect novel pathogens due to their low sensitivity and specificity. Similarly, conventional machine learning techniques, while promising, require large annotated datasets and extensive feature engineering and are prone to overfitting. Addressing these challenges, we introduce PathoLM, a cutting-edge pathogen language model optimized for the identification of pathogenicity in bacterial and viral sequences. Leveraging the strengths of pre-trained DNA models such as the Nucleotide Transformer, PathoLM requires minimal data for fine-tuning, thereby enhancing pathogen detection capabilities. It effectively captures a broader genomic context, significantly improving the identification of novel and divergent pathogens. We developed a comprehensive data set comprising approximately 30 species of viruses and bacteria, including ESKAPEE pathogens, seven notably virulent bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics. Additionally, we curated a species classification dataset centered specifically on the ESKAPEE group. In comparative assessments, PathoLM dramatically outperforms existing models like DciPatho, demonstrating robust zero-shot and few-shot capabilities.

However, the outcomes of nuclear invagination remain unclear. This work identified a new function of nuclear invagination: regulating ribosome biogenesis. With expansion microscopy, we observed frequent physical contact between nuclear invaginations and nucleoli. Surprisingly, the higher the invagination curvature, the more ribosomal RNA and pre-ribosomes are made in the contacted nucleolus. By growing cells on nanopillars that generate nuclear invaginations with desired curvatures, we can increase and decrease ribosome biogenesis. Based on this causation, we repressed the ribosome levels in breast cancer and progeria cells by growing cells on low-curvature nanopillars, indicating that overactivated ribosome biogenesis can be rescued by reshaping nuclei. Mechanistically, high-curvature nuclear invaginations reduce heterochromatin and enrich nuclear pore complexes, which promote ribosome biogenesis. We anticipate that our findings will serve as a foundation for further studies on nuclear deformation.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

We hypothesized that a genomic comparison of mutations in pre-treated versus treatment-naive tumors would serve to identify genes that confer resistance. A challenge in such an analysis is that therapy alters mutation burdens and signatures, confounding association studies and complicating identifying causal, selected mutations. We developed DiffInvex, a framework for identifying changes in selection acting on individual genes in somatic genomes. Crucially, DiffInvex draws on a mutation rate baseline that accounts for these shifts in neutral mutagenesis during cancer evolution. We applied DiffInvex to 9,953 cancer whole-genomes from 29 cancer types from 8 studies, containing both WGS of treatment-naive tumors and tumors pre-treated by various drugs, identifying genes where point mutations are under conditional positive or negative selection for a certain chemotherapeutic, suggesting resistance mechanisms occurring via point mutation. DiffInvex confirmed well-known chemoresistance-driver mutations in EGFR, ESR1, KIT and AR genes as being under conditional positive selection, with additional cancer types identified for EGFR and KIT. Additionally, DiffInvex identified 11 genes with treatment-associated selection for different classes of therapeutics. In most cases, these genes were common cancer genes including PIK3CA, APC, MAP2K4 and MAP3K1. This suggests that tumor resistance to therapy via mutation often occurs via selective advantages conferred by known driver genes, rather than via mutations in specialized resistance genes. Various gene-chemotherapy associations were further supported in tests for functional impact of mutations, again implemented in a conditional selection setting, as well as replicating in independent panel or exome sequencing data. In addition to nominating drug resistance genes that could be targeted by future therapeutics, DiffInvex can also be applied to diverse analysis in cancer evolution, such as comparing normal and tumoral tissues, or analyzing subclonal evolution, identifying changes in selection over time.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

Adolescence is considered a crucial period for the maturation of excitation-inhibition balance. This has been primarily observed in animal studies, yet human in vivo evidence on adolescent maturation of the excitation-inhibition balance at the individual level is limited. Here, we developed an individualized in vivo marker of regional excitation-inhibition balance in human adolescents, estimated using large-scale simulations of biophysical network models fitted to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from two independent cross-sectional (N = 752) and longitudinal (N = 149) cohorts. We found a widespread relative increase of inhibition in association cortices paralleled by a relative age-related increase of excitation, or lack of change, in sensorimotor areas across both datasets. This developmental pattern co-aligned with multiscale markers of sensorimotor-association differentiation. The spatial pattern of excitation-inhibition development in adolescence was robust to inter-individual variability of structural connectomes and modeling configurations. Notably, we found that alternative simulation-based markers of excitation-inhibition balance show a variable sensitivity to maturational change. Taken together, our study highlights an increase of inhibition during adolescence in association areas using cross sectional and longitudinal data, and provides a robust computational framework to estimate microcircuit maturation in vivo at the individual level.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

Given evidence from animal models that thalamic axons modulate windows of cortical plasticity7-12, here we evaluate the overarching hypothesis that structural connections between the thalamus and cortex help to coordinate cortical maturational heterochronicity during youth. We first introduce, cortically annotate, and anatomically validate a new atlas of human thalamocortical connections using diffusion tractography. By applying this atlas to three independent youth datasets (ages 8-23 years; total N = 2,676), we reproducibly demonstrate that thalamocortical connections develop along a maturational gradient that aligns with the cortexs sensorimotor-association axis. Associative cortical regions with thalamic connections that take longest to mature exhibit protracted expression of neurochemical, structural, and functional markers indicative of higher circuit plasticity as well as heightened environmental sensitivity. This work highlights a central role for the thalamus in the orchestration of hierarchically organized and environmentally sensitive windows of cortical developmental malleability.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

Methods like AlphaFold have revolutionized protein structure prediction based only on the amino-acid sequence. However, proteins often appear in multiple different conformations, and it is highly relevant to resolve the full conformational distribution. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo EM) is a powerful tool for capturing a large number of images of a given protein, frequently in different conformations (referred to as particles). The images are, however, very noisy projections of the protein, and traditional methods for cryo EM reconstruction are limited to recovering a single, or a few, conformations. In this paper, we introduce cryoSPHERE, a deep learning method that takes as input a nominal protein structure, e.g. from AlphaFold, learns how to divide it into segments, and how to move these as approximately rigid bodies to fit the different conformations present in the cryo EM dataset. This formulation is shown to provide enough constraints to recover meaningful reconstructions of single protein structures. This is illustrated in three examples where we show consistent improvements over the current state-of-the-art for heterogeneous reconstruction.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

Using a combination of cell biological profiling, genetic engineering, and experimental evolution, we show that chromosome fusions are well tolerated up until a critical point. Cells with fewer than five centromeres lack the necessary number of kinetochore-microtubule attachments needed to counter outward forces in the metaphase spindle, triggering the spindle assembly checkpoint and prolonging metaphase.

Here we examine islet isolation and cell culture outcomes at the Alberta Diabetes Institute (ADI) IsletCore (n=197). Research-focused isolations typically have a lower yield of islet equivalents (IEQ), with a median of 252,876 IEQ, but a higher purity (median 85%) than clinically-focused isolations before culture. The median recovery of IEQs after culture was 75%, suggesting some loss. This was associated with a shift towards smaller islet particles, indicating possible islet fragmentation, and occurred within 24 hours with no further loss after longer periods of culture (up to 136 hours). No overall change in stimulation index as a measure of islet function was seen with culture time. These findings were replicated in a representative cohort of clinical islet preparations from the Clinical Islet Transplant Program at the University of Alberta. Thus, loss of islets occurs within 24 hours of isolation and there is no further impact of extended culture prior to islet distribution for research.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

But with hundreds of copies of rDNA genes it is unknown whether they possess sequence variations that form different types of ribosomes that affect human physiology and disease. Here, we developed an algorithm for variant-calling between paralog genes (termed RGA) and compared rDNA variations found in short- and long-read sequencing data from the 1,000 Genomes Project (1KGP) and Genome In A Bottle (GIAB). We additionally developed a novel protocol for long-read sequencing full-length rRNA (RIBO-RT) from actively translating ribosomes. Our analyses identified hundreds of rDNA variants, most of which, surprisingly, are short insertion-deletions (indels) and dozens of highly abundant rRNA variants that are incorporated into translationally active ribosomes. To visualize variant ribosomes at the single cell level, we developed an in-situ rRNA sequencing method (SWITCH-seq) which revealed that variants are co-expressed within individual cells. Strikingly, by analyzing rDNA, we found that variants assemble into distinct ribosome subtypes. We discovered that these subtypes acquire different rRNA structures by successfully employing dimethyl sulfate (DMS) probing of full length rRNA. With this atlas we investigated rRNA variation changes across human tissues and cancer types. This revealed tissue-specific rRNA subtype expression in endoderm/ectoderm-derived tissues. In cancer, low abundant rRNA variants can become highly expressed, which suggests the presence of cancer-specific ribosomes. Together, this study identifies and comprehensively characterizes the diversity of ribosomes at the level of rRNA variants which is dominated by indel variants, their chromosomal location and unique structure as well as the association of ribosome variation with tissue-specific biology and cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

Among these approaches, the amplicon-based metagenomics relies on specific genetic markers, such as the 16S rRNA gene, while the shotgun metagenomics annotates the whole bacterial DNA. Despite the 16S being the gold standard marker, studies highlighted its inefficiency in characterising and quantifying divergent bacterial groups such as the Candidate Phyla Radiation. On the other hand, shotgun metagenomics is highly informative and accurate but it is more expensive and requires computational resources and time. In this study, we propose RecA as a pan-bacterial genetic marker, particularly suitable for the Candidate Phyla Radiation. Indeed, we found that applying a Random Forest machine learning model on RecA amino acid sequences provides an accurate and fast taxonomic annotation across the whole bacterial tree of life. Ultimately, we produced Forestax, a tool for the characterisation and quantification of bacterial communities in metagenomics data, on the basis of RecA sequences. The analyses showed that RecA-based metagenomics has a taxonomic accuracy comparable to other multi-gene approaches, reinforcing RecA as a powerful marker for taxonomic annotation in bacteria. In perspective, RecA could be considered as a broad-spectrum marker for amplicon-based studies to overcome the limits of 16S rRNA.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

Ulva-associated bacteria exhibit high turnover across environmental gradients, leading to the hypothesis that bacteria contribute to the acclimation potential of the host. Yet little is known about the variation in the functional profile of Ulva-associated bacteria in relation to environmental changes. To test which microbial functions shift alongside a strong environmental gradient, we analysed microbial communities of 91 Ulva samples across a 2,000 km Atlantic-Baltic Sea salinity gradient using metagenomic sequencing. Metabolic reconstruction of 639 metagenome-assembled genomes revealed widespread potential for carbon, sulphur, nitrogen, and vitamin metabolism, including amino acid and vitamin B biosynthesis. While salinity explained 70% of taxonomic variation, it only accounted for 17% of functional variation, indicating extensive functional stability. The limited variation was attributed to typical high-salinity bacteria exhibiting enrichment in genes for thiamine, pyridoxal, and betaine biosynthesis. These metabolic modules likely contribute to oxidative stress mitigation, cellular osmotic homeostasis, and membrane stabilization in response to salinity variations. Our results emphasise the importance of functional profiling to understand the seaweed holobiont and its collective response to environmental change.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

It is estimated that 783 million by 2045 will live with diabetes worldwide, 90% of those cases are type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a multifaceted disease, its treatment requires a holistic approach, beyond single target medications with high efficacy. There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3, which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 and KP.2.3, which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

We hypothesized that sex-specific immune dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of LC. To investigate the immunologic underpinnings of LC development and persistence, we used single-cell transcriptomics, single-cell proteomics, and plasma proteomics on blood samples obtained during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and at 3 and 12 months post-infection in a cohort of 45 patients who either developed LC or recovered. Several sex-specific immune pathways were associated with LC. Specifically, males who would develop LC at 3 months had widespread increases in TGF-{beta} signaling during acute infection in proliferating NK cells. Females who would develop LC demonstrated increased expression of XIST, an RNA gene implicated in autoimmunity, and increased IL1 signaling in monocytes at 12 months post infection. Several immune features of LC were also conserved across sexes. Both males and females with LC had reduced co-stimulatory signaling from monocytes and broad upregulation of NF-{kappa}B transcription factors. In both sexes, those with persistent LC demonstrated increased LAG3, a marker of T cell exhaustion, reduced ETS1 transcription factor expression across lymphocyte subsets, and elevated intracellular IL-4 levels in T cell subsets, suggesting that ETS1 alterations may drive an aberrantly elevated Th2-like response in LC. Altogether, this study describes multiple innate and adaptive immune correlates of LC, some of which differ by sex, and offers insights toward the pursuit of tailored therapeutics.

Parvalbumin (PV) INs inhibit PCs and are activated by local and extrinsic inputs. Thus, SOM and VIP INs exhibit complementary roles in feedback and feedforward inhibition, respectively, while PV INs contribute to both microcircuit motifs. Functionally, each IN subtype reveals unique activity patterns across fear- and extinction learning with SOM and VIP INs showing most divergent characteristics, and PV INs display an intermediate phenotype parallelling synaptic data. Finally, SOM and PV INs dynamically track behavioral state transitions across learning.

Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans.

For this purpose, numerous detergents, amphipols, polymers and membrane scaffold proteins are available. The choice of the specific membrane substitute can strongly affect the proteins specific activity, stability and conformational spectrum, potentially leading to errors or misinterpretation during analysis. The bacterial ATP-binding cassette transporter MsbA is a prominent example of such environment-specific bias, resulting in apparent conformational and activity responses.

Here, we present a systematic analysis of the conformational spectrum of MsbA, stabilized in a dozen environments, using cryo-EM. Our data show pronounced structural feedback of the ABC transporter to the respective membrane mimetics. Detergents generally favour a conformation with wide separation of the nucleotide-binding domains, while nanodiscs induce the narrow conformation. Notably, only three of the dozen tested environments allow MsbA to sample the functional conformational spectrum, enabling full movement of the nucleotide-binding domains between narrow and wide inward-facing conformations. We expect this study to serve as a blueprint for other membrane proteins, even where the structural reaction to the hydrophobic environment is not directly visible but still critical for the proteins function.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

However, replicating this protocol to match the productivity of the traditional PURE system can take considerable time and effort due to variability in the expression level of individual proteins. In this work, we observed unstable PURE protein expression in two E. coli protein expression strains, M15/pREP4 and BL21(DE3), and addressed this instability using catabolite repression. We identified key proteins whose concentration in the One-Pot PURE mixture significantly impacted the reactions protein expression capacity. Compared to the original method using two E. coli protein expression strains, we found that consolidating all expression vectors onto one BL21 (DE3) strain led to more uniform cell growth at the time of protein induction, thereby improving the composition of critical translation initiation factors in the purified mixture for efficient translation. We also found that variations in commercial energy solution formulations could compensate for deficiencies in the One-Pot PURE protein composition. Additionally, our study revealed significant differences in the translation capacity of commercially available E. coli tRNAs, suggesting the potential of optimizing tRNA composition to improve protein translation.

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1719180331440

Here, we show how that the presence of heterogeneity in the spatial autocorrelation across brain maps may affect statistical inference in common approaches for spatially correlated maps. In response, we highlight the need to explicitly model spatial processes, including non-stationarity, for more accurate statistical inference. We illustrate how a Bayesian spatial regression approach can be applied to compare functional and structural cortical brain maps, even in the presence of heterogeneity. By explicitly modelling spatial processes underlying the data, a much wider and more sophisticated range of neurobiological questions can be answered about the relationship between brain maps than with current approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

We uncover three syntactic networks that are broadly distributed across traditional language regions, but with focal concentrations in middle and inferior frontal gyri. In contrast to previous findings from comprehension studies, these networks process syntax mostly to the exclusion of words and meaning, supporting a cognitive architecture with a distinct syntactic system. Most strikingly, our data reveal an unexpected property of syntax: it is encoded independent of neural activity levels.

While the TMEs impact on immunotherapy has been extensively studied, its role in chemotherapy response remains less explored. To address this, we developed DECODEM (DEcoupling Cell-type-specific Outcomes using DEconvolution and Machine learning), a generic computational framework leveraging cellular deconvolution of bulk transcriptomics to associate the gene expression of individual cell types in the TME with clinical response. Employing DECODEM to analyze the gene expression of breast cancer (BC) patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we find that the gene expression of specific immune cells (myeloid, plasmablasts, B-cells) and stromal cells (endothelial, normal epithelial, CAFs) are highly predictive of chemotherapy response, going beyond that of the malignant cells. These findings are further tested and validated in a single-cell cohort of triple negative breast cancer. To investigate the possible role of immune cell-cell interactions (CCIs) in mediating chemotherapy response, we extended DECODEM to DECODEMi to identify such CCIs, validated in single-cell data. Our findings highlight the importance of active pre-treatment immune infiltration for chemotherapy success. The tools developed here are made publicly available and are applicable for studying the role of the TME in mediating response from readily available bulk tumor expression in a wide range of cancer treatments and indications.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

Traditional link prediction (LP) methods, using similarity metrics like Personalized PageRank, are limited in capturing the complexity of biological networks. Recently, representation-based learning techniques have emerged, mapping nodes to low-dimensional embeddings to enhance prediction accuracy. However, these methods often face challenges with interpretability and scalability in large, complex networks. Based on a representation of biological systems as knowledge graphs (KGs), which encode entities and their relationships as triplets, we propose here BioKGC, a novel graph neural network framework which builds upon the Neural Bellman-Ford Network (NBFNet). It addresses the limitations of previous methods by utilizing path-based reasoning for LP in biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs). Unlike node-embedding learning frameworks that optimize the embedding space based on single triplets, BioKGC learns representations between nodes by considering all relations along paths. This approach enhances prediction accuracy and interpretability, allowing for the visualization of influential paths and facilitating the validation of biological plausibility. BioKGC leverages a background regulatory graph (BRG) for enhanced message passing and implements a stringent negative sampling strategy to improve learning precision. In evaluations across various LP tasks -- gene function annotation, drug-disease interaction prediction, synthetic lethality prediction, and lncRNA-mRNA regulatory relationship inference -- BioKGC consistently outperformed state-of-the art methods. BioKGC outperformed knowledge graph embedding and GNN-based methods in gene function prediction, especially with BRG information. We demonstrated that BioKGC effectively predicts drug-disease interactions in zero-shot learning scenarios, surpassing state-of-the-art models like TxGNN. Additionally, BioKGC demonstrated robust performance in synthetic lethality prediction and the capacity for scoring novel lncRNA-mRNA interactions, showcasing its versatility in diverse biomedical applications. One of BioKGCs key advantages is its interpretability, enabling researchers to trace prediction paths and gain insights into molecular mechanisms. Combined with its use of regulatory information for message passing, BioKGC is a powerful tool for predicting complex biological interactions, making it valuable for drug discovery and personalized medicine.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

Extensive research in rodents, along with some evidence in humans, suggests that single-neuron activity at specific phases of theta oscillations plays a crucial role in memory processes. Our fundamental understanding of such theta-phase locking in humans and its dependency on basic electrophysiological properties of the local field potential is still limited, however. Here, using single-neuron recordings in epilepsy patients performing a spatial memory task, we thus aimed at improving our understanding of factors modulating theta-phase locking in the human brain. Combining a generalized-phase approach for frequency-adaptive theta-phase estimation with time-resolved spectral parameterization, our results show that theta-phase locking is a strong and prevalent phenomenon across human medial temporal lobe regions, both during spatial memory encoding and retrieval. Neuronal theta-phase locking increased during periods of elevated theta power, when clear theta oscillations were present, and when aperiodic activity exhibited steeper slopes. Theta-phase locking was similarly strong during successful and unsuccessful memory, and most neurons activated at similar theta phases between encoding and retrieval. Some neurons changed their preferred theta phases between encoding and retrieval, in line with the idea that different memory processes are separated within the theta cycle. Together, these results help disentangle how different properties of local field potentials and memory states influence theta-phase locking of human single neurons. This contributes to a better understanding of how interactions between single neurons and local field potentials may support human spatial memory.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

To solve this ambiguity, animals form hierarchical associations in which the context acts as a gatekeeper in the retrieval of the appropriate cue-evoked memory, ensuring context-appropriate behavior. These hierarchical associative structures also influence future learning by promoting the formation of new context-dependent associations (leading to the inference of context-dependency for new associations). The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the dorsal hippocampus (DH) are both proposed to encode a ""cognitive map"" that includes the representation of hierarchical, context-dependent, associations. However the causal role of the OFC and DH in the different functional properties of hierarchical associations remains controversial. Here we used chemogenetic inactivations, in rats, to examine the role of OFC and DH in 1) the contextual regulation of performance, and 2) the contextual learning bias conferred by hierarchical associations. We show that OFC is required for both manifestations of hierarchical associations. In contrast, DH contribution appears limited to the contextual learning bias. This study provides novel insight into the different functional properties of context-dependent hierarchical associations, and establishes the OFC as a critical orchestrator of these different contextual effects.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

Rnf is widespread in primordial organisms and the evolutionary predecessor of the Na+-pumping NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (Nqr)1. By running in reverse, Rnf reduces ferredoxin with NADH as reductant at the expense of the transmembrane electrochemical ion gradient and provides low potential electrons for nitrogenases as well as CO2 reductases. Yet, the molecular principles that couple the long-range electron transfer to the Na+ translocation across the membrane remain elusive. Here we resolve key functional states along the electron transfer pathway using redox-controlled cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that, in combination with biochemical functional assays and atomistic molecular simulations, provide key insight into the redox-driven Na+ pumping mechanism. We show that the reduction of the unique membrane-embedded [2Fe2S] cluster in the vestibule between the RnfA/E subunits electrostatically attracts the sodium ions, and in turn, triggers an inward/outward transition with alternating membrane access driving the Na+ pump and the reduction of NAD+. Our study unveils an ancient mechanism for redox-driven ion pumping, and provides key understanding of the fundamental principles governing energy conversion in biological systems.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

To produce the contractile forces required for the controlled excision of cell-like compartments such as giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), reconstituted cytokinetic rings made of actin are considered to be among the most promising structures of a potential synthetic division machinery. Although the targeting of actin rings to GUV membranes and their myosin-induced constriction have been previously demonstrated, large-scale vesicle deformation has been precluded due to the lacking spatial control of these contractile structures. Here, we show the combined in vitro reconstitution of actomyosin rings and the bacterial MinDE protein system, effective in targeting E.coli Z-rings to mid-cell, within GUVs. Incorporating this spatial positioning tool, which induces active transport of any diffusible molecule on membranes, yields self-organized assembly of actomyosin rings at the equatorial plane of vesicles. Remarkably, the synergistic effect of Min oscillations and the contractile nature of actomyosin bundles induces mid-vesicle membrane deformation and striking bleb-like protrusions, leading to shape remodeling and symmetry breaking. Our system showcases how functional machineries from various organisms may be synergistically combined in vitro, leading to the emergence of new functionality towards a synthetic division system.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

Such discordance has hampered interpretation and convergence of research findings across the field. To address this problem, we have developed the Network Correspondence Toolbox (NCT) to permit researchers to examine and report spatial correspondence between their novel neuroimaging results and sixteen widely used functional brain atlases, consistent with recommended reporting standards developed by the Organization for Human Brain Mapping.

The atlases included in the toolbox show some topographical convergence for specific networks, such as those labeled as ""default"" or ""visual"". Network naming varies across atlases, particularly for networks spanning frontoparietal association cortices. For this reason, quantitative comparison with multiple atlases is recommended to benchmark novel neuroimaging findings.

We provide several exemplar demonstrations using the Human Connectome Project task fMRI results and UK Biobank independent component analysis maps to illustrate how researchers can use the NCT to report their own findings through quantitative evaluation against multiple published atlases. The NCT provides a convenient means for computing Dice coefficients with spin test permutations to determine the magnitude and statistical significance of correspondence among user-defined maps and existing atlas labels. The NCT also includes functionality to incorporate additional atlases in the future. The adoption of the NCT will make it easier for network neuroscience researchers to report their findings in a standardized manner, thus aiding reproducibility and facilitating comparisons between studies to produce interdisciplinary insights.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

During foraging as well as during sleep, population activity drifted continuously and unidirectionally along a one-dimensional manifold. Boundaries between events were associated with discrete shifts in state space, suggesting that LEC dynamics directly reflect event segmentation. During tasks with a recurring temporal structure, activity traveled additionally in directions orthogonal to the flow of drift, enabling the LEC population to multiplex event information across different timescales.

While the molecular and cellular effects arising from experience with drugs like cocaine are increasingly well understood, the mechanisms that sculpt NAc ensemble participation are largely unknown. Here, we leveraged unbiased single-nucleus transcriptional profiling to identify expression of the secreted glycoprotein Reelin (encoded by the Reln gene) as a marker of cocaine-activated neuronal ensembles within the rat NAc. Multiplexed in situ detection confirmed selective expression of the immediate early gene Fos in Reln+ neurons after cocaine experience, and also revealed enrichment of Reln mRNA in Drd1+ medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in both the rat and human brain. Using a novel CRISPR interference strategy enabling selective Reln knockdown in the adult NAc, we observed altered expression of genes linked to calcium signaling, emergence of a transcriptional trajectory consistent with loss of cocaine sensitivity, and a striking decrease in MSN intrinsic excitability. At the behavioral level, loss of Reln prevented cocaine locomotor sensitization, abolished cocaine place preference memory, and decreased cocaine self-administration behavior. Together, these results identify Reelin as a critical mechanistic link between ensemble participation and cocaine-induced behavioral adaptations.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

Therefore, the abundance variation of regulatory proteins across unstimulated single cells can be associatively linked with their response to stimulation. Here we developed an approach that leverages this association across individual cells and nuclei to systematically identify potential regulators of biological processes, followed by targeted validation. Specifically, we applied this approach to identify regulators of nucleocytoplasmic protein transport in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To this end, we quantified the proteomes of 3,412 individual nuclei, sampling the dynamic response to LPS treatment, and linking functional variability to proteomic variability. Minutes after the stimulation, the protein transport in individual nuclei correlated strongly with the abundance of known protein transport regulators, thus revealing the impact of natural protein variability on functional cellular response. We found that simple biophysical constraints, such as the quantity of nuclear pores, partially explain the variability in LPS-induced nucleocytoplasmic transport. Among the many proteins newly identified to be associated with the response, we selected 16 for targeted validation by knockdown. The knockdown phenotypes confirmed the inferences derived from natural protein and functional variation of single nuclei, thus demonstrating the potential of (sub-)single-cell proteomics to infer functional regulation. We expect this approach to generalize to broad applications and enhance the functional interpretability of single-cell omics data.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

This has led to the evolution of numerous phage defensive systems in bacteria that are still being discovered, as well as numerous ways of interference or circumvention on the part of phages. Here, we identify a unique molecular battle between the classical biotype of Vibrio cholerae and virulent phages ICP1, ICP2, and ICP3. We show that classical biotype strains resist almost all isolates of these phages due to a 25-kb genomic island harboring several putative anti-phage systems. We observed that one of these systems, Nezha, encoding SIR2-like and helicase proteins, inhibited the replication of all three phages. Bacterial SIR2-like enzymes degrade the essential metabolic coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), thereby preventing replication of the invading phage. In support of this mechanism, we identified one phage isolate, ICP1_2001, which circumvents Nezha by encoding two putative NAD+ regeneration enzymes. By restoring the NAD+ pool, we hypothesize that this system antagonizes Nezha without directly interacting with either protein and should be able to antagonize other anti-phage systems that deplete NAD+.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

Existing cloning strategies allow to produce constructs for co-expression of proteins, but are often time-consuming, labour-intensive, host-specific, or involving error-prone assembly steps. Here we present a unique set of vectors together with a novel assembly strategy designed to overcome these limitations. It allows for the generation of expression constructs for multi-subunit protein complexes for various hosts in a single cloning step. Its modular nature allows the system to be easily extended to target additional expression hosts or to include new tags or regulatory sequences. As a proof of principle, we present the parallel construction of expression vectors for several Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes, allowing us to devise strategies for the recombinant production of these targets in bacteria, insect cells, and human cells, respectively.

This is exemplified by repressive chromatin domains frequently contacting nuclear lamina or nucleoli. The nucleolus undergoes structural changes in response to various cellular states, potentially impacting genome organization. However, how the 3D-genome organization responds to nucleolar states has remained underinvestigated due to the lack of methods able to identify nucleolar associated domains (NADs) in single cells and under nucleolar stress. To address this, we developed NoLMseq, a method combining laser-capture microdissection and DNA sequencing to map NADs in single cells. NoLMseq identified many unexplored features of chromosome organization around single nucleoli such as NAD heterogeneity among ESCs, culminating in two major populations with distinct chromatin states. The data also revealed that NADs prevalently contact nucleoli in a monoallelic manner and allelic nucleolar contact frequency sets gene expression and chromatin states. NoLMseq also revealed how chromosomes reorganise around nucleoli under nucleolar stress conditions, highlighting the importance of nucleolus integrity in genome organization and 3D-genome response to nucleolar stress. The results demonstrated that NoLMseq accurately measures chromosome contacts around single healthy and stressed nucleoli and it will be a critical tool to study NADs within biological populations and determine how the 3D-genome responds to nucleolar stress in healthy and disease states.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

Control of gene expression by GPCRs has been studied almost exclusively at the transcriptional level, neglecting an extensive amount of regulation that takes place translationally. Hence, little is known about the nature and mechanisms of gene-specific post-transcriptional regulation downstream of receptor activation. Here, we apply an unbiased multiomics approach to delineate an extensive translational regulatory program initiated by the prototypical beta2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2-AR) and provide mechanistic insights into how these processes are orchestrated. Using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), we identify nearly 120 novel gene targets of adrenergic receptor activity which expression is exclusively regulated at the level of translation. We next show that all translational changes are induced selectively by endosomal {beta}2-ARs. We further report that this proceeds through activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Specifically, within the set of translational GPCR targets we discover significant enrichment of genes with 5 terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, a gene class classically known to be translationally regulated by mTOR. We then demonstrate that endosomal {beta}2-ARs are required for mTOR activation and subsequent mTOR-dependent TOP mRNA translation. Together, this comprehensive analysis of drug-induced translational regulation establishes a critical role for location-biased GPCR signaling in fine-tuning the cellular protein landscape.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

Here, we comprehensively examined the response to human Notch1 across a time course of activation using genomic assays of nascent RNA and chromatin accessibility. These data revealed that Notch induces target gene transcription primarily by releasing paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), in contrast to prevailing models suggesting that Notch acts by promoting chromatin accessibility. Indeed, we found that open chromatin is established at Notch-responsive regulatory elements prior to Notch signaling, through SWI/SNF-mediated remodeling. Notch activation, however, elicited no further chromatin opening at these loci. Together, these studies reveal that the nuclear response to Notch signaling is dictated by the pre-existing chromatin state and RNAPII distribution at time of signal activation.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

As such, modern protein contamination limits access to endogenous proteomes. Here, we compare five approaches of bone protein decontamination applied to a Pleistocene Equus sp. bone fragment contaminated with a modern dog salivary proteome. We find that all tested methods reduce the protein contamination, but with different efficiencies. We find that a brief bleach wash is the most effective approach in removing modern protein contamination, and that no additional damage is caused to the endogenous proteome by this treatment. Next, we apply this approach to a hominin tooth found at Khudji, a Late Pleistocene archaeological site in Tajikistan. We demonstrate that a brief bleach wash removes almost all human skin protein contamination while retaining the endogenous hominin dentine proteome.

Responses to sub-lethal abiotic stress combinations are complex and often distinct from responses to individual stresses and remain poorly understood. Investigating traits and molecular factors mediating acclimation to stress combinations is essential for the development of climate change-resilient field crops. Here, we studied the morphological, physiological, and molecular responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to i) co-occurring high temperature and drought and ii) flooding sequentially followed by drought, both of which have increased in frequency due to climate change. A set of 15 physiological and morphological traits were assessed during single and combined stresses. By combining these comprehensive trait analyses with transcriptome characterization, we established the generally additive effects of simultaneous or sequential stresses on plant morphology and physiology compared to the corresponding individual stresses. Although drought had a mild effect in both stress combinations, a unique transcriptome signature emerged upon combination with high temperature simultaneously or flooding sequentially. Molecular processes identified as important for multi-stress resilience included plastid-nucleus communication, ABA signaling and photo-acclimation. Based on the RNA-seq data, a set of 39 genes was identified as potential multi-stress response regulators. Mutants were tested to validate their contribution to plant survival and phenotypic acclimation under combined stress. We confirmed the involvement of several genes in regulating phenotypic acclimation traits.

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022).

Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms.

The central biological question about HD pathogenesis has been how the disease-causing DNA repeat expansion (CAGn) in the huntingtin (HTT) gene leads to neurodegeneration after decades of apparent latency. Inherited HTT alleles with a longer CAG repeat hasten disease onset; the length of this repeat also changes over time, generating somatic mosaicism, and genes that regulate DNA-repeat stability can influence HD age-at-onset. To understand the relationship between a cells CAG-repeat length and its biological state, we developed a single-cell method for measuring CAG-repeat length together with genome-wide RNA expression. We found that the HTT CAG repeat expands from 40-45 CAGs to 100-500+ CAGs in HD-vulnerable SPNs but not in other striatal cell types, with these long DNA-repeat expansions acquired at different times by individual SPNs. Surprisingly, somatic expansion from 40 to 150 CAGs had no apparent effect upon gene expression - but neurons with 150-500+ CAGs shared profound gene-expression changes. These expression changes involved hundreds of genes, escalated alongside further CAG-repeat expansion, eroded positive and then negative features of neuronal identity, and culminated in expression of senescence/apoptosis genes. Rates of striatal neuron loss across HD stages reflected the rates at which neurons entered this biologically distorted state. Our results suggest that HTT CAG repeats in striatal neurons undergo decades of biologically quiet expansion, then, as they asynchronously cross a high threshold, cause SPNs to degenerate quickly and asynchronously. We conclude that, at any moment in the course of HD, most neurons have an innocuous (but unstable) huntingtin gene, and that HD pathogenesis is a DNA process for almost all of a neurons life.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

These ruminants were presumed not to be hosts for IAVs. Previously, IAV-positive mammalian species were hunters and scavengers, possibly getting infected while feeding on infected birds. It is now presumed that H5N1 viruses that circulate in US dairy cattle transmit through a mammary gland route, in contrast to transmission by aerosols via the respiratory tract, although the latter cannot be excluded. The receptor display in the mammary and respiratory tract in cows for IAVs is unknown. Here, we used recombinant HA proteins representing current circulating and classical H5 viruses to determine the distribution of IAV receptors in the respiratory and mammary tract tissues of cows and goats. Most of the sialome of the cow and goat respiratory tract is lined with sialic acid modifications such as N-glycolyl and O-acetyl, which are not bound by IAV. Interestingly, the H5 protein representing the cow isolates bound significantly in the mammary gland, whereas classical H5 proteins failed to do so. Furthermore, whereas the 9-O-acetyl modification is prominent in all tissues tested, the 5-N-glycolyl modification is not, resulting in the display of receptors for avian IAV hemagglutinins. This could explain the high levels of virus found in these tissues and milk, adding supporting data to this possible virus transmission route.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

However, to be included in national NCS inventories, governments must first quantify the kelp-derived carbon stocks and fluxes leading to carbon sequestration. Here, we present a blueprint for assessing the national carbon sequestration capacity of kelp forests in which data synthesis and Bayesian hierarchical modelling enable estimates of kelp forest carbon production, storage, and export capacity from limited data. Applying this blueprint to Canadas extensive coastline, we find kelp forests store an estimated 1.4 Tg C in short-term biomass and produce 3.1 Tg C yr-1 with modest carbon fluxes to the deep ocean. Arctic kelps had the highest carbon stocks and production capacity, while Pacific kelps had greater carbon fluxes overall due to their higher productivity and export rates. Our transparent, reproducible blueprint represents an important step towards accurate carbon accounting for kelp forests.","NA","biorxiv",1719180331440

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1719180331440

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1719180331440

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.
