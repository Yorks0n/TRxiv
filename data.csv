Persistently elevated autoantibodies have been found in some individuals with long COVID (LC). Using a >21,000 human protein array, we identified diverse AAB targets in LC patients that correlated with their symptoms. Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness. Our findings suggest that targeting AABs could benefit some LC patients.","NA","medrxiv",1721513135709

However, directed evolution methods are labor intensive, cannot efficiently optimize over multiple protein properties, and are often trapped by local maxima. In silico-directed evolution methods incorporating protein language models (PLMs) have the potential to accelerate this engineering process, but current approaches fail to generalize across diverse protein families. We introduce EVOLVEpro, a few-shot active learning framework to rapidly improve protein activity using a combination of PLMs and protein activity predictors, achieving improved activity with as few as four rounds of evolution. EVOLVEpro substantially enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of in silico protein evolution, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods and yielding proteins with up to 100-fold improvement of desired properties. We showcase EVOLVEpro for five proteins across three applications: T7 RNA polymerase for RNA production, a miniature CRISPR nuclease, a prime editor, and an integrase for genome editing, and a monoclonal antibody for epitope binding. These results demonstrate the advantages of few-shot active learning with small amounts of experimental data over zero-shot predictions. EVOLVEpro paves the way for broader applications of AI-guided protein engineering in biology and medicine.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Thereafter, JN.1 subvariants, such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1), KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), and KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which convergently acquired a deletion of Serine at the 31st position in S (S:S31del) in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We recently reported the virological features of JN.1 subvariants including KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3.2,3 Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.3.1.1. First, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3.1.1 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model4 based on genome surveillance data from Spain, the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, where this variant has spread as of June 2024. In Spain, the Re of KP.3.1.1 is over 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and even higher than those of KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein show higher Re for KP.3.1.1. However, it must be noted there is the possibility of overestimation in these countries due to more limited KP.3.1.1 sequence numbers. These results suggest that KP.3.1.1 will spread worldwide along with other JN.1 sublineages. We then assessed the virological properties of KP.3.1.1 using pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus of KP.3.1.1 had significantly higher infectivity than that of KP.3. Neutralization of KP.3.1.1 was tested using i) convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or EG.5, ii) convalescent sera after the infection with HK.3 or JN.1, and iii) sera after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.3.1.1 was significantly lower than KP.3 (1.4-1.6-fold) in all four groups of convalescent sera tested. KP.3.1.1 also showed a 1.3-fold lower NT50 against XBB.1.5 vaccine sera than KP.3. Moreover, KP.3.1.1 showed stronger resistance with a 1.3-fold lower NT50 with statistical significances to the convalescent sera infected with EG.5 and HK.3 than KP.2.3. Altogether, KP.3.1.1 exhibited a higher Re, higher pseudovirus infectivity, and higher neutralization evasion than KP.3. These results align with our recent report that the JN.1 subvariants with S:S31del (e.g., KP.2.3 and LB.1) exhibited enhanced Re and immune evasion compared to the other JN.1 subvariants without S:S31del (e.g., JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3), highlighting the evolutionary significance of S:S31del in the JN.1 lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Antioxidant delivery as a therapeutic for AAA is of substantial interest although clinical translation of antioxidant therapy has met with significant challenges due to limitations in achieving sufficient antioxidant levels at the site of AAA. We posit that nanoparticle-based approaches hold promise to overcome challenges associated with systemic administration of antioxidants.

MethodsWe employed a peptide-based nanoplatform to overexpress a key modulator of oxidative stress, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). The efficacy of systemic delivery of SOD2 mRNA as a nanotherapeutic agent was studied in two different murine AAA models. Unbiased mass spectrometry-enabled proteomics and high-dimensional bioinformatics were used to examine pathways modulated by SOD2 overexpression.

ResultsThe murine SOD2 mRNA sequence was mixed with p5RHH, an amphipathic peptide capable of delivering nucleic acids in vivo to form self-assembled nanoparticles of [~]55 nm in diameter. We further demonstrated that the nanoparticle was stable and functional up to four weeks following self-assembly when coated with hyaluronic acid. Delivery of SOD2 mRNA mitigated the expansion of small AAA and largely prevented rupture. Mitigation of AAA was accompanied by enhanced SOD2 protein expression in aortic wall tissue. Concomitant suppression of nitric oxide, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and cell death was observed. Proteomic profiling of AAA tissues suggests that SOD2 overexpression augments levels of microRNAs that regulate vascular inflammation and cell apoptosis, inhibits platelet activation/aggregation, and downregulates mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Gene set enrichment analysis shows that SOD2 mRNA delivery is associated with activation of oxidative phosphorylation, lipid metabolism, respiratory electron transportation, and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways.

ConclusionsThese results confirm that SOD2 is key modulator of oxidative stress in AAA. This nanotherapeutic mRNA delivery approach may find translational application in the medical management of small AAA and the prevention of AAA rupture.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Long-read sequencing platforms now produce data-types that can, in principle, drive routine definitive isoform quantification. However some particulars of contemporary long-read datatypes, together with isoform complexity and genetic variation, present bioinformatic challenges. We show here, using ONT data, that fast and accurate quantification of long-read data is possible and that it is improved by exome capture.

The latest example is the BA.2.86 Variant Of Interest (VOI), which rapidly outcompeted all other lineages following its detection in late July 2023. Descending sublineages dominated globally by July 2024, at the time of writing this study. The mechanisms by which highly-divergent viral lineages tend to emerge remain unclear, with the most strongly supported hypothesis being the acquisition of multiple mutations through accelerated evolution in chronically infected individuals, with spread back into the community facilitated by prolonged shedding. We used BA.2.86 as a case study to investigate the evolutionary process behind the emergence of a highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variant. Through fine-scale evolutionary analyses applied to four independently subsampled datasets, we identify over 100 genomes representing evolutionary intermediates occupying the branch in the phylogenetic tree leading to the BA.2.86*/JN.1* clade. Additionally, we detected more than 2,600 hybrid genomes across the evolutionary history of the Omicron-descending BA.2* sub-lineages, displaying a sequential acquisition of BA.2.86 lineage-defining mutation constellations through time. We observe that hybrid strains circulated up to 19 months prior to BA.2.86, denoting cryptic circulation in various countries, with further evidence of early transmission chains. We also found signals of recombination between pre-existing parental lineages, suggesting that this process contributed to the emergence of BA.2.86. Our results suggest that the BA.2.86 lineage emerged sequentially through a complex evolutionary process, rather than via accelerated evolution associated with a single emergence event.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

While much of the current understanding of P. syringae is centered on interactions with flowering plants, much less is known about infection in evolutionarily divergent non-flowering lineages. Here, we took a comparative evolutionary approach to understand how P. syringae infects distantly related plants. We identify broad host P. syringae isolates causing significant disease in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, the fern Ceratopteris richardii, and the flowering plant Nicotiana benthamiana, which last shared a common ancestor over 500 million years ago. We demonstrate that phytotoxin enriched isolates belonging to the phylogroup 2 clade of the P. syringae species complex are particularly virulent in non-flowering plants, relying on a combination of type-3 secreted effector proteins and the lipopeptide phytotoxin syringomycin. The application of purified syringomycin promotes necrosis in diverse host tissues and activates conserved genes associated with redox regulation and cell death. Toxin-deficient phylogroups normally unable to infect Marchantia thalli exhibit enhanced bacterial growth when supplemented with exogenous syringomycin, further highlighting its role as a host-range defining factor in Pseudomonas. Collectively our research reveals a key role for the lipopeptide syringomycin in promoting Pseudomonas colonization, which works in concert with type-3 effector proteins to antagonize an exceptionally wide spectrum of land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

How do fixed structural connections yield a diverse range of dynamic patterns in spontaneous brain activity? We hypothesize that the observed relationship between empirical structure and functional patterns is best explained when the microscopic neuronal dynamics is close to a critical regime. Using a modular Spiking Neuronal Network model based on empirical connectomes, we posit that multiple stored functional patterns can transiently reoccur when the system operates near a critical regime, generating realistic brain dynamics and structural-functional relationships. The connections in the model are chosen as to force the network to learn and propagate suited modular spatiotemporal patterns. To test our hypothesis, we employ magnetoencephalography and tractography data from five healthy individuals. We show that the critical regime of the model is able to generate realistic features, and demonstrate the relevance of near-critical regimes for physiological brain activity.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Deep learning methods facilitate integration of heterogeneous datasets. However, almost all published deep learning-based bulk multi-omics integration methods have constrained usability. They suffer from lack of transparency, modularity, deployability, and are applicable exclusively to narrow tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce Flexynesis, a versatile tool designed with usability, and adaptability in mind. Flexynesis streamlines data processing, enforces structured data splitting, and ensures rigorous model evaluation. It offers unsupervised feature selection, different omics layer fusion options, and hyperparameter tuning. Users can choose from distinct architectures - fully connected networks, variational autoencoders, multi-triplet networks, graph neural networks, and cross-modality encoding networks. Each model is complemented with a straightforward input interface and standardized training, evaluation, and feature importance quantification methods, enabling easy incorporation into data integration pipelines. For improved user experience, Flexynesis supports features such as on-the-fly task determination and compatibility with regression, classification, and survival modeling. It accommodates multi-task prediction of a mixture of numerical/categorical outcome variables with a tolerance for missing labels. We also developed an extensive benchmarking pipeline, showcasing the tools capability across diverse real-life datasets. This toolset should make deep-learning based bulk multi-omics data integration in the context of clinical/pre-clinical data analysis and marker discovery more accessible to a wider audience with or without experience in deep-learning development. Flexynesis is available at https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/flexynesis and can be installed from https://pypi.org/project/flexynesis/.

BLAST established itself as the canonical tool for sequence similarity search in large part thanks to its meaningful statistical analysis. Specifically, BLAST reports the E-value of each reported alignment, which is defined as the expected number of optimal local alignments that will score at least as high as the observed alignment score, assuming that the query and the database sequences are randomly generated. Here we critically reevaluate the E-values provided by the standard protein BLAST (blastp), showing that they can be at times significantly conservative while at others too liberal. We offer an alternative approach based on generating a small sample from the null distribution of random optimal alignments, and testing whether the observed alignment score is consistent with it. In contrast with blastp, our significance analysis seems valid, in the sense that it did not deliver inflated significance estimates in any of our extensive experiments. Moreover, although our method is slightly conservative, it is often significantly less so than the blastp E-value. Indeed, in cases where blastp's analysis is valid (i.e., not too liberal), our approach seems to deliver a greater number of correct alignment. One advantage of our approach is that it works with any reasonable choice of substitution matrix and gap penalties, avoiding blastp's limited options of matrices and penalties. In addition, we can formulate the problem using a canonical family-wise error rate control setup, thereby dispensing with E-values, which can at times be difficult to interpret.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

These protofibrils and fibrils can intertwine to form mature amyloid fibres. Similar phenomena occur in blood from individuals with circulating inflammatory molecules (also those originating from viruses and bacteria). In the presence of inflammagens, pathological clotting can occur, that results in an anomalous amyloid form termed fibrinaloid microclots. Previous proteomic analyses of these microclots have shown the presence of non-fibrin(ogen) proteins, suggesting a more complex mechanism than simple entrapment. We provide evidence against a simple entrapment model, noting that clot pores are too large and centrifugation would have removed weakly bound proteins. Instead, we explore whether co-aggregation into amyloid fibres may involve axial (multiple proteins within the same fibril), lateral (single-protein fibrils contributing to a fibre), or both types of integration. Our analysis of proteomic data from fibrinaloid microclots in different diseases shows no significant overlap with the normal plasma proteome and no correlation between plasma protein abundance and presence in microclots. Notably, abundant plasma proteins like -2-macroglobulin, fibronectin, and transthyretin are absent from microclots, while less abundant proteins such as adiponectin, periostin, and von Willebrand Factor are well represented. Using bioinformatic tools including AmyloGram and AnuPP, we found that proteins entrapped in fibrinaloid microclots exhibit high amyloidogenic tendencies, suggesting their integration as cross-{beta} elements into amyloid structures. This integration likely contributes to the microclots resistance to proteolysis. Our findings underscore the role of cross-seeding in fibrinaloid microclot formation and highlight the need for further investigation into their structural properties and implications in thrombotic and amyloid diseases. These insights provide a foundation for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting amyloidogenic cross-seeding in blood clotting disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

For others, we uncover novel functions, including a role for Uty in establishment and differentiation of spermatogonia, and for Zfy2 in ensuring meiotic pairing and reciprocal recombination between the sex chromosomes.

While PacBio HiFi sequencing data enhances the accessibility of the genome's TR regions for genotyping, simple de novo calling strategies often generate an excess of likely false positives, which can obscure true positive findings, particularly as the number of surveyed genomic regions increases. Results We developed TRGT-denovo, a computational method designed to accurately identify all types of de novo TR mutations-including expansions, contractions, and compositional changes-within family trios. TRGT-denovo directly interrogates read evidence, allowing for the detection of subtle variations often overlooked in variant call format (VCF) files. TRGT-denovo improves the precision and specificity of de novo mutation (DNM) identification, reducing the number of de novo candidates by an order of magnitude compared to genotype-based approaches. In our experiments involving eight rare disease trios previously studied, TRGT-denovo correctly reclassified all false positive DNM candidates as true negatives. Using an expanded repeat catalog, it identified new candidates, of which 95% (19/20) were experimentally validated, demonstrating its effectiveness in minimizing likely false positives while maintaining high sensitivity for true discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

But for any given application, it is likely that just a small subset of informative time-series features is required to capture the dynamical quantities of interest. So, while comprehensive libraries of time-series features have been developed, it is useful to construct reduced and computationally efficient subsets for specific applications. In this work, we demonstrate a systematic process to deduce such a reduced set, focused on the problem of distinguishing changes to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) time series caused by a range of experimental manipulations of excitatory and inhibitory neural activity in mouse cortical circuits. We reduce a comprehensive library of over 7000 candidate time-series features down to a subset of 16 features, which we call catchaMouse16, that aims to both: (i) accurately characterize biologically relevant properties of fMRI time series; and (ii) minimize inter-feature redundancy. The catchaMouse16 feature set accurately classifies experimental perturbations of neuronal activity from fMRI recordings, and also shows strong generalization performance on an unseen mouse and human resting-state fMRI data where it tracks spatial variations in excitatory and inhibitory cortical cell densities, often with greater statistical power than the full hctsa feature set. We provide an efficient, open-source implementation of the catchaMouse16 feature set in C (achieving an approximately 60 times speed-up relative to the native Matlab code of the same features), with wrappers for Python and Matlab. This work demonstrates a procedure to reduce a large candidate time-series feature set down to the key statistical properties of mouse fMRI dynamics that can be used to efficiently quantify and interpret informative dynamical patterns in neural time series.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

However, the lackluster efficacy of CCL2-based chemotaxis blockade in clinical trials suggests that a new understanding of monocyte/macrophage infiltration may be necessary. Here we demonstrate that random migration, and not only chemotaxis, drives macrophage tumor infiltration. We identified tumor-associated monocytes (TAMos) that display a dramatically enhanced migration capability, induced rapidly by the tumor microenvironment, that drives effective tumor infiltration, in contrast to low-motility differentiated macrophages. TAMo, not TAM{Phi}, promotes cancer cell proliferation through activation of the MAPK pathway. IL-6 secreted both by cancer cells and TAMo themselves enhances TAMo migration by increasing dendritic protrusion dynamics and myosin-based contractility via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Independent from CCL2 mediated chemotaxis, IL-6 driven enhanced migration and pro-proliferative effect of TAMo were validated in a syngeneic TNBC mouse model. Depletion of IL-6 in cancer cells significantly attenuated monocyte infiltration and reversed TAMo-induced cancer cell proliferation. This work reveals the critical role random migration plays in monocyte driven TAM{Phi} enrichment in a tumor and pinpoints IL-6 as a potential therapeutic target in combination with CCL2 to ameliorate current strategies against TAM{Phi} infiltration.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Research into rare (<0.1) genetic variants on the X chromosome has implicated over 20 genes in ASD pathogenesis, such as MECP2, DDX3X, and DMD. The ""female protective effect"" in ASD suggests that females may require a higher genetic burden to manifest similar symptoms as males, yet the mechanisms remain unclear. Despite technological advances in genomics, the complexity of the biological nature of sex chromosomes leave them underrepresented in genome-wide studies. Here, we conducted an X chromosome-wide association study (XWAS) using whole-genome sequencing data from 6,873 individuals with ASD (82% males) across Autism Speaks MSSNG, Simons Simplex Cohort SSC, and Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research SPARK, alongside 8,981 population controls (43% males). We analyzed 418,652 X-chromosome variants, identifying 59 associated with ASD (p-values 7.9x10- to 1.51x10-), surpassing Bonferroni-corrected thresholds. Key findings include significant regions on chrXp22.2 (lead SNP=rs12687599, p=3.57x10-) harboring ASB9/ASB11, and another encompassing DDX53/PTCHD1-AS long non-coding RNA (lead SNP=rs5926125, p=9.47x10-).

However, limited efficacy and emergence of drug resistance are major handicaps for successful treatments. Here, by using relevant preclinical models, we found that Connexin43 (Cx43), a protein that plays a role in cell-to-cell communication, increases effectiveness of BRAF/MEKi by recruiting DNA repair complexes to lamin-associated domains and promoting persistent DNA damage and cellular senescence. The nuclear compartmentalization promoted by Cx43 contributes to genome instability and synthetic lethality caused by excessive DNA damage, which could lead to a novel therapeutic approach for these tumours to overcome drug resistance. Based on these findings, we designed an innovative drug combination using small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) to deliver the full-Cx43 in combination with the BRAF/MEKi. This study reveals Cx43 as a new player on DNA repair and BRAF/MEKi response, underlining the therapeutical potential that this approach could eventually have in the clinic to overcome the limitations of current therapies and improve treatment outcomes for patients with advanced BRAF mutant tumours.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Of the 1,289 T2D GWAS index variants, 716 (56%) demonstrated strong evidence of colocalization with a molecular or T2D-related trait, implicating 657 cis-effector genes, 1,691 distal-effector genes, 731 metabolites, and 43 T2D-related traits. We identified 773 of these cis- and distal-effector genes using either expression QTL data from understudied ancestry groups or inclusion of T2D index variants enriched in underrepresented populations, emphasizing the value of increasing population diversity in functional mapping. Linking these variants, genes, metabolites, and traits into a network, we elucidated mechanisms through which T2D-associated variation may impact disease risk. Finally, we showed that drugs targeting effector proteins were enriched in those approved to treat T2D, highlighting the potential of these results to prioritize drug targets for T2D.

These results represent a leap in the molecular characterization of T2D-associated genetic variation and will aid in translating genetic findings into novel therapeutic strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1721513135709

As Tregs are pivotal to control inflammation, Treg stimulation by low-dose IL-2 (IL-2LD) could have a therapeutic impact on bipolar depression. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (2 active: 1 placebo) proof-of-concept trial of add-on IL-2LD in patients with bipolar depression. Patients received a placebo or IL-2LD (1MIU) once a day for 5 days, and then once a week for 4 weeks starting on week 2. The primary objective was to demonstrate a biological Treg response to IL-2LD assessed by fold increase in Treg percentage of CD4+ cells from baseline to day 5. Secondary objectives included safety assessment and mood improvement throughout the study period. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04133233. Fourteen patients with bipolar depression were included, with 4 receiving placebo and 10 IL-2LD. Baseline clinical and biological characteristics were balanced between groups. The primary evaluation criterion was met, with IL-2LD expanding 1.17 [95% CI 1.01- 1.34] vs 1.01 [95% CI 0.90 - 1.12] (p=0.0421) and activating Tregs. Secondary evaluation criteria were also met with significant improvements of depressive symptoms and global functioning from day-15 onwards in the IL-2LD treated patients. The treatment was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events related to treatment. This proof-of-concept trial shows that stimulating Tregs in patients with bipolar depression is safe and associated with clinical improvements. This supports a pathophysiological role of inflammation in BD and warrants pursuing the evaluation of IL-2LD as an adjunct treatment of major mood disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1721513135709

Existing data-driven multi-omic analysis methods, such as multi-omic factor analysis (MOFA), can identify associations between molecular features and phenotypes, but they are not designed to integrate existing mechanistic molecular knowledge, which can provide further actionable insights. We introduce an approach that connects data-driven analysis of multi-omic data with systematic integration of mechanistic prior knowledge using COSMOS+ (Causal Oriented Search of Multi-Omics Space). We show how factor analysis output can be used to estimate activities of transcription factors and kinases as well as ligand-receptor interactions, which in turn are integrated with network-level prior-knowledge to generate mechanistic hypotheses about paths connecting deregulated molecular features. Our approach offers an interpretable framework to generate actionable insights from multi-omic data particularly suited for high dimensional datasets such as patient cohorts.

With single-cell and spatial-transcriptomics of synovial tissue biopsies, validated by micro co-culture systems, we identified condition and niche-specific myeloid DC clusters with distinct differentiation trajectories and functions. Healthy synovium contains a unique tolerogenic AXLpos DC2 cluster in the superficial sublining layer. In active RA, a macrophage-rich lining-layer niche becomes populated with inflammatory DC3 clusters that specifically activate memory CCL5pos TEM and CCL5posCXCL13pos TPH, promoting synovitis. In the sublining lymphoid niche, CCR7pos DC2 mReg specifically interact with naive-T-cells, potentially driving the local expansion of new effector T-cells. Sustained remission sees the resolution of these niches but lacks the recovery of tolerogenic AXLpos DC2, indicating latent potential for disease flare. A human RA disease-flare model showed that the activation of blood predecessor of ST-DC3 clusters precedes the onset of inflammation in joints. Therapeutic strategies targeting pathogenic ST-DC3 clusters, or reinstating tolerogenic AXLpos DC2, may restore immune homeostasis in RA.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Non-adhering cells do not display tension gradients. We further show that branched actin increases tension, while membrane-to-cortex attachments facilitate its propagation. Tension is the lowest at the edge of adhesion sites and highest at protrusions, setting the boundaries of the tension gradients.

We use surface morphometrics tools to identify a subset of ribosomes optimally oriented on mitochondrial membranes for protein import. This allows us to establish the first subtomogram structure of a cytoplasmic ribosome on the surface of the mitochondria in the native cellular context, which showed three distinct connections with the outer mitochondrial membrane surrounding the peptide exit tunnel. Further, this analysis demonstrated that cytoplasmic ribosomes primed for mitochondrial protein import cluster on the OMM at sites of local constrictions of the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane.

However, genome-wide depletions of architectural proteins such as cohesin result in only limited changes in gene expression, despite a loss of contact domains and loops. Consequently, the role of cohesin and 3D contacts in enhancer function remains debated. Here, we developed CRISPRi of regulatory elements upon degron operation (CRUDO), a novel approach to measure how changes in contact frequency impact enhancer effects on target genes by perturbing enhancers with CRISPRi and measuring gene expression in the presence or absence of cohesin. We systematically perturbed all 1,039 candidate enhancers near five cohesin-dependent genes and identified 34 enhancer-gene regulatory interactions. Of 26 regulatory interactions with sufficient statistical power to evaluate cohesin dependence, 18 show cohesin-dependent effects. A decrease in enhancer-promoter contact frequency upon removal of cohesin is frequently accompanied by a decrease in the regulatory effect of the enhancer on gene expression, consistent with a contact-based model for enhancer function. However, changes in contact frequency and regulatory effects on gene expression vary as a function of distance, with distal enhancers (e.g., >50Kb) experiencing much larger changes than proximal ones (e.g., <50Kb). Because most enhancers are located close to their target genes, these observations can explain how only a small subset of genes -- those with strong distal enhancers -- are sensitive to cohesin. Together, our results illuminate how 3D contacts, influenced by both cohesin and genomic distance, tune enhancer effects on gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Homologous with ATP synthases, these multi-subunit enzymes consist of a soluble catalytic V1 subcomplex and a membrane-embedded proton-translocating VO subcomplex. The V1 and VO subcomplexes can undergo reversible dissociation to regulate proton pumping, with reassociation of V1 and VO requiring the protein complex known as RAVE (regulator of the ATPase of vacuoles and endosomes). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RAVE consists of subunits Rav1p, Rav2p, and Skp1p. We used electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a structure of yeast RAVE bound to V1. In the structure, RAVE is a L-shaped complex with Rav2p pointing toward the membrane and Skp1p distant from both the membrane and V1. Only Rav1p interacts with V1, binding to a region of subunit A not found in the corresponding ATP synthase subunit. When bound to RAVE, V1 is in a rotational state suitable for binding the free VO complex, but it is partially disrupted in the structure, missing five of its 16 subunits. Other than these missing subunits and the conformation of the inhibitory subunit H, the V1 complex with RAVE appears poised for reassembly with VO.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Each immunoreceptor recognises a matching, strain-specific powdery mildew effector encoded by an avirulence gene (AVRa). We present here the cryo-EM structure of barley MLA13 in complex with its cognate effector AVRA13-1. The effector adopts an RNase-like fold when bound to MLA13 in planta, similar to crystal structures of other RNase-like AVRA effectors purified from E. coli. AVRA13-1 interacts via its basal loops with MLA13 C-terminal leucine rich repeats (LRRs) and the central winged helix domain (WHD). Co-expression of structure-guided MLA13 and AVRA13-1 substitution variants show that the receptor-effector interface plays an essential role in mediating immunity-associated plant cell death. Furthermore, by combining structural information from the MLA13-AVRA13-1 heterocomplex with sequence alignments of other MLA receptors, we designed a single amino acid substitution in MLA7 that enables expanded effector detection of AVRA13-1 and the virulent variant AVRA13-V2. In contrast to the pentameric conformation of previously reported effector-activated CNL resistosomes, MLA13 was purified and resolved as a stable heterodimer from an in planta expression system. Our study suggests that the MLA13-AVRA13-1 heterodimer might represent a CNL output distinct from CNL resistosomes and highlights opportunities for the development of designer gain-of-function NLRs.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

While the celebrated FORCE learning rule can train chaotic recurrent networks to produce coherent patterns by suppressing chaos, it requires non-local plasticity rules and extremely quick plasticity, raising the question of how synapses adapt on local, biologically plausible timescales to handle potential chaotic dynamics. We propose a novel framework called ""Predictive Alignment"", which tames the chaotic recurrent dynamics to generate a variety of patterned activities via a biologically plausible plasticity rule. Unlike most recurrent learning rules, predictive alignment does not aim to directly minimize output error to train recurrent connections, but rather it tries to efficiently suppress chaos by aligning recurrent prediction with chaotic activity. We show that the proposed learning rule can perform supervised learning of multiple target signals, including complex low-dimensional attractors, delay matching tasks that require short-term temporal memory, and finally even dynamic movie clips with high-dimensional pixels. Our findings shed light on how predictions in recurrent circuits can support learning.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Yet, sequencing efforts are not evenly distributed in the tree of life questioning our true ability to enlighten conservation with genomic data. Good quality reference genomes remain scarce in octocorals while these species are highly relevant target for conservation. Here, we present the first annotated reference genome in the red coral, Corallium rubrum (Linnaeus, 1758), a habitat-forming octocoral from the Mediterranean and neighboring Atlantic, impacted by overharvesting and anthropogenic warming-induced mass mortality events. Combining long reads from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Illumina paired-end reads for improving the base accuracy of the ONT-based genome assembly and Arima Hi-C contact data to place the sequences into chromosomes, we assembled a genome of 475 Mb (21 chromosomes, 326 scaffolds) with contig and scaffold N50 of 1.6 Mb and 16.2 Mb, respectively. Fifty percent of the sequence (L50) was contained in eight superscaffolds. The consensus quality (QV) of the final assembly was 42 and the gene completeness reported by BUSCO was 74% (metazoa_odb10 database). We annotated 39,114 protein-coding genes and 32,678 non-coding transcripts. This annotated chromosome-level genome assembly, one of the first in octocorals, is currently used in a project based on whole genome re-sequencing dedicated to the conservation and management of C. rubrum.

Significance StatementThe Mediterranean red coral, Corallium rubrum, is critically impacted by overharvesting and by mass mortality events linked to marine heat waves. Accordingly, C. rubrum is increasingly receiving conservation efforts. Previous population genetics studies based on microsatellites contributed to improving our knowledge of the species ecology. Yet, crucial questions regarding, admixture among lineages, demographic history, effective population sizes and local adaptation, are still open owing to a lack of genomic resources. Here, we present the first chromosome-level genome assembly for the species with high contiguity, good completeness and protein-coding genes and repeat sequence annotations. This genome, one of the first in octocorals, will pave the way for the integration of population genomics data into ongoing interdisciplinary conservation efforts dedicated to C. rubrum.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

However, a comprehensive model that investigates the association between a broad range of psychiatric disorders and immune-mediated disease in a multivariate framework is lacking. Objective: This study aims to establish a factor structure based on the genetic correlations of immune-mediated diseases and investigate their genetic relationships with clusters of psychiatric disorders. Design, Setting, and Participants: We utilized Genomic Structural Equation Modeling (Genomic SEM) to establish a factor structure of 11 immune-mediated diseases. Genetic correlations between these immune factors were examined with five established factors across 13 psychiatric disorders representing compulsive, schizophrenia/bipolar, neurodevelopmental, internalizing, and substance use disorders. We included GWAS summary statistics of individuals of European ancestry with sample sizes from 1,223 cases for Addison's disease to 170,756 cases for major depressive disorder. Main Outcomes and Measures: Genetic correlations between psychiatric and immune-mediated disease factors and traits to determine genetic overlap. We develop and validate a new heterogeneity metric, QFactor, that quantifies the degree to which factor correlations are driven by more specific pairwise associations. We also estimate residual genetic correlations between pairs of psychiatric disorders and immune-mediated diseases. Results: A four-factor model of immune-mediated diseases fit the data well and described a continuum from autoimmune to autoinflammatory diseases. The four factors reflected autoimmune, celiac, mixed pattern, and autoinflammatory diseases. Analyses revealed seven significant factor correlations between the immune and psychiatric factors, including autoimmune and mixed pattern diseases with the internalizing and substance use factors, and autoinflammatory diseases with the compulsive, schizophrenia/bipolar, and internalizing factors. Additionally, we find evidence of divergence in associations within factors as indicated by QFactor. This is further supported by 14 significant residual genetic correlations between individual psychiatric disorders and immune-mediated diseases. Conclusion and Relevance: Our results revealed genetic links between clusters of immune-mediated diseases and psychiatric disorders. Current analyses indicate that previously described relationships between specific psychiatric disorders and immune-mediated diseases often capture broader pathways of risk sharing indexed by our genomic factors, yet are more specific than a general association across all psychiatric disorders and immune-mediated diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1721513135709

This shortcoming increases the rate of false positives and false negatives, giving rise to a potentially misleading scientific record. To address this shortcoming, many researchers now use point-and-click software to run sample size calculations.

ObjectiveWe aimed to (1) estimate how many published articles report using the G*Power sample size calculation software; (2) assess whether these calculations are reproducible and (3) error-free; and (4) assess how often these calculations use G*Powers default option for mixed-design ANOVAs--which can be misleading and output sample sizes that are too small for a researchers intended purpose.

MethodWe randomly sampled open access articles from PubMed Central published between 2017 and 2022 and used a coding form to manually assess 95 sample size calculations for reproducibility and errors.

ResultsWe estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65% [95% CI: 0.62% - 0.67%] of articles). We could reproduce 2% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8%; 3/36).

ConclusionPublished sample size calculations that use G*Power are not transparently reported and may not be well-informed. Given the popularity of software packages like G*Power, they present an intervention point to increase the prevalence of informative sample size calculations.","NA","medrxiv",1721513135709

However, the lack of defined structures and the high variability in sequence and conformational preferences has complicated such efforts. We sought to develop a method combining biophysical principles with deep learning to readily generate binders for any disordered sequence. Instead of assuming a fixed regular structure for the target, general recognition is achieved by threading the query sequence through diverse extended binding modes in hundreds of templates with varying pocket depths and spacings, followed by RFdiffusion refinement to optimize the binder-target fit. We tested the method by designing binders to 39 highly diverse unstructured targets. Experimental testing of [~]36 designs per target yielded binders with affinities better than 100 nM in 34 cases, and in the pM range in four cases. The co-crystal structure of a designed binder in complex with dynorphin A is closely consistent with the design model. All by all binding experiments for 20 designs binding diverse targets show they are highly specific for the intended targets, with no crosstalk even for the closely related dynorphin A and dynorphin B. Our approach thus could provide a general solution to the intrinsically disordered protein and peptide recognition problem.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Most riboswitches identified to date are broadly conserved and control genes that are directly involved in the transport or biosynthesis of their cognate ligands. However, a minority of switches are restricted to a few species and in addition may bind less obvious ligands. One such switch controls the expression of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis rpfB operon, which is critical for resuscitation of dormant bacteria, ribosome maturation and reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection. The switch is restricted to pathogenic mycobacteria and until now, its ligand was unknown. However, in the current study, we identify the ligand as cobalamin or vitamin B12. Using in-line probing, we show that vitamin B12 binds directly to the riboswitch RNA, and we predict a structure based on the cleavage pattern. Moreover, we show that B12 suppresses the expression of an rpfB-lacZ reporter fusion and crucially, that B12 suppresses resuscitation of M. tuberculosis from a state of non-replicating persistence. These findings demonstrate a pivotal role of crosstalk between a host-derived metabolite and a pathogen riboswitch in controlling M. tuberculosis persistence with potential for improved interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

One such event is the dramatic reorganization of CTCF into senescence-induced clusters (SICCs). However, the molecular determinants, genomic consequences, and functional purpose of SICCs remained unknown. Here, we combine functional assays, super-resolution imaging, and 3D genomics with computational modelling to dissect SICC emergence. We establish that the competition between CTCF-bound and non-bound loci dictates clustering propensity. Upon senescence entry, cells repurpose SRRM2 --a key component of nuclear speckles-- and BANF1 --a  molecular glue for chromosomes-- to cluster CTCF and rewire genome architecture. This CTCF-centric reorganization in reference to nuclear speckles functionally sustains the senescence splicing program, as SICC disruption fully reverts alternative splicing patterns. We therefore uncover a new paradigm, whereby cells translate changes in nuclear biochemistry into architectural changes directing splicing choices so as to commit to the fate of senescence.

In plants with indeterminate inflorescences, the number of flowers produced is determined by the activity of the inflorescence meristem. However, the integration of inflorescence meristem activity with the physiological and developmental status of a plant is not well understood. We combined quantitative imaging of the inflorescence meristem with the manipulation of cytokinin levels and distribution to investigate how meristem activity is regulated. Our data support the hypothesis that emerging fruits drain the acropetal flow of cytokinin away from the meristem inducing its proliferative arrest. We further show that the duration of flowering and cytokinin signaling in the inflorescence meristem is influenced by nitrate availability. Taken together, these data suggest that cytokinin functions as a systemic signal that integrates information about ongoing reproductive effort and plant nutrient status to control flower production.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

The neural mechanisms underlying the selective sampling of decision-relevant information remain unknown. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and neural decoding to track the spontaneous dynamics of the locus and strength of covert attention as human participants performed a three-alternative perceptual choice task. The strength of covert attention fluctuated rhythmically at 11 Hz. At the peak of this oscillation, attention re-focused on the location of the previously sampled alternative, promoting the in-depth evaluation of a single alternative. By contrast, at the trough, attention was oriented to a different alternative, that way facilitating the comparison between alternatives. Further, switching attention to a different alternative intrinsically reset the attentional oscillation. We propose that rhythmic attentional sampling is a universal cognitive mechanism underpinning the flexible information processing necessary for key decision computations.

- Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we tracked the locus and strength of covert attention in humans performing a multialternative choice task.

However, empty droplets and poor quality cells are often captured in single cell genomics experiments and need to be removed to avoid cell type interpretation errors. Many automated and manual methods exist to identify poor quality cells or empty droplets, such as minimum RNA count thresholds and comparing the gene expression profile of an individual cell to the overall background RNA expression of the experiment. A versatile approach is to use unbalanced overall RNA splice ratios of cells to identify poor quality cells or empty droplets. However, this approach is computationally intensive, requiring a detailed search through all sequence reads in the experiment to quantify spliced and unspliced reads. We found that the expression level of MALAT1, a non-coding RNA retained in the nucleus and ubiquitously expressed across cell types, is strongly correlated with this splice ratio measure and thus can be used to similarly identify low quality cells in scRNA-seq data. Since it is easy to visualize the expression of a single gene in single-cell maps, MALAT1 expression is a simple cell quality measure that can be quickly used during the cell annotation process to improve the interpretation of cells in tissues of human, mouse and other species with a conserved MALAT1 function.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1721513135709

Their complex and intermingled population dynamics have sparked extensive debate over the impacts of historical overfishing and have complicated their sustainable management today. Recently developed tools - including diagnostic SNP panels for mixed-stock analysis - aim to improve population assignment for fisheries management, however, the biological relevance of such tools over long periods of time remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate the millennium-long applicability of diagnostic SNP panels and identify population perturbations associated with increasing exploitation pressure and climate change by analyzing whole genome data from modern and ancient herring specimens. We find that herring demographic cycles were likely within healthy ecosystem boundaries until the dramatic disruption of these cycles in the 20th century. We find only autumn-spawning herring in our archaeological remains spanning 900 years from 8 sites across Europe, supporting observations that the numerical dominance of specific spawning populations can demographically outcompete other herring types. We also obtain pre-archival aDNA evidence for the famous, cyclical ""Bohuslan periods,"" during which mass quantities of North Sea autumn-spawning herring congregated in the Skagerrak. Finally, the long-term applicability of diagnostic SNP panels underscores their highly cost-effective application for the genetic monitoring of herring stocks. Our results highlight the utility of ancient DNA and genomic analysis to obtain historical and natural insights in herring ecology and population dynamics with relevance for sustainable fisheries management.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Uncovering the sequence determinants of proteins for phase separation is important in understanding the biophysical and biochemical properties of BCs. Despite significant discoveries in the last decade, the role of cysteine residues in BC formation and dissolution has remained unknown. Here, to determine the involvement of disulfide crosslinks and their redox sensitivity in BCs, we designed a  stickers and spacers model of phase-separating peptides interspersed with cysteines. Through biophysical investigations, we learned that cysteines promote liquid-liquid phase separation in oxidizing conditions and perpetuate liquid condensates through disulfide crosslinks, which can be reversibly tuned with redox chemistry. By varying the composition of cysteines, subtle but distinct changes in the viscoelastic behavior of the condensates were observed. Empirically, we conclude that cysteines are neither stickers nor spacers but function as covalent nodes to lower the effective concentrations for sticker interactions and inhibit system-spanning percolation networks. Together, we unmask the role of cysteines in protein phase behavior and the potential to develop tunable, redox-sensitive viscoelastic materials.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Brain aging is complex and accompanied by many cellular changes. However, the influence that aged cells have on neighboring cells and how this contributes to tissue decline is unknown. More generally, the tools to systematically address this question in aging tissues have not yet been developed. Here, we generate spatiotemporal data at single-cell resolution for the mouse brain across lifespan, and we develop the first machine learning models based on spatial transcriptomics ('spatial aging clocks') to reveal cell proximity effects during brain aging and rejuvenation. We collect a single-cell spatial transcriptomics brain atlas of 4.2 million cells from 20 distinct ages and across two rejuvenating interventions--exercise and partial reprogramming. We identify spatial and cell type-specific transcriptomic fingerprints of aging, rejuvenation, and disease, including for rare cell types. Using spatial aging clocks and deep learning models, we find that T cells, which infiltrate the brain with age, have a striking pro-aging proximity effect on neighboring cells. Surprisingly, neural stem cells have a strong pro-rejuvenating effect on neighboring cells. By developing computational tools to identify mediators of these proximity effects, we find that pro-aging T cells trigger a local inflammatory response likely via interferon-gamma; whereas pro-rejuvenating neural stem cells impact the metabolism of neighboring cells possibly via growth factors (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor) and extracellular vesicles, and we experimentally validate some of these predictions. These results suggest that rare cells can have a drastic influence on their neighbors and could be targeted to counter tissue aging. We anticipate that these spatial aging clocks will not only allow scalable assessment of the efficacy of interventions for aging and disease but also represent a new tool for studying cell-cell interactions in many spatial contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Specifically, Genomics-FM is first pretrained with ensemble genomic vocabulary on vast unlabelled data to learn comprehensive and generalizable representations and then finetuned with specific genomic vocabulary on limited labeled data to selectively activate and adapt the pretraining knowledge for specific tasks. We show that Genomics-FM significantly reduces the dependence on labeled data, and demonstrates the capability to outperform existing models across a comprehensive suite of tasks including genome annotation, epigenomic and expression profile prediction, and variant effect assessment. Remarkably, Genomics-FM even shows impressive zero-shot predictive capabilities across diverse species and tissues and exhibits noticeable adaptability to RNA-related tasks.

This reduces the risk of spreading pathogens while enabling effective population control. Robust sex sorting methods to enable early larval sorting in mosquitoes need to be developed to allow for scalable sex sorting for genetic biocontrol interventions. This study applies the SEPARATOR (Sexing Element Produced by Alternative RNA-splicing of A Transgenic Observable Reporter) system, previously developed for Aedes aegypti, to the Asian malaria vector Anopheles stephensi. We hypothesized that the intron from the doublesex gene in Anopheles gambiae would function in An. stephensi due to evolutionary conservation. Our results confirm that the splicing module from An. gambiae operates effectively in An. stephensi, demonstrating evolutionary conservation in sex-specific splicing events between these species. This system enables reliable positive male selection from first instar larval to pupal stages. RT-PCR analysis demonstrates that male-specific EGFP expression is dependent on doublesex sex-specific splicing events. The SEPARATOR system's independence from sex-chromosome linkage confers resistance to meiotic recombination and chromosomal rearrangements. This approach may facilitate the mass release of males, and the cross-species portability of SEPARATOR establishes it as a valuable tool for genetic biocontrol interventions across various pest species.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Realistic simulations have enabled, for example, the non-invasive estimation of fine neuronal sub-structures, which is playing an increasingly key role in neurology and neuro-science. However, biologically-realistic, simulation-informed dMRI techniques are also needed in other applications, as for example in oncological imaging of body tumours. This article aims to fill this gap by presenting a Monte Carlo (MC) framework tailored for histology-informed simulations in body imaging applications. The framework, which combines free software with custom-written routines, is demonstrated on substrates reconstructed from hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stains of human liver biopsies, including non-cancerous liver and primary/metastatic liver cancer tissues. The article has four main contributions. Firstly, it provides practical guidelines on how to conduct realistic MC diffusion simulations informed by HE histology. Secondly, it reports reference values on cell size (CS), cell density and on other cellular properties in non-cancerous and cancerous liver -- information not easily found in the literature, yet essential to inform the design of innovative dMRI techniques. Thirdly, it presents a detailed characterisation of synthetic signals generated for clinically feasible dMRI protocols, shedding light onto patterns of intra-/extra-cellular (IC/EC) water diffusion in liver. Finally, it illustrates the utility of the framework, by devising a strategy where synthetic signals inform the estimation of unexplored microstructural properties, as the EC intrinsic diffusivity and CS distribution skewness. The strategy is demonstrated on actual dMRI scans, acquired on ex vivo mouse tissue and in cancer patients in vivo.","NA","medrxiv",1721513135709

This includes Brownian diffusion, but also flow across intricate networks of capillaries. This effect, the intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM), enables microvasculature characterisation with dMRI, through metrics such as the vascular signal fraction fV or Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) D*. The IVIM metrics, while sensitive to perfusion, are in general protocol-dependent, and their interpretation can change depending on the flow regime spins experience during the dMRI measurements (e.g., diffusive vs ballistic), which is in general not known -- facts that hamper their clinical utility. Innovative vascular dMRI models are needed to enable the in vivo calculation of biologically meaningful markers of capillary flow. These could have relevant applications in cancer, for instance assessing responses to anti-angiogenic therapies targeting tumor vessels. This paper tackles this need by introducing SpinFlowSim, an open-source simulator of dMRI signals arising from blood flow within pipe networks. SpinFlowSim, tailored for the laminar flow patterns in capillaries, enables the synthesis of highly-realistic microvascular dMRI signals, given networks reconstructed from histology. We showcase the simulator by generating synthetic signals for 15 networks, reconstructed from liver biopsies, and containing cancerous and non-cancerous tissue. Signals exhibit com-plex, non-mono-exponential behaviours, pointing towards the co-existence of different flow regimes within the same network, and diffusion time dependence. We also demonstrate the potential utility of SpinFlowSim by devising a strategy for microvascular property mapping informed by the synthetic signals, focussing on the quantification of blood velocity distribution moments, and of an apparent network branching index. These were estimated in silico and in vivo, in healthy volunteers and in 13 cancer patients, scanned at 1.5T. In conclusion, realistic flow simulations, as those enabled by SpinFlowSim, may play a key role in the development of the next-generation of dMRI methods for microvascular mapping, with immediate applications in oncology.","NA","medrxiv",1721513135709

During aging, levels of NAD+ can decrease by up to 50% in some tissues, the repletion of which provides a range of health benefits in both mice and humans. Whether or not the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) extends lifespan in mammals is not known. Here we investigate the effect of long-term administration of NMN on the health, cancer burden, frailty and lifespan of male and female mice. Without increasing tumor counts or severity in any tissue, NMN treatment of males and females increased activity, maintained more youthful gene expression patterns, and reduced overall frailty. Reduced frailty with NMN treatment was associated with increases in levels of Anerotruncus colihominis, a gut bacterium associated with lower inflammation in mice and increased longevity in humans. NMN slowed the accumulation of adipose tissue later in life and improved metabolic health in male but not female mice, while in females but not males, NMN increased median lifespan by 8.5%, possible due to sex-specific effects of NMN on NAD+ metabolism. Together, these data show that chronic NMN treatment delays frailty, alters the microbiome, improves male metabolic health, and increases female mouse lifespan, without increasing cancer burden. These results highlight the potential of NAD+ boosters for treating age-related conditions and the importance of using both sexes for interventional lifespan studies.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

The aging ovary assumes a fibro-inflammatory milieu which negatively impacts gamete quantity and quality as well as ovulation. Here we tested whether the systemic delivery of anti-inflammatory (Etanercept) or anti-fibrotic (Pirfenidone) drugs attenuates ovarian aging in mice. We first evaluated the ability of these drugs to decrease the expression of fibro-inflammatory genes in primary ovarian stromal cells. Whereas Etanercept did not block Tnf expression in ovarian stromal cells, Pirfenidone significantly reduced Col1a1 expression. We then tested Pirfenidone in vivo where the drug was delivered systemically via mini-osmotic pumps for 6-weeks. Pirfenidone mitigated the age-dependent increase in ovarian fibrosis without impacting overall health parameters. Ovarian function was improved in Pirfenidone-treated mice as evidenced by increased follicle and corpora lutea number, AMH levels, and improved estrous cyclicity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Pirfenidone treatment resulted in an upregulation of reproductive function-related genes at 8.5 months and a downregulation of inflammatory genes at 12 months of age. These findings demonstrate that reducing the fibroinflammatory ovarian microenvironment improves ovarian function, thereby supporting modulating the ovarian environment as a therapeutic avenue to extend reproductive longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

When cued explicitly, task context was encoded in both brain areas and changed rapidly at task boundaries. Hippocampus exhibited a temporally dynamic code with fast decorrelation over time, preventing cross-temporal generalization. Medial frontal cortex exhibited a static code that decorrelated slowly, allowing generalization across minutes of time. When task context needed to be inferred as a latent variable, hippocampus encoded task context with a static code.

First, retrograde and anterograde viral tracing strategies revealed a direct projection from the piriform cortex to the auditory cortex. Next, using in vivo electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity in the auditory cortex of awake mice, we found that odor stimuli modulate auditory cortical responses to sound.

Objectives: In a post hoc 10-year follow-up analysis of the MI-GENES trial, we investigated whether disclosure of a PRS for CHD was associated with a reduction in adverse cardiovascular events. Methods: Participants were followed from randomization beginning in October 2013 until September 2023 to ascertain adverse cardiovascular events, testing for CHD, and changes in risk factors, by blinded review of electronic health records. The primary outcome was the time from randomization to the occurrence of the first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and non-fatal stroke. Statistical analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression and linear mixed-effects models. Results: We followed all 203 participants who completed the MI-GENES trial, 100 in FRSg and 103 in IRSg (mean age at the end of follow-up: 68.2+-5.2, 48% male). During a median follow-up of 9.5 years, 9 MACEs occurred in FRSg and 2 in IRSg (hazard ratio (HR), 0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.04 to 0.94; P=0.042). In FRSg, 47 (47%) underwent at least one test for CHD, compared to 30 (29%) in IRSg (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.81; P=0.004). IRSg participants had a longer duration of statin therapy during the first four years post-randomization and a greater reduction in LDL-C for up to 3 years post-randomization. No significant differences between the two groups were observed for hemoglobin A1C, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, weight, and smoking cessation rate during follow-up. Conclusions: The disclosure of an IRS that included a PRS to individuals at intermediate risk for CHD was associated with a lower incidence of MACE after a decade of follow-up, likely due to a higher rate of initiation and longer duration of statin therapy, leading to lower LDL-C levels.","NA","medrxiv",1721513135709

However, the role and extent of {gamma}{delta} T cells in production of pro-tumorigenic interleukin-17 (IL-17) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains controversial. In this study, we re-analyzed nine published human CRC whole-tissue single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, identifying 18,483 {gamma}{delta} T cells out of 951,785 total cells, in the neoplastic or adjacent normal tissue of 165 human CRC patients. Our results confirm that tumor-infiltrating {gamma}{delta} T cells exhibit high cytotoxicity-related transcription in both tumor and adjacent normal tissues, but critically, none of the {gamma}{delta} T cell clusters showed IL-17 production potential. We also identified various {gamma}{delta} T cell subsets, including Teff, TRM, Tpex, and Tex, and noted an increased expression of cytotoxic molecules in tumor-infiltrating {gamma}{delta} T cells compared to their normal area counterparts. Our work demonstrates that {gamma}{delta} T cells in CRC primarily function as cytotoxic effector cells rather than IL-17 producers, mitigating the concerns about their potential pro-tumorigenic roles in CRC, highlighting the importance of accurately characterizing these cells for cancer immunotherapy research and the unneglectable cross-species discrepancy between the mouse and human immune system in the study of cancer immunology.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Conversely, dietary fiber has been associated with a reduced risk of CVD and been proposed to exhibit beneficial effects on gut health. Considering these associations, we conducted an intervention study to investigate the influence of fiber supplementation on intestinal TMAO formation and its response after beef consumption.

Our randomized, double blind, pilot study MEATMARK included thirteen volunteers who underwent a dietary fiber and placebo intervention over two weeks. We assessed the effect of fiber supplementation on the gut microbiota and expression of the enzyme cutC, a key enzyme for microbial TMA formation, a precursor for TMAO. We measured the TMAO response following beef consumption after the two-week intervention. We further investigated the impact of three human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the expression of the hepatic enzyme FMO3 on TMAO plasma levels, as this factor is responsible for the final oxidation step from TMA to TMAO.

Our findings indicate that dietary fiber supplementation attenuated TMAO formation after beef intake, particularly in participants with habitual lower daily meat consumption. Furthermore, we observed a significant downregulation of cutC expression in response to the fiber intervention, suggesting a potential mechanism to reduce plasma TMAO. Considering these findings, a high fiber, low meat diet presents a promising dietary strategy for reducing this CVD risk factor.

To couple ATP hydrolysis to a mechanical step, a dynein monomer must be released from the MT before undergoing a conformational change that generates a bias towards the minus end. However, the dynamics of dynein stepping have been poorly characterized by tracking flexible regions of the motor with limited resolution. Here, we developed a cysteine-light mutant of yeast dynein and site-specifically labeled its MT-binding domain in vitro. MINFLUX tracking at sub-millisecond resolution revealed that dynein hydrolyzes one ATP per step and takes multitudes of 8 nm steps at physiological ATP. Steps are preceded by the transient movement towards the plus end. We propose that these backward ""dips"" correspond to MT release and subsequent diffusion of the stepping monomer around its MT-bound partner before taking a minus-end-directed conformational change of its linker. Our results reveal the order of sub-millisecond events that result in a productive step of dynein.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Additionally, pinder provides a test subset with 180 dimers for comparison to AlphaFold-Multimer without any interface leakage with respect to its training set. Unsurprisingly, the pinder benchmark reveals that the performance of existing docking models is highly overestimated when evaluated on leaky test sets.

To explain this pattern, this article develops new theory relating genetic variation to geographic population structure and local extinction. It argues that the observed pattern results from subdivision and gene flow. If two haploid genomes are sampled from the same subpopulation, their recent ancestors are likely to be geographic neighbors and therefore coalesce rapidly. By contrast, remote ancestors are likely to be far apart, and their coalescent rate is lower. Consequently, Ne is larger in the distant past than in the recent past.

However, the sparsity (very few reads per transcript) or bias in protocols (favoring 3' ends of the transcripts) makes the chance of capturing somatic variants very unlikely. This can be overcome by targeted sequencing or the use of mitochondrial variants as natural barcodes for clone identification. Currently, available computational tools focus on genotyping, but do not provide functionality for combined analysis of somatic and mitochondrial variants and functional analysis such as characterization of gene expression changes in detected clones. Results: Here, we propose SIGURD, which is an R-based pipeline for the clonal analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. This allows the quantification of clones by leveraging both somatic and mitochondrial variants. SIGURD also allows for functional analysis after clonal detection: association of clones with cell populations, detection of differentially expressed genes across clones and association of somatic and mitochondrial variants. Here, we demonstrate the power of SIGURD by analyzing single-cell data of colony-forming cells derived from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

So far, a well-known mammalian mutation PB2-E627K has not been maintained in AIV in poultry, which limits the spread of AIVs from avian to humans. Here, we discovered a variant, PB2-627V, which combines the properties of avian-like PB2-627E and human-like PB2-627K, overcoming host restrictions and posing a risk for human pandemics. Specifically, by screening the global PB2 sequences, we discovered a new independent cluster with PB2-627V emerged in the 2010s, which is prevalent in various avian, mammalian, and human isolates of AIVs, including H9N2, H7N9, H3N8, 2.3.4.4b H5N1, and other subtypes. And, the increasing prevalence of PB2-627V in poultry is accompanied by a rise in human infection cases with this variant. Then we systematically assessed its host adaptation, fitness, and transmissibility across three subtypes of AIVs (H9N2, H7N9, and H3N8) in different host models, including avian and human cells, chickens, mice, and ferrets where infections naturally occur. We found that PB2-627V facilitates AIVs to efficiently infect and replicate in chickens and mice by utilizing both avian- and human-origin ANP32A proteins. Importantly, and like PB2-627K, PB2-627V promotes efficient transmission between ferrets through respiratory droplets. Deep sequencing in passaged chicken samples and transmitted ferret samples indicates that PB2-627V remains stable across the two distinct hosts and has a high potential for long-term prevalence in avian species. Therefore, the mutation has the ability to continue spreading among poultry and can also overcome the barrier between birds and humans, greatly enhancing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, it is crucial to closely monitor influenza viruses carrying PB2-627V to prevent a pandemic.

Author summaryAvian influenza viruses (AIVs) play a critical role in the evolution of pandemic influenza viruses. Adaptive changes in AIVs enable them to infect mammalian species by altering viral interactions with host-specific factors, and one well-known example is the PB2-E627K mutation. Fortunately, this mutation is sporadic and rare in AIVs, usually occurring after infecting humans, and AIVs with PB2-627E, which is prevalent in poultry, cannot easily infect humans. However, if an AIV manages to overcome this species barrier, the risk of a pandemic originating from an AIV will significantly increase. In our study, we identified a dual adaptive variant called PB2-627V that combines avian-like properties of PB2-627E and human-like properties of PB2-627K. This variant not only maintains viral fitness in chickens but also facilitates aerosol transmission of AIVs between ferrets. Mechanistically, PB2-627V utilizes both avian and human host protein ANP32A to support viral polymerase function. The mutation exhibited good fitness in both birds and humans, thereby greatly increasing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. The PB2-627V polymorphism has been found in birds, humans, and mammals worldwide across more than ten AIV subtypes. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, we recommend considering PB2-627V as a new molecular marker to assess the pandemic potential of AIVs.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Fusion is mediated by the binding of the viral Spike protein to its receptor ACE2. Lipid rafts are dynamic nanodomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Rafts can act as platforms for entry of dierent viruses by localizing virus receptors, and attachment factors to the same membrane microdomains. Here, we first demonstrate that cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin inhibits Spike mediated fusion and entry. To further study the role of ACE2 lipid raft localization in SARS-CoV-2 fusion and entry, we design a GPI-anchored ACE2 construct. Both ACE2 and ACE2-GPI proteins are similarly expressed at the plasma membrane. Through membrane flotation assays, we show that in dierent cell lines, ACE2-GPI localises predominantly to raft domains of the plasma membrane while ACE2 is non-raft associated. We then compare the ability of ACE2 and ACE2-GPI to permit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry and syncytia formation and replication of dierent viral variants. We find little dierence in the two proteins. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 entry and fusion are a cholesterol dependent and raft-independent process.

IMPORTANCERafts are often exploited by viruses and used as platforms to enhance their entry into the cell or spread from cell-to-cell. The membrane localization of ACE2 and the role of lipid rafts in SARS-CoV-2 entry and cell-to-cell spread is poorly understood. The function of lipid rafts in viral fusion is often studied through their disruption by cholesterol-depleting agents. However, this process may have o-target impacts on viral fusion independently of lipid-raft disruption. Therefore, we created an ACE2 construct that localizes to lipid rafts using a GPI anchor. Conversely, wild-type ACE2 was non-raft associated. We find that the localization of ACE2 to lipid rafts does not modify the fusion dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

In addition to impacting poultry, these HPAI viruses caused mortality events in wild bird species and wild mammals. Transmission in multiple host species raises the concern for mammalian adaptation. On March 25, 2024, HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed in a dairy cow in Texas in response to a multi-state investigation into milk production losses. Over one hundred positive herds were rapidly identified in Texas and eleven other U.S. states. The case description included reduced feed intake and rumen motility in lactating cows, decreased milk production, and thick yellow milk. The diagnostic investigation revealed detections of viral RNA in milk and mammary tissue with alveolar epithelial degeneration and necrosis, and positive immunoreactivity of glandular epithelium by immunohistochemistry. A single transmission event, likely from avian species to dairy cattle, followed by limited local transmission preceded the onward lateral transmission of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13. We sought to experimentally reproduce infection with genotype B3.13 in Holstein yearling heifers and lactating cows. The heifers were inoculated by an aerosol respiratory route and the cows by an intramammary route. Clinical disease was mild in the heifers, but infection was confirmed by virus detection, lesions, and seroconversion. Clinical disease in lactating cows included decreased rumen motility, changes to milk appearance, and production losses consistent with field reports of viral mastitis. Infection was confirmed by high levels of viral RNA detected in milk, virus isolation, lesions in mammary tissue, and seroconversion. This study provides the foundation to investigate additional routes of infection, transmission, and intervention strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

The diazotrophic photoautotrophs also serve as a hub for specialized heterotrophic bacterial communities whose physiological contributions are poorly understood. By comparing the axenic strain Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 and the related strains Nostoc sp. KVJ2 and KVJ3, which still maintain their heterotrophic microbiome, we were able to demonstrate an almost obligate dependence of the cyanobacteria on the heterotrophic partners under carbon-limiting conditions. Detailed analysis of the intimate bilateral relationship between N. punctiforme and the isolate Agrobacterium tumefaciens Het4 using shotgun proteomics and microscopy uncovered a complex partnership characterized, among other traits, by competition for iron and facilitation for carbon. Although competitive interactions with A. tumefaciens Het4 compromise nitrogen fixation and stimulate the degradation of cyanophycin, mutualistic dependency prevails under inorganic carbon limitation. Both the absence of the high affinity bicarbonate uptake transporter SbtA and the prevalent extracarboxysomal localization of the carbon-fixing enzyme RubisCO, as detected by immunofluorescence microscopy, suggest that a weak carbon concentrating mechanism in N. punctiforme enforces a dependence on heterotrophic bacteria. Further, immunofluorescence, electron microscopic and proteomic analyses reveal a pronounced extracellular recycling of proteins under N- and C-limiting conditions. Our study shows that the pivotal influence of heterotrophic bacteria on symbiotic Nostoc strains should be considered when analyzing these cyanobacteria, especially in the free-living state. This work also sheds new light on how Nostoc benefits from the organic carbon provided by plant hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

They are known to impact microbial community dynamics, microbial ecology, and evolution. Efforts to document the diversity, host range, infection dynamics, and effects of bacteriophage infection on host cell metabolism are extremely underexplored. Phages are classified as virulent or temperate based on their life cycles. Temperate phages adopt the lysogenic mode of infection, where the genome integrates into the host cell genome forming a prophage. Prophages enable viral genome replication without host cell lysis, and often contribute novel and beneficial traits to the host genome. Current phage research predominantly focuses on lytic phages, leaving a significant gap in knowledge regarding prophages, including their biology, diversity, and ecological roles.

ResultsHere we develop and describe Prophage-DB, a database of prophages, their proteins, and associated metadata that will serve as a resource for viral genomics and microbial ecology. To create the database, we identified and characterized prophages from genomes in three of the largest publicly available databases. We applied several state-of-the-art tools in our pipeline to annotate these viruses, cluster and taxonomically classify them, and detect their respective auxiliary metabolic genes. In total, we identify and characterize over 350,000 prophages and 35,000 auxiliary metabolic genes. Our prophage database is highly representative based on statistical results and contains prophages from a diverse set of archaeal and bacterial hosts which show a wide environmental distribution.

ConclusionProphages are particularly overlooked in viral ecology and merit increased attention due to their vital implications for microbiomes and their hosts. Here, we created Prophage-DB to advance our comprehension of prophages in microbiomes through a comprehensive characterization of prophages in publicly available genomes. We propose that Prophage-DB will serve as a valuable resource for advancing phage research, offering insights into viral taxonomy, host relationships, auxiliary metabolic genes, and environmental distribution.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1721513135709

Despite this widely-held assumption, it remains unconfirmed how local density generally drives individuals positions within wild animal networks. We analysed 34 datasets of simultaneous spatial and social behaviour in >55,000 individual animals, spanning 28 species of fish, reptiles, birds, mammals, and insects. >80% of systems exhibited strongly positive relationships between local density and network centrality, providing broad empirical evidence that local density increases connectedness at the individual level. However, >75% of density-connectedness relationships were nonlinear, and densitys importance declined at higher values in >70% of systems, signifying saturating effects. Densitys effect was much stronger and less saturating for spatial than social networks, suggesting population density drives individuals to become disproportionately spatially connected rather than socially. These findings reveal fundamental trends underlying societal structuring, with widespread behavioural, ecological, and evolutionary implications.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Patients with loss-of-function mutations in the ARPC5 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex develop inflammation and immunodeficiency after birth, leading to early mortality. However, the mechanistic basis for these phenotypes remains obscure. Here we demonstrate that loss of Arpc5 in the murine hematopoietic system, but not the corresponding Arpc5l isoform causes early-onset intestinal inflammation. This condition is initiated by microbiota breaching the ileal mucosa, leading to local and systemic inflammation. Macrophage and neutrophils infiltrate into the ileum, but in the absence of Arpc5 fail to restrict microbial invasion. Loss of Arpc5 compromises the ability of macrophages to phagocytose and kill intra-cellular bacteria. Our results underscore the indispensable role of Arpc5, but not Arpc5l containing Arp2/3 complexes in mononuclear phagocytes function and host-microbiota homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

The relationship between cell shape and forces has been extensively studied for cells seeded on flat 2-dimensional (2D) substrates, but not for cells in more physiological three-dimensional (3D) settings. Here, we demonstrate a technique called 3D micropatterned traction force microscopy (3D-TFM) to confine cells in three-dimensional wells of defined shape, while simultaneously measuring the forces transmitted between cells and their microenvironment. This technique is based on the 3D micropatterning of polyacrylamide wells and on the calculation of 3D traction force from their deformation. With 3D-TFM, we show that MCF10A breast epithelial cells exert defined, reproducible patterns of forces on their microenvironment, which can be both contractile and extensile. We further show that cells switch from a global contractile to extensile behaviour as their volume is reduced. Our technique enables the quantitative study of cell mechanobiology with full access to 3D cellular forces while having accurate control over cell morphology and the mechanical conditions of the microenvironment.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135709

Typical MINFLUX microscopes localize the target molecule by scanning a zero-intensity focus around the molecule in a circular trajectory, with smaller trajectory diameters yielding lower localization uncertainties for a given number of photons. Since this approach requires the molecule to be within the scanned trajectory, MINFLUX typically relies on a photon-demanding iterative scheme with decreasing trajectory diameters. Although the iterative procedure does not substantially reduce the photon efficiency of MINFLUX, this approach is prone to misplacements of the trajectory and increases the systems complexity. In this work, we introduce ISM-FLUX, a novel implementation of MINFLUX using image-scanning microscopy (ISM) with a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detector. ISM-FLUX provides precise MINFLUX localization within the trajectory while maintaining conventional photon-limited uncertainty outside it. The robustness of ISM-FLUX localization results in a larger localization range and greatly simplifies the architecture, which may facilitate broader adoption of MIN-FLUX.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135710

New procedures were successfully developed to simultaneously detect indigenous and contaminant microbial cells in a drill core sample. Precision rock sectioning coupled with infrared, fluorescence and electron microscopy imaging of the rock section with submicron resolution revealed microbial colonization in veins filled with smectite. The entry and exit of microbial cells in the veins are severely limited by tight packing with smectite, the formation of which supplies energy sources for long-term habitability.

All participants underwent two weeks of left leg immobilization via the use of crutches and a locking leg brace. After this two-week period, all participants underwent eight weeks (3 d/week) of knee extensor focused progressive RT. Vastus lateralis (VL) ultrasound-derived thickness and muscle cross-sectional area were measured at baseline (PRE), immediately after disuse (MID), and after RT (POST) with VL muscle biopsies collected at these time points. T and UT presented lower ultrasound derived VL size (cross-sectional area and thickness) values at MID versus PRE (p[&le;]0.001), and values increased in both groups from MID to POST (p<0.05); however, VL size increased from PRE to POST in UT only (p<0.001). Mean and type II myofiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) values demonstrated a main effect of time where PRE and POST were greater than MID (p<0.05) and main effect of training status where T was greater than UT (P[&le;]0.012). In both groups, satellite cell number was not affected by leg immobilization but increased in response to RT (p[&le;]0.014), with T being greater than UT across all time points (p=0.004). Additionally, ribosome content (total RNA) decreased (p=0.010) from PRE to MID while the endoplasmic reticulum stress proteins (BiP, Xbp1s, and CHOP) increased from MID to POST regardless of training status. Finally, the phosphorylation states of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1 signaling proteins were not significantly altered for either group throughout the intervention. In conclusion, immobilization-induced muscle atrophy and recovery RT hypertrophy outcomes are similar between UT and T participants, and the lack of molecular signature differences between groups supports these findings. However, these data are limited to younger adults undergoing non-complicated disuse. Thus, further investigation to determine the impact of training status on prolonged leg immobilization models mirroring current medical protocols (e.g., following orthopedic injury and surgery) is warranted.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135710

In total, we quantify the nucleation rates of >100,000 20-amino-acid-long peptides. This large and diverse dataset allows us to train CANYA, a convolution-attention hybrid neural network. CANYA is fast and outperforms existing methods with stable performance across diverse prediction tasks. Interpretability analyses reveal CANYAs decision-making process and learned grammar, providing mechanistic insights into amyloid nucleation. Our results illustrate the power of massive experimental analysis of random sequence-spaces and provide an interpretable and robust neural network model to predict amyloid nucleation.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135710

In our study, we investigated the case of Saccharolobus solfataricus, a crenarchaeon belonging to the TACK branch, which mainly uses leaderless mRNAs. We characterized the small ribosomal subunit of S. solfataricus bound to SD-leadered or leaderless mRNAs (lmRNAs). Cryo-EM structures show for the first time archaeal versions of eS25, eS26 and eS30 proteins bound to the small subunit. In addition, we identify two novel ribosomal proteins named aS33 and aS34 as well as a domain of eS6, that highlight the diversity of archaeal ribosomes. Leaderless mRNAs are bound to the small ribosomal subunit, and the 5-triphosphate group contributes to their binding. Archaeal eS26 is in the mRNA exit channel wrapped around the 3 end of ribosomal RNA, as it is in eukaryotes. Its position is not compatible with an SD:antiSD duplex in the mRNA exit channel.

We can generalize by ignoring task-irrelevant features, report different features of a stimulus, and use different actions to report a perceptual judgment. These forms of flexible behavior are associated with small modulations of the responses of sensory neurons. While the existence of these response modulations is indisputable, efforts to understand their function have been largely relegated to theory, where they have been posited to change information coding or enable downstream neurons to read out different visual and cognitive information using flexible weights. Here, we tested these ideas using a rich, flexible behavioral paradigm, multi-neuron, multi-area recordings in primary visual cortex (V1) and mid-level visual area V4. We discovered that those response modulations in V4 (but not V1) contain the ingredients necessary to enable flexible behavior, but not via those previously hypothesized mechanisms. Instead, we demonstrated that these response modulations are precisely coordinated across the population such that downstream neurons have ready access to the correct information to flexibly guide behavior without making changes to information coding or synapses. Our results suggest a novel computational role for task-dependent response modulations: they enable flexible behavior by changing the information that gets out of a sensory area, not by changing information coding within it.

SignificanceNatural perceptual judgments are continuous, generalized, and flexible. We estimate the ripeness of a piece of fruit on a continuous scale, we generalize by judging the ripeness of either a mango or an avocado even though they look very different, we flexibly judge either the size or the ripeness of the same piece of fruit, and we can flexibly indicate the same perceptual judgment using a variety of behaviors such as by speaking or writing any of many languages. Here, we show that the response modulations in visual cortex long associated with cognitive processes, surround modulation, or motor planning are sufficient to guide all these aspects of natural perceptual decision-making. We find that across the population, these response modulations reorient and reformat visual representations so that the relevant information is used to guide behavior via communication with downstream neurons. Our results are an example of a general computational principle for flexible behavior that emerges from the coordinated activity of large populations of neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135710

Protrudin recruits KIF5 to provide a FYCO1-independent force to fission endosomal tubules in neurons and non-polarised cells.

AbstractFission of transport tubules from early endosomes is required for endosomal sorting, but mechanisms of endosomal tubule fission (ETF) are incompletely understood. We show protrudin acts at ER-endosome contacts to promote ETF and endosome-to-Golgi traffic. Protrudin-mediated ETF required its ability to interact with ER-localised VAP proteins, endosomal phosphoinositides and KIF5. These properties also regulated the distance between protrudin and endosomal tubules. The defective ETF phenotype of increased endosomal tubulation in cells lacking protrudin was phenocopied by depletion of KIF5, but not FYCO1, a motor protein adaptor implicated in protrudin-dependent late endosome motility. It also required intact microtubules and dynein, consistent with a model where protrudin facilitates a tug-of-war between KIF5 and dynein to fission tubules. In addition to its direct role, protrudin links many other machineries involved in ETF, thus our findings elucidate how ETF is co-ordinated. These machineries are enriched for proteins implicated in hereditary motor neuron disorders, and protrudin or KIF5 depletion caused defective ETF in human neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135710

In the absence of defined network junctions, the high conformational freedom of the molecules was previously theorized to confer unique mechanical properties to Olympic gels, such as non-linear elasticity and unconventional swelling characteristics. However, the synthesis of an Olympic gel exhibiting these intriguing features is challenging, since unintended crosslinking and polymerization processes are often favored over cyclization. Here, we report the successful assembly of a true Olympic gel from a library of DNA rings comprising more than 16,000 distinct molecules. Each of these rings contains a unique sequence domain that can be enzymatically activated to produce reactive termini that favor intramolecular cyclization. We characterized the materials genetic, mechanical, and structural characteristics by next-generation sequencing, oscillatory rheology, large-scale computational simulations, atomic force microscopy, and cryogenic electron microscopy. Our results confirm the formation of a stable Olympic gel, which exhibits unique swelling behavior and an elastic response that is exclusively determined by entanglements, yet persists on long time scales. By combining concepts from polymer physics, synthetic biology, and DNA nanotechnology, this new material class provides a flexible experimental platform for future studies into the effects of network topology on macroscopic material properties and its function as a carrier of genetic information in biological and biomimetic systems. This work moreover demonstrates that exotic material properties can emerge in systems with a high compositional complexity that is more reminiscent of biological than synthetic matter.

Here, we evaluated 59 healthy individuals using resting-state fMRI to determine how network-level temporal dynamics were impacted by two well-characterized pharmacotherapies targeting catecholamines: methylphenidate (20mg) and haloperidol (2mg). Network dynamic changes were tested for links with drug-induced alterations in complex corticostriatal connections as this circuit is a primary site of action for both drugs. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design was used. Methylphenidate enhanced time spent in the default mode network (DMN p<0 .001) and dorsal attention network (DAN p<0.001) and reduced time in the frontoparietal network (p<0.01). Haloperidol increased time in a sensory motor-DMN state (p<0.01). The magnitude of change in network dynamics induced by methylphenidate vs. placebo was correlated with the magnitude of methylphenidate-induced rearrangement of complex corticostriatal connectivity (R=0.32, p=0.014). Haloperidol did not alter complex corticostriatal connectivity. Methylphenidate increased time in networks involved in internal (DMN) and external attention (DAN), aligning with methylphenidates established role in attention. Methylphenidate also significantly changed complex corticostriatal connectivity by altering the relative strength between multiple corticostriatal connections, indicating that methylphenidate may shift which corticostriatal connections are prioritized relative to others. Findings further show that these local circuit changes are linked with large scale network function. Collectively, these findings provide a deeper understanding of large-scale network function, set a stage for mechanistic understanding of network engagement, and provide needed information to potentially guide medication use based on network-level effects.","NA","medrxiv",1721513135710

Wheat resistance breeding frequently relies on the use of resistance (R) genes that encode diverse immune receptors which detect specific avirulence (AVR) effectors and subsequently induce an immune response. While R gene cloning has accelerated recently, AVR identification in many pathogens including Bgt lags behind, preventing pathogen-informed deployment of resistance sources. Here we describe a new ""avirulence depletion (AD) assay"" for rapid identification of AVR genes in Bgt. This assay relies on the selection of a segregating, haploid F1 progeny population on a resistant host, followed by bulk sequencing, thereby allowing rapid avirulence candidate gene identification with high mapping resolution. In a proof-of- concept experiment we mapped the AVR component of the wheat immune receptor Pm3a to a 25kb genomic interval in Bgt harboring a single effector, the previously described AvrPm3a2/f2. Subsequently, we applied the AD assay to map the unknown AVR effector recognized by the Pm60 immune receptor. We show that AvrPm60 is encoded by three tandemly arrayed, nearly identical effector genes that trigger an immune response upon co- expression with Pm60 and its alleles Pm60a and Pm60b. We furthermore provide evidence that Pm60 outperforms Pm60a and Pm60b through more efficient recognition of AvrPm60 effectors, suggesting it should be prioritized for wheat breeding. Finally, we show that virulence towards Pm60 is caused by simultaneous deletion of all AvrPm60 gene paralogs and that isolates lacking AvrPm60 are especially prevalent in the US thereby limiting the potential of Pm60 in this region. The AD assay is a powerful new tool for rapid and inexpensive AVR identification in Bgt with the potential to contribute to pathogen-informed breeding decisions for the use of novel R genes and regionally tailored gene deployment.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135710

If fighting was essential to get access to mates and territory, then why did fights rarely lead to serious injury? Maynard Smith and Price developed game theory to show that limited war can be selected at the individual level. Owing to the explanatory potential of this first paper, and enabled by the elegant and powerful machinery of the soon-to-be-developed replicator dynamics [2, 3], EGT took off at an accelerated pace and began to shape expectations across systems and scales. But, even as it expanded its reach from animals to microbes [4-8] and from microbes to cancer [9-11], the field did not revisit a fundamental assumption of that first paper, which subsequently got weaved into the very fabric of the framework--that individual differences in reproduction are determined only by payoff from the game (i.e. in isolation, all individuals, regardless of strategy, were assumed to have identical intrinsic growth rates). Here, we argue that this original assumption substantially limits the scope of EGT. But, because it is not explicitly presented as a caveat, predictions of EGT have been empirically tested broadly across real systems, where the intrinsic growth rates are generally not equal. That has, unsurprisingly, led to puzzling findings and contentious debates [7, 12-15]. Flagging the high potential for confusion to arise from applications of EGT to empirical systems that it is not designed to study and suggesting a way forward constitute our main motivation for this work. In the process, we reestablish a dialog with ecology that can be fruitful both ways, e.g., by providing a so-far-elusive explanation for how diverse ecological communities can assemble evolutionarily.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135710

Here, we show that the dynamics of plasmid transmission follow a simple ecological model known as Hollings Type II Functional Response. Plasmid transmission dynamics can be faithfully captured using two parameters: the searching rate (the pace at which a donor bacterium encounters a suitable recipient) and the handling time (the time required for a donor to transfer the plasmid). By analyzing the dynamics of different plasmid prototypes, we show that these parameters are characteristic of the plasmid transfer machinery. Quantifying the dynamics of plasmid spread may shed light on the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance genes.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135710

This paper aimed to assess a multitude of cardiac signs, symptoms, and conditions, as well as focused on patients with and without congenital heart defects (CHDs), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the post-acute cardiovascular outcomes among children and adolescents after COVID-19.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 19 US childrens hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and September 2023. Every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry. Absolute risks of incident post-acute COVID-19 sequelae were reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by contrasting COVID-19-positive with COVID-19-negative groups using a Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through propensity scoring stratification.

ResultsA total of 1,213,322 individuals under 21 years old (mean[SD] age, 7.75[6.11] years; 623,806 male [51.4%]) were included. The absolute rate of any post-acute cardiovascular outcome in this study was 2.32% in COVID-19 positive and 1.38% in negative groups. Patients with CHD post-SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks of any cardiovascular outcome (RR, 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-1.80), including increased risks of 11 of 18 post-acute sequelae in hypertension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias), myocarditis, other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest), thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain and palpitations). Those without CHDs also experienced heightened cardiovascular risks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.69), covering 14 of 18 conditions in hypertension, arrhythmias (ventricular arrhythmias and premature atrial or ventricular contractions), inflammatory heart disease (pericarditis and myocarditis), other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock), thrombotic disorders (pulmonary embolism and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and syncope).

ConclusionsBoth children with and without CHDs showed increased risks for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the need for targeted monitoring and management in the post-acute phase.

What are the clinical implications?O_LIWithin the post-acute phase, children and adolescents previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at statistically significant increased risk of incident cardiovascular outcomes, including hypertension, ventricular arrhythmias, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, thromboembolism, chest pain, and palpitations. These findings are consistent among patients with and without CHDs.

We identified 8.94 million population-specific small variants and 235,195 structural variants within the Arab pangenome. We detected 883 gene duplications including 15.06% associated with recessive diseases and 1,436 bp of novel mitochondrial pangenome sequence. Our study provides a valuable resource for future genomic medicine initiatives in Arab population and other global populations.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135710

Here, we report PARM, a cell-type specific deep learning model trained on specially designed massively parallel reporter assays that query human promoter sequences. PARM requires [~]1,000 times less computational power than state-of-the-art technology, and reliably predicts autonomous promoter activity throughout the genome from DNA sequence alone, in multiple cell types. PARM can even design purely synthetic strong promoters. We leveraged PARM to systematically identify binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) that are likely to contribute to the activity of each natural human promoter. We uncovered and experimentally confirmed striking positional preferences of TFs that differ between activating and repressive regulatory functions, as well as a complex grammar of motif-motif interactions. For example, many, but not all, TFs act as repressors when their binding motif is located near or just downstream of the transcription start site. Our approach lays the foundation towards a deep understanding of the regulation of human promoters by TFs.

The key component of this system, ParB, loads and spreads along DNA to form a local protein-DNA condensate known as a partition complex. As bacterial chromosomes are heavily supercoiled due to the continuous action of RNA polymerases, gyrases, and nucleoid-associated proteins, it is important to study the impact of DNA supercoiling on the ParB-DNA partition complex formation. Here, we use an in vitro single- molecule assay to visualize ParB on supercoiled DNA. Unlike most DNA-binding proteins, individual ParB proteins are found to not pin plectonemes on supercoiled DNA, but freely diffuse along supercoiled DNA. We find that DNA supercoiling enhances ParB-DNA condensation which initiates at lower ParB concentrations than on DNA that is torsionally relaxed. ParB proteins induce a DNA- protein condensate that strikingly absorbs all supercoiling writhe. Our findings provide mechanistic insights that have important implications for our understanding of bacterial chromosome organization and segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135710

Mitochondrial dysfunction is widely considered a key contributing mechanism to muscle aging. However, mounting evidence position physical activity as a confounding factor, making unclear whether muscle mitochondria accumulate bona fide defects with aging. To disentangle aging from physical activity-related mitochondrial adaptations, we functionally profiled skeletal muscle mitochondria in 51 inactive and 88 active men aged 20-93. Physical activity status conferred partial protection against age-related decline in physical performance. A trend for reduced muscle mitochondrial respiration with aging was observed in inactive but not in active participants, indicating that aging per se does not alter mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was unaffected by aging and active participants displayed higher ROS production. In contrast, mitochondrial calcium retention capacity decreased with aging regardless of physical activity status and correlated with muscle mass, performance and the stress-responsive metabokine GDF15. Targeting mitochondrial calcium handling may hold promise for treating aging-related muscle impairments.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135710

Contrary to this, we show that both regions appear to be indistinguishable in their encoding/decoding of accumulator value and communicate this information bidirectionally. Consistent with a role for FOF in accumulation, silencing FOF to ADS projections impacted behavior throughout the accumulation period, even while nonselective FOF silencing did not. We synthesize these findings into a multi-region recurrent neural network trained with a novel approach. In-silico experiments reveal that multiple scales of recurrence in the cortico-striatal circuit rescue computation upon nonselective FOF perturbations.

Here, we demonstrate that long- read chromatin fiber sequencing (Fiber-seq) permits the comprehensive annotation of the regulatory potential of maize TEs. We uncover that only 94 LTR retrotransposons contain the functional epigenetic architecture required for mobilization within maize leaves. This epigenetic architecture degenerates with evolutionary age, resulting in solo TE enhancers being preferentially marked by simultaneous hyper-CpG methylation and chromatin accessibility, an architecture markedly divergent from canonical enhancers. We find that TEs shape maize gene regulation by creating novel promoters within the TE itself as well as through TE-mediated gene amplification. Lastly, we uncover a pervasive epigenetic code directing TEs to specific loci, including that locus that sparked McClintocks discovery of TEs.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135710

They can learn to vocalize on command and the activity of single neurons from the crows associative telencephalic structure nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) is correlated with the execution of this vocal and many non-vocal skilled behaviors. However, it remains unknown if specific anatomical adaptations that directly link the crow NCL to any of the nuclei of the crows ""song system"" exist. To address this issue, we used fluorescent tracers along with histological staining methods (Nissl-, myelin-, and anti tyrosine hydroxylase) to characterize the connectivity of the crows NCL in relation to its song system nuclei. We found that the NCL sends dense projections into the dorsal intermediate arcopallium (AID) directly adjacent to and engulfing the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), which is the telencephalic motor output of the song system. Similarly, we demonstrate dense NCL projections into the striatum surrounding the basal ganglia song nucleus ""area X"". Both of these descending projections mirror the projections of the nidopallial song nucleus HVC (proper name) into RA and area X, with extremely sparse NCL fibers extending into area X. Furthermore, we characterized the distribution of cells projecting from the lateral part of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MAN) to NCL. Notably, a separate medial population of MAN cells projects to HVC. These two sets of connections--MAN to NCL and MAN to HVC--run in parallel but do not overlap. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that the NCL is part of a ""general motor system"" that parallels the song system but exhibits only minimal monosynaptic interconnections with it.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135710

Given a collection of reference sequences, a c-dBG can be essentially regarded as a map from k-mers to their color sets. The color set of a k-mer is the set of all identifiers, or colors, of the references that contain the k-mer. While these maps find countless applications in computational biology (e.g., basic query, reading mapping, abundance estimation, etc.), their memory usage represents a serious challenge for large-scale sequence indexing. Our solutions leverage on the intrinsic repetitiveness of the color sets when indexing large collections of related genomes. Hence, the described algorithms factorize the color sets into patterns that repeat across the entire collection and represent these patterns once, instead of redundantly replicating their representation as would happen if the sets were encoded as atomic lists of integers. Experimental results across a range of datasets and query workloads show that these representations substantially improve over the space effectiveness of the best previous solutions (sometimes, even dramatically, yielding indexes that are smaller by an order of magnitude). Despite the space reduction, these indexes only moderately impact the efficiency of the queries compared to the fastest indexes.

Participants were randomised to the primary intervention (prebiotic blend; 30g/d) or control (bread croutons; 28g/d; isocaloric functional equivalent) or a daily probiotic (L. rhamnosus). The primary outcome was change in  favourable and  unfavourable microbiome species compared to control, secondary outcomes included changes in blood metabolites, gut symptoms, stool output, anthropometric measures, subjective hunger, sleep, energy and mood. A crossover test meal challenge sub-study was conducted in 34 participants, investigating postprandial glucose responses, subjective hunger, satiety and mood.

In the 349 male and female participants (mean age 50yrs) included in the analysis (intention-to-treat), self-reported adherence was high (> 98% for all treatments). Following the prebiotic blend, significant improvements were seen in the change and ranking of  favourable and  unfavourable species as well as beta diversity (weighted-UniFrac measure), but not in the control or probiotic group. There were significantly greater improvements in self reported indigestion, constipation, heartburn, flatulence and energy, following the prebiotic vs control, and hunger following the prebiotic vs probiotic. Addition of the prebiotic to a high carbohydrate test meal challenge resulted in significant improvements in subjective hunger, fullness, and energy (3h incremental area under the curve). No other significant differences between groups were observed.

This prebiotic blend is a simple dietary strategy that benefits gut microbiome composition, gut symptoms and self-reported energy and hunger.

We leverage whole-genome sequencing of >2600 plants across six continents to investigate the relative roles of colonization history and adaptation during the worldwide invasion of Trifolium repens. Introduced populations contain high levels of genetic variation with independent colonization histories evident on different continents. Five large structural variants on three chromosomes exist as standing genetic variation within the native range, and exhibit strong signatures of parallel climate-associated adaptation across continents. Common gardens in the native and introduced ranges demonstrate that three structural variants exhibit patterns of selection consistent with local adaptation across each range. Our results provide strong evidence that rapid and parallel adaptation during invasion is caused by large-effect structural variants introduced throughout the world.

Significance StatementBiological invasions occur over short timescales and introductions are often hypothesized to include limited genetic diversity, making the role of adaptation in invasion success controversial. We demonstrate that the invasion of a human-commensal species, Trifolium repens, likely stems from multiple, diverse introductions with significant evidence of climate-associated adaptation following introduction. The genetic basis of adaptation is most strongly linked to five chromosomal rearrangements that each span hundreds of genes - matching theoretical predictions that large-effect variants are key to the initial stages of adaptation to novel environments. Chromosomal rearrangements have remarkably parallel signatures of adaptation across different introductions despite initial colonization from different areas of Europe. Our study highlights the impact of globalization and rapid adaptation for the invasion success of human commensal species.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135710

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1721513135710
