We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1717797965446

A core feature of the consolidation process is offline replay of neuronal firing patterns that occur during experience7,8. This replay is thought to originate in the hippocampus and trigger the reactivation of ensembles of cortical and subcortical neurons1,3,9-18. However, non-declarative memories do not require the hippocampus for learning or for sleep-dependent consolidation19-26 meaning what drives their consolidation is unknown. Here we show, using an unsupervised method, that replay occurs in the dorsal striatum of mice during offline consolidation of a non-declarative, procedural, memory and that this replay is generated independently of the hippocampus. Replay occurred at both real-world and time-compressed speeds and was also prioritised both at the level of the individual neurons and the type of neural sequence. Complete bilateral lesions of the hippocampus had no effect on any feature of this replay. Our results demonstrate that procedural replay during consolidation of a non-declarative memory is independent of the hippocampus. These results support the view that replay drives active consolidation of all types of memory during sleep but challenges the idea that the hippocampus is the source of this replay.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

To minimize interpretational uncertainty, researchers control for across-cohort disparities in age, gender, co-morbidities, and head motion. Yet, studies rarely, if ever, consider the possibility that systematic differences in inner experience (i.e., what subjects think and feel during the scan) may directly affect FC measures. Here we demonstrate that is the case using a rs-fMRI dataset comprising 471 scans annotated with experiential data. Wide-spread significant differences in FC are observed between scans that systematically differ in terms of reported in-scanner experience. Additionally, we show that FC can successfully predict specific aspects of in-scanner experience in a manner similar to how it predicts demographics, cognitive abilities, clinical outcomes and labels. Together, these results highlight the key role of in-scanner experience in shaping rs-fMRI estimates of FC.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

But as these designs expand to multigene systems it becomes challenging to sequence these in a cost-effective way that reveals the genotype to phenotype relationships in the libraries. Here, we introduce a new quick, low-cost method designed for assessing combinational designs of genome-integrated multigene constructs that we call Pool of Long Amplified Reads (POLAR) sequencing. POLAR-seq takes genomic DNA isolated from library pools and uses long range PCR to amplify target genomic regions up to 35 kb long containing combinatorial designs. The pool of long amplicons is then directly read by nanopore sequencing with full length reads then used to identify the gene content and structural variation of individual genotypes in the library and read count indicating how abundant a genotype is within the pool. Using yeast cells with loxP-containing synthetic gene clusters that rearrange in vivo in the presence of Cre recombinase, we demonstrate how POLAR-seq can be used to identify global patterns from combinatorial experiments, find the most abundant genotypes in a pool and also be adapted to sequence-verify gene clusters from isolated strains.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

A short-term increase in reliance on social information under these conditions has been experimentally shown in primates, including humans, but whether this occurs in other taxa is unknown. By conducting a large-scale cultural diffusion experiment, we asked whether migration between spatially variable environments affected social information use in great tits (Parus major), a small passerine bird that can socially learn novel behaviors. We simulated an immigration event where knowledgeable birds were exchanged between groups with opposing preferences for a socially learned foraging puzzle, living in similar or different environments. We found evidence that both immigrants and residents were influenced by social information and attended to the rewards that others received. Our analysis supported the use of a payoff-biased social learning by immigrants when both resources and habitat features were spatially variable. In contrast, immigrants relied more-so on individual learning when payoffs or the environment were unchanged. In summary, our results suggest that great tits assess the payoffs others receive, and are more influenced by socially observed differences in payoffs when environmental cues differ in their new environment. Our results provide experimental support for the hypothesis that spatial variation is a strong driver for the evolution of social learning strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

However, natural populations frequently violate this assumption, which may potentially confound genome-wide association studies, selection scans, and demographic inference. Within several recently admixed human populations, empirical genetic studies have reported a correlation in global ancestry proportion between spouses, referred to as ancestry-assortative mating. Here, we use forward genomic simulations to link correlations in ancestry between mates to the underlying mechanistic mate-choice process. We consider the impacts of two types of mate-choice model, using either ancestry-based preferences or social groups as the basis for mate pairing. We find that multiple mate-choice models can produce the same correlations in ancestry proportion between spouses; however, we also highlight alternative analytic approaches and circumstances in which these models may be distinguished. With this work, we seek to highlight potential pitfalls when interpreting correlations in empirical data as evidence for a particular model of human mating practices, as well as to offer suggestions toward development of new best practices for analysis of human ancestry-assortative mating.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

We show that a range of inbred and outbred PSC lines can be stably maintained in the primed pluripotent state (epiblast stem cells -- EpiSCs) and establish the contribution of genetic variation to phenotypic differences in gene regulation and directed differentiation. Using pooled in vitro fertilization, we generate and characterize a genetic reference panel of Diversity Outbred PSCs (n = 230). Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of pooled culture of Diversity Outbred EpiSCs as ""cell villages"", which can facilitate the differentiation of large numbers of EpiSC lines for forward genetic screens.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has MCSs with a variety of organelles in the cell. MCSs are dynamic, responding to changes in cell state, and are therefore best visualized through inducible labeling methods. However, existing methods typically distort ER-MCSs, by expanding contacts or creating artificial ones. Here we describe a new method for inducible labeling of ER-MCSs using the Lamin B receptor (LBR) and a generic anchor protein on the partner organelle. Termed LaBeRling, this versatile, one-to-many approach allows labeling of different types of ER-MCSs (mitochondria, plasma membrane, lysosomes, early endosomes, lipid droplets and Golgi), on-demand, in interphase or mitotic cells. LaBeRling is non-disruptive and does not change ER-MCSs in terms of the contact number, extent or distance measured; as determined by light microscopy or a deep-learning volume electron microscopy approach. We applied this method to study the changes in ER-MCSs during mitosis and to label novel ER-Golgi contact sites at different mitotic stages in live cells.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

We investigated how ecological interactions between microbes derived from polymicrobial urinary tract infections affect the tempo and mode of antibiotic resistance evolution. We show that for representative strains of three uropathogens, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecium, the rate and evolutionary trajectories towards antibiotic resistance depend on interactions with community members that mediate their growth and antibiotic tolerance. Replicate lineages of the same species evolved under similar ecological conditions show parallel evolutionary trajectories.

Two actionable variants in these genes have reached much higher frequencies than in cosmopolitan UK populations. Here, we report a BRCA2 splice acceptor variant, c.517-2A>G, found in breast and ovarian cancer families from Shetland. We investigated the frequency and origin of this variant in a population-based research cohort of people of Shetland ancestry, VIKING I. The variant segregates with female breast and ovarian cancer in diagnosed cases and is classified as pathogenic. Exome sequence data from 2,108 participants with three or more Shetlandic grandparents in VIKING I was used to estimate the population prevalence of c.517-2A>G in Shetlanders. Nine VIKING I research volunteers carry this variant, on a shared haplotype (carrier frequency 0.4%). This frequency is [~]130-fold higher than in UK Biobank, where the small group of carriers has a different haplotype. Records of birth, marriage and death indicate genealogical linkage of VIKING I carriers to a founder from the Isle of Whalsay, Shetland, similar to our observations for the BRCA1 founder variant from Westray, Orkney. In total, 93.5% of pathogenic BRCA variant carriers in Northern Isles exomes are accounted for by these two drifted variants. We thus provide the scientific evidence of an opportunity for screening people of Orcadian and Shetlandic origins for each drifted pathogenic variant, particularly women with Westray or Whalsay ancestry.","NA","medrxiv",1717797965446

For each comparison, participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the relevant antiviral (five days of molnupiravir 800mg twice daily or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 300mg/100mg twice daily) or to usual care without the relevant antiviral drug, using web-based unstratified randomisation with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were time to discharge alive from hospital, and among those not on invasive ventilation at baseline, progression to invasive ventilation or death. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Both comparisons were stopped by the investigators because of low recruitment. ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsFrom 24 January 2022 to 24 May 2023, 923 patients were recruited to the molnupiravir comparison (445 allocated molnupiravir and 478 allocated usual care), and from 31 March 2022 to 24 May 2023, 137 patients were recruited to the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison (68 allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 69 allocated usual care). More than three-quarters of the patients in both comparisons were vaccinated and had anti-spike antibodies at randomisation, and more than two-thirds were receiving other SARS-CoV-2 antivirals (including remdesivir or sotrovimab). In the molnupiravir comparison, 74 (17%) patients allocated to molnupiravir and 79 (17%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.28; p=0.66). In the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, 13 (19%) patients allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 13 (19%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.47-2.23; p=0.96). In neither comparison was there evidence of a significant difference in the duration of hospitalisation or the proportion of patients progressing to invasive ventilation or death.

InterpretationIn adults hospitalised with COVID-19, neither molnupiravir nor nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were associated with reductions in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death although these comparisons had limited statistical power due to low recruitment.

Procarbazine in eBEACOPP (escalated dose bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisolone) is increasingly replaced with dacarbazine (eBEACOPDac) to reduce toxicity, although limited genomic and clinical data support this substitution. Methods To assess mutagenic and clinical consequences of dacarbazine-procarbazine substitutions, we compared mutational landscapes in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from patients treated with different Hodgkin regimens and children, sperm and bowel tissue from procarbazine-treated patients. We compared efficacy and toxicity data of a multicentre eBEACOPDac-treated patient cohort, with eBEACOPP clinical trial and real-world datasets. Results eBEACOPP-treated patients exhibit a higher burden of point mutations, small insertions and deletions in HSPCs compared to eBEACOPDac and ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine)-treated patients. Two novel mutational signatures, SBSA (SBS25-like) and SBSB were identified in HSPCs, neoplastic and normal colon from only procarbazine-treated patients. SBSB was also identified in germline DNA of three children conceived post-eBEACOPP and sperm of an eBEACOPP-treated male. The dacarbazine substitution did not appear to compromise efficacy; 3-year progression-free survival of 312 eBEACOPDac patients (93.3%; CI95=90.3-96.4%) mirrored that of 1945 HD18-trial eBEACOPP patients (93.3%; CI95=92.1-94.4%). eBEACOPDac-treated patients required fewer blood transfusions, demonstrated higher post-chemotherapy sperm concentrations, and experienced earlier resumption of menstrual periods. Conclusions Procarbazine induces a higher mutational burden and novel mutational signatures in eBEACOPP-treated patients and their germline DNA raising concerns for hereditary consequences. However, replacing procarbazine with dacarbazine appears to mitigate gonadal and stem cell toxicity while maintaining comparable clinical efficacy.","NA","medrxiv",1717797965446

Recently, it was shown that AP-3 is in a constitutively open, active conformation compared to the related AP-1 and AP-2 coat complexes, which are inactive until undergoing large conformational changes upon membrane recruitment. How AP-3 is regulated is therefore an open question. To understand the mechanism of AP-3 membrane recruitment and activation, we reconstituted the core of human AP-3 and determined multiple structures in the soluble and membrane-bound states using electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). Similar to yeast AP-3, human AP-3 is in a constitutively open conformation, with the cargo-binding domain of the 3 subunit conformationally free. To reconstitute AP-3 activation by the small GTPase Arf1, we used lipid nanodiscs to build Arf1-AP-3 complexes on membranes and determined three structures that show the stepwise conformational changes required for formation of AP-3 coated vesicles. First, membrane-recruitment is driven by one of two predicted Arf1 binding sites on AP-3. In this conformation, AP-3 is flexibly tethered to the membrane and its cargo binding domain remains conformationally dynamic. Second, cargo binding causes AP-3 to adopt a fixed position and rigidifies the complex, which stabilizes binding for a second Arf1 molecule. Finally, binding of the second Arf1 molecule provides the template for AP-3 dimerization, providing a glimpse into the first step of coat polymerization. We propose coat polymerization only occurs after cargo engagement, thereby linking cargo sorting with assembly of higher order coat structures. Additionally, we provide evidence for two amphipathic helices in AP-3, suggesting that AP-3 contributes to membrane deformation during coat assembly. In total, these data provide evidence for the first stages of AP-3 mediated vesicle coat assembly.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

Extensive genome sequencing efforts are currently in progress across a broad spectrum of life forms, holding the potential to unravel the intricate branching patterns within the tree of life. However, estimating species trees starting from raw genome sequences is quite challenging, and the current cutting-edge methodologies require a series of error-prone steps that are neither entirely automated nor standardized. In this paper, we present ROADIES, a novel pipeline for species tree inference from raw genome assemblies that is fully automated, easy to use, scalable, free from reference bias, and provides flexibility to adjust the tradeoff between accuracy and runtime. The ROADIES pipeline eliminates the need to align whole genomes, choose a single reference species, or pre-select loci such as functional genes found using cumbersome annotation steps. Moreover, it leverages recent advances in phylogenetic inference to allow multi-copy genes, eliminating the need to detect orthology. Using the genomic datasets released from large-scale sequencing consortia across three diverse life forms (placental mammals, pomace flies, and birds), we show that ROADIES infers species trees that are comparable in quality with the state-of-the-art approaches but in a fraction of the time. By incorporating optimal approaches and automating all steps from assembled genomes to species and gene trees, ROADIES is poised to improve the accuracy, scalability, and reproducibility of phylogenomic analyses.

To our knowledge, a comprehensive assessment of the financial net benefits of digital endpoints in clinical trials has not been conducted.

Data and MethodsWe obtained data from the Digital Medicine Society (DiMe) Library of Digital Endpoints and the U.S. clinical trials registry, ClinicalTrials.gov. The benefit metrics are changes in trial phase duration and enrollment associated with the use of digital endpoints. The cost metric was obtained from an industry survey of the costs of including digital endpoints in clinical trials. We developed an expected net present value (eNPV) model of the cash flows for new drug development and commercialization to assess financial value. The value measure is the increment in eNPV that occurs when digital endpoints are employed. We also calculated a return on investment (ROI) as the ratio of the estimated increment in eNPV to the mean digital endpoint implementation cost.

ResultsFor phase 2 trials, the increase in eNPV varied from $2.2 million to $3.3 million, with ROIs between 32% to 48% per indication. The net benefits were substantially higher for phase 3 trials, with the increase in eNPV varying from $27 million to $48 million, with ROIs that were four to seven times the investment.

ConclusionsThe use of digital endpoints in clinical trials can provide substantial extra value to sponsors developing new drugs, with high ROIs.","NA","medrxiv",1717797965446

Computational denoising methods can bypass imaging constraints and improve signal-to-noise ratio in images. However, current state of the art methods are commonly trained in a supervised manner, requiring paired noisy and clean images, limiting their application across diverse datasets. An alternative class of denoising models can be trained in a self-supervised manner, assuming independent noise across samples but are unable to generalize from available unpaired clean images. A method that can be trained without paired data and can use information from available unpaired high-quality images would address both weaknesses. Here, we present Baikal, a first attempt to formulate such a framework using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for fluorescence microscopy images. We first train a DDPM backbone in an unconditional manner to learn generative priors over complex morphologies in microscopy images. We then apply various conditioning strategies to sample from the trained model and propose an optimal strategy to denoise the desired image. Extensive quantitative comparisons demonstrate better performance of Baikal over state of the art self-supervised methods across multiple datasets. We highlight the advantage of generative priors learnt by DDPMs in denoising complex Flywing morphologies where other methods fail. Overall, our DDPM based denoising framework presents a new class of denoising methods for fluorescence microscopy datasets that achieve high performance without collection of paired high-quality images.

Tanning bed radiation is often thought of as a substitute for natural UV radiation despite differences in the maximum doses, UV content, body sites exposed, and patterns of melanoma that arise. Methods: To better understand the epidemiologic trends and etiology of melanoma associated with tanning bed use, we described the patterns of melanoma in patients with quantifiable tanning bed usage and performed exome sequencing of 182 melanocytes from normal skin of a subset of these patients. Results: Tanning bed users were more likely than non-users to have melanoma on body sites with low cumulative levels of sun damage and were more likely to have multiple melanomas. The melanocytes in normal appearing skin from tanning bed users had higher mutation burdens, a higher proportion of melanocytes with pathogenic mutations, and distinct mutational signatures. These differences were most prominent over body sites that experience comparatively less exposure to natural sunlight. Conclusions: We conclude that tanning bed radiation induces melanoma by increasing the mutation burden of melanocytes and by mutagenizing a broader field of melanocytes than are typically exposed to natural sunlight. The unique signatures of mutations in skin cells of tanning users may be attributable to the distinct spectra of radiation emitted from solariums.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

Following uptake, Sec released from SELENOP undergoes metabolisation via selenocysteine lyase (SCLY), producing selenide, a substrate used by selenophosphate synthetase 2 (SEPHS2), which provides the essential selenium donor - selenophosphate - for the biosynthesis of the selenocysteine tRNA. Here, we report the discovery of an alternative pathway mediating Sec metabolisation that is independent of SCLY and mediated by peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6). Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PRDX6 can readily react with selenide and interact with SEPHS2, potentially acting as a selenium delivery system. Moreover, we demonstrate the presence and functional significance of this alternative route in cancer cells where we reveal a notable association between elevated expression of PRDX6 with a highly aggressive neuroblastoma subtype.

This study examines how race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status influence Lp(a) ordering.

MethodsThis is a single center, retrospective study (2/1/2020-6/30/2023) using electronic medical records of adults with at least one ICD-10 diagnosis of ASCVD or resistant hyperlipidemia (LDL-C >160 mg/dL on statin therapy). We evaluated Lp(a) level differences among racial/ethnic groups and sexes. We also assessed associations between diagnosis type, diagnosis number, age at diagnosis, race, socioeconomic score (based on zip codes), public health coverage and presence of Lp(a) orders.

Results4% of our cohort (N=56,833) had an Lp(a) order (17.3% Hispanic, 8.7% non-Hispanic Black, 47.5% non-Hispanic White and, 27% Asian/others). Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients had lower rates of Lp(a) orders (0.17%, 0.28%, respectively) when compared to non-Hispanic White patients (2.35%), p<0.001, however, their median Lp(a) levels were higher. Individuals belonging to deprived socioeconomic groups or on Medicaid, were less likely to have an Lp(a) order (RR=0.39, p<0.001 and RR=0.40, p<0.001 respectively). Certain diagnoses (carotid stenosis, family history of ASCVD and FH) and multiple diagnoses (>2) resulted in more Lp(a) orders compared to those with only one diagnosis (p<0.001).

ConclusionsLp(a) ordering is low in patients with ASCVD. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients at risk are less likely to have an Lp(a) order.

Using transcriptomics analysis, we show that during their two-day period of growth deceleration, wing imaginal discs of Drosophila undergo a progressive metabolic shift away from oxidative phosphorylation and towards glycolysis. We then develop an ultra-sensitive reporter HIF-1 activity, which reveals that imaginal discs become increasingly hypoxic during development in normoxic conditions, suggesting that limiting oxygen supply could underlie growth deceleration. Growth is energetically expensive and thus expected to contribute, indirectly, to oxygen consumption. Indeed, excess TOR signalling, a key stimulator of growth, triggers hypoxia locally and systemically, highlighting the need to rein in growth when oxygen becomes limiting. This is achieved by a negative feedback loop whereby the classic TOR-inhibitory function of HIF-1 is deployed in response to developmental hypoxia. The absence of Sima/HIF-1 leads to cellular stress, which is alleviated by reduced TOR signalling. Conversely, a small increase in oxygen supply reduces the stress induced by excess TOR activity. We conclude that mild hypoxia is a normal feature of organ development and that Sima/HIF-1 prevents growth-induced oxygen demand from exceeding supply.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

Single-cell transcriptomic analyses have revealed a high level of inter- and intra-organ heterogeneity of fibroblasts. However, the functional implications and lineage relations of different fibroblast subtypes remain unexplored, especially in the mammary gland. Here we provide a comprehensive characterization of pubertal mammary fibroblasts, achieved using single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial mapping, and in vivo lineage tracing. Notably, we discovered a transient niche-forming population of specialized contractile fibroblasts that exclusively localize around the tips of the growing mammary epithelium and are recruited from the surrounding fat pad. Using functional organoid-fibroblast co-cultures we reveal that different fibroblast populations can acquire contractile features when in direct contact with the epithelium, promoting morphogenesis. In summary, our exhaustive characterization of these specialized cells provides new insights into mammary fibroblast heterogeneity and implicates their functional relevance for branching morphogenesis and lineage hierarchy during mouse mammary gland development.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

This knowledge allows us to form expectations about future sensory events. Several influential predictive coding models posit that, when a stimulus matches our expectations, the activity of feature-selective neurons in visual cortex will be suppressed relative to when that stimulus is unexpected. However, after accounting for known critical confounds, there is currently scant evidence for these hypothesised effects from studies recording electrophysiological neural activity. To provide a strong test for expectation effects on stimulus-evoked responses in visual cortex, we performed a probabilistic cueing experiment while recording electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Participants (n=48) learned associations between visual cues and subsequently presented gratings. A given cue predicted the appearance of a certain grating orientation with 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 90% validity. We did not observe any stimulus expectancy effects on grating-evoked event-related potentials. Bayes factors generally favoured the null hypothesis throughout the time-courses of the grating-evoked responses. Multivariate classifiers trained to discriminate between grating orientations also did not substantively differ in their performance across stimulus expectancy conditions. Our null findings provide further evidence against modulations of prediction error signalling by probabilistic expectations as specified in contemporary predictive coding models.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

This study uses influenza mortality reduction (IMR) during the pandemic as an indicator of the aggregate efficacy of NPIs to assess their impact on COVID mortality.

Age-adjusted COVID mortality for US states were modeled as a function of four variables: mortality prior to the introduction of NPIs, vaccination rates, IMR relative to historical averages, and population density.

A simple linear model with only these variables explained 69% of the state-to-state variability in age adjusted COVID mortality. The resulting model suggests that NPIs alone prevented 840,000 COVID related deaths in the United States over the course of the pandemic.

Methods: We developed a novel metapopulation model for simulating respiratory virus transmission in the North America region, specifically for the 96 states, provinces, and territories of Canada, Mexico and the United States. The model is informed by COVID-19 case data, which are assimilated using the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF), a Bayesian inference algorithm, and commuting and mobility data, which are used to build and adjust the network and movement across locations on a daily basis. Findings: This model-inference system provides estimates of transmission dynamics, infection rates, and ascertainment rates for each of the 96 locations from January 2020 to March 2021. The results highlight differences in disease dynamics and ascertainment among the three countries. Interpretation: The metapopulation structure enables rapid simulation at large scale, and the data assimilation method makes the system responsive to changes in system dynamics. This model can serve as a versatile platform for modeling other infectious diseases across the North American region.","NA","medrxiv",1717797965446

Nucleotides in the input DNA sequence with high saliency in gene expression pattern prediction overlapped with regions identified via comparative genomic or chromatin-based approaches as potential regulatory sequences. High saliency regions identified in a second species, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), without species-specific training were also associated with potential regulatory sequences in noncoding regions upstream and downstream of each gene of interest. The potential impact of a scaleable and transferable approach to identifying regulatory sequences using saliency calculated from large context window models spans multiple applications.

These condensates emerge from the programmed interactions of nanostructured motifs assembling from three DNA strands and one RNA strand that can include an aptamer domain for the recruitment of a target protein. Because condensates are designed to form regardless of the presence of target protein, they function as 'host' compartments. As a model protein we consider streptavidin (SA) due to its widespread use in binding assays, thus the host condensates presented here could find immediate use for the physical separation of a variety of biotin-tagged components. In addition to demonstrating protein recruitment, we describe two approaches to control the onset of condensation and protein recruitment. The first approach uses UV irradiation, a physical stimulus that bypasses the need for exchanging molecular inputs and is particularly convenient to control condensation in emulsion droplets. The second approach uses RNA transcription, a ubiquitous biochemical reaction that is central to the development of the next generation of living materials. We finally show that the combination of RNA transcription and degradation leads to an autonomous dissipative system in which host condensates and protein recruitment occur transiently, and that the host condensate size as well as the timescale of the transient can be controlled by the level of RNA degrading enzyme.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

Among various spatial omics methods, genome-scale imaging allows transcriptomic, 3D-genomic, and epigenomic profiling of individual cells with high spatial (subcellular) resolution but often requires a preselection of targeted genes or genomic loci. On the other hand, spatially dependent barcoding of molecules followed by sequencing provides untargeted, genome-wide profiling but typically lacks single-cell resolution. Here, we report a spatial omics method that could potentially combine the power of the two approaches by optically controlled spatial barcoding followed by sequencing. Specifically, we utilize patterned light to encode the locations of cells in tissues using oligonucleotide-based barcodes and then identify the barcoded molecular content, such as mRNAs, by sequencing. This optical barcoding method is designed with multiplexing and error-correction capacity and achieved by a light-directed ligation chemistry that attaches distinct nucleic-acid sequences to the reverse transcribed cDNA products at different locations. As a proof of principle for this method, we demonstrated high-efficiency in situ light-directed ligation, spatially dependent barcoding with multiplexed light-controlled ligations, and high-accuracy detection of spatially barcoded mRNAs in cells.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

The layers and areas are distinguished both molecularly, by diverse neuronal and glial cell subtypes, and structurally, through intricate spatial organization. While single-cell transcriptomics studies have advanced molecular characterization of human cortical development, a critical gap exists due to the loss of spatial context during cell dissociation. Here, we utilized multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), augmented with deep-learning-based cell segmentation, to examine the molecular, cellular, and cytoarchitectural development of human fetal cortex with spatially resolved single-cell resolution. Our extensive spatial atlas, encompassing 16 million single cells, spans eight cortical areas across four time points in the second and third trimesters. We uncovered an early establishment of the six-layer structure, identifiable in the laminar distribution of excitatory neuronal subtypes by mid-gestation, long before the emergence of cytoarchitectural layers. Notably, while anterior-posterior gradients of neuronal subtypes were generally observed in most cortical areas, a striking exception was the sharp molecular border between primary (V1) and secondary visual cortices (V2) at gestational week 20. Here we discovered an abrupt binary shift in neuronal subtype specification at the earliest stages, challenging the notion that continuous morphogen gradients dictate mid-gestation cortical arealization. Moreover, integrating single-nuclei RNA-sequencing and in situ whole transcriptomics revealed an early upregulation of synaptogenesis in V1-specific Layer 4 neurons, suggesting a role of synaptogenesis in this discrete border formation. Collectively, our findings underscore the crucial role of spatial relationships in determining the molecular specification of cortical layers and areas. This work not only provides a valuable resource for the field, but also establishes a spatially resolved single-cell analysis paradigm that paves the way for a comprehensive developmental atlas of the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

Polymer structure and modifications, however, depend on the ensemble of synthase modules and accessory subunits, thus defining several types of bacterial cellulose secretion (Bcs) systems. In E. coli, a BcsRQABEFG macrocomplex, encompassing the inner membrane and cytosolic subunits, and an outer membrane porin, BcsC, secure the biogenesis of phosphoethanolamine (pEtN)-modified cellulose. Resolution-limited studies have proposed different macrocomplex stoichiometries and its assembly and regulation have remained elusive. Using cryo-EM, we visualize the molecular mechanisms of BcsA-dependent recruitment and stabilization of a trimeric BcsG pEtN-transferase for polymer modification and a dimeric BcsF-dependent recruitment of an otherwise cytosolic BcsE2R2Q2 regulatory complex. We further demonstrate that BcsE, a secondary c-di-GMP sensor, remains dinucleotide-bound and retains the essential-for-secretion BcsRQ partners onto the synthase even in the absence of direct c-di-GMP-synthase complexation, likely lowering the threshold for c-di-GMP-dependent synthase activation. Such activation-by-proxy mechanism could allow Bcs secretion system activation even in the absence of dramatic intracellular c-di-GMP increase and is reminiscent of other widespread synthase-dependent polysaccharide secretion systems where c-di-GMP sensing and/or synthase stabilization are carried out by key co-polymerase subunits.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

We present the first comprehensive genome-wide continental study including 257 cultivated isolates representing most of the geographical distribution of this major human pathogen. The L. braziliensis species complex is genetically highly heterogeneous, consisting of divergent parasite groups that are associated with different environments and vary greatly in diversity. Apart from several small ecologically isolated groups with little diversity, our sampling identifies two major parasite groups, one associated with the Amazon and the other with the Atlantic Forest biomes. These groups show different recombination histories, as suggested by high levels of heterozygosity and effective population sizes in the Amazonian group in contrast to high levels of linkage and clonality in the Atlantic group.

Many Gram-negative bacteria that encode PQQ-dependent enzymes do not possess the biosynthetic machinery for its production and instead obtain it from the environment. To achieve this the bacterium Escherichia coli uses the TonB-dependent transporter PqqU as a high-affinity PQQ importer, allowing it to use PQQ at an external concentration as low as 1 nM. Here, we show that PqqU achieves this by binding PQQ with a very high affinity. Using cryo-electron microscopy we determine the structure of the PqqU-PQQ complex at a resolution of 1.99 angstrom, revealing that the extracellular loops of PqqU undergo significant conformational changes upon PQQ binding, which captures the cofactor in an internal cavity. This cavity likely facilitates an airlock-style gating mechanism that prevents non-specific import through PqqU. Using structural modelling we show that the change in PqqU structure upon PQQ binding precludes the binding of bacteriophage, which targets it as a cell surface receptor. Guided by the PqqU-PQQ complex structure we use phenotypic analysis to identify the amino acids essential for PQQ import and leverage this information to map the presence of PqqU across Gram-negative bacteria. This reveals that PqqU is encoded by Gram-negative bacteria from at least 22 phyla from diverse habitats, including those found in aquatic, soil, host-associated, and extreme environments. This indicates that PQQ is a ubiquitous nutrient in many environments, and an important cofactor for bacteria that adopt diverse lifestyles and metabolic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

Leveraging these extensive data cohorts, we developed CellFM, a robust single-cell foundation model with an impressive 800 million parameters, marking an eight-fold increase over the current largest single-species model. To ensure the training of CellFM on the MindSpore AI framework from Huawei, we have integrated RetNet, a Transformer architecture variant with linear complexity for a balance between efficiency and performance, serving as the backbone of our model. Our comprehensive experiments have shown that CellFM outperforms existing models across diverse applications, such as cell annotation, perturbation prediction, and gene function prediction.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

We investigated the alkaloid biosynthesis in Flueggea suffruticosa, a plant that produces diverse piperidine alkaloids, including securinine. Until now, pathways leading to the formation of {triangleup}1-piperideine have involved two enzymatic steps: a decarboxylase and an oxidase, proceeding via free cadaverine. We discovered {triangleup}1-piperideine synthase (PS), a PLP-dependent enzyme that forms {triangleup}1-piperideine directly from lysine via an oxidative deamination. We demonstrate that PS catalyses this transformation in a non-symmetric manner, and show it is positioned within the group III decarboxylase family, which is typically associated with prokaryotes. We also identified a paralog gene exhibiting decarboxylase activity. This work delineates the first enzymatic step in the biosynthesis of securinine as an unprecedented oxidative deamination of lysine. It also marks the identification of the first eukaryotic group III decarboxylase and resolves the longstanding question of non-symmetric nitrogen incorporation in piperidine alkaloids.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

Here we show that cells lacking GPX4 still exhibit substantial PLOOH reduction capacity, arguing for the presence of alternative PLOOH peroxidases. By scrutinizing potential candidates, we showed that while overexpression of peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), a thiol-specific antioxidant enzyme with reported PLOOH-reducing activity, failed to prevent ferroptosis, its genetic loss markedly sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis. Mechanistically, we uncover that PRDX6 facilitates intracellular selenium handling, which is crucial for selenium incorporation into selenoproteins, including GPX4. Consequently, PRDX6 modulates GPX4 expression, thereby dictating the sensitivity of cells to undergo ferroptosis. Our study highlights PRDX6 as a critical factor in ferroptosis prevention by directing cellular selenium mobilization.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

CdsRNA triggers a type-I interferon (IFN-I)-based innate immune response in human neural cells, resulting in their death 4. Here, we report that cdsRNA is also spatially coincident with pTDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions in brain cells of patients with AD pathology and that type-I interferon response genes are significantly upregulated in brain regions affected by AD. We updated our machine-learning pipeline DRIAD-SP (Drug Repurposing In Alzheimer Disease with Systems Pharmacology) to incorporate cryptic exon (CE) detection as a proxy of pTDP-43 inclusions and demonstrated that the FDA-approved JAK inhibitors baricitinib and ruxolitinib that block interferon signaling show a protective signal only in cortical brain regions expressing multiple CEs. Furthermore, the JAK family member TYK2 was a top hit in a CRISPR screen of cdsRNA-mediated death in differentiated human neural cells. The selective TYK2 inhibitor deucravacitinib, an FDA-approved drug for psoriasis, rescued toxicity elicited by cdsRNA. Finally, we identified CCL2, CXCL10, and IL-6 as candidate predictive biomarkers for cdsRNA-related neurodegenerative diseases.

S. paradoxus, has not adapted to these chemicals despite being consistently present in sympatry with S. cerevisiae in vineyards. This contrast represents a case of apparent evolutionary constraints favoring greater adaptive capacity in S. cerevisiae. In this study, we used a comparative mutagenesis approach to test whether S. paradoxus is mutationally constrained with respect to acquiring greater copper and sulfite resistance. For both species, we assayed the rate, effect size, and pleiotropic costs of resistance mutations and sequenced a subset of 150 mutants isolated from our screen. We found that the distributions of mutational effects displayed by the two species were very similar and poorly explained the natural pattern. We also found that chromosome VIII aneuploidy and loss of function mutations in PMA1 confer copper resistance in both species, whereas loss of function mutations in REG1 were only a viable route to copper resistance in S. cerevisiae. We also observed a single de novo duplication of the CUP1 gene in S. paradoxus but none in S. cerevisiae. For sulfite, loss of function mutations in RTS1 and KSP1 confer resistance in both species, but mutations in RTS1 have larger average effects in S. paradoxus. Our results show that even when the distributions of mutational effects are largely similar, species can differ in the adaptive paths available to them. They also demonstrate that assays of the distribution of mutational effects may lack predictive insight concerning adaptive outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

Here, we propose that these phenomena can be explained by the existence of a fast, reversible glucotoxicity process, which may exist in all people but be more pronounced in those susceptible to KPD. We develop a simple mathematical model of the pathogenesis of KPD, which incorporates this assumption, and show that it reproduces the phenomenology of KPD, including variations in the ability for patients to achieve and sustain remission. These results suggest that a variation of our model may be able to quantitatively describe variations in the course of remission among individuals with KPD.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

Here, we introduce the Visium HD platform (10x Genomics) and use it to investigate human CRC and normal adjacent mucosal tissues from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. The first assay available on Visium HD is a probe-based spatial transcriptomics workflow that was developed to enable whole transcriptome single cell scale analysis. We demonstrate highly refined unsupervised spatial clustering in Visium HD data that aligns with the hallmarks of colon tissue morphology and is notably improved over earlier Visium assays. Using serial sections from the same FFPE blocks we generate a single cell atlas of our samples, then we integrate the data to comprehensively characterize the immune cell types present in the TME, specifically at the tumor periphery. We observed enrichment of two pro-tumor macrophage subpopulations with differential gene expression profiles that were localized within distinct tumor regions. Further characterization of the T cells present in one of the samples revealed a clonal expansion that we were able to localize in the tissue using in situ gene expression analysis. In situ analysis also allowed us to perform in-depth characterization of the microenvironment of the clonally expanded T cell population and we identified a third macrophage subpopulation with gene expression profiles consistent with an anti-tumor response. Our study provides a comprehensive map of the cellular composition of the CRC TME and identifies phenotypically and spatially distinct immune cell populations within it. We show that the single cell-scale resolution afforded by Visium HD and the whole transcriptome nature of the assay allows investigations into cellular function and interaction at the tumor periphery in FFPE tissues, which has not been previously possible.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

They contain large intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), and form biomolecular condensates that are important for transcription regulation. However, little is known about how different IDRs work together to contribute to the behaviour of CBP condensates, knowledge which is essential to fully understand their biological function. Here, we show that endogenous CBP forms fluid-like condensates in the nucleus, and that properties of CBP condensates depend on IDRs dispersed throughout its sequence. Adjacent IDRs in the C-terminus form a regulatory module that balances positive and negative contributions, to ensure that CBP condensates are responsive to other IDRs and to post translational lysine acetylation. These distinct behaviours also change the characteristics of endogenous CBP condensates, including changing patterns of chromatin localisation and altering behaviours in live cell imaging. Cooperation between different IDRs therefore ensures that CBP condensates are poised to respond to their environment, allowing CBP to effectively integrate signalling events and control diverse transcriptional outputs.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

Extensive EGL proliferation characterises the foliated structure of amniote cerebella, but the factors that regulate EGL formation, amplification within it, and differentiation from it, are incompletely understood. Here, we characterise bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling during cerebellar development in chick and human and show that while in chick BMP signalling correlates with external granule layer formation, in humans BMP signalling is maintained throughout the external granule layer after the onset of foliation. We also show via Immunohistochemical labelling of phosphorylated Smad1/5/9 the comparative spatiotemporal activity of BMP signalling in chick and human. Using in-ovo electroporation in chick, we demonstrate that BMP signalling is necessary for subpial migration of granule cell precursors and hence the formation of the external granule layer (EGL) prior to transit amplification. However, altering BMP signalling does not block the formation of mature granule neurons but significantly disrupts that pattern of morphological transitions that accompany transit amplification. Our results elucidate two key, temporally distinct roles for BMP signalling in vivo in organising first the assembly of the EGL from the rhombic lip and subsequently the tempo of granule neuron production within the EGL.

Significance statementImproper development of cerebellar granule neurons can manifest in a plethora of neurodevelopmental disorders, including but not limited to medulloblastoma and autism. Many studies have sought to understand the role of developmental signalling pathways in granule cell neurogenesis, using genetic manipulation in transgenic mice. To complement these insights, we have used comparative assessment of BMP signalling during development in chick and human embryos and in vivo manipulation of the chick to understand and segregate the spatiotemporal roles of BMP signalling, yielding important insights on evolution and in consideration of future therapeutic avenues that target BMP signalling.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

We examined if such dynamics involves changes in chromatin organization by profiling the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility of SPGs from early postnatal stages to adulthood in mice using deep RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and computational deconvolution analyses. By integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic features, we show that SPGs undergo massive chromatin remodeling during postnatal development that partially correlates with distinct gene expression profiles and transcription factors (TF) motif enrichment. We identify genomic regions with significantly different chromatin accessibility in adult SPGs that are marked by histone modifications associated with enhancers and promoters. Some of the regions with increased accessibility correspond to transposable element subtypes enriched in multiple TFs motifs and close to differentially expressed genes. Our results underscore the dynamics of chromatin organization in developing germ cells and complement existing datasets on SPGs by providing maps of the regulatory genome at high resolution from the same cell populations at early postnatal, late postnatal and adult stages collected from single individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

However, these studies suffered from the impossibility of ruling out a fast experience-driven origin of the effect resulting from infants speed of learning, their sensitivity to environmental regularities, and the large number of sound-symbolic associations to which they are precociously exposed when interacting with adults. To better describe its ontogeny and fill in this gap, we tested the Bouba-Kiki effect in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus).

Our silicatein-expressing bacteria can self-assemble a shell of polysilicate ""bioglass"" around themselves. Remarkably, the polysilicate-encapsulated bacteria can focus light into intense nanojets that are nearly an order of magnitude brighter than unmodified bacteria.

The modified bacteria can polymerize a layer of bioglass at their surface. This bioglass shell allows the bacteria to act as engineered optical devices that are able to scatter high intensity, focused light while also surviving for several months, opening the door to a wide range of sense-and-respond applications.

Direct targeting of MYC itself remains an unmet clinical need, therefore focusing on vulnerabilities driven by MYC may be a viable option for novel therapeutic interventions. Using whole-genome CRISPR screening, we identified the de novo pyrimidine synthesis enzyme CTP synthase (CTPS1) as a strong dependency in MYC-driven MB. CTPS1 is the final and rate-limiting step in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. Targeted inhibition of CTPS1 leads to decreased tumor cell proliferation and markedly reduces MYC expression in G3 MB models. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that single agent CTPS1 inhibition activates the replication stress signaling pathway mediated by ATM-CHK2 and ATR-CHK1. Blockade of CHK1 kinase activity increases sensitivity to CTPS1 inhibition and significantly impedes heterotopic MB tumor growth. CTPS1 enzymatic activity requires the amino acid glutamine, therefore we inhibited CTPS1 using the glutamine antagonists, JHU083 and JHU395. These compounds are prodrugs of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) which were developed to exhibit exquisite blood-brain barrier penetrability. Combining JHU083 and CHK1 inhibition demonstrates potent synergy against patient-derived MB xenografts in vivo. Our findings strongly suggest that combining de novo pyrimidine synthesis and ATR-CHK1 inhibitors is a promising treatment for MYC-driven MBs.

Importance of the StudyMYC hyperactivation in tumors drives multiple anabolic processes which contribute to tumor proliferation and aggressiveness in patients. We show that targeting de novo pyrimidine synthesis (via CTPS1) limits tumor growth and targets MYC itself through a feedback mechanism. CTPS1 inhibition potently combines with CHK1 blockade and enhances disease control in both heterotopic and orthotopic models of medulloblastoma (MB). Our results support the clinical evaluation of combined CTPS1 and CHK1 inhibition in patients with MYC-driven MB.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

Understanding more about the gene expression patterns that underlie developmental programs can inform engineering efforts for new or optimized forms. Here, we present a four-state integrase-based recorder of gene expression history and demonstrate its use in tracking gene expression events in Arabidopsis thaliana in two developmental contexts: lateral root initiation and stomatal differentiation. The recorder uses two serine integrases to mediate sequential DNA recombination events, resulting in step-wise, history-dependent switching between expression of fluorescent reporters. By using promoters that express at different times along each of the two differentiation pathways to drive integrase expression, we successfully tied fluorescent status to an ordered progression of gene expression along the developmental trajectory. In one snapshot of a mature tissue, our recorder was able to reveal past gene expression with single cell resolution. In this way, we were able to capture heterogeneity in stomatal development, confirming the existence of two alternate paths of differentiation.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

BA.2.86 and its descendants, including JN.1 (referred to collectively as ""JN lineages""), emerged in late 2023 and exhibited substantial genomic divergence from co-circulating XBB lineages. Methods: We analyzed patients hospitalized with COVID-19-like illness at 26 hospitals in 20 U.S. states admitted October 18, 2023-March 9, 2024. Using a test-negative, case-control design, we estimated the effectiveness of an updated 2023-2024 (Monovalent XBB.1.5) COVID-19 vaccine dose against sequence-confirmed XBB and JN lineage hospitalization using logistic regression. Odds of severe outcomes, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death, were compared for JN versus XBB lineage hospitalizations using logistic regression. Results: 585 case-patients with XBB lineages, 397 case-patients with JN lineages, and 4,580 control-patients were included. VE in the first 7-89 days after receipt of an updated dose was 54.2% (95% CI = 36.1%-67.1%) against XBB lineage hospitalization and 32.7% (95% CI = 1.9%-53.8%) against JN lineage hospitalization. Odds of ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.80; 95% CI = 0.46-1.38) and IMV or death (aOR 0.69; 95% CI = 0.34-1.40) were not significantly different among JN compared to XBB lineage hospitalizations. Conclusions: Updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccination provided protection against both XBB and JN lineage hospitalization, but protection against the latter may be attenuated by immune escape. Clinical severity of JN lineage hospitalizations was not higher relative to XBB lineage hospitalizations.","NA","medrxiv",1717797965446

Theory suggests that competition for space and resources should maintain the number of coexisting species far below the staggering diversity commonly found in nature. A recent model finds that, when sublinear growth rates of species are coupled with competition, species diversity can stabilize community dynamics. This, in turn, is suggested to explain the coexistence of many species in natural ecosystems. In this brief note we clarify why the sublinear growth (SG) model does not solve the long standing paradox of species coexistence. This is because in the SG model coexistence emerges from an unrealistic property, in which species per-capita growth rate diverges at low abundance, preventing species from ever going extinct. When infinite growth at low abundance is reconciled with more realistic assumptions, the SG model recovers the expected paradox: increasing diversity leads to competitive exclusion and species extinctions.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

When present in healthy tissues in low numbers, we show that cells expressing cancer-causing mutations (KrasG12D, p53R172H) compete with normal cells for survival and are often eliminated. Thus, tumour initiation must require mechanisms whereby mutant cells override tissue defence mechanisms to remain in a tissue; however, the biology of these initial events is poorly understood. Here, we use an in vivo model of sporadic tumorigenesis in the adult pancreas to show that a population of KrasG12D- or p53R172H-expressing cells are never eliminated from the epithelium. Using RNA sequencing of non-eliminated populations and quantitative fluorescence imaging, we show that {beta}-catenin-independent Wnt5a signalling, and cell dormancy are key features of surviving KrasG12D cells in vivo. We demonstrate that Wnt5a (and not Wnt3a) inhibits apical extrusion of RasV12 cells in vitro by promoting stable E-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesions at RasV12-normal cell-cell boundaries. Inhibition of Wnt5a signalling restores E-cadherin dynamics at normal-mutant boundaries and apical extrusion in vitro. RasV12 cells arrested in the cell cycle are not extruded and this is rescued when Wnt signalling is inhibited. In the pancreas, Wnt signalling, E-cadherin and {beta}-catenin are increased at cell-cell contacts between non-eliminated KrasG12D cells and normal neighbours. Importantly, we demonstrate that active Wnt signalling is a general mechanism required to promote KrasG12D and p53R172H cell survival in vivo. Treatment with porcupine inhibitor rescues pancreas tissue defence by switching mutant cell retention to cell expulsion. Our results suggest that RAS mutant cells activate Wnt and a dormant cell state to avoid cell expulsion and to survive in the adult pancreas.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

Despite these advanced capabilities and broad potential, the current study presents critical findings that question these models adherence to fundamental physical principles and its susceptibility to overfitting specific protein families.

These discrepancies reveal a significant divergence from expected physical behaviors, indicating potential overfitting to particular data subsets within its training corpus. Our findings underscore the models limitations in generalizing effectively across diverse biological structures and highlight the necessity of integrating robust physical and chemical priors in the development of such predictive tools.

By adopting inducible bacterial and plant degrons we also highlight how orthogonality and uncoupling of synthetic construct degradation from the native machinery can be achieved. We show the effect of this competition to be dependent on the context of the degrons where C-terminal degradation appears to impact competition the most across our tested settings. We then build a genomically integrated capacity monitor tagged with different degrons and confirm resource competition between genomic and transiently expressed DNA constructs.

We use live observation of wound closure in larval zebrafish after inflicting a stab wound to the brain. We demonstrate that the wound closes in the first 24 hours after injury by global tissue contraction. Microglia accumulation at the point of tissue convergence precedes wound closure and computational modelling of this process indicates that physical traction by microglia could lead to wound closure. Indeed, genetically or pharmacologically depleting microglia leads to defective tissue repair. Live observations indicate centripetal deformation of astrocytic processes contacted by migrating microglia. Severing such contacts leads to retraction of cellular processes, indicating tension. Weakening tension by disrupting the F-Actin stabilising gene lcp1 in microglial cells, leads to failure of wound closure. Therefore, we propose a previously unidentified mechanism of brain repair in which microglia has an essential role in contracting spared tissue.

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

We build on previous research characterizing changes in physiology and morphology to explore behavioral variation across the invasive range of coqui in Hawaii. We hypothesized that behavioral traits contributing to invasion expansion would be reflected in behavioral differences at the invasive center versus invasive edge. To investigate whether differences in the field represent local adaptation or behavioral plasticity, we additionally evaluated behavior following acclimation to a shared laboratory environment. While we identified only subtle behavioral variation among populations in the field, we found that individuals from all populations became less bold, active, and exploratory in the laboratory, converging on a similar behavioral phenotype. Alongside previous work, our results suggest that coqui adjust their behavior to local environmental conditions across their invasive range, and that behavioral flexibility may contribute to invasive success.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold).

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded. We report the value of wastewater sequencing to track avian influenza.","NA","medrxiv",1717797965446

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1717797965446

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

Here, we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), a genome editing system that combines the programmability and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 with the RNA-mediated gene insertion capabilities of the human LINE1 (L1) element. CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

DesignNationwide cohort studies, using target trial emulation.

SettingDenmark, Finland, and Sweden, from 1 October 2023 to 29 February 2024.

ParticipantsIndividuals aged [&ge;]65 years who had previously received at least four covid-19 vaccine doses. Main outcome measures: Cumulative incidences of covid-19 hospital admission and death for 12 weeks after immunisation (defined as 1 week after vaccination) among recipients of an XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences.

ResultsDuring autumn and winter 2023-2024, a total of 1,867,448 1:1 matched pairs of XBB-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and non-recipients were included (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years). The comparative vaccine effectiveness was 60.6% (95% confidence interval, 46.1% to 75.1%) against covid-19 hospital admission (930 v 2,551 events) and 77.9% (69.2% to 86.7%) against covid-19 related death (301 v 1,326 events) at 12 weeks of follow-up. This corresponded to 191.1 (95% confidence interval, 50.2 to 332.1) covid-19 hospital admissions and 109.2 (100.2 to 118.1) deaths prevented per 100,000 individuals vaccinated with an XBB.1.5-containing vaccine. The comparative vaccine effectiveness was similar across sex, age (65-74/[&ge;]75 years), number of previous covid-19 vaccine doses received, and seasonal influenza vaccination co-administration subgroups and periods of either omicron XBB- or BA.2.86-sublineage dominance. While the protection was highest during the first weeks after vaccination, it was well-preserved at end of week 12 of follow-up.

ConclusionAmong adults aged [&ge;]65 years, vaccination with a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine reduced the rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death during autumn and winter 2023-2024 across three Nordic countries.","NA","medrxiv",1717797965446

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1717797965446

Recently, H5 viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b have caused large outbreaks in avian and multiple non-human mammalian species1,2. Previous studies have identified molecular phenotypes of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein that contribute to pandemic potential in humans, including cell entry, receptor preference, HA stability, and reduced neutralization by polyclonal sera3-6. However, prior experimental work has only measured how these phenotypes are affected by a handful of the >10,000 different possible amino-acid mutations to HA. Here we use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning7 to measure how all mutations to a 2.3.4.4b H5 HA affect each phenotype. We identify mutations that allow HA to better bind 2-6-linked sialic acids, and show that some viruses already carry mutations that stabilize HA. We also measure how all HA mutations affect neutralization by sera from mice and ferrets vaccinated against or infected with 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses. These antigenic maps enable rapid assessment of when new viral strains have acquired mutations that may create mismatches with candidate vaccine strains. Overall, the systematic nature of deep mutational scanning combined with the safety of pseudoviruses enables comprehensive measurements of the phenotypic effects of mutations that can inform real-time interpretation of viral variation observed during surveillance of H5 influenza.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446

It forms a right-handed helical barrel consisting of 22 pairs of Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 subunits, with a diameter of 32 nm its wider end and 19 nm at its narrower end. Oligomerization is stabilized by the C-terminus, which forms two helical layers linked by a {beta}-strand, and coiled-coil domains that enable strong charge-charge inter-subunit interactions. Flotillin interacts with membranes at both ends; through its SPFH1 domains at the wide end and the C-terminus at the narrow end, facilitated by hydrophobic interactions and lipidation. The inward tilting of the SPFH domain, likely triggered by phosphorylation, suggests its role in membrane curvature induction, which could be connected to its proposed role in clathrin-independent endocytosis. The structure suggests a shared architecture across the family of SPFH proteins and will promote further research into Flotillins roles in cell biology.

Significance statementIt is well known that many biochemical processes in cells must occur in localized regions. There are many different ideas about how cells keep processes localized. In this study we demonstrate that Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 co-assemble to form a large, truncated cone shaped cage whose wide end is always attached to a membrane surface and whose narrow end is sometimes attached to a separate membrane. The entire wall of the cage is without holes and is likely impervious even to small molecules, forming a diffusion barrier that can connect membrane systems. The Flotillin cage is thus well suited to isolate biochemical processes. Through membrane attachment, it also alters local membrane curvature, which could influence endocytic and mechanosensory processes.","NA","biorxiv",1717797965446
