We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1717452539878

It has been hypothesized that autoantibodies play a crucial role in the development of Long COVID and other syndromes, such as fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). In this study, we tested this hypothesis by passively transferring total IgG from Long COVID patients to mice. Using Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and type-I interferon expression, we stratified patients into three Long COVID subgroups, each with unique plasma proteome signatures. Remarkably, IgG transfer from the two subgroups, which are characterized by higher plasma levels of neuronal proteins and leukocyte activation markers, induced pronounced and persistent sensory hypersensitivity with distinct kinetics. Conversely, IgG transfer from the third subgroup, which are characterized by enriched skeletal and cardiac muscle proteome profiles, reduced locomotor activity in mice without affecting their motor coordination. These findings demonstrate that transfer of IgG from Long COVID patients to mice replicates disease symptoms, underscoring IgG's causative role in Long COVID pathogenesis. This work proposes a murine model that mirrors Long COVID's pathophysiological mechanisms, which may be used as a tool for screening and developing targeted therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539878

Concerningly, high titres of virus were detected in cows milk, raising the concern that milk could be a route of human infection. Cows milk is typically pasteurised to render it safe for human consumption, but the effectiveness of pasteurisation on influenza viruses in milk was uncertain. To assess this, we evaluated heat inactivation in milk for a panel of different influenza viruses. This included human and avian influenza A viruses (IAVs), an influenza D virus that naturally infects cattle, and recombinant IAVs carrying contemporary avian or bovine H5N1 glycoproteins. At pasteurisation temperatures, viral infectivity was rapidly lost and became undetectable before the times recommended for pasteurisation. We then showed that an H5N1 HPAIV in milk was effectively inactivated by a comparable treatment, even though its genetic material remained detectable. We conclude that industry standard pasteurisation conditions should effectively inactivate H5N1 HPAIV in cows milk, but that unpasteurised milk could carry infectious influenza viruses.","NA","medrxiv",1717452539878

In October 2023, following outbreaks in sea lions in Argentina, we recorded unprecedented mass mortality (~17,000 individuals) in southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) at Peninsula Valdes. Seal pups were disproportionately affected. Adult seals departed early, disrupting social and breeding structure. Frequent interactions with sea lions and scavenging by seagulls were observed. Deaths of terns concurred with seals but peaked weeks later. HPAI H5N1 was confirmed in seals and terns. Moreover, genomic characterization showed viruses from pinnipeds and terns in Argentina form a distinct clade with marine mammal viruses from Peru, Chile and Brazil. These mammal-clade viruses share an identical set of mammalian adaptation mutations which are notably also found in the terns. Our combined ecological and phylogenetic data support mammal-to-mammal transmission and occasional mammal-to-bird spillover. To our knowledge, this is the first multinational transmission of H5N1 viruses in mammals ever observed globally. The implication that H5N1 viruses are becoming more evolutionary flexible and adapting to mammals in new ways could have global consequences for wildlife, humans, and/or livestock.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539878

While the influence of life history traits on invasive success is well-established, the role of behavior in the invasive potential of animals is less studied. The common coqui frog, Eleutherodactylus coqui, is a highly successful invader in Hawaii. We build on previous research characterizing changes in physiology and morphology to explore behavioral variation across the invasive range of coqui in Hawaii. We hypothesized that behavioral traits contributing to invasion expansion would be reflected in behavioral differences at the invasive center versus invasive edge. To investigate whether differences in the field represent local adaptation or behavioral plasticity, we additionally evaluated behavior following acclimation to a shared laboratory environment. While we identified only subtle behavioral variation among populations in the field, we found that individuals from all populations became less bold, active, and exploratory in the laboratory, converging on a similar behavioral phenotype. Alongside previous work, our results suggest that coqui adjust their behavior to local environmental conditions across their invasive range, and that behavioral flexibility may contribute to invasive success.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539878

These fluorescent proteins (FPs) have enabled the real-time observation of protein localization and dynamics within live cells. Applications of FP vary from monitoring gene/protein expression patterns, visualizing protein-protein interactions, measuring protein stability, assessing protein mobility and creating biosensors. The utility of FPs also extends to biochemical approaches through immunoblotting and proteomic analyses, aided by anti-FP antibodies and nanobodies. FPs are notoriously robust proteins with a tightly folded domain that confers a strong stability and a relative resistance to degradation and denaturation. In this study, we report that various green and red FPs can be maintained in a native, fluorescent form during the entire process of protein sample extraction, incubation with sample buffer, loading and migration on SDS-PAGE with only minor adaptations of traditional protocols. This protocol results in the ability to detect and quantify in-gel fluorescence (IGF) of endogenously-expressed proteins tagged with FPs directly after migration, using standard fluorescence-imaging devices. This approach eliminates the need for antibodies and chemiluminescent reagents, as well as the time-consuming steps inherent to immunoblotting such as transfer onto a membrane and antibody incubations. Overall, IGF detection provides clearer data with less background interference, a sensitivity comparable or better to antibody-based detection, a better quantification and a broader dynamic range. After fluorescence imaging, gels can still be used for other applications such as total protein staining or immunoblotting if needed. It also expands possibilities by allowing the detection of FPs for which antibodies are not available. Our study explores the feasibility, limitations, and applications of IGF for detecting endogenously expressed proteins in cell extracts, providing insights into sample preparation, imaging conditions, and sensitivity optimizations, and potential applications such as co-immunoprecipitation experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539878

Here we present alphaDIA, a modular open-source search framework for data independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics. We developed a feature-free identification algorithm particularly suited for detecting patterns in data produced by sensitive time-of-flight instruments. It naturally adapts to novel, more eTicient scan modes that are not yet accessible to previous algorithms. Rigorous benchmarking demonstrates competitive identification and quantification performance. While supporting empirical spectral libraries, we propose a new search strategy named end-to-end transfer learning using fully predicted libraries. This entails continuously optimizing a deep neural network for predicting machine and experiment specific properties, enabling the generic DIA analysis of any post-translational modification (PTM). AlphaDIA provides a high performance and accessible framework running locally or in the cloud, opening DIA analysis to the community.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539878

However, current automated approaches are limited in accuracy and generalizability, and expert annotation is not scalable to hundreds of thousands of significant findings. Here, we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can accurately identify genes likely to be causal at loci from GWAS. By evaluating the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on datasets of GWAS loci with high-confidence causal gene annotations, we show that these models outperform state-of-the-art methods in identifying putative causal genes.

Diverse microorganisms have nevertheless been detected within caves, though it remains unclear what strategies enable them to meet their energy and carbon needs. Here we determined the processes and mediators of primary production in aerated limestone and basalt caves through paired metagenomic and biogeochemical profiling. Based on 1458 metagenome-assembled genomes, over half of microbial cells in caves encode enzymes to use atmospheric trace gases as energy and carbon sources. The most abundant microbes in these systems are chemosynthetic primary producers, notably the novel gammaproteobacterial methanotrophic order Ca. Methylocavales and two uncultivated actinobacterial genera predicted to grow on atmospheric hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. In situ and ex situ biogeochemical and isotopic measurements consistently confirmed that these gases are rapidly consumed at rates sufficient to meet community-wide energy needs and drive continual primary production. Conventional chemolithoautotrophs, which use trace lithic compounds such as ammonium and sulfide, are also enriched and active alongside these trace gas scavengers. These results indicate that caves are unique in both their microbial composition and the biogeochemical processes that sustain them. Based on these findings, we propose caves are the first known ecosystems where atmospheric trace gases primarily sustain growth rather than survival and define this process as  aerotrophy. Cave aerotrophy may be a hidden process supporting global biogeochemistry.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

In plants, due to the absence of cell migration, correct placement of newly produced cell walls during cell division is of eminent importance for generating functional tissues and organs. In particular, during radial growth of plant shoots and roots, concerted cell divisions in the cambium are essential to produce adjacent xylem and phloem tissues in a strictly bidirectional manner. While several intercellular signaling cascades have been identified to instruct tissue organization during radial growth, a role of mechanical forces in guiding cambium stem cell activity has been frequently proposed but, so far, not been functionally investigated on the cellular level. Here, we coupled anatomical analyses with a cell-based vertex model to analyze the role of mechanical stress in radial plant growth at the cell and tissue scale. Simulations based on segmented cellular outlines of radially growing Arabidopsis hypocotyls revealed a distinct stress pattern with circumferential stresses in cambium stem cells which coincided with the orientation of cortical microtubules. Integrating stress patterns as a cue instructing cell division orientation was sufficient for the emergence of typical cambium-derived cell files and agreed with experimental results for stress-related tissue organization in confining mechanical environments. Our work thus underlines the significance of mechanical forces in tissue organization through self-emerging stress patterns during the growth of plant organs.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Here, we leverage the tools of natural language processing to probe the nature of arousal in a data-driven, comprehensive manner. We show that arousal comes in seven varieties: cognitive, emotional, physiological, sexual, related to stress disorders, to sleep, or to sleep disorders. Meta-analyses of the brain imaging literature further reveal that all varieties of arousal, except arousal in sleep disorders for lack of data, converge onto a domain-general cortical arousal network composed of the pre-supplementary motor area and the left and right dorsal anterior insula. More precisely, we found that dysgranular insular area 7, the region with highest convergence across varieties of arousal, also shows activation specific to arousal.

Despite this emerging paradigm, we lack tools to describe, quantify, predict, and interpret these types of structurally heterogeneous interactions from the underlying amino acid sequences. Here, we repurpose the chemical physics developed originally for molecular simulations to develop an approach for predicting intermolecular interactions between IDRs and partner proteins.

Understanding how the brain recognizes objects in natural scenes by integrating contextual information remains a key challenge. To elucidate neural mechanisms compatible with human visual processing, we need an animal model that behaves similarly to humans, so that inferred neural mechanisms can provide hypotheses relevant to the human brain. Here we assessed whether rhesus macaques could model human context-driven object recognition by quantifying visual object identification abilities across variations in the amount, quality, and congruency of contextual cues. Behavioral metrics revealed strikingly similar context-dependent patterns between humans and monkeys. However, neural responses in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of monkeys that were never explicitly trained to discriminate objects in context, as well as current artificial neural network models, could only partially explain this cross-species correspondence. The shared behavioral variance unexplained by context-naive neural data or computational models highlights fundamental knowledge gaps.

Our approach relies on a novel multi-sequence pretraining task, and a fine-tuning strategy that effectively conditions predictions on retrieved exemplars. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets and settings for predicting Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and Pfam families.

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Even without adaptive immunity, insects have evolved potent innate immune strategies to neutralize such enemies, including nematodes and parasitoid wasps. One such strategy relies on endosymbioses between insects and toxin-expressing bacteria. Here, we use genome editing in Drosophila melanogaster to retrace the evolution of two of such toxins -- cytolethal distending toxin B (cdtB) and apoptosis inducing protein of 56kDa (aip56) -- that were horizontally transferred from bacteriophages to insects. We found that a cdtB::aip56 fusion gene (fusionB), which is conserved in Drosophila ananassae subgroup species, dramatically promoted fly survival and suppressed wasp development when expressed in D. melanogaster immune tissues. FusionB, a functional nuclease, was secreted into the host hemolymph where it targeted the parasitoid embryo's serosal tissue and is to our knowledge the first humoral anti-parasitoid toxin in Drosophila. When expressed ubiquitously, fusionB slowed development in late stage fly larvae and eventually killed flies, pointing to the salience of regulatory constraint in preventing autoimmunity. Our findings demonstrate how horizontal gene transfer, in the right regulatory context, can instantly provide new and potent innate immune modules in animals.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Each sheath, if imagined unwrapped, has a cytoplasm-filled space at its perimeter, linking it to the oligodendrocyte soma via a short process. By electron microscopy (EM), this space, which we term the myelinic channel system contains microtubules and membranous organelles, but whether these are remnants of development or serve a function is unknown. Performing live imaging of myelinating oligodendrocytes expressing fluorescent reporters, we found that the myelinic channel system serves microtubule-dependent organelle transport. Further, the intra-myelinic movement of peroxisomes was modulated by neuronal electrical activity in these mixed neural cell cultures. Loss of oligodendroglial Kif21b or CNP in vivo led to apparent stasis of myelin organelles and secondary axon pathology. This suggests that oligodendrocytes require motor transport in the myelinic channel system to maintain axonal integrity.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Unknown species with similarity to known genomes cause database bias in reference-based metagenomics. To improve surveillance, we designed this study to recover sewage genomes and develop a quantification and correlation workflow for these genomes and AMR over time. We used longitudinal sewage sampling in seven treatment plants from five major European cities to explore the utility of catch-all sequencing of these population-level samples. Using metagenomic assembly methods, we recovered 2,332 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from prokaryotic species, 1,334 of which were previously undescribed. These genomes account for ~69% of sequenced DNA and provide insight into sewage microbial dynamics. Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Copenhagen (Denmark) showed strong seasonal microbial community shifts, while Bologna, Rome, (Italy) and Budapest (Hungary) had occasional blooms of Pseudomonas-dominated communities, accounting for up to ~95% of sample DNA. Seasonal shifts and blooms present challenges for effective sewage surveillance. We find that bacteria of known shared origin, like human gut microbiota, form communities, suggesting the potential for source-attributing novel species and their ARGs through network community analysis. This could significantly improve AMR tracking in urban environments.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

We show that larger clutch sizes, colder winters and summers, and more productive beech masting lead to younger populations. We report spatial synchrony of variation in age structure, which is distant-dependent but maintained up to approximately 650km. Despite covariation with age structure, reproductive and environmental variables do not strongly affect the scale of synchrony, except for evidence of an influence of beech masting.

The identification of ASD risk genes from exome-wide association studies and de novo variation analyses has enabled mechanistic investigations into how ASD-risk genes alter development. Most functional genomics studies have focused on the role of these genes in neurons and progenitor cells. However, roles for ASD risk genes in other cell types are largely uncharacterized. There is evidence from postmortem tissue that microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, appear activated in ASD. Here, we systematically assess the impact of ASD-risk gene knock-down on microglial uptake of synaptic material. We developed both an iPSC-derived microglia-neuron coculture system and high-throughput flow cytometry readout for synaptic uptake to enable CRISPRi-based screening. Our screen identified ADNP, one of the high-confidence ASD risk genes, amongst others as a modifier of microglial synaptic uptake. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional analyses revealed that ADNP plays a role in endocytosis, cell surface remodeling, and motility in microglia. Through this focused investigation into the role of ADNP in microglia, we also found preliminary evidence for WNT signaling coordinating microglial uptake of synaptic material.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Interactions between BMP ligands and their main antagonist, Chordin, establish BMP gradients, subdivide embryos into distinct territories and organise body plans. However, the molecular control and evolutionary origins of dorsal-ventral patterning within spiralians, one of the three major bilaterian groups, have been obscured by their unique embryonic development. Here we present the chromosome-level genome of a spiralian with deuterostome-like development, the brachiopod Lingula anatina, and apply functional transcriptomics to study dorsal-ventral patterning under the control of BMP signalling. We uncover the presence of a dorsal-ventral BMP signalling gradient in the L. anatina gastrula with bmp2/4 and chordin expressed at its dorsal and ventral sides, respectively. Using small-molecule drugs, exogenous recombinant BMP proteins and RNA sequencing, we show that a high level of BMP pathway activation inhibits the expression of neural genes during gastrula and larval stages. We also show that BMP signalling splits the developing larval shell field into two valves. The discovery of a BMP-mediated dorsal-ventral patterning system in a spiralian, similar to those observed in deuterostomes and non-spiralian protostomes, suggests deep conservation of this mechanism across all three major bilaterian clades. This is further supported by striking similarities in the gene sets regulated by BMP signalling in brachiopods and the vertebrate model Xenopus. We argue that the spiralian ancestor retained the basal bilaterian mechanism of dorsal-ventral patterning, although downstream components of the BMP-Chordin network have undergone dynamic evolutionary changes.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

The RNAPII-associated cleavage product is then degraded by XRN2, dislodging RNAPII from the DNA template. In contrast, prokaryotic RNAP and eukaryotic RNAPIII often terminate directly at T-tracts in the coding DNA strand. Here, we demonstrate a similar and omnipresent capability for mammalian RNAPII. XRN2- and T-tract-dependent termination are independent - the latter usually acting when XRN2 cannot be engaged. We show that T-tracts terminate snRNA transcription, previously thought to require the Integrator complex. Importantly, we find genome-wide termination at T-tracts in promoter-proximal regions, but not within protein-coding gene bodies. XRN2-dependent termination dominates downstream of protein-coding genes, but the T-tract process is sometimes employed. Overall, we demonstrate global DNA-directed attrition of RNAPII transcription, suggesting that RNAPs retain the potential to terminate over T-rich sequences throughout evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

We addressed this issue in a foraging task for mice where multiple decision variables are simultaneously encoded even if, at any given time, only one of them is used. We found that characteristic features of the face simultaneously encode not only the currently used decision variables, but also independent and unexpressed ones, and we show that these features partially originate from neural activity in the secondary motor cortex.

Phase separation is mediated by multivalent interactions of biological macromolecules including intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDRs). Despite considerable advances in experiments, theory and simulations, the prediction of the thermodynamics of IDR phase behaviour remains challenging. We combined coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and active learning to develop a fast and accurate machine learning model to predict the free energy and saturation concentration for phase separation directly from sequence. We validate the model using both experimental and computational data. We apply our model to all 27,663 IDRs of chain length up to 800 residues in the human proteome and find that 1,420 of these (5%) are predicted to undergo homotypic phase separation with transfer free energies <-2 kBT. We use our model to understand the relationship between single-chain compaction and phase separation, and find that changes from charge- to hydrophobicity-mediated interactions can break the symmetry between intra- and inter-molecular interactions. We also analyse the structural preferences at condensate interfaces and find substantial heterogeneity that is determined by the same sequence properties as phase separation. Our work refines the established rules governing the relationships between sequence features and phase separation propensities, and our prediction models will be useful for interpreting and designing cellular experiments on the role of phase separation, and for the design of IDRs with specific phase separation propensities.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Using this approach, we demonstrate measuring peptide quantitative linearity down to 25x dilution in a background of only a 1 ng proteome without requiring stable isotope labeled standards.

Here, we show that senescent cells (SCs) accumulate within demyelinated lesions after injury, and their elimination enhances remyelination in young mice but not in aged mice. In young mice, we observed the upregulation of senescence-associated transcripts primarily in microglia after demyelination, followed by their reduction during remyelination. However, in aged mice, senescence-associated factors persisted within lesions, correlating with inefficient remyelination. We found that SC elimination enhanced remyelination in young mice but was ineffective in aged mice. Proteomic analysis of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) revealed elevated levels of CCL11/Eotaxin-1 in lesions, which was found to inhibit efficient oligodendrocyte maturation. These results suggest therapeutic targeting of SASP components, such as CCL11, may improve remyelination in aging and MS.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Extensive genome sequencing efforts are currently in progress across a broad spectrum of life forms, holding the potential to unravel the intricate branching patterns within the tree of life. However, estimating species trees starting from raw genome sequences is quite challenging, and the current cutting-edge methodologies require a series of error-prone steps that are neither entirely automated nor standardized. In this paper, we present ROADIES, a novel pipeline for species tree inference from raw genome assemblies that is fully automated, easy to use, scalable, free from reference bias, and provides flexibility to adjust the tradeoff between accuracy and runtime. The ROADIES pipeline eliminates the need to align whole genomes, choose a single reference species, or pre-select loci such as functional genes found using cumbersome annotation steps. Moreover, it leverages recent advances in phylogenetic inference to allow multi-copy genes, eliminating the need to detect orthology. Using the genomic datasets released from large-scale sequencing consortia across three diverse life forms (placental mammals, pomace flies, and birds), we show that ROADIES infers species trees that are comparable in quality with the state-of-the-art approaches but in a fraction of the time. By incorporating optimal approaches and automating all steps from assembled genomes to species and gene trees, ROADIES is poised to improve the accuracy, scalability, and reproducibility of phylogenomic analyses.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1717452539879

Previous studies have shown that dehydrated mosquitoes will increase blood feeding propensity, but how this would occur over extended dry periods is unknown. Following a bloodmeal, prolonged exposure to dry conditions increased secondary blood feeding in mosquitoes by nearly two-fold, and chronic blood feeding allowed mosquitoes to survive twenty days without access to water sources. This refeeding did not alter the number of eggs generated, suggesting this refeeding is for hydration and nutrient replenishment. Exposure to desiccating conditions following a bloodmeal resulted in increased activity, decreased sleep levels, and prompted a return of CO2 sensing before egg deposition. The increased blood feeding during the vitellogenic stage and higher survival during dry periods are predicted to increase pathogen transmission and explain the elevated levels of specific arbovirus cases during dry conditions. These results solidify our understanding of the role of dry periods on mosquito blood feeding and how mosquito dehydration contributes to vectorial capacity and disease transmission dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Recent functional MRI studies using multi-voxel pattern classification analyses showed that unconscious contents could be decoded from brain activity patterns. However, decoding does not imply a full understanding of neural representations. Here we re-analysed data from a high-precision fMRI study coupled with representational similarity analysis based on convolutional neural network models to provide a detailed information-based approach to neural representations of both unconscious and conscious perceptual content. The results showed that computer vision model representations strongly predicted brain responses in ventral visual cortex and in fronto-parietal regions to both conscious and unconscious contents. Moreover, this pattern of results generalised when the models were trained and tested with different participants. Remarkably, these observations results held even when the analysis was restricted to observers that showed null perceptual sensitivity. In light of the highly distributed brain representation of unconscious information, we suggest that the functional role of fronto-parietal cortex in conscious perception is unlikely to be related to the broadcasting of information, as proposed by the global neuronal workspace theory, and may instead relate to the generation of meta-representations as proposed by higher-order theories.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

This study employed repeated training intervention interspersed with a detraining period to assess epigenetic memory of HIIT. METHODS: Twenty healthy subjects (25{+/-}5yrs) completed two HIIT interventions (training and retraining) lasting 2 months, separated by 3 months of detraining. Measurements at baseline, after training, detraining and retraining included maximal oxygen consumption ([V]O2max). Vastus lateralis biopsies were taken for genome-wide DNA methylation and targeted gene expression analyses. RESULTS: V'O2max improved during training and retraining (p<0.001) without differences between interventions (p>0.58). Thousands of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) predominantly demonstrated a hypomethylated state after training, retained even after 3-months exercise cessation and into retraining. Five genes; ADAM19, INPP5a, MTHFD1L, CAPN2, SLC16A3 possessed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with retained hypomethylated memory profiles and increased gene expression. The retained hypomethylation during detraining was associated with an enhancement in expression of the same genes even after 3 months of detraining. SLC16A3, INPP5a, CAPN2 are involved in lactate transport and calcium signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar physiological adaptations between training and retraining, memory profiles were found at epigenetic and gene expression level, characterized by retained hypomethylation and increased gene expression after training into long-term detraining and retraining. These genes were associated with calcium signaling and lactate transport. Whilst significant memory was not observed in physiological parameters, our novel findings indicate that human skeletal muscle possesses an epigenetic memory of HIIT.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is currently the most widely accepted MS method in the clinic, due to its reliability and analytical performance. However, due to limited throughput and the difficulty in setting up and analyzing large scale assays, SRM and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) are typically used only for very refined as-says of on the order of 100 targets or less. Here we introduce a new MS platform with a quadrupole mass filter, collision cell, linear ion trap architecture that has increased acquisition rates compared to the analogous hardware found in the OrbitrapTM TribridTM series instruments. The platform can target more analytes than existing SRM and PRM instruments, in the range of 5000 to 8000 peptides per hour. This capability for high multiplexing is enabled by acquisition rates of 70-100 Hz for peptide applications, and the incorporation of real time chromatogram alignment that adjusts for retention time drift and enables narrow time scheduled acquisition windows. Finally, we describe a Skyline external software tool that implements the building of targeted methods based on data independent acquisition chromatogram libraries or unscheduled analysis of heavy labeled standards. We show that the platform delivers ~10x lower LOQs than traditional SRM analysis for a highly multiplex assay and also demonstrate how analytical figures of merit change while varying method duration with a constant number of analytes, or by keeping a constant time duration while varying the number of analytes.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Using our method, we sequenced multiple consecutive amino acids within a model peptide.

Methods: Here we examine post-mortem tissue from six brain regions associated with cognitive and behavioural symptoms in a cohort of 30 people with sporadic ALS (sALS), a proportion of which underwent standardized neuropsychological behavioural assessment as part of the Edinburgh Cognitive ALS Screen (ECAS). Results: Overall, the behavioural screen performed as part of the ECAS predicted accumulation of pathological phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) with 100% specificity and 86% sensitivity in behaviour-associated brain regions. Notably, of these regions, pathology in the amygdala was the most predictive correlate of behavioural dysfunction in sALS. In the amygdala of sALS patients, we show variation in morphology, cell type predominance, and severity of pTDP-43 pathology. Further, we demonstrate that the presence and severity of intra-neuronal pTDP-43 pathology, but not astroglial pathology, or phosphorylated Tau pathology, is associated with behavioural dysfunction. Cases were also evaluated using a TDP-43 aptamer (TDP-43APT), which revealed that pathology was not only associated with behavioural symptoms, but also with ferritin levels, a measure of brain iron. Conclusions: Intra-neuronal pTDP-43 and cytoplasmic TDP-43APT pathology in the amygdala is associated with behavioural symptoms in sALS. TDP-43APT staining intensity is also associated with increased ferritin, regardless of behavioural phenotype, suggesting that ferritin increases may occur upstream of clinical manifestation, in line with early TDP-43APT pathology, representing a potential region-specific imaging biomarker of early disease in ALS.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

We found that yeast epsin Ent5 displayed the highest affinity for clathrin, indicating its significant role in cellular trafficking processes. Epsins Ent1 and Ent2, which are crucial for endocytosis but described to have redundant functions, revealed distinct binding patterns; Ent1 demonstrated stronger interactions with clathrin than Ent2, explaining its functional divergence towards actin binding. Despite both having actin anchoring domains, since Ent1 is actually more stably recruited by clathrin, it would provide a better actin anchoring function. These results offer molecular insights into AP selectivity, suggesting they competitively bind clathrin while also targeting different clathrin sites.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

On the functional dimension, metaproteomics data can be used to quantify beta-diversity to understand how microbial community functional profiles vary under different environmental conditions. Conventional approaches to metaproteomic functional beta diversity often treat protein functions as independent features, ignoring the evolutionary relationships among microbial taxa from which different proteins originate. A more informative functional distance metric that incorporates evolutionary relatedness is needed to better understand microbiome functional dissimilarities. Results: Here, we introduce PhyloFunc, a novel functional beta-diversity metric that incorporates microbiome phylogeny to inform on metaproteomic functional distance. Leveraging the phylogenetic framework of weighted UniFrac distance, PhyloFunc innovatively utilizes branch lengths to weigh between-sample functional distances for each taxon, rather than differences in taxonomic abundance as in weighted UniFrac. Proof-of-concept using a simulated toy dataset and a real dataset from mouse inoculated with a synthetic gut microbiome and fed different diets show that PhyloFunc successfully captured functional compensatory effects between phylogenetically related taxa. We further tested a third dataset of complex human gut microbiomes treated with five different drugs to compare PhyloFunc's performance with other traditional distance methods. PCoA and machine learning-based classification algorithms revealed higher sensitivity of PhyloFunc in microbiome responses to paracetamol. Conclusions: Unlike traditional approaches that consider metaproteomics features as independent and unrelated, PhyloFunc acknowledges the role of phylogenetic context in shaping the functional landscape in metaproteomes. In particular, we report that PhyloFunc accounts for the functional compensatory effect of taxonomically related species. It is effective, ecologically significant, and has better sensitivity, as evidenced by the particular applications we presented.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Cachexia is mediated by reduced muscle and fat mass and impaired function, and it lowers survival for patients. With no approved drugs to treat cachexia, preclinical efforts focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this condition to reveal treatment targets. Housing laboratory mice at ambient temperature imposes cold stress, leading to induced thermogenic activity and consequent whole-body metabolic adaptations. Yet, the impact of housing temperature in in vivo preclinical cachexia remains unknown. We found that thermoneutral (TN) housing in C26 carcinoma-bearing (C26) mice affected lean and fat mass, but not muscle weight or force. TN housing improved glucose tolerance in C26 mice, while enhancing circulating abundance of FGF21 and IL-6. Thermogenic tissues, especially brown adipose tissue, exhibited housing temperature-dependent molecular responses to cancer in oxygen consumption, ATP levels and SERCA ATPase activity, which are all crucial for cancer-induced whole-body metabolic adaptations. We conclude that molecular and systemic adaptations to cancer in mice critically depend on housing temperature, which should be considered in the design and interpretation of preclinical cancer studies.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.

Multiple solutions have been recently developed to widen the conformational landscape of predictions made by Alphafold2 (AF2). Here, we introduce AFsample2, a method employing random MSA column masking to reduce the influence of co-evolutionary signals to enhance the structural diversity of models generated by the AF2 neural network. AFsample2 improves the prediction of alternative states for a broad range of proteins, yielding high-quality end states and diverse conformational ensembles. In the data set of open-closed conformations (OC23), alternate state models improved in 17 out of 23 cases without compromising the generation of the preferred state. Consistent results were observed in 16 membrane protein transporters, with improvements in 12 out of 16 targets. TM-score improvements to experimental end states were substantial, sometimes exceeding 50%, elevating mediocre scores from 0.58 to nearly perfect 0.98. Furthermore, AFsample2 increased the diversity of intermediate conformations by 70% compared to the standard AF2 system, producing highly confident models that could potentially be on-path between the two states. In addition, we also propose a way of selecting the end-states in generated model ensembles. These solutions could potentially enhance the generation and identification of alternative protein conformations, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of protein function and dynamics. Future work will focus on validating the accuracy of these intermediate conformations and exploring their relevance to functional transitions in proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Here we show that the endocytic adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) is essential for the survival of Purkinje cells. Employing a multidisciplinary approach encompassing mouse genetics, viral tracing, ex vivo calcium imaging, and kinematic analysis, we demonstrate that mice lacking the -subunit of AP-2 in cerebellar Purkinje cells exhibit early-onset ataxia associated with progressive Purkinje cell degeneration. Importantly, we uncover that synaptic input dysfunctions, characterized by a predominance of parallel fiber (PF) over climbing fiber (CF) synapses precede Purkinje cell loss. Mechanistically, we find that AP-2 localizes to Purkinje cells dendrites, where it interacts with the PF synapse-enriched protein GRID2IP. The loss of AP-2 results in proteasome-dependent degradation of GRID2IP and accumulation of the glutamate {delta}2 receptor (GLUR{delta}2) in distal Purkinje cell dendrites, leading to an excess of PF synapses, while CF synapses are drastically reduced. The overrepresentation of PF synaptic input induces Purkinje cell hyperexcitation, which can be alleviated by enhancing synaptic glutamate clearance using the antibiotic ceftriaxone. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of AP-2 in preventing motor gait dysfunctions by regulating GRID2IP levels in Purkinje cells, thereby preserving the equilibrium of PF and CF synaptic inputs in a cell-autonomous manner.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

ProCapNet learns sequence motifs with distinct effects on initiation rates and TSS positioning and uncovers context-specific cryptic initiator elements intertwined within other TF motifs. ProCapNet annotates predictive motifs in nearly all actively transcribed regulatory elements across multiple cell-lines, revealing a shared cis-regulatory logic across promoters and enhancers mediated by a highly epistatic sequence syntax of cooperative and competitive motif interactions.

In complexes with PIWI proteins, they mediate the silencing of transposons and other genes at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. While numerous additional proteins are known to be essential for piRNA biogenesis and function in Drosophila and other animals, their molecular and mechanistic functions have remained largely unknown. To improve our molecular understanding of the Drosophila piRNA pathway, we used a cell culture-based protein-protein interaction assay, called ReLo, and performed a systematic pairwise interaction screen involving 22 factors operating in the cytoplasm, including PIWI proteins, Tudor domain-containing proteins (TDRDs), RNA helicases, and mitochondrial surface proteins. We detected all previously reported interactions for which crystal structures have been determined, some of which are dependent on symmetric arginine dimethylation (sDMA), and several interactions previously identified by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In addition, we identified previously unknown interactions. Through additional ReLo interaction testing and structural modeling using AlphaFold-Multimer, we have characterized six protein complexes at the molecular and structural levels, namely the Vreteno-BoYb, Vreteno-SoYb, Tejas-Spindle E, Tejas-Maelstrom, Tejas-Krimper complexes, as well as the complex composed of Armi and the Gasz-Daed heterodimer.

In sensorimotor adaptation, savings is tested by having participants adapt to perturbed feedback and, following a washout block during which the system resets to baseline, presenting the same perturbation again. While savings has been observed with these tasks, we have shown that the contribution from implicit sensorimotor adaptation, a process that uses sensory prediction errors to recalibrate the sensorimotor map, is actually attenuated upon relearning (Avraham et al., 2021). In the present study, we test the hypothesis that this attenuation is due to interference arising from the washout block, and more generally, from experience with a different relationship between the movement and the feedback. In standard adaptation studies, removing the perturbation at the start of the washout block results in a salient error signal in the opposite direction to that observed during learning. As a starting point, we replicated the finding that implicit adaptation is attenuated following a washout period in which the feedback now signals a salient opposite error. When we eliminated visual feedback during washout, implicit adaptation was no longer attenuated upon relearning, consistent with the interference hypothesis. Next, we eliminated the salient error during washout by gradually decreasing the perturbation, creating a scenario in which the perceived errors fell within the range associated with motor noise. Nonetheless, attenuation was still prominent. Inspired by this observation, we tested participants with an extended experience with veridical feedback during an initial baseline phase and found that this was sufficient to cause robust attenuation of implicit adaptation during the first exposure to the perturbation. This effect was context-specific: It did not generalize to movements that were not associated with the interfering feedback. Taken together, these results show that the implicit sensorimotor adaptation system is highly sensitive to memory interference from a recent experience with a discrepant action-outcome contingency.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Marfan syndrome is the most common inherited connective tissue disorder associated with TAAD. While vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) metabolism is emerging as a targetable driver of aortic aneurysm, surgical interventions remain the primary strategy to prevent aortic dissection. Our research indicates that the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), a branch of glycolysis, is upregulated in aortas from the Fbn1C1041G/+ Marfan Syndrome mouse model. Enhancing HBP activity promotes aortic dilation and accumulation glycan-rich extracellular matrix, contributing to aortic medial degeneration in wild-type mice. Mechanistically, fueling HBP activity induces VSMC dysfunction through excessive glycosylation, which activates the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). Pharmacological inhibition of HBP, along with ISR inhibition, successfully reverses aortic dilation and aortic medial degeneration in Fbn1C1041G/+ Marfan Syndrome mouse model. Additionally, Marfan Syndrome patients show elevated levels of HBP metabolites in blood plasma and serum, and heightened HBP-ISR signaling in patients with TAAD.

Lachancea thermotolerans, a yeast related to the fermentative process and one of the current trends in wine technology research, has undergone an anthropization process that has led to a strong differentiation both from a genomic and phenomic perspective. Using whole-genome sequencing, we have investigated the genomic diversity of 145 L. thermotolerans strains, identifying six well-defined groups primarily delineated by their ecological origin and exhibiting high levels of genetic diversity. Anthropized strains showed lower genetic diversity due to the purifying selection imposed by the winemaking environment. Strong evidence of anthropization and adaptation to the wine environment through modification of gene content was also found. Differences in genes involved in the assimilation of alternative carbon and nitrogen sources, such as the MAL1 and DAL5 genes, which confer greater fitness in the winemaking environment, were observed. Additionally, we found that phenotypic traits considered domestication hallmarks are present in anthropized strains. Among these, increased fitness in the presence of ethanol and sulphites, assimilation of non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol, and lower levels of residual fructose under fermentative conditions highlight. We hypothesize that lactic acid production by wine-related strains is an anthropization signature consequence of the adaption of early Crabtree-positive yeasts to the fermentative environment. Overall, the results of this work provide valuable insight into the anthropization process in L. thermotolerans and demonstrate how fermentation environments give rise to similar adaptations in different yeast species.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Furthermore, the cell-intrinsic requirement for IL-7 signaling during memory homeostasis has not been directly tested. Using inducible deletion, we found that Il7ra loss had only a modest effect on persistence of circulating memory and TRM subsets and that IL-7R was primarily required for normal basal proliferation. Loss of IL-15 signaling imposed heightened IL-7R dependence on memory CD8+ T cells, including TRM populations previously described as IL-15-independent. In the absence of IL-15 signaling, IL-7R was upregulated, and loss of IL-7R signaling reduced proliferation in response to IL-15, suggesting cross-regulation in memory CD8+ T cells. Thus, across subsets and tissues, IL-7 and IL-15 act in concert to support memory CD8+ T cells, conferring resilience to altered availability of either cytokine.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

We uncovered that transport of both transcripts is reinstated in dnmt2 nsun2b mutants after commitment to flowering.

An analysis of the graft-mobile transcriptome of juvenile heterografted-grafted wild type, dnmt2 nsun2b, aly2 and aly4 mutants revealed that the nuclear export factors are key regulators of mRNA transport.

Although most nematodes lack eyes, some species exhibit phototaxis. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the unique photoreceptor protein Cel-LITE-1, its downstream G proteins, and cyclic GMP (cGMP)-dependent pathways are required for phototransduction. However, the mechanism of light-sensing in other nematodes remains unknown. To address this question, we used the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, which was established as a satellite model organism for comparison with C. elegans. Similar to C. elegans, illumination with short-wavelength light induces avoidance behavior in P. pacificus. Opsin, cryptochrome/photolyase, and lite-1 were not detected in the P. pacificus genome using orthology and domain prediction-based analyses. To identify the genes related to phototransduction in P. pacificus, we conducted forward genetic screening for light-avoidance behavior and isolated four light-unresponsive mutants. Whole-genome sequencing and genetic mapping revealed that the cGMP-dependent pathway and Ppa-grk-2, which encodes a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) are required for light avoidance. Although the cGMP-dependent pathway is conserved in C. elegans phototransduction, GRK is not necessary for light avoidance in C. elegans. This suggests similarities and differences in light-sensing mechanisms between the two species. Using a reverse genetics approach, we showed that GABA and glutamate were involved in light avoidance. Through reporter analysis and suppression of synapse transmission, we identified candidate photosensory neurons. These findings advance our understanding of the diversity of phototransduction in nematodes even in the absence of eyes.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

However, it remains unclear whether similar biological processes occur during healthy aging, albeit to a lesser degree. We therefore determined whether midbrain DA neurons degenerate during aging in mice and humans. In mice, we identified no changes in midbrain neuron numbers throughout aging. Despite this, we found age-related decreases in midbrain mRNA expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), the rate limiting enzyme of DA synthesis. Among midbrain glutamatergic cells, we similarly identified age-related declines in vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2) mRNA expression. In co-transmitting Th+/Vglut2+ neurons, Th and Vglut2 transcripts decreased with aging. Importantly, striatal Th and Vglut2 protein expression remained unchanged. In translating our findings to humans, we found no midbrain neurodegeneration during aging and identified age-related decreases in TH and VGLUT2 mRNA expression similar to mouse. Unlike mice, we discovered diminished density of striatal TH+ dopaminergic terminals in aged human subjects. However, TH and VGLUT2 protein expression were unchanged in the remaining striatal boutons. Finally, in contrast to Th and Vglut2 mRNA, expression of most ribosomal genes in Th+ neurons was either maintained or even upregulated during aging. This suggests a homeostatic mechanism where age-related declines in transcriptional efficiency are overcome by ongoing ribosomal translation. Overall, we demonstrate species-conserved transcriptional effects of aging in midbrain dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurons that are not accompanied by marked cell death or lower striatal protein expression. This opens the door to novel therapeutic approaches to maintain neurotransmission and bolster neuronal resilience.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Balance of the activity in these canonical direct-indirect pathways is considered a core requirement for normal movement control, and their imbalance is a major etiologic factor in movement disorders including Parkinsons disease. We present evidence for a conceptually equivalent parallel system of direct-D1 and indirect-D2 pathways that arise from striatal projection neurons (SPNs) of the striosome compartment rather than from the matrix. These striosomal direct (S-D1) and indirect (S-D2) pathways, as a pair, target dopamine-containing neurons of the substantia nigra (SNpc) instead of the motor output nuclei of the basal ganglia. The novel anatomically and functionally distinct indirect-D2 striosomal pathway targets dopaminergic SNpc cells indirectly via a core region of the external pallidum (GPe). We demonstrate that these S-D1 and S-D2 pathways oppositely modulate striatal dopamine release in freely behaving mice under open-field conditions and oppositely modulate locomotor and other movements. These S-D1 and S-D2 pathways further exhibit different, time-dependent responses during performance of a probabilistic decision-making maze task and respond differently to rewarding and aversive stimuli. These contrasts depend on mediolateral and anteroposterior striatal locations of the SPNs as are the classic direct and indirect pathways. The effects of S-D1 and S-D2 stimulation on striatal dopamine release and voluntary locomotion are nearly opposite. The parallelism of the direct-indirect circuit design motifs of the striosomal S-D and S-D2 circuits and canonical matrix M-D1 and M-D2, and their contrasting behavioral effects, call for a major reformulation of the classic direct-indirect pathway model of basal ganglia function. Given that some striosomes receive limbic and association cortical inputs, the S-D1 and S-D2 circuits likely influence motivation for action and behavioral learning, complementing and possibly reorienting the motoric activities of the canonical matrix pathways. At a fundamental level, these findings suggest a unifying framework for aligning two sets of circuits that share the organizational motif of opponent D1 and D2 regulation, but that have different outputs and can even have opposite polarities in their targets and effects, albeit conditioned by striatal topography. Our findings further delineate a potentially therapeutically important set of pathways influencing dopamine, including a D2 receptor-linked S-D2 pathway likely unknowingly targeted by administration of many therapeutic drugs including those for Parkinsons disease. The novel parallel pathway model that we propose here could help to account for the normally integrated modulatory influence of the basal ganglia on motivation for actions as well as the actions themselves.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

The strong evolutionary pressure to adapt, shapes pathogens genomes, and comparative genomics has been instrumental in characterizing this process. With the aim to capture genomic variation at high resolution and study the processes contributing to adaptation, we here leverage and expand on an innovative, multi-genome method to construct, annotate, and analyse the first pangenome graph of an oomycete plant pathogen. We generated telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies of six genetically diverse isolates of the oomycete pathogen Peronospora effusa, the economically most important disease in cultivated spinach worldwide. The pangenome graph demonstrates that P. effusa genomes are highly conserved, both in chromosomal structure and gene content, and revealed the continued activity of transposable elements which are directly responsible for 80% of the observed variation between the isolates. While most genes are generally conserved, pathogenicity related genes are highly variable between the isolates. Most of the variation is found in large gene clusters resulting from extensive copy-number expansion. Pangenome graph-based discovery can thus be effectively used to capture genomic variation at exceptional resolution, thereby providing a framework to study the biology and evolution of plant pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

How KMDs evolve is not well understood. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the largest gene family, known as the wtf genes, is a KMD family that causes intraspecific hybrid sterility. Here, we investigate how wtf genes evolve using long-read-based genome assemblies of 31 distinct S. pombe natural isolates, which encompass the known genetic diversity of S. pombe. Our analysis, involving nearly 1,000 wtf genes in these isolates, yields a comprehensive portrayal of the intraspecific diversity of wtf genes. Leveraging single-nucleotide polymorphisms in adjacent unique sequences, we pinpoint wtf-gene-containing loci that have recently undergone gene conversion events and infer their pre-gene-conversion state. These events include the revival of wtf pseudogenes, lending support to the notion that gene conversion plays a role in preserving this gene family from extinction. Moreover, our investigation reveals that solo long terminal repeats (LTRs) of retrotransposons, frequently found near wtf genes, can act as recombination arms, influencing the upstream regulatory sequences of wtf genes. Additionally, our exploration of the outer boundaries of wtf genes uncovers a previously unrecognized type of directly oriented repeats flanking wtf genes. These repeats may have facilitated the early expansion of the wtf gene family in S. pombe. Our findings enhance the understanding of the mechanisms influencing the evolution of this KMD gene family.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

However, its routine clinical use is limited by cost and accessibility barriers. Here we explore using machine learning (ML) models to predict clinically useful tau-PET outcomes from low-cost and non-invasive features, e.g., basic clinical variables, plasma biomarkers, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results demonstrated that models including plasma biomarkers yielded highly accurate predictions of tau-PET burden (best model: R-squared=0.66-0.68), with especially high contribution from plasma P-tau217. In contrast, MRI variables stood out as best predictors (best model: R-squared=0.28-0.42) of asymmetric tau load between the two hemispheres (an example of clinically relevant spatial information). The models showed high generalizability to external test cohorts with data collected at multiple sites. Based on these results, we also propose a proof-of-concept two-step classification workflow, demonstrating how the ML models can be translated to a clinical setting.

Multiple different methods are currently used to cluster together closely-related genomes, potentially leading to inconsistency between studies. Here, we use a global dataset of 26,306 S. pneumoniae genomes to compare four clustering methods: gene-by-gene seven-locus multi-locus sequencing typing (MLST), core genome MLST (cgMLST)-based hierarchical clustering (HierCC) assignments, Life Identification Number (LIN) barcoding, and k-mer-based PopPUNK clustering (known as GPSCs in this species). We compare the clustering results with phylogenetic and pan-genome analyses to assess their relationship with genome diversity and evolution, as we would expect a good clustering method to form a single monophyletic cluster that has high within-cluster similarity of genomic content. We show that the four methods are generally able to accurately reflect the population structure based on these metrics, and that the methods were broadly consistent with each other. We investigated further to study the discrepancies in clusters. The greatest concordance was seen between LIN barcoding and HierCC (Adjusted Mutual Information Score = 0.950), which was expected given that both methods utilise cgMLST, but have different methods for defining an individual cluster and different core genome schema. However, the existence of differences between the two methods show that the selection of a core genome schema can introduce inconsistencies between studies. GPSC and HierCC assignments were also highly concordant (AMI = 0.946), showing that k-mer based methods which use the whole genome and do not require the careful selection of a core genome schema are just as effective at representing the population structure. Additionally, where there were differences in clustering between these methods, this could be explained by differences in the accessory genome that were not identified in cgMLST. We conclude that for S. pneumoniae, standardised and stable nomenclature is important as the number of genomes available expands. Furthermore, the research community should transition away from seven-locus MLST, and cgMLST, GPSC, and LIN assignments should be used more widely. However, to allow for easy comparison between studies and to make previous literature relevant, the reporting of multiple clustering names should be standardised within research.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

The synaptic terminals of Mfs (Mf boutons, MfBs) form large and complex synapses with thorny excrescences (TE) on the proximal dendrites CA3 pyramidal cells (PCs). MfB/TE synapses have distinctive ""detonator"" properties due to low intitial release probability and large presynaptic facilitation. The molecular mechanisms shaping the morpho-functional properties of MfB/TE synapses are still poorly understood, though alterations in their morphology are associated with Down syndrome, intellectual disabilities, and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we identify the core PCP gene Vangl2 as essential to the morphogenesis and function of MfB/TE synapsess. Vangl2 colocalises with the presynaptic heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican 4 (GPC4) to stabilise the postsynaptic orphan receptor GPR158. Embryonic loss of Vangl2 disrupts the morphology of MfBs and TEs, impairs ultrastructural and molecular organisation, resulting in defective synaptic transmission and plasticity. In adult, the early loss of Vangl2 results in a number of hippocampus-dependent memory deficits including characteristic flexibility of declarative memory, organisation and retention of working/everyday-like memory. These deficits also lead to abnormal generalisation of memories to salient cues and diminished ability to form detailed contextual memories. Together, these results establish Vangl2 as a key regulator of DG-CA3 connectivity and functions.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

In addition to calcification and flagella, transcriptomes and proteomes of haploid and diploid cells modulate their differentiation in photosynthesis, sulfatases, DMSP degradation, DNA replication, and endomembrane system and transport. Haploid-diploid differential gene expression can be partially attributable to allelic imbalance (allele-specific expression) in diploid cells. Gene transcript abundance is positively associated with both CG and CHG gene-body DNA methylation, which can be inheritable, allele-specific, and differentiated between life-cycle phases.

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

However, it has only recently been discovered that MEC and hippocampus are modulated by the positions and trajectories of others. To understand how encoding spatial information of multiple agents shapes neural representations, we train a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that captures properties of MEC to path integrate trajectories of two agents simultaneously navigating the same environment. We find significant differences between these RNNs and those trained to path integrate only a single agent. At the individual unit level, RNNs trained to path integrate more than one agent develop weaker grid responses, stronger border responses, and tuning for the relative position of the two agents.

Our findings reveal a significant reduction in PD occurrence following anti-tetanus vaccination, with a time-dependent association between the elapsed time since vaccination and both the rate and progression of PD. These results are supported by evidence that antimicrobial treatments significantly alter disease severity, suggesting the actual involvement of Clostridium Tetani in PD pathology.

Specifically, it samples the smallest k-mer according to the order O from each window of w consecutive k-mers in S. Because consecutive windows can sample the same k-mer, the set of the sampled k-mers is typically much smaller than S. This makes the minimizer a versatile tool to reduce the memory footprint and processing time of several applications in bioinformatics, such as sequence comparison, assembly, compacted De Bruijn graph construction, and sequence indexing. More generally, we consider substring sampling algorithms that respect a window guarantee: at least one k-mer must be sampled from every window of w consecutive k-mers. As a sampled k-mer is uniquely identified by its absolute position in S, we can define the density of a sampling algorithm as the fraction of distinct sampled positions. Good methods have low density which, by respecting the window guarantee, is lower bounded by 1/w. It is however difficult to design a sequence-agnostic algorithm with provably optimal density. In practice, the order O is usually implemented using a pseudo-random hash function to obtain the so-called random minimizer. This scheme is simple to implement, very fast to compute even in streaming fashion, and easy to analyze. However, its density is almost a factor of 2 away from the lower bound for large windows. Prior work has thus focused on methods that achieve lower density than the random minimizer, both in theory and practice. Nonetheless, those methods remain difficult to analyze and intuitively understand, and are not always as versatile as random minimizers. Methods: In this work we introduce mod-sampling, a two-step sampling algorithm to obtain new minimizer schemes. Given a (small) parameter t, the mod-sampling algorithm finds the position p of the smallest t-mer in a window. It then samples the k-mer at position p mod w. The lr-minimizer uses t = k - w and the mod-minimizer uses t {equiv} k (mod w). Results: These new schemes have provably lower density than classic random minimizers and other schemes when k is large compared to w, while being as fast to compute. Importantly, the mod-minimizer achieves optimal density when k [-&gt;] {infty}. Although the mod-minimizer is not the first method to achieve optimal density for large k, its proof of optimality is simpler than previous work. We provide pseudocode for a number of other methods and compare to them. In practice, the mod-minimizer has considerably lower density than the random minimizer and other state-of-the-art methods, like closed syncmers and miniception, when k > w. We plugged the mod-minimizer into SSHash, a k-mer dictionary based on minimizers. For default parameters (w, k) = (11, 21), space usage decreases by 15% when indexing the whole human genome (GRCh38), while maintaining its fast query time.

The most common genetic causes are mutations in the CLN3 gene encoding a lysosomal protein. There are currently no therapies targeting the progression of the disease, mostly due to the lack of knowledge about the disease mechanisms. To gain insight into the impact of CLN3 loss on cellular signaling and organelle function, we generated CLN3 knock-out cells in a human cell line (CLN3-KO), and performed RNA sequencing to obtain the cellular transcriptome. Following a multi-dimensional transcriptome analysis, we identified the transcriptional regulator YAP1 as a major driver of the transcriptional changes observed in CLN3-KO cells. We further observed that YAP1 pro-apoptotic signaling is hyperactive as a consequence of CLN3 functional loss in retinal pigment epithelia cells, and in the hippocampus and thalamus of CLN3ex{Delta}7/8 mice, an established model of Batten disease. Loss of CLN3 activates YAP1 by a cascade of events that starts with the inability of releasing glycerophosphodiesthers from CLN3-KO lysosomes, which leads to perturbations in the lipid content of the nuclear envelope and nuclear dysmorphism. This results in increased number of DNA lesions, activating the kinase c-Abl, which phosphorylates YAP1, stimulating its pro-apoptotic signaling. Altogether, our results highlight a novel organelle crosstalk paradigm in which lysosomal metabolites regulate nuclear envelope content, nuclear shape and DNA homeostasis. This novel molecular mechanism underlying the loss of CLN3 in mammalian cells and tissues may open new c-Abl-centric therapeutic strategies to target Batten disease.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Neural pathologies are often associated with anatomical changes in these axonal projections and synaptic connections. Notably, axonal density variations of local and long-range projections increase or decrease as a function of the strengthening or weakening, respectively, of the information flow between brain regions. Traditionally, histological quantification of axonal inputs relied on assessing the mean fluorescence intensity within a rectangle placed in the brain region-of-inter-est. Despite yielding valuable insights, this conventional method is notably susceptible to background fluorescence, post-acquisition adjustments, and inter-researcher variability. Additionally, it fails to account for the non-uniform innervation across brain regions, thus overlooking critical data such as innervation percentages and axonal distribution patterns. In response to these challenges, we introduce AxoDen, an open-source semi-automated platform designed to increase the speed and rigor of axon quantifications for basic neuroscience discovery. AxoDen processes user-defined brain regions-of-interests incorporating dynamic thresholding of grayscales-transformed images to facilitate binarized pixel measure-ments. Thereby AxoDen segregates the image content into signal and non-signal categories, effectively eliminating background interference and enabling the exclusive measurement of fluorescence from axonal projections. AxoDen provides detailed and accurate representations of axonal density and spatial distribution. AxoDens advanced yet user-friendly platform enhances the reliability and efficiency of axonal density analysis and facilitates access to unbiased high-quality data analysis with no technical background or coding experience required. AxoDen is freely available to everyone as a valuable neuroscience tool for dissecting axonal innervation patterns in precisely defined brain regions.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Cases of chronic viral infection have been suggested as an explanation for this phenomenon, whereby an extended period of infection, with an increased rate of evolution, creates viruses with substantial genetic novelty. However, measuring a rate of evolution during chronic infection is made more difficult by the potential existence of compartmentalisation in the viral population, whereby the viruses in a host form distinct subpopulations. We here describe and apply a novel statistical method to study within-host virus evolution, identifying the minimum number of subpopulations required to explain sequence data observed from cases of chronic infection, and inferring rates for within-host viral evolution. Across nine cases of chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalised patients we find that non-trivial population structure is relatively common, with four cases showing evidence of more than one viral population evolving independently within the host. We find cases of within-host evolution proceeding significantly faster, and significantly slower, than that of the global SARS-CoV-2 population, and of cases in which viral subpopulations in the same host have statistically distinguishable rates of evolution. Non-trivial population structure was associated with high rates of within-host evolution that were systematically underestimated by a more standard inference method.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Model-based analyses explained why decision and movement speeds were coupled or decoupled as rats adapted to changes in reward value or motor cost, respectively.

Current leading hypotheses propose that a symbiosis between an asgardarchaeal host cell and an alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont represented a crucial step in eukaryotic origins and invoke a central role for syntrophic interactions - that is, metabolic cross-feeding between the partners as the basis for their subsequent evolutionary integration. A major unanswered question is whether the metabolism of modern eukaryotes bears any vestige of this ancestral interaction. To investigate this question in detail, we systematically analyze the evolutionary origins of the eukaryotic gene repertoires mediating central carbon metabolism. Our phylogenetic and sequence analyses reveal that this gene repertoire is chimeric, with ancestral contributions from Asgardarchaeota and Alphaproteobacteria operating predominantly in glycolysis and TCA, respectively. Furthermore, our analyses reveal diverse additional contributions from other prokaryotic sources as well as the extent to which this ancestral metabolic interplay has been remodeled via gene loss, transfer, and subcellular retargeting in the >2Ga since the origin of eukaryotic cells. Together, our work demonstrates that in contrast to previous assumptions, the eukaryotic metabolism preserves information about the nature of the original asgardarchaeal-alphaproteobacterial interactions, and supports syntrophy scenarios on the origin of the eukaryotic cell.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

Inflorescence architecture depends on shape, longevity and determinacy of meristems that direct growth of the main rachis and lateral branches, but how individual meristem activities are determined and integrated within complex inflorescences is not yet understood. We found that activity of distinct meristems in the barley inflorescence is coordinated by a signalling pathway comprising the receptor like kinase Hordeum vulgare CLAVATA1 (HvCLV1) and the secreted CLAVATA3/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION (CLE)-family peptide FON2- LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (HvFCP1). HvFCP1 interacts with HvCLV1 to promote spikelet formation but restricts inflorescence meristem and rachilla meristem proliferation. Hvfcp1 or Hvclv1 mutants generate branched inflorescences with additional rows of spikelets and supernumerary florets.

Within germ granules, mRNAs form multi-transcript clusters marked by increased mRNA concentration, creating an elevated potential for intermolecular base pairing. However, the type and abundance of intermolecular base pairing in mRNA clusters is poorly characterized. Using single-molecule super-resolution microscopy, chemical probing for base accessibility, phase separation assays, and simulations, we demonstrated that mRNAs remain well-folded upon localization to germ granules. While most base pairing is intramolecular, mRNAs still display the ability for intermolecular base pairing, facilitating clustering without high sequence complementarity or significant melting of secondary structure. This base pairing among mRNAs is driven by scattered and discontinuous stretches of bases appearing on the surface of folded RNAs, providing multivalency to clustering but exhibits low probability for sustained interactions. Notably, engineered germ granule mRNAs with exposed GC-rich complementary sequences (CSs) presented within stable stem loops induce sustained base pairing in vitro and enhanced intermolecular interactions in vivo. However, the presence of these stem loops alone disrupts fly development, and the addition of GC-rich CSs exacerbates this phenotype. Although germ granule mRNAs contain numerous GC-rich CSs capable of stable intermolecular base pairing, they are primarily embedded by RNA folding. This study emphasizes the role of RNA folding in controlling the type and abundance of intermolecular base pairing, thereby preserving the functional integrity of mRNAs within the germ granules.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

These strategies require extensive testing and method refinement due to the difficulties associated with prediction of peptide response in the biological matrix of interest. Gas-phase fractionated (GPF) narrow window data-independent acquisition (DIA) aids in the development of reproducible selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays by providing matrix-specific information on peptide detectability and quantification by mass spectrometry.

Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

The complex assembles with a long P tetrameric coiled-coil that is capped by a bundle of -helices that we show are likely dynamic in solution. Highly conserved zinc-binding modules in the capping domain and a large insert in the RdRp palm domain that is short or absent in most other non-segmented negative strand RNA viruses are critical for replication and transcription.

The recovery of mammalian predators of conservation concern in Europe is a success story, but their impact on some prey species of conservation concern may cause conservation dilemmas. This calls for effective intervention strategies that mitigate predator impacts without compromising their recovery.

2. We evaluated diversionary feeding as a management intervention tool to reduce depredation on nests of rapidly declining Western capercaillies in Scotland. We studied the influence of diversionary feeding provision on the fates of artificial nests deployed using a replicated and representative randomised landscape-scale experiment. This comprised 30 paired control (no diversionary feeding) and treatment (diversionary feeding applied) sites, 60 in total, each containing six artificial nests distributed across 600 km2. The experiment was replicated over two years, and in the second year, the control-treatment pairs were reversed, yielding 60 treatment and 60 control sites and 720 artificial nests.

3. Diversionary feeding substantially reduced depredation of artificial nests, translating into an 83% increase in predicted nest survival over 28 days of incubation. The increase in survival was mostly accounted for by a reduction in the probability that a pine marten, the main nest predator, consumed or cached eggs. Diversionary food also significantly reduced nest predation by badgers, although the magnitude of this effect varied by year.

4. Diversionary feeding is an easily employable method shown in this study to reduce predator impact (functional) without lethal (numerical) intervention. Managers should proceed with its application for conserving capercaillie in Scotland without delay.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

Therefore, we calculated Brain Age Gap (BAG), which is the difference between brain age and chronological age, in a cohort of 25 mild to moderate COVID-19 survivors (did not experience breathlessness, pneumonia, or respiratory/organ failure) and 24 non-infected controls (mean age = 30 +/- 8) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic.

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

FundingNational Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2701800 and 2022YFC2304700), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82202567 and 32270003), Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2022278), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (23QA1410500), and Shanghai municipal three-year action plan for strengthening the construction of the public health system (2023-2025) GWVI-2.1.2.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1717452539879

CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events.

In this study, we compared the humoral immunogenicity of XBB and JN.1 lineage infections in human subjects with diverse immune histories to understand the antigenic and immunogenic distinctions between these variants. Similar to observations in naive mice, priming with XBB and JN.1 in humans without prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure results in distinct NAb responses, exhibiting minimal cross-reactivity. Importantly, breakthrough infections (BTI) with the JN.1 lineage induce 5.9-fold higher neutralization titers against JN.1 compared to those induced by XBB BTI. We also observed notable immune evasion of recently emerged JN.1 sublineages, including JN.1+R346T+F456L, with KP.3 showing the most pronounced decrease in neutralization titers by both XBB and JN.1 BTI sera.

ParticipantsIndividuals aged [&ge;]65 years who had previously received at least four covid-19 vaccine doses. Main outcome measures: Cumulative incidences of covid-19 hospital admission and death for 12 weeks after immunisation (defined as 1 week after vaccination) among recipients of an XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences.

ResultsDuring autumn and winter 2023-2024, a total of 1,867,448 1:1 matched pairs of XBB-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and non-recipients were included (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years). The comparative vaccine effectiveness was 60.6% (95% confidence interval, 46.1% to 75.1%) against covid-19 hospital admission (930 v 2,551 events) and 77.9% (69.2% to 86.7%) against covid-19 related death (301 v 1,326 events) at 12 weeks of follow-up. This corresponded to 191.1 (95% confidence interval, 50.2 to 332.1) covid-19 hospital admissions and 109.2 (100.2 to 118.1) deaths prevented per 100,000 individuals vaccinated with an XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.

However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1717452539879

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

It forms a right-handed helical barrel consisting of 22 pairs of Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 subunits, with a diameter of 32 nm its wider end and 19 nm at its narrower end. Oligomerization is stabilized by the C-terminus, which forms two helical layers linked by a {beta}-strand, and coiled-coil domains that enable strong charge-charge inter-subunit interactions. Flotillin interacts with membranes at both ends; through its SPFH1 domains at the wide end and the C-terminus at the narrow end, facilitated by hydrophobic interactions and lipidation. The inward tilting of the SPFH domain, likely triggered by phosphorylation, suggests its role in membrane curvature induction, which could be connected to its proposed role in clathrin-independent endocytosis. The structure suggests a shared architecture across the family of SPFH proteins and will promote further research into Flotillins roles in cell biology.

Significance statementIt is well known that many biochemical processes in cells must occur in localized regions. There are many different ideas about how cells keep processes localized. In this study we demonstrate that Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 co-assemble to form a large, truncated cone shaped cage whose wide end is always attached to a membrane surface and whose narrow end is sometimes attached to a separate membrane. The entire wall of the cage is without holes and is likely impervious even to small molecules, forming a diffusion barrier that can connect membrane systems. The Flotillin cage is thus well suited to isolate biochemical processes. Through membrane attachment, it also alters local membrane curvature, which could influence endocytic and mechanosensory processes.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879

However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.","NA","biorxiv",1717452539879
