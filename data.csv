The use of ExM has revealed several novel insights into the nanoscale architectures of cellular protein complexes, especially the microtubule cytoskeleton in model and non-model systems. Despite tremendous progress in expansion microscopy protocols that preserve cellular ultrastructure (U-ExM), compatible probes for imaging actin isoforms with U-ExM are still lacking and have hindered the study of diverse actin isoforms and networks across model systems. Here, we use IntAct, an internally tagged actin that incorporates into cellular actin networks, to develop and optimize U-ExM of diverse actin network types in both yeast and mammalian cells. Using expression of ALFA-tagged IntAct variants in yeast and mammalian cells, we show robust visualization of actin patches, cables, and rings in yeast and diverse actin networks such as actin cortex, stress fibers, filopodia, lamellipodium in mammalian cells at improved resolution. We also detect transient nuclear actin filaments using IntAct-U-ExM underscoring the advantages offered by our approach to image understudied actin structures. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of IntAct-U-ExM for performing super-resolution imaging of various actin structures in an isoform-specific manner and highlight the potential of IntAct to study the nanoscale organization of diverse actin cytoskeletal networks across species.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

However, how these malignant states arise and whether they follow defined cellular trajectories across tumours is poorly understood. Here, we generated a deep single cell and spatial multi-omic atlas of human glioblastoma that pairs transcriptomic, epigenomic and genomic profiling of 12 tumours across multiple regions. We identify that glioblastoma heterogeneity is driven by spatially-patterned transitions of cancer cells from developmental-like states towards those defined by a glial injury response and hypoxia. This cellular trajectory regionalises tumours into distinct tissue niches and manifests in a molecularly conserved manner across tumours as well as genetically distinct tumour subclones. Moreover, using a new deep learning framework to map cancer cell states jointly with clones in situ, we show that tumour subclones are finely spatially intermixed through glioblastoma tissue niches. Finally, we show that this cancer cell trajectory is intimately linked to myeloid heterogeneity and unfolds across regionalised myeloid signalling environments. Our findings define a stereotyped trajectory of cancer cells in glioblastoma and unify glioblastoma tumour heterogeneity into a tractable cellular and tissue framework.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

Consensus assembly using Trycycler can improve accuracy, but its lack of automation limits scalability. There is a need for an automated method to generate high-quality consensus bacterial genome assemblies from long-read data. Results: We present Autocycler, a command-line tool for generating accurate bacterial genome assemblies by combining multiple alternative long-read assemblies of the same genome. Without requiring user input, Autocycler builds a compacted De Bruijn graph from the input assemblies, clusters and filters contigs, trims overlaps and resolves consensus sequences by selecting the most common variant at each locus. It also supports manual curation when desired, allowing users to refine assemblies in challenging or important cases. In our evaluation using Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads from five bacterial isolates, Autocycler outperformed individual assemblers, automated pipelines and other consensus tools, producing assemblies with lower error rates and improved structural accuracy. Availability and implementation: Autocycler is implemented in Rust, open-source and freely available at github.com/rrwick/Autocycler. It runs on Linux and macOS and is extensively documented.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

Cellular plasticity, the capacity of cancer cells to transition between phenotypic states, drives GB progression and resistance. However, the regulatory logic that permits or restricts specific state transitions remains poorly understood. Here, we integrated single-nucleus RNA and chromatin accessibility multi-ome profiles from over one million cells across primary IDH-wildtype GBs and developed scDORI, a scalable deep-learning framework to infer enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks (eGRNs) at single-cell resolution. Our analysis revealed a structured hierarchy of GB cell states governed by distinct regulatory programs, with marked variability in epigenetic plasticity that enables or constrains transitions. Neuronal-like tumor cells emerge as a low plasticity state that deploys active repression, in contrast to more permissive progenitor-like and astrocytic states. We identified the neuronal-like state-specific repressor MYT1L as a key regulator that silences master transcription factors of alternative states. MYT1L gain-of-function in patient-derived GB cells reduced chromatin accessibility, induced neuronal-like identity, and restricted proliferation and invasion in vivo, whereas loss-of-function reactivated plasticity and accelerated malignant features. Our findings delineate the epigenetic architecture and associated transcriptional master regulators that shape GB state trajectories, and establish safeguard repressors such as MYT1L as potential therapeutic targets to constrain malignant plasticity.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

However, some lineages remain recalcitrant to assembly despite recent advances in sequencing technologies and assembly tools. Birds present a substantial genome assembly challenge due to the presence of tiny, hard to assemble microchromosomes that are often highly fragmented or even missing in draft genome assemblies. As such, bird genomes require a large amount of expert manual curation effort via manipulation of genome-wide HI-C contact maps and many current chromosome-level bird genome assemblies do not resolve the known karyotype. Microchromosomes have distinct genetic and epigenetic features. They are GC-biased, gene-rich, highly methylated, and have distinct spatial organisation in the centre of the nucleus. Importantly, they are conserved across avian evolution. Here, using a reference set of expert curated bird genomes, we have identified a set of conserved microchromosome genes and developed MicroFinder, a pipeline that uses this gene set to find small microchromosome fragments in draft genome assemblies to act as anchors for manual curation of microchromosomes. We demonstrate how MicroFinder can be used to improve the speed and accuracy of bird genome curation. Furthermore, we highlight the usefulness of MicroFinder by carrying out MicroFinder-enabled re-curation of 12 previously released chromosome-scale bird genome assemblies, increasing the sequence content of microchromosome models.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

Estimates of long COVID risk after a first COVID-19 infection vary, and data on risk following reinfections remain lacking.

ObjectiveTo estimate and compare long COVID risk and severity with first COVID-19 infection versus reinfections among healthcare workers (HCWs).

DesignRetrospective cohort study based on an electronic survey among Quebec HCWs conducted between May 16 and June 15, 2023. A short telephone survey among randomly selected non-respondents further assessed potential response bias.

SettingPopulation-based study in Quebec, Canada.

Participants397 222 HCWs were invited to participate in the electronic survey and 10 500 in the telephone survey.

Main outcomes and measuresWe defined long COVID cases as HCWs self-reporting COVID-19-attributed symptoms lasting [&ge;]12 weeks, classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on perceived symptom intensity. We compared self-reported symptoms and functional limitations of cases to COVID controls (infected participants without long COVID) and non-COVID controls (uninfected participants). Risk and prevalence were estimated by number of infections, likely infecting variant and perceived acute COVID-19 severity. We conducted symptom clustering analyses using unsupervised learning techniques.

ResultsEstimated long COVID risk following any COVID-19 infection was similar among 22 496 online survey participants (17.0% [95%CI, 16.3%-17.6%] and 3 978 telephone survey participants (15.9% [14.6%-17.2%]. The cumulative risk increased with the number of infections, but reinfections were associated with three times lower risk of long COVID than first infections.

Pre-Omicron infections and severe acute COVID-19 episodes correlated with higher long COVID risk and severity. Among prevalent long COVID cases, 43% were moderate and 33% severe. Compared to controls, dyspnea, neurocognitive symptoms, post-exertional malaise and smell/taste disturbances were most strongly associated with long COVID. Cluster analysis identified seven symptom groups with systemic, neurocognitive, pulmonary, and mood-related clusters being the most prevalent. Severe long COVID cases exhibited multiple symptom clusters and greater functional limitations.

ConclusionsLong COVID is a common and disabling condition among HCWs. Societal and healthcare burden remains important and will continue to accrue given ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and long COVID risk with reinfections.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes the risk and severity of long COVID differ for first COVID-19 infections versus reinfections among healthcare workers in Quebec, Canada?

FindingsThe risk of long COVID was [~]15% with first COVID-19 infection, but three-fold lower with reinfections. Risk was higher with COVID-19 infections due to ancestral strains and with more severe acute episodes. Long COVID risk and severity compromised self-rated health, physical capacity and cognitive function.

MeaningLong COVID is a common and disabling condition among workers. Societal and healthcare burden remains important and will continue to accrue given ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and long COVID risk with reinfections.","NA","medrxiv",1747433365344

While exteroceptive stimuli, such as food and drugs of abuse, are well-established activators of DA-neuron activity, growing evidence indicates that interoceptive signals also play a critical role in modulating reward. Among these, the gut-brain vagal axis has emerged as a key pathway, yet its precise contribution to mesolimbic DA-dependent signaling, dynamics and behaviors remains poorly defined. Here, we combine complementary ex vivo and in vivo approaches across multiple scales to investigate how the gut-brain vagal axis regulates DA dynamics and reward-related behaviors. We show that gut-brain vagal tone is essential for gating mesolimbic DA system activity and functions, modulating DA-dependent molecular and cellular processes, and scaling both food- and drugs-induced reinforcement. These findings challenge the traditional brain-centric view of reward processing, supporting a more unified and integrated model in which gut-derived and vagus-mediated interoceptive signals are pivotal in intrinsically shaping motivation and reinforcement. By uncovering the influence of gut-brain vagal communication on mesolimbic DA functions, this work offers new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying both adaptive and maladaptive reward processes, with broad implications for eating disorders and addiction.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

However, efficient and lossless indexing of such structures remains challenging due to the scale and complexity of pangenomic data. We present a practical and scalable indexing framework based on tag arrays, which annotate positions in the Burrows--Wheeler transform (BWT) with graph coordinates. Our method extends the FM-index with a run-length compressed tag structure that enables efficient retrieval of all unique graph locations where a query pattern appears. We introduce a novel construction algorithm that combines unique k-mers, graph-based extensions, and haplotype traversal to compute the tag array in a memory-efficient manner. To support large genomes, we process each chromosome independently and then merge the results into a unified index using properties of the multi-string BWT and r-index. Our evaluation on the HPRC graphs demonstrates that the tag array structure compresses effectively, scales well with added haplotypes, and preserves accurate mapping information across diverse regions of the genome. This indexing method enables lossless and haplotype-aware querying in complex pangenomes and offers a practical indexing layer to develop scalable aligners and downstream graph-based analysis tools.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

However, the evolution of the cichlid axial skeleton has been largely overlooked, despite its high variation and functional significance for locomotion. Here, we present the first macroevolutionary study of axial morphology in African cichlids, based on phylogenetic comparative analyses of 4861 individuals from 583 species. Adaptation to demersal, pelagic, and piscivorous niches has led to the evolution of elongate bodies with high vertebral counts in lacustrine cichlids, emphasising the role of the fusiform body shape in ecological adaptation. However, riverine species occupy a broader axial morphospace than lacustrine species, which is partly explained by a higher stochastic rate of vertebral count evolution in riverine lineages. In addition, the occupied axial morphospace broadly correlates with the estimated age of the lacustrine radiations, suggesting that exploration of axial morphospace is a function of divergence time. However, rates of vertebral count evolution are not the same across the lake radiations. Therefore, accumulated variation in vertebral counts (and more broadly axial morphospace) is not solely a function of divergence time. Finally, we show that the common ancestor of African cichlids possessed a distinctly riverine axial morphology, indicating that the exploration of axial morphospace radiated outward from this ancestral riverine form. These findings highlight the importance of a comparative approach to studying cichlid evolution and underscore the value of African cichlids as a model for investigating the evolutionary and developmental dynamics of the teleostean vertebral column.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

It remains unclear how different sources of heterogeneity influence model performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, and whether all sessions contribute equally to downstream performance gains. In this work, we systematically investigate how data heterogeneity impacts the scaling behavior of neural data transformers (NDTs) in neural activity prediction. We found that explicit sources of heterogeneity, such as brain region mismatches among sessions, reduced scaling benefits of neuron- and region-level activity prediction performances. For tasks that do exhibit consistent scaling, we identified implicit data heterogeneity arising from cross-session variability. Through our proposed session-selection procedure, models pretrained on as few as five selected sessions outperformed those pretrained on the entire dataset of 84 sessions. Our findings challenge the direct applicability of traditional scaling laws to neural data and suggest that prior claims of multi-session scaling benefits may be premature. This work both highlights the importance of incremental data scaling analyses and suggests new avenues toward optimally selecting pretraining data when developing foundation models on large-scale neuroscience datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

We find that while some interactions are stable, such as those between the histone locus bodies and Cajal bodies, others are transient, such as those between PML bodies and Cajal bodies. Furthermore, interactions among MLOs are not random: functionally related MLOs interact more frequently than unrelated MLOs, and these interactions completely rewire when we inhibit transcription. Our study provides first glimpses into how different MLOs interact with each other under different conditions, and lays the foundation for future cellular engineering efforts that modulate MLOs interactome to treat diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

We tracked chromatin dynamics across seven orders of magnitude in time in both human and mouse cells and found strongly subdiffusive dynamics ( [~] 0.3). These dynamics are only mildly sensitive to perturbations of transcription, histone acetylation, and topoisomerase II, while loop extrusion has a constraining effect.

However, little is known about fellowship structure, curricula, and outcomes. This lack of transparency creates challenges for residents choosing programs, institutions developing new fellowships, and existing programs evaluating their outcomes.

MethodAuthors identified 28 United States-based surgical education fellowships and distributed a survey to representatives (directors or fellows) from each program evaluating program structure, educational opportunities, research infrastructure, teaching experiences, and mentorship. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics.

ResultsNineteen fellowship programs (68% response rate) participated. The majority of programs offered full funding (84%). Program length varied from 1 to 2 years, most commonly with one fellow per year. Few (16%) required completion of an advanced degree during the fellowship. The majority mandated teaching (84%) and simulation (89%) responsibilities, though time commitments varied. Most programs (84%) required fellows to attend national conferences. Over half (53%) had an Education PhD advisor within the department, and 63% provided free access to statisticians. Leadership structures varied, with 74% having a single fellowship director. Among directors, 80% were surgical specialists, while all non-surgical directors held Education PhDs. Dedicated faculty time equivalents for directors varied widely.

ConclusionsOur findings highlight significant heterogeneity across U.S. surgical education fellowships. Transparency about fellowship structures could improve prospective fellow decision-making and guide future program development. Further research should focus on the long-term outcomes of fellowship graduates and the impact of accreditation on fellowship success.","NA","medrxiv",1747433365344

Such data are hard to collect and the results are often sensitive to the definition of fitness used. Here, we present a new method for estimating VA that does not involve making measurements of fitness proxies on individuals, but instead tracks changes in the genetic composition of the population. First, we show that VA can readily be expressed as a function of the genome-wide diversity/linkage disequilibrium matrix and genome-wide expected change in allele frequency due to selection. We then show how independent experimental replicates can be used to infer the expected change in allele frequency due to selection and then estimate VA via a linear mixed model. Finally, using individual-based simulations, we demonstrate that our approach yields precise and unbiased estimates over a range of biologically plausible levels of VA.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

In 2023, external funding accounted for 21% of total TB expenditures, with the U.S. contributing over 55% of these funds. The withdrawal of U.S. support threatens essential TB services, including diagnostics, treatment, TB-HIV co-infection interventions, and research initiatives critical to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for TB eradication.

MethodsThis study analyses the dependency of 26 high-burden TB countries (HBCs) on U.S. funding and models the potential impact of funding cuts on TB incidence and mortality. Countries were classified into low (0-22%), moderate (23-37%), and high (>37%) dependency groups based on three-year expenditure data. A deterministic compartmental model simulated service disruptions under three recovery scenarios: (1) minimal impact (services recover within three months), (2) moderate impact (recovery within one year), and (3) worst-case scenario (permanent service reduction). Extrapolations were made for all 26 HBCs based on representative countries from each dependency category.

FindingsFunding cuts are projected to result in substantial increases in TB cases and deaths across the three scenarios. In a high-dependency country, cumulative TB cases could rise by 2.1% (CI 1.5 - 2.5), 5.4% (CI4 - 6.5), or 36% (CI 25 - 47), and TB deaths by 2.9%(CI 2.2 - 3.5), 7.8%(CI 5.9 - 9.2), 68%(CI 45 - 86), depending on the severity of service disruptions. Across all 26 HBCs, additional TB cases are estimated at 0.63 million (CI 0.45 - 0.81) (minimal impact), 1.66 million (CI 1.2 - 2.1) (moderate impact), and 10.67 million (CI 7.85 - 13.19) (worst-case). Corresponding TB deaths are projected to increase by 99,800 (CI 65,200-130,000), 268,600 (CI 185,800-337,900), and 2,243,700 (CI 1,570,800-2,807,300), respectively. The findings underscore the catastrophic consequences of the funding cut, particularly in countries highly reliant on U.S. support.

InterpretationThe loss of U.S. funding endangers global TB control, jeopardizing End TB and SDG targets. While some nations may adapt, short-term disruptions will severely impact vulnerable populations. Urgent alternative funding is needed to sustain TB prevention and treatment efforts and mitigate the effects of aid withdrawal.

Two of the most powerful social determinants are socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity; people with lower SES or marginalized race/ethnicity tend to experience earlier onset of aging-related diseases and have shorter lifespans. DNA methylation (DNAm) measures of biological aging, often referred to as ""epigenetic clocks"", are increasingly used to study the social determination of health. However, there are several generations of epigenetic clocks and it remains unclear which are most sensitive to social factors affecting health. Moreover, there is uncertainty about how technical factors, such as the tissue from which DNA is derived or the technology used to measure DNA methylation may affect associations of social determinants with epigenetic clocks. We conducted a pre-registered multi-level meta-analysis of 140 studies, including N = 65,919 participants, encompassing 1,065 effect sizes for associations of SES and racial/ethnic identity with three generations of epigenetic clocks. We found that associations were weakest for the first generation of epigenetic clocks developed to predict age differences between people. Associations were stronger for the second generation of epigenetic clocks developed to predict mortality and health risks. The strongest associations were observed for a third generation of epigenetic clocks, sometimes referred to as ""epigenetic speedometers"", developed to predict the pace of aging. In studies of children, only the speedometers showed significant associations with SES. Effects of sex and technical factors were minimal and there was no evidence of publication bias.","NA","medrxiv",1747433365344

Despite this, Microsporidia remain relatively enigmatic, with many aspects of their biology and evolution unexplored. Key questions include whether Microsporidia undergo sexual reproduction, and the nature of the relationship between tetraploid and diploid lineages. While few high-quality microsporidian genomes currently exist to help answer such questions, large-scale biodiversity genomics initiatives, such as the Darwin Tree of Life project, can generate high-quality genome assemblies for microsporidian parasites when sequencing infected host species. Here, we present 40 new microsporidian genome assemblies from infected arthropod hosts that were sequenced to create reference genomes. Out of the 40, 32 are complete genomes, eight of which are chromosome-level, and eight are partial microsporidian genomes. We characterised 14 of these as polyploid and five as diploid. We found that tetraploid genome haplotypes are consistent with autopolyploidy, in that they coalesce more recently than species, and that they likely recombine. Within some genomes, we found large-scale rearrangements between the homeologous genomes. We also observed a high rate of rearrangement between genomes from different microsporidian groups, and a striking tolerance for segmental duplications. Analysis of chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) data indicated that tetraploid genomes are likely organised into two diploid compartments, similar to dikaryotic cells in fungi, with evidence of recombination within and between compartments. Together, our results provide evidence for the existence of a sexual cycle in Microsporidia, and suggest a model for the microsporidian lifecycle that mirrors fungal reproduction.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

In plant research, unique challenges arise from the complexity of plant tissues, interference of secondary metabolites, and sometimes the low abundance of target proteins. Many conventional plant protein purification methods rely on expensive reagents, multi-step procedures, and labor-intensive workflows, limiting their feasibility for many applications. Here, we present the Catch & Release system, a cost-effective, fast and reliable one-step purification workflow for the isolation of soluble and membrane-bound proteins from plant tissues. The Catch & Release toolbox includes a vector set, a homemade GFP-trap and homemade proteases. Catch & Release vectors streamline cloning and transgenic plant selection through the Fluorescence-Accumulating Seed Technology (FAST), which marks positive transformants with a strongly fluorescing seed coat. Each plasmid consists of four, easy to exchange, modules: a plant promoter, a cloning dropout marker, protease cleavage sites, and seven different epitope tags, including an innovative dual-fluorescent tag, providing flexibility for diverse experimental needs. The in vivo functionality of all modules has been confirmed. Besides enabling standard molecular biological experimentation, our vector set in combination with homemade GFP-trap and proteases enables efficient and rapid isolation of soluble and high molecular weight membrane proteins directly from plants.

Recently, there has been excitement about the promise of advances in protein structure modeling to generate hypotheses about sequence-structure-function relationships based on successes with controlled benchmarks. Here, we leverage structural similarity to identify rapidly evolving proteasome assembly chaperones and characterize their function in the emerging fungal pathogen Candida auris. Despite the large sequence divergence, we demonstrate conservation of structure and function across hundreds of millions of years of evolution, representing a case of rapid neutral evolution. Using the functional constraints on structure from these naturally evolved sequences, we prospectively designed de novo chaperones and demonstrate that these artificial proteins can rescue complex biological processes in the context of the whole cell.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

Here, we describe a systematic screen for degrons in the human cytosol. We determine degron potency of >200,000 different 30-residue tiles from more than 5,000 cytosolic human proteins with 99.7% coverage. In total, 19.1% of the tiles function as strong degrons, 30.4% as intermediate degrons, while 50.5% did not display degron properties. The vast majority of the degrons are dependent on the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and the proteasome but independent of autophagy. The results reveal both known and novel degron motifs, both internal as well as at the C-terminus. Mapping the degrons onto protein structures, predicted by AlphaFold2, revealed that most of the degrons are located in buried regions, indicating that they only become active upon unfolding or misfolding. Training of a machine learning model allowed us to probe the degron properties further and predict the cellular abundance of missense variants that operate by forming degrons in exposed and disordered protein regions, thus providing a mechanism of pathogenicity for germline coding variants at such positions.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

Here, we utilized high-resolution spatial transcriptomics (ST) via the Xenium platform with a fully customized gene panel to elucidate disease-associated microglial subtypes in tandem with examining metabolic signatures across AD-relevant mouse models and well-characterized human postmortem tissue. Three mouse models were evaluated: PS19, APP/PS1, and 5xFAD. Analyzing anatomical features across entire hemisections, our approach resolved the distribution of five disease-associated microglial subtypes, while deciphering how proximity to cerebral amyloid plaques influenced transcriptional mediators governing metabolic pathways. We observed robust alterations in glycolytic and cholesterol/lipid processing pathways in plaque-associated microglia, consistent with a specific switch to glycolysis and lipid-fueled metabolism in the plaque niche. Extending our analysis to human postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), we identified conserved disease-reactive microglial states, i.e., similar proximity-dependent metabolic shifts around amyloid plaques. Further, integrating spatial transcriptomics with machine-learning approaches revealed novel anatomic domain-specific cellular gene expression profiling features, highlighting differential vulnerabilities of neuronal populations near specific microglial subtypes.

How durations are stored in working memory is unknown, despite the widely held view of memory systems central role in timing. Here, we investigated the neural signatures of a sequence of durations (n-item sequence) held in working memory. We recorded human participants using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while they performed an n-item delayed reproduction task, which required to encode a sequence of durations, maintain it, and then reproduce it. The number of items in a sequence (one or three) and the duration of the sequence were orthogonalized. Our results show that during working memory maintenance, the number of durations, not the duration of the sequence, affected recall precision and could be decoded from alpha and beta oscillatory activity. Parieto-occipital alpha power showed a direct link with the precision of temporal reproduction. Our results extend earlier behavioral findings suggesting that durations are itemized in working memory and that their number, not their duration, modulates recall precision (Herbst et al., 2025). Crucially, we establish that alpha power reflects a universal signature of working memory load and mediates recall precision, even for abstract information such as duration.

This phenomenon is traditionally attributed to the activity of its two Type III Secretion Systems (T3SS) and their associated effectors. A critical challenge for these bacteria is acquiring nutrients from inside the host cell. Thus, they modulate the metabolism of host cells to replicate. Given the metabolic plasticity of macrophages, a key unresolved question is how their metabolic heterogeneity shapes intracellular Salmonella replication. By using human primary macrophages and live-cell imaging to monitor bacterial dynamics at the single-cell level, we revealed that Salmonella does not replicate in all infected cells. However, supplementation with specific carbon sources used by Salmonella during infection accelerated bacterial replication and increased the proportion of macrophages showing replicative bacteria. Remarkably, this occurred even in the absence of functional T3SSs, as a {Delta}prgH/ssaV double mutant was able to replicate in a subset of infected cells under favorable nutrient conditions. These phenotypes are further amplified in macrophages with higher glycolytic activity, such as the murine RAW 264.7 cell line. Further analyses demonstrated that enhanced Salmonella replication is not strictly dependent on host glycolytic activity but is instead driven by the ability of the host cell to take up the nutrients Salmonella prefers for its replication early during infection. In summary, our findings suggest that the dependence of Salmonella on its T3SSs for intracellular replication can be bypassed when host cells provide optimal access to key nutrients and highlight the impact of metabolic heterogeneity in shaping intracellular bacterial replication during infection of macrophages.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

This phenomenon, termed fungal morphogenesis, is critical for fungi to survive and colonize diverse ecological niches and establish infections in a variety of hosts. Despite significant advancements in the field with respect to understanding the gene regulatory networks that control these transitions, the metabolic determinants of fungal morphogenesis remain poorly characterized. In this study, we uncover a previously uncharacterized, conserved dependency between central carbon metabolism and de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids that is critical for fungal morphogenesis, in two key fungal species. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrate that glycolytic flux is crucial to drive fungal morphogenesis and perturbation of this pathway leads to a significant downregulation in the expression of genes involved in de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids. Remarkably, exogenous supplementation of sulfur-containing amino acids (cysteine/methionine) or inorganic sulfate, robustly rescues the morphogenesis defect induced by the perturbation of glycolysis in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, underscoring the pivotal role of de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acid as a downstream effector of morphogenesis. Furthermore, a C. albicans mutant lacking the glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase (Pfk1) exhibited significantly reduced survival within murine macrophages and attenuated virulence in a murine model of systemic candidiasis. Overall, our research elucidates a previously uncharacterized coupling between glycolysis and sulfur metabolism that is critical for driving fungal morphogenesis, contributing to our understanding of this conserved phenomenon.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

KRAB zinc finger proteins (KZFPs), a large family of transcription factors specialized in TE recognition, are known repressors of TE-derived regulatory activity through TRIM28-mediated H3K9me3 deposition. Here, we expand this paradigm by uncovering noncanonical relationships between TEs and KZFPs. By generating a comprehensive epigenomic map of KZFP-bound TEs, we find that the regulatory activity of ancient mammalian L2/MIR elements is broadly delineated by KZFP binding patterns, despite low H3K9me3 enrichment. We further dissect this relationship by investigating the function of ZNF436, a non-canonical KZFP, highly expressed during in vivo human fetal heart development. Using loss-of-function approaches, we show that ZNF436 preserves cardiomyocyte function by promoting cardiac gene expression while restricting the activation of alternative lineage programs. Mechanistically, ZNF436 recruits specialized SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes to limit the accessibility of L2/MIR-derived enhancers, many of which are active in non-cardiac tissues. These findings reveal a noncanonical, TRIM28-independent role for KZFPs in shaping cell-type-specific regulatory landscapes and emphasize the importance of repressing alternative regulatory programs alongside activating lineage-specific ones to safeguard cell identity.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

Little is understood about the regulatory mechanisms of replication stress recovery, including the mechanisms involved in the restart of stalled replication forks. Here, we identify the oncogenic phosphatase PPM1D/WIP1 as a critical regulator of replication fork restart. Upon recovery from replication stress, PPM1D prevents excessive MRE11- and DNA2-dependent nucleolytic degradation of stalled forks. Loss of PPM1D function leads to defects in RAD51 recruitment to chromatin and impairs RAD51-dependent fork restart. Phosphoproteomic analysis reveals that PPM1D regulates a network of ATM substrates, several of which are phosphorylated at an S/T-Q-(E/D)n motif. Strikingly, inhibition of ATM suppresses the deleterious consequences of impaired PPM1D function at replication forks, enabling timely fork restart. The dominant effect of ATM hyper-signaling in suppressing fork restart occurs, in part, through the excessive engagement of 53BP1 and consequent RAD51 antagonization. These findings uncover a new mode of ATM signaling responding to fork stalling and highlights the need for PPM1D to restrain ATM signaling and enable proper fork restart.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

By integrating mathematical modeling, single-cell microfluidics, and time-resolved flow cytometry, we evaluate bacterial survival under heavy metal and {beta}-lactam antibiotic stress. Our results show that filamentation can improve survival by decreasing the surface area-to-volume ratio, which slows intracellular toxin accumulation and extends the time available for stress response activation or for external toxin levels to dissipate.

An obstacle to the development of new T cell receptor therapeutics is the difficulty in engineering these proteins for enhanced therapeutic efficacy while avoiding introduction of unexpected off-target autoreactivity. In this study, we apply a functional high-throughput screening assay, Tope-seq, to detecting cross-reactive epitopes in libraries of >5 x 105 unique peptide-coding sequences. We retrospectively analyze an affinity-enhanced engineered T cell receptor, which previously failed clinical trials due to severe off-target toxicity caused by epitope cross-reactivity, by comprehensive functional testing against all genome-coded self-antigens. Using the Tope-seq methodology, we were able to identify the epitope mediating off-target reactivity at a significance threshold of p < 0.01 in first-pass bulk screening. We also identified other potential cross-reactive epitopes of the engineered TCR of-interest, suggesting that the need for assessing promiscuity in TCR based therapeutics is larger than previously appreciated.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

Here, we apply energetic profiling to structural time series from cryo-EM datasets of IAPP, tau, and -synuclein to decode the principles governing fibril maturation, stability and polymorphic divergence. By mapping residue-level free energy contributions across experimentally resolved assembly pathways, we reconstruct the complex maturation trajectories of distinct amyloid systems. We find that amyloid assembly is driven by aggregation-prone regions that act as sequence-encoded stabilizing motifs. As assembly progresses, these motifs are reorganized and expanded, while additional regions introduce structural frustration that enables conformational flexibility. In several cases, environmental cofactors such as metal ions or polyanions are observed in association with regions of structural remodeling, where they may act to compensate for otherwise energetically strained conformations. Notably, structurally distinct polymorphs can exhibit similar energetic profiles, while polymorphs with similar folds may differ thermodynamically depending on their assembly environment. This framework connects polymorph structure to both encoded sequence features and extrinsic modifiers, offering mechanistic insight into how amyloid strains mature and diversify over time.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play an important role in limiting pathogen entry and colonization. Despite intensive research into the regulation and biochemical properties of AMPs, their exact significance in vivo has remained uncertain due to the challenges of mutating small genes. Fortunately, recent technologies have enabled the mutation of individual AMP genes, overcome previous obstacles, and opened new avenues for research. In this study, we characterized one novel host-defense peptide, Paillotin (IM18, CG33706), using loss-of-function mutants. Paillotin is an ancient host defense peptide of Diptera, regulated by the Imd pathway. Loss of Paillotin does not impact the activity of either the Imd or Toll pathways. Importantly, we found that Paillotin mutants are viable but exhibit increased susceptibility to specific infections, particularly Providencia burhodogranariea. Paillotin was further found to contribute synergistically to defense against P. burhodogranariea when combined with other AMPs. However, we did not detect direct microbicidal activity of Paillotin in vitro in our hands. Taken together, our findings identify Paillotin as a novel host defense peptide acting downstream of Imd signaling, advancing our understanding of the Drosophila antimicrobial response.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

Their physiological state is dynamic and impacted by abiotic and biotic conditions, responding to environmental fluctuations by changes in cellular metabolism, according to their genetic potential. Molecular, cellular and genomic approaches can identify and measure microbial responses and adaptation to environmental changes in native communities. However, isolating individual microbial cells that respond to specific changes for cultivation has been difficult. To address this, we developed a novel bacterial isolation approach (BONCAT-Live) by integrating bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) in diverse native communities, with isolation and cultivation of cells responding to specific stimuli, at different time scales. In frozen Arctic permafrost samples, we identified and isolated dormant bacteria that become active after thawing under native or nutrient enriched conditions. From a Populus tree rhizosphere, we isolated strains that thrive under high concentrations of root exudates that act as defense compounds and nutrients. In a human microbiome, we identified and isolated bacteria that rapidly proliferated when exposed to metabolites provided by the host or other co-occurring microbes. Further characterization of isolated bacterial strains will provide opportunities for in depth determination of how these microbes adapt to changes in their environments, individually and as part of model communities.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

These delineations deliver further benefit when they encompass assessments of population vulnerability to extinction from pressures such as climate change. However, delineations and vulnerability assessments are particularly difficult within highly diverse species, such as the salmonid fish Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), that show extensive phenotypic and genetic variation within and across locations, variable and complex life histories, and broad geographic distributions. As yet, the nature and scope of Arctic charr diversity has not been characterised at the scale needed to delineate key conservation units in Scotland. To identify evolutionarily significant and vulnerable populations to prioritise conservation needs, we conducted a genomic study of Arctic charr populations across Britain and Ireland with a focus on Scottish populations (N=64 populations; 24,878 SNPs; 410 individuals). We found that most lake populations represented distinct genetic clusters, with limited gene flow between them resulting in high levels of genetic differentiation. Higher level groupings of genetic similarity across catchments likely reflect historic anadromy and migration, with populations primarily grouping east or west of the central watershed divide in Scotland. Analysing genetic offset, also known as genomic vulnerability, we identified strong inverse correlations between genetic vulnerability with latitude and distance to the sea suggesting that more southern and more inland populations are more vulnerable to loss due to climate change. Additionally, patterns of vulnerability across several additional metrics identified further populations that may be at high vulnerability to loss. We further used our genetic data, along with phenotypic and geographic information, to identify populations of greatest evolutionary significance. This highlighted the most important ones to protect are those in locations with multiple ecotypes, a key facet of functional Arctic charr biodiversity, and populations that are the only ones in their Hydrometric Area.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1747433365344

To explore the molecular basis of this difference, we screened for missense mutations that are unique to modern humans and occur at high frequency and that alter post-translational sites. One such mutation was identified in DCHS1, a protocadherin family gene, and it was found to disrupt an N-glycosylation site in modern humans. Using CRISPR/Cas9-editing we introduced into human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) this ancestral DCHS1 variant present in Neanderthals and other primates, representing the ancestral state before the modern human-specific substitution. Leveraging hiPSCs-derived neural organoids, we observed an expansion of striatal progenitors at the expense of the neocortex, mirroring the anatomical distribution seen in non-human primates. We further identify the ephrin receptor EPHA4 as a binding partner of DCHS1 and show that modern human-specific alterations in DCHS1 modulate EPHA4-ephrin signalling, contributing to a gradual shift in the neocortex-to-striatum ratio - a hallmark of brain organisation in our species.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

Yet, these neural signatures are dissociable at the single-cell level: Specific cells within these visuo-oculomotor areas are exclusively involved in either motor preparation or covert attention. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that many cells in visuo-oculomotor areas are involved in both motor preparation and covert attention, and consequently their neural signatures should functionally overlap to a large degree. Here, we put this proposal to the test: we combined EEG with sensitive decoding techniques to investigate whether the neural signatures of preparatory overt and covert attention are dissociable across large-scale neuronal populations. We found that neural decoding reliably discerned whether overt or covert attention was shifted well before saccade initiation. Further, inverted encoding modeling revealed sharper spatially tuned activity in preparatory overt than in covert attention. We then asked whether preparatory overt attention achieved sharper spatially-tuned activity by using  more-of-the-same covert attention, or by recruiting additional spatially selective neural processing. Crossdecoding results demonstrated that preparatory overt attention recruited at least one additional, frontal process. This additional spatially selective process emerged early and likely reflects motor preparation or predictive remapping. To summarize, we found that the neural signatures of overt and covert attention overlap, yet diverge rapidly, in part because overt attention employs an additional spatially selective neural process. Extending beyond a dissociation on the single-cell level, our findings demonstrate that population-level neural activity dissociates preparatory overt from covert attention.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

In coral reefs, dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by benthic primary producers such as algae fuels heterotrophic microbial growth, which can be detrimental to corals. While this microbialization process has been associated with the abundance and replication strategies of bacteriophages, the direct relationship between reef DOM composition and bacteriophage communities remains unclear. Here, we combine metabolomics, metagenomes, and viromes to demonstrate that phage abundances have significant relationships with DOM composition on the reefs of Curacao, Southern Caribbean. By constructing co-occurrence networks between free or cell-associated viruses and exometabolites, we identified thousands of statistically significant associations between phages and organic compounds. While total viral abundances did not significantly correlate with overall dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, cell-associated phages had significantly more positive associations with compounds that had a reduced nominal oxidative state of carbon (NOSC). Furthermore, temperate phages were more frequently correlated with metabolites exhibiting higher Gibbs energy than lytic phages. Six of the ten viruses with the highest number of positive associations with metabolites were temperate (i.e., encoded an integrase or were identified as a prophage), despite this network consisting of approximately 90% lytic viruses. These temperate viruses were predicted to infect members of the genus Sphingobium. Together, these findings reveal a connection between phage replication strategies and DOM energy availability with potential implications for coral reef biogeochemistry.

SignificanceCoral reefs are highly dynamic ecosystems where microbial communities and organic matter cycles are intricately linked. This study provides new insights into how bacteriophages interact with dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition, revealing that cell-associated bacteriophages, particularly temperate phages, are associated with more energy-rich organic compounds. These findings suggest that DOM may have a bottom-up influence on the lysis-lysogeny decision of temperate phages infecting their host or that lysogeny may play an underappreciated role in shaping the reef carbon cycle. Energy-rich organic compounds have generally been associated with increased algal abundances and coral decline. By demonstrating significant connections between viral infection strategies and the energy content of DOM, our results highlight the potential for phages to influence coral reef biogeochemistry and health.","NA","biorxiv",1747433365344

Here, we quantify the nonlinear, flow-dependent resistance of ETTs with and without a bronchoscope by analyzing pressure-flow relationships across multiple tube-bronchoscope configurations. We find that with bronchoscope insertion, tube resistance increases with the inverse fifth power of the effective tube diameter, defined as the diameter of a circular tube with the same cross-sectional area as the remaining lumen. Using an intensive care ventilator in combination with an active lung simulator, we demonstrate that the increased resistance during bronchoscopy causes dynamic hyperinflation and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) buildup in volume-controlled modes, and reduced tidal volumes in pressure-controlled modes. Numerical simulations using a simple scaling law relating resistance to effective tube diameter accurately reproduce the observed impairments. This demonstrates that the impact of tube narrowing during bronchoscopy can be reliably predicted from ventilator settings and patient respiratory mechanics. We present a predictive model that allows clinicians to anticipate and manage ventilation impairments, supporting evidence-based selection of endotracheal tubes and bronchoscopes. In addition, we provide proof of principle that combining pressure-controlled ventilation with automatic tube compensation can fully prevent these impairments, pointing to a technically feasible solution to an underrecognized clinical problem.","NA","medrxiv",1747433365344

Sex and gender mandates were introduced in grant competitions to increase womens health research. This study aimed to understand what type of womens health research is being funded and prioritized in open grant competitions in Canada.

MethodsPublicly available funded Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) project grant abstracts from 2020 and 2023 were coded for the mention of sex, gender, two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer plus (2S/LGBTQ+), and female-specific research and assessed for changes in research representation and funding. A deeper analysis of funded female-specific grant abstracts from 2023 and 2009-2020 was conducted to assess if grant abstracts focused on the 11 areas of global disease burden and death that disproportionately affect females, and if this has evolved over time.

ResultsThe percentage of abstracts mentioning sex, gender and 2S/LGBTQ+ doubled or quadrupled from 2020 to 2023, but remained at under 10% of overall funded abstracts. In contrast, female-specific research representation did not change over time, and remained at [~]7% of all research. Importantly, female-specific research largely focused on cancers (breast, gynecologic) or pregnancy. We also examined research funding representation for the top 11 global burden of disease or death for females across the 13 years and observed that cancer accounted for 2.07% of funding, whereas the other top 10 collectively accounted for 2.21% across 13 years.

ConclusionsDespite mandates for integrated sex and gender based analyses in Canada, research acknowledging which population is explored remains under 10%. Mandates are not affecting the percentage of funding for womens health grants. More efforts and support beyond sex and gender mandates are needed to increase funding for and to diversify female-specific research beyond pregnancy and cancer. Research devoted to womens health factors is key to achieving personalized medicine and improved health outcomes for everyone.","NA","medrxiv",1747433365344
