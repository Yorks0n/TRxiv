We observed a pH-dependent survival of the virus, with infectious virus persisting throughout the cheese making process and for up to 60 days of aging in the pH 6.6 and 5.8 cheese groups. Whereas at pH 5.0, the virus did not survive the cheese making process. These findings were validated using the commercial raw milk cheese samples in which infectious virus was detected for up to 60 days of aging. Our study highlights the potential public health risks of consuming raw milk cheese, underscoring the need for additional mitigation steps in cheese production to prevent human exposure to infectious virus.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911919

To address this challenge, we developed the Evidence Aggregator (EvAgg), a generative AI tool designed for rare disease diagnosis that systematically extracts relevant information from the scientific literature for any human gene. EvAgg provides a thorough and current summary of observed genetic variants and their associated clinical features, enabling rapid synthesis of evidence concerning gene-disease relationships. EvAgg demonstrates strong benchmark performance, achieving 97% recall in identifying relevant papers, 92% recall in detecting instances of genetic variation within those papers, and ~80% accuracy in extracting individual case and variant-level content (e.g. zygosity, inheritance, variant type, and phenotype). Further, EvAgg complemented the process of manual literature review by identifying a substantial number of additional relevant pieces of information. When tested with analysts in rare disease case analysis, EvAgg reduced review time by 34% (p-value < 0.002) and increased the number of papers, variants, and cases evaluated per unit time. These savings have the potential to reduce diagnostic latency and increase solve rates for challenging rare disease cases.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911919

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1742162911919

Here, we developed SONAR (Sensing Of Nucleic acids using ASOs and Reverse-transcriptases), a platform that enables the detection of target DNA and RNA sequences and triggers controlled gene expression in human cells. SONAR operates through circularizable single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) sensors that, upon hybridization with complementary DNA or reverse-transcribed RNA, undergoes target-dependent ligation via endogenous ligases, subsequently driving expression of genetic payloads. For RNA sensing, we employed chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to prime targeted reverse transcription, generating complementary DNA that promotes ssDNA circularization. We demonstrate SONAR ability to detect DNA, exogenous and endogenous RNA transcripts, coupled with a programmable expression of diverse protein payloads, including reporters, recombinases, and genome editors. This platform establishes a versatile framework for targeted nucleic acid detection and inducible gene expression, with broad applications in diagnostics, therapeutics, and synthetic biology.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911919

However, traditional fish models, such as zebrafish, regenerate only dermal fin rays, which are neither homologous to limbs nor as cellularly complex. To address this, we employed a multi-omics approach leveraging the regenerative capacity of Polypterus senegalus, a fish species capable of full fin regeneration. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing revealed extensive erythrocyte and myeloid cell infiltration during Polypterus fin regeneration. Spatial transcriptomics identified key cellular contributors to the blastema, while cross-species comparisons with axolotl limbs uncovered both common and divergent expression patterns of wound epidermis and blastema markers. Fin amputation triggered a conserved injury response, including sequential activation of pro- and anti-inflammatory programs and DNA damage repair in cycling cells. Hypoxia responses involved hif1a modulation, consistent with other regenerative models, but uniquely included the expression of hif4a in erythrocytes and the upregulation of a myoglobin gene in the wound epidermis. Furthermore, genome-wide chromatin profiling identified candidate regeneration-responsive elements. Together, these findings establish Polypterus as a powerful comparative model for identifying shared and derived mechanisms of limb and fin regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911919

PRC2 deposits the repressive chromatin mark H3 lysine 27 tri-methyl (H3K27me3) through a read-write loop that involves direct interactions between PRC2 and H3K27me3. According to current models, the PRC2-H3K27me3 read-write loop is initiated by the PRC2 subunits JARID2 and PALI1 that mimic H3K27me3. However, it is unknown what restricts the PRC2-H3K27me3 read-write loop from spreading H3K27me3 indefinitely. To answer this question, we generated mutant mice where PRC2 subunits cannot mimic H3K27me3. Unexpectedly, the mutations led to a homeotic transformation characteristic of a Polycomb gain-of-function in vivo and the spread of H3K27me3 beyond Polycomb domains in stem cells. Collectively, we show that H3K27me3 mimicry evolved to compete against the PRC2-H3K27me3 read-write loop in a process that restrains PRC2 and restricts the spread of Polycomb domains.

Current chemical-based treatments target cells by inhibiting growth or metabolic function, but their effectiveness is diminishing. To address the growing antimicrobial resistance crisis, there is an urgent need for innovative therapies. Conjugative plasmids, a natural mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, have been repurposed to deliver toxic genetic cargo to recipient cells, showing promise as next-generation antimicrobial agents. However, the ecological risks posed by unintended gene transfer require robust biocontainment strategies. In this study, we developed inducible conjugative plasmids to solve these challenges. Utilizing an arabinose-inducible promoter, we evaluated 13 plasmids with single essential gene deletions, identifying trbC and trbF as strong candidates for stringent regulation. These plasmids demonstrated inducibility in both cis and trans configurations, with induction resulting in up to a 5-log increase in conjugation efficiency compared to uninduced conditions. Although challenges such as reduced conjugation efficiency and promoter leakiness persist, this work establishes a foundation for the controlled transfer of plasmids, paving the way for safer and more effective antimicrobial technologies.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

The disease is caused by the self-templated misfolding of the prion protein (PrP) into toxic species, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration and death. We evaluated a novel epigenetic regulation approach using Zinc Finger Repressors (ZFRs) to ablate PrP expression at the transcriptional level. When delivered using adeno-associated virus (AAV), ZFRs potently and specifically reduced prion mRNA expression by >95% in vitro and to near undetectable levels within single neurons in vivo. In wildtype mice, ZFRs stably lowered neuronal PrP expression throughout the central nervous system for at least 17 months. In mice inoculated with misfolded PrP, AAV-ZFRs given at either early or late disease stages profoundly extended lifespan, significantly reduced PrP in the brain, and improved an array of molecular, histological, biomarker, and behavioral readouts. Finally, we delivered a ZFR targeting the human prion gene (PRNP) to cynomolgus monkeys using a novel blood-brain-barrier penetrant AAV capsid. Extensive bulk and single-cell assessments revealed widespread ZFR expression and PRNP repression in all 35 brain regions assessed, providing the first demonstration of epigenetic regulation across the nonhuman primate neuraxis following a single intravenous (IV) dose. These results highlight the potential of a one-time IV administered ZFR treatment for prion disease and other neurological disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

In 2023, external funding accounted for 21% of total TB expenditures, with the U.S. contributing over 55% of these funds. The withdrawal of U.S. support threatens essential TB services, including diagnostics, treatment, TB-HIV co-infection interventions, and research initiatives critical to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for TB eradication.

MethodsThis study analyses the dependency of 26 high-burden TB countries (HBCs) on U.S. funding and models the potential impact of funding cuts on TB incidence and mortality. Countries were classified into low (0-22%), moderate (23-37%), and high (>37%) dependency groups based on three-year expenditure data. A deterministic compartmental model simulated service disruptions under three recovery scenarios: (1) minimal impact (services recover within three months), (2) moderate impact (recovery within one year), and (3) worst-case scenario (permanent service reduction). Extrapolations were made for all 26 HBCs based on representative countries from each dependency category.

FindingsFunding cuts are projected to result in substantial increases in TB cases and deaths across the three scenarios. In a high-dependency country, cumulative TB cases could rise by 2.1% (CI 1.5 - 2.5), 5.4% (CI4 - 6.5), or 36% (CI 25 - 47), and TB deaths by 2.9%(CI 2.2 - 3.5), 7.8%(CI 5.9 - 9.2), 68%(CI 45 - 86), depending on the severity of service disruptions. Across all 26 HBCs, additional TB cases are estimated at 0.63 million (CI 0.45 - 0.81) (minimal impact), 1.66 million (CI 1.2 - 2.1) (moderate impact), and 10.67 million (CI 7.85 - 13.19) (worst-case). Corresponding TB deaths are projected to increase by 99,800 (CI 65,200-130,000), 268,600 (CI 185,800-337,900), and 2,243,700 (CI 1,570,800-2,807,300), respectively. The findings underscore the catastrophic consequences of the funding cut, particularly in countries highly reliant on U.S. support.

InterpretationThe loss of U.S. funding endangers global TB control, jeopardizing End TB and SDG targets. While some nations may adapt, short-term disruptions will severely impact vulnerable populations. Urgent alternative funding is needed to sustain TB prevention and treatment efforts and mitigate the effects of aid withdrawal.

Using the mdx mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, we developed innovative live-imaging of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) in vivo, and ex vivo on isolated myofibres. We show that mdx MuSCs have impaired migration and precocious differentiation through unbalanced symmetric divisions, driven by p38 and PI3K signalling pathways, in contrast to the p38-only dependence of healthy MuSCs. Cross-grafting shows that MuSC fate decisions are governed by intrinsic cues, whereas their migration behaviour is determined by the extracellular niche.

However, these studies hardly encompass cartilaginous fishes deeply isolated from the rest of vertebrates, which hinders the comprehensive view of vertebrate sex determination. Here, we produced chromosome-scale genome assemblies of egg-laying shark species and comparatively investigated genome sequences and transcriptome profiles across diverse cartilaginous fishes. Sex chromosome identification, supported by cytogenetic experiments, elucidated the homology of X chromosomes between sharks and rays as well as an extensively degenerating Y chromosome harboring no male-specific genes. These sex chromosomes scarcely included orthologs of previously documented sex determining genes. Transcriptomic analyses combined with histology of embryonic gonads revealed female-biased expressions of X-linked genes including those implicated in TGF-{beta} and IGF signaling pathways, which are attributed to their incomplete dosage compensation. Our findings indicate that sharks and rays share the oldest vertebrate sex chromosomes that originated around 300 million years ago and the dosage-dependent sex determination mechanism comprised of distinct molecules from other vertebrates. This study highlights the antiquity of sex chromosomes and uniqueness of sex determination mechanisms in sharks and rays, which advance our understanding on evolutionary plasticity of vertebrate sex determination.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

Plants have evolved a complex set of cell-cycle genes with unique features. The high number of cyclin-CDK pairs in flowering plants complicates functional studies due to redundancy and diversification. It is critical to study simple systems in other plant lineages to better understand the functional integration of the cell-cycle control machinery and its evolution across land plants.

Through a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, we show that non-seed plants possess a simple repertoire of cyclin and CDK proteins, suggesting that the observed complexity in seed plants is a derived trait. The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha possess a streamlined set of core cell cycle genes with minimal redundancy during vegetative development. Using single-cell RNA-seq and fluorescent reporters, we found a precise, phase-specific pattern of expression for cell cycle genes. We demonstrated in vivo that only three cyclins are active, one at a given phase, without redundancy. Functional analyses revealed that MpCYCD;1 promotes cell cycle re-entry and disrupts differentiation, while overexpression of MpCYCA or MpCYCB;1 arrests the cell cycle, consistent with their respective roles at G1, S, and G2/M progression.

Our findings highlight the functional conservation of mechanisms for cell-cycle control across eukaryotes and provide insights into its ancestral state, revealing a minimal set of functional components required for multicellular development. This study advances our understanding of fundamental aspects of cell-cycle regulation and opens new possibilities for engineering plant growth.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

Here, we elucidate the functional interplay between ParA and ParB in the model bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. We demonstrate that the N-terminal ParA-binding motif of ParB associates with a conserved bipartite binding pocket at the ParA dimer interface, in a manner dependent on ParB clamp closure. Moreover, we show that ParB and non-specific DNA interact cooperatively with ParA and synergistically induce structural changes at its Walker A and Walker B motifs that correlate with the activation of ParA ATPase activity.

Here, we use subcellular proteomics approaches to map acute insulin-stimulated protein in adipocytes on a cell-wide scale. These data revealed extensive insulin-regulated protein redistribution, with hundreds of novel insulin-responsive proteins. These included the uncharacterised protein C3ORF18, which redistributed to the PM in response to insulin.

This study used the model bryophyte Physcomitrium patens to uncover such genes and employed CRISPR-based screening to identify novel cell division genes in plants.
C_LIO_LICo-expression data from known mitotic genes were used to create a pool of 216 candidate genes, which were then targeted in CRISPR/Cas9 screening. Frameshift mutants with division defects were characterized using high-resolution imaging of mitosis and gene tagging with fluorophores for localization analysis.
C_LIO_LIThree novel gene families--CYR (Cytokinesis-Related), LACH (Lagging Chromosome), and SpinMi (Spindle and Phragmoplast Midzone)--were identified. CYR genes were linked to cytokinesis defects, LACH was essential for chromosome segregation, and SpinMi localized to the spindle and phragmoplast midzone. Notably, none of these gene families had homologs in algae, suggesting their emergence during land colonization.
C_LIO_LIOur findings provide a framework for combining co-expression analysis with targeted screening to identify genes associated with specific cellular processes, in this case, cell division. Beyond characterizing three novel gene families, this study also offers insights into evolutionary changes in the plant cell division machinery.

We gathered two diverse pretraining datasets: one consisting of 19,551 reference genomes, including over 18,000 prokaryotic genomes (115B nucleotides), and another more balanced dataset with 1,354 genomes, including 1,166 prokaryotic and 188 eukaryotic reference genomes (180B nucleotides).

We introduce seqLens, a family of models based on disentangled attention with relative positional encoding, which outperforms state-of-the-art models in 13 of 19 benchmarking phenotypic predictions. We further explore continual pretraining, domain adaptation, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to assess trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy.

Oral administration of anle138b delayed deposition of mHTT inclusions, reduced brain atrophy, mitigated neuroinflammation, improved motor function and extended life span in HD mice. Downregulation of striatal markers and synapse loss in striatal spiny projection neurons were also partially rescued. No adverse effects of anle138b were observed in wildtype animals. Moreover, anle138b markedly decreased mHTT aggregation in human neural precursor cells differentiated from HD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).

Nuclear RNAs (nucRNAs) have been proposed to be important regulators of such changes; however, the type, abundance, and functions of nucRNAs during neurodifferentiation remain largely unexplored. Here, we integrate multi-omic data generated in the frame of the Functional ANnoTation Of the Mammalian genome (FANTOM6) to chart 3D genome, RNA-DNA contactome, and transcriptome changes during in vitro differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells to neural stem cells and neurons. We find that most RNA-DNA contacts form between transcripts and their source gene; however, a group of intronic RNAs engages in chromatin contacts with distal loci on the same or on different chromosomes. We detect such trans-contacting intronic RNAs (TIRs) in all cell types profiled by FANTOM6, but most prominently in neurons, where TIRs are produced from highly expressed, neuron-specific, long (mean length: 400 kilobases, kb) protein-coding genes. In neurons, TIRs accumulate in the nucleus forming large clouds around their source loci, and they occasionally spread across the nucleus. TIRs engage in local and distal contacts with a set of genomic regions (named TIR-contacted regions or TIRCs) carrying much shorter (mean length: 30 kb) neuron-specific genes that become upregulated and move towards the nuclear center during neurodifferentiation, forming high-connectivity hubs. TIR source genes, and especially their introns, are strongly enriched in risk loci for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Notably, knockdown of a single TIR by antisense oligonucleotides leads to downregulation of multiple genes implicated in NDDs and of source genes of most other TIRs. We propose that TIRs orchestrate cell type-specific gene expression during neurodifferentiation and might be pathogenically linked to NDDs.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

How the molecular architecture of the yeast seipin complex and its interaction with regulatory proteins adapt to different metabolic conditions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that multiple Ldb16 regions contribute differently to recruiting Ldo45 and Ldo16 to the seipin complex. Using an in-vivo site-specific photo-crosslinking approach, we further show that Ldo45 resides at the center of the seipin ring both in the absence and presence of neutral lipids. Interestingly, neutral lipid synthesis leads to the recruitment of Ldo45 but not Ldo16 to the complex. Our findings suggest that the seipin complex serves as a pre-assembled scaffold for lipid storage that can be remodeled in response to increased neutral lipid availability.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

We found that the first sound excitatory response recruits, via NMDA receptors, local inhibition to gate the second response via GABAB receptors. Optogenetic inhibition of somatostatine-interneurons counteracted gating more effectively compared to parvalbumine-positive interneurons. Dopamine local blockade also counteracted gating, and dopamine effect was prevented by somatostatine-, but not parvalbumine-, optoactivation.

Recently, powerful methods have emerged that leverage third-generation sequencing to map protein-DNA interactions genome-wide. For example, Directed Methylation with Long-read sequencing (DiMeLo-seq) enables mapping of protein-DNA interactions along long, single chromatin fibers, including in highly repetitive genomic regions. However, DiMeLo-seq involves lossy centrifugation-based wash steps that limit its applicability to many sample types. To address this, we developed DiMeLo-cito, a single-tube, wash-free protocol that maximizes the yield and quality of genomic DNA obtained for long-read sequencing. This protocol enables the interrogation of genome-wide protein binding with as few as 100,000 cells and without the requirement of a nuclear envelope, enabling confident measurement of protein-DNA interactions during mitosis.

In this study, we present a deep learning-based method for automatically removing corrupted tilts. We evaluated 13 different neural network architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers. Using a dataset of 435 annotated tilt series, we trained models for both binary and multiclass classification of corrupted tilts.

This uncertainty poses a difficult challenge for adaptive decision making, as failing to preserve relevant information can prevent us from making good choices later on. One solution to this challenge is to store detailed memories of individual experiences that can be flexibly accessed whenever their details become relevant. By allowing us to store and recall specific events in vivid detail, the human episodic memory system provides exactly this capacity. Yet whether and how this ability supports adaptive behavior is poorly understood. Here we aimed to determine whether people use detailed episodic memories to make decisions when future task demands are uncertain. We hypothesized that the episodic memory system's ability to store events in great detail allows us to reference any of these details if they later become relevant. We tested this hypothesis using a novel decision making task where participants encoded individual events with multiple features and later made decisions based on these features to maximize their earnings. Across four experiments (total n = 472), we found that participants referenced episodic memories during decisions in feature-rich environments, and that they did so specifically when it was unclear at encoding which features would be needed in the future. Overall, these findings reveal a fundamental adaptive function of episodic memory, showing how its rich representational capacity enables flexible decision making under uncertainty.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

While peptides presented to CD4+ T cells via major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) are traditionally thought to be derived from extracellular sources that are processed by antigen presenting cells (APCs) through the classical exogenous pathway4,5, the precise mechanisms of mRNA-LNP vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell priming remain unknown. Here, we investigated the role of alternative, endogenous antigen presentation pathways6,7 in inducing CD4+ T cell responses to mRNA-LNP vaccines. APCs treated with mRNA-LNP vaccines were consistently superior in activating T cells under conditions of endogenous, rather than exogenous, presentation. Immunization with an mRNA-LNP vaccine that excludes antigen expression in APCs resulted in lower antigen-specific CD4+ T cell, T follicular helper cell, and antibody responses than mice receiving control vaccine. In contrast, depletion of vaccine antigen from exogenous sources such as muscle cells resulted in little to no reduction in antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. Our findings demonstrate that direct presentation of endogenous antigen on MHC II is crucial to mRNA-LNP vaccine-induced immune responses and adds to a growing body of literature that redefines the paradigm of MHC II-restricted antigen processing and presentation.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

These morphologies, characterised by a high topological genus, can be visualised as spherical double membranes connected by neck-like structures. The necks are often occupied by specific biomolecular complexes, such as the nuclear pore complex, which divide the space into three distinct compartments. Understanding how the size of these necks responds to pressure gradients is fundamentally important for unravelling the influence of mechanical stimuli on traffic control through the necks, for example, in nuclear mechanosensing. In this work, we use computer simulations and theoretical analysis to investigate how neck size responds to variations in pressure or tension. Our findings reveal a two-phase behaviour: below a certain threshold, necks constrict as the pressure gradient increases, while above that threshold, they dilate. This response stems from the pure membrane's mechanics and depends on the magnitude of the pressure gradient, the initial diameter of the neck and the membrane bending rigidity. We also provide a simple equation that links the threshold tension, the neck diameter and the bending rigidity, offering a useful tool to quickly assess different scenarios. Our results furthermore show that protein complexes in the neck partially counteract both constriction and dilation, stabilising neck size while preserving the same two-phase response to membrane tension. These findings uncover a novel, previously overlooked membrane property with implications for organelle shape and function.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

Using a large-scale human electroencephalography (EEG) dataset (n=10, 82,160 trials), we investigate whether this discrepancy arises because human neural EEG signals predominantly reflect scene segmentation processes rather than high-level, category-specific object representations. We trained DCNNs to perform object recognition using visual diets (~1 million training images across 292 object categories) with systematically varying scene segmentation demands: objects-only (pre-segmented), background-silhouette (explicit boundaries), original/background-only images (requiring full segmentation). Despite substantial differences in categorization accuracy (27-53%), all trained models showed remarkably uniform encoding performance, with peak correlations with neural data at ~0.1s post-stimulus. Layer-wise analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between categorization accuracy and encoding performance, with earlier network layers better predicting EEG responses than deeper layers specialized for object categorization. This dissociation suggests that EEG signals primarily reflect fundamental scene parsing mechanisms rather than object-specific representations, explaining the growing discrepancy between DCNNs increasing categorization performance but deteriorating neural prediction performance.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

With the importance of the loop length established, here we evaluated the impact of disrupting the FCS, but preserving the S1/S2 loop length. Using reverse genetics, we generated a SARS-CoV-2 mutant that disrupts the FCS (PQQAR) but maintains its extended S1/S2 loop. The SARS-CoV-2 PQQAR mutant has reduced replication, decreased spike processing, and attenuated disease in vivo compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2.

We hypothesized that narrative insight accompanies retrieving causally related past events in memory and updating the current event representation. To test this, we designed an fMRI study in which participants watched a TV episode that was cut into multiple events and presented in temporally scrambled orders. Participants pressed an ""aha"" button whenever they understood something new and verbally explained why they pressed in those moments at the end of each run. Supporting our prediction, more than 40% of insights included the retrieval of past events that were causally related to the current event. Neural patterns representing causally related past events were reinstated in cortical areas. This neural reinstatement drove sudden shifts in cortical representation patterns ~2 s prior to aha button presses, reflecting an update in situational representation at moments of insight. Moreover, distributed areas in the brain represented causally related events with similar neural patterns, beyond their shared semantic or perceptual features. Together, the study suggests that we comprehend events by reinstating causally related past events via shared neural patterns, followed by updating neural patterns at moments of insight.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

These processes vary widely across cell types and differ depending on the nature and structure of the vector, whether it is a lipid nanoparticle or a different synthetic material. We developed a novel genome-wide CRISPR screening strategy to better understand these limitations within human cells to identify genes modulating cellular uptake, payload delivery, and gene editing efficiency. Our screen interrogates the cellular processes controlling genome editing by Cas-based nuclease and base editing strategies in human cells. We designed a genome-wide screen targeting 19,114 genes in HEK293 cells, and we identified six genes whose knockout increased nonviral editing efficiency in human cells by up to five-fold. Further validation through arrayed knockouts of the top hits from our screen boosted the editing efficiency from 5% to 50% when Cas9 was delivered via lipid-based nanoparticles. By designing the guides to target the screen library cassette, we could accurately track the library sgRNA identity and the editing outcome on the same amplicon via short-read sequencing, enabling the identification of rare outcomes via computationally sorting edited from unedited cells within a heterogenous pool of >200M cells. In patient-derived human retinal pigment epithelium cells derived from pluripotent stem cells, BET1L, GJB2, and MS4A13 gene knockouts increased targeted genome editing by over five-fold.

In acute and chronic viral infections, early activation and expansion of CD28A210P CD8 effector T cells increased, with accelerated exhaustion in chronic infection. Mechanistically, CD28A210P enhanced JunB, IL-2, and inhibitory receptors driven by MEK1/2. Generation of CD28A210P stem-like progenitor (Tpex) cells was enhanced in acute and chronic infections, and further expanded by PD-L1 blockade in chronically-infected mice. Thus, humanized PYAP mice reveal key roles for CD28 signaling strength in CD8 activation, accelerating exhaustion during antigen persistence, while promoting and sustaining Tpex during acute and chronic viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

Polyploidy plays a critical role during tissue development, following acute stress, and during disease progression. Common methods to reveal polyploidy involve either destroying tissue architecture by cell isolation or by tedious identification of individual nuclei in intact tissue. Therefore, there is a critical need for rapid and high-throughput ploidy quantification using images of nuclei in intact tissues. Here, we present iSPy (Inferring Spatial Ploidy), a new unsupervised learning pipeline that is designed to create a spatial map of nuclear ploidy across a tissue of interest. We demonstrate the use of iSPy in Arabidopsis, Drosophila, and human tissue. iSPy can be adapted for a variety of tissue preparations, including whole mount and sectioned. This high-throughput pipeline will facilitate rapid and sensitive identification of nuclear ploidy in diverse biological contexts and organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

However, the pulvinar has a large tissue volume, multiple subnuclei, and widespread cortical connections. It remains unknown whether electrical stimulation of distinct pulvinar subregions affects the temporal, occipital, and parietal areas differently. To address this gap, we delivered single-pulse electrical stimulation to the pulvinar and measured the resulting brain stimulation evoked potentials in twelve patients undergoing stereotactic EEG for drug-resistant epilepsy. Brain stimulation evoked potentials were parameterized across the occipital, temporal and parietal cortex. Stimulation of the lateral pulvinar elicited significant brain stimulation evoked potentials in striate and extrastriate areas that diminish as stimulation shifts towards the medial pulvinar. Conversely, stimulation of the ventral aspect of the medial pulvinar produced significant lateral temporal evoked potentials, which diminish with lateral pulvinar stimulation. We also found that stimulation of the dorsomedial pulvinar evoked significant parietal responses with limited striate/extrastriate and lateral temporal responses. These results demonstrate that electrical stimulation of specific pulvinar subregions influences distinct occipital, parietal and lateral temporal areas. Selective targeting of pulvinar subregions to maximize seizure network engagement may be essential for individualized treatment of posterior quadrant and temporal epilepsies.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

This process depends at least in part on plasticity in visual cortex (Widmer et al., 2022). Key signals involved in driving this plasticity are visuomotor prediction errors (Keller et al., 2012; Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018). Ideally however, the amount of plasticity induced by an error signal should be a function of several variables - including overall cortical prediction error, the animals experience in the current environment or task, stability of the current environment, and task engagement - for optimal computational performance. Candidates for regulators of visuomotor prediction error driven plasticity are the three major neuromodulatory systems that innervate visual cortex in the mouse: acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and serotonin. While visuomotor mismatch acutely triggers activity in noradrenaline (Jordan and Keller, 2023) but not acetylcholine (Yogesh and Keller, 2023) axons in visual cortex, how serotonergic axons in cortex respond to visuomotor mismatch is unknown. The serotonergic system in particular, is an interesting candidate for regulating visuomotor plasticity, as its activity is correlated with action-outcome uncertainty in mice (Grossman et al., 2020), and is increased under conditions of higher visuomotor gain in larval zebra fish (Kawashima et al., 2016). Here, we characterized the activity of serotonergic axons in visual cortex (V1) and in area A24b, a motor cortical area in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), of awake head-fixed mice using two-photon calcium imaging. Our results reveal cortical region-specific responses to visuomotor stimuli in serotonergic axons, but no evidence of a response to visuomotor mismatch. However, average activity in serotonergic axons was increased under conditions of greater visuomotor uncertainty. Thus, serotonin could function to regulate visuomotor plasticity as a function of the predictability of the environment on longer time scales.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

Rapidly proliferating cells require large amounts of nucleotides, making nucleotide metabolism a widely exploited target for cancer therapy. However, resistance frequently emerges, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of nucleotide regulation. Here, we harness uridine salvage and CRISPR-Cas9 screening to reveal regulators of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. We identify several factors and report that pyrimidine synthesis can continue in the absence of coenzyme Q (CoQ), the canonical electron acceptor in de novo synthesis. We further investigate NUDT5 and report its conserved interaction with PPAT, the rate-limiting enzyme in purine synthesis. We show that in the absence of NUDT5, hyperactive purine synthesis siphons the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) pool at the expense of pyrimidine synthesis, promoting resistance to chemotherapy. Intriguingly, the interaction between NUDT5 and PPAT appears to be disrupted by PRPP, highlighting intricate allosteric regulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental mechanism for maintaining nucleotide balance and position NUDT5 as a potential biomarker for predicting resistance to chemotherapy.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

To minimise potential negative impact on families and clinical services, it is crucial to reduce false positive results while prioritising clinical utility. Here we present an automated variant prioritisation approach for genomic newborn screening and the assessment of its validity across the conditions included in the Generation Study, a research study investigating genomic sequencing in 100,000 newborns in England. Prioritised variants will subsequently undergo manual review by a registered clinical scientist, and a specialist clinician, before being reported back to parents.

MethodsThe automated variant prioritisation approach was evaluated for its ability to predict the presence or absence of relevant genetic variants, subsequently informing gene and variant-specific inclusion in the study. Specificity was estimated using a cohort of 34,410 samples not enriched for rare diseases, while sensitivity was assessed with 546 samples from participants with diagnostic variants in genes relevant to newborn screening. Coverage and CNV callability metrics were evaluated as proxies for variant detection.

ResultsAssessing validity of automated variant prioritisation on a gene level led to changes in rules used in variant prioritisation and conditions included. We estimated that 3-5% of samples will have prioritised variants that require manual review and that <1% of samples will be taken forward for orthogonal confirmatory testing and genetic confirmation. We prioritised variants in [~]80% of samples with diagnostic variants across genes included in the Generation Study.

The tomato sensor NLR Prf guards the Pto kinase from AvrPto and AvrPtoB effector perturbation and activates the downstream helpers NRC2 and NRC3. Prf is conserved across the Solanaceae and its ortholog in the model species Nicotiana benthamiana is also required for detection of AvrPto/AvrPtoB function on Pto. A recent study reported that cell death induction after transient expression of an autoactive mutant of tomato NRC3 is abolished upon RNAi silencing of Prf in N. benthamiana. Here we generated loss-of-function prf mutants in N. benthamiana and demonstrate that autoactive mutants of eight canonical tomato NRCs (NRC0, NRC1, NRC2, NRC3, NRC4a, NRC4b, NRC6, and NRC7) still induce hypersensitive cell death when expressed transiently in the prf mutant background. Autoactive tomato NRCs also triggered cell death when expressed in lettuce (Lactuca sativa), an Asteraceae plant that does not have a Prf ortholog.

This project aims to study the application of ARG methods to systematically impute and trace the transmission of all disease variants in founder populations where long-shared haplotypes allow for accurate timing of relatedness. We applied these methods to the population of Quebec, where multiple founder events led to an uneven distribution of pathogenic variants across regions and where extensive population pedigrees are available. We validated our approach with nine founder mutations for the SLSJ region, demonstrating high accuracy for mutation age, imputation, and regional frequency estimation. Moreover, we showed that this subset of high-quality carriers is sufficient to capture previously described associations with pathogenic variants in the LPL gene. This method systematically characterizes rare variants in founder populations, establishing a fast and accurate approach to inform genetic screening programs.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

In 2023 for the first time in Cameroon, identification of PAMIs for cholera control was conducted, following the 2023 GTFCC guidelines. We hereby describe experience of PAMIs identification in a cholera high-burden country.

MethodsIn August 2023, a multisectoral technical team was set up, under the leadership of the Ministry of health to conduct identification of PAMIs. Stakeholders were briefed on GTFCC guidelines. A retrospective (January 2016-September 2023) descriptive study was conducted in all the 10 regions of Cameroon. Data were collected from DHIS-2, national cholera line lists, situation reports, databases from the Centre Pasteur of Cameroon and the National Public Health Laboratory. These datasets were entered in the GTFCC tool for automated analysis. An initial list of PAMIs was identified based on a priority index using four indicators: cholera incidence, mortality, persistence, and positivity. In December 2023, we conducted a multisectoral validation workshop, during which the threshold of 9 was set for PAMIs prioritization and a second prioritization done using vulnerability factors.

ResultsOverall, 48 health districts (25% of all health districts) were identified as PAMIs, 35 PAMIs using the priority index and 13 based on vulnerability factors. About 11 488 089 people (41% of the countrys population) live in these PAMIs from which 93% of cholera cases were reported over the past 8 years. The Centre, Littoral, South-West, and the Far North regions are home to 66% of PAMIs.

ConclusionIdentification of PAMIs was successfully conducted in Cameroon and provided scientific evidence for decision-making to level up cholera preparedness and prevention. The ownership and leadership of governmental main stakeholders were critical. Data availability facilitated this exercise.

Key questionsO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSEnding cholera requires implementation of targeted interventions in high-priority areas for maximum impact. Identification of these areas (PAMIs) is the first step towards cholera elimination.

What this study addsPriority areas for targeted cholera control interventions were identified and categorized in Cameroon for cholera control. PAMIs represent 25% of health districts in Cameroon with a targeted population representing 41% of the whole country. The study describes lessons learnt and challenges of using GTFCC guides for PAMIs identification, which is useful information for other countries.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyOur findings will inform decision-making for cholera control in Cameroon and in other countries through elaboration, implementation and monitoring and evaluation of a national cholera control budgeted plan with specific key long-term interventions to be conducted where needed.","NA","medrxiv",1742162911920

We developed a massively parallel dual reporter assay that enables simultaneous assessment of the intrinsic promoter and enhancer potential exerted by the same sequence. Parallel quantification for thousands of elements reveals that canonical human promoters and enhancers can act as both promoters and enhancers under the same contexts, and that promoter activity may be necessary but not sufficient for enhancer function. We find that regulatory potential is intrinsic to element sequences, irrespective of downstream features typically associated with distinct element classes. Perturbations to element transcription factor binding motifs lead to disruptions in both activities, implicating a shared syntax for the two regulatory functions. Combinations of elements with different minimal promoters reveal reciprocal activity modulation between associated elements and a strong positive correlation between promoter and enhancer functions imply a bidirectional feedback loop used to maintain environments of high transcriptional activity. Finally, our results indicate that the magnitude and balance between promoter and enhancer functions are shaped by both intrinsic sequence properties and contextual regulatory influences, suggesting a degree of plasticity in regulatory action. Our approach provides a new lens for understanding fundamental principles of regulatory element biology.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

However, the cellular and molecular components of the exercise-induced anti-inflammatory effects remain only partly understood. Herein we show that moderate-intensity exercise promotes anti-inflammatory reprograming of macrophages orchestrated by the skeletal muscle cells secretome. Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) exposed to the secretome of mechanically-loaded myotubes (exercise-conditioned medium, exCM) acquire an anti-inflammatory transcriptional profile and increased reliance on oxidative phosphorylation, as shown by Seahorse real-time cell metabolic analysis, compatible with an M2-like phenotypic switch. Using an unbiased proteomic analysis of the exCM we identify the chaperonin Hsp60 as a key mediator of the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise. Hsp60 expression increases in mechanically loaded myotubes in vitro, in the quadriceps muscle and serum of mice following an 8-week program of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, as well as in human muscle after resistance training. Importantly, treatment of BMDMs with Hsp60 in vitro recapitulates the exCM-induced transcriptional reprograming, promoting an M2-like phenotype. Taken together, our data highlight Hsp60 as a novel component of the skeletal muscle cell-macrophage crosstalk, providing mechanistic insights into the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

Despite their prevalence, the mechanisms underlying ER domestication and their long-term adaptation within bacterial hosts remain largely unexplored.

Across multiple phyla, marker frequency analyses showed that large ERs maintain a 1:1 copy number with the chromosome. Another key finding of this study is that large ERs terminate replication in synchrony with the chromosome. Hi-C contact maps revealed consistent ori-ori interactions between chromosomes and ERs. In large ERs, inter-replichore and ter-ter interactions, along with the recruitment of key chromosomal segregation motifs, suggest the co-option of chromosome-associated replication and segregation machineries.

We show that an oligomerization domain of the nuclease effector, LmuA, is sequestered by two tightly-folded SMC-like LmuB protomers and LmuC. Upon activation, released LmuA proteins assemble into a cyclic homo-tetramer, in which two of four nuclease domains are brought into proximity to create an active site capable of cleaving DNA. We propose tetramer formation is likely a one-way switch that establishes a threshold to limit potential spontaneous activation and cell death. Our findings reveal a mechanism of cellular defence, involving liberation and oligomerization of immune effectors, and shed light on how Lamassu systems balance potent immune responses with self-preservation.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

Unexpectedly, the activation of IP3 receptors with the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist carbachol had minimal impact on the initial peak elicited by 11 mM glucose, but Ca2+ waves at 11 and 25 mM glucose were more poorly coordinated. To determine whether ER calcium mobilization was sufficient to initiate Ca2+ waves we next blocked sarco(endo)plasmic Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pumps with thapsigargin, whilst preventing plasma membrane depolarization with the KATP-channel opener, diazoxide. Under these conditions, an initial cytosolic Ca2+ increase was followed by secondary Ca2+ waves that slowly subsided. The application of carbachol alongside diazoxide still enhanced Ca2+ dynamics, though this activity was uncoordinated and beta cells were poorly connected. Our results show that ER Ca2+ mobilization plays a relatively minor role in the initiation and propagation of Ca2+ waves in response to glucose. On the other hand, ER stores are required to transition to sustained Ca2+ waves.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

Therefore, it is critically important to optimize how existing antibiotics act against bacterial infections. Although antibiotic activity is well studied at the single cell level, many infections are caused by spatially structured multicellular populations. In such populations, cellular consumption of scarce nutrients establishes strong spatial variations in their abundance. These nutrient variations have long been hypothesized to help bacterial populations tolerate antibiotics, since single-cell studies show that antibiotic tolerance depends on metabolic activity, and thus, local nutrient availability. Here, we directly test this hypothesis by visualizing cell death in Escherichia coli populations with defined structures upon exposure to nutrient (glucose) and antibiotic (fosfomycin). We find that nutrient availability acts as a bottleneck to antibiotic killing, causing death to propagate through the population as a traveling front---a phenomenon predicted over 20 years ago, but never verified until now. By integrating our measurements with biophysical theory and simulations, we establish quantitative principles that explain how collective nutrient consumption can limit the progression of this ""death front,"" protecting a population from a nominally deadly antibiotic dose. While increasing nutrient supply can overcome this bottleneck, our work reveals that in some cases, excess nutrient can unexpectedly promote the regrowth of resistant cells. Altogether, this work provides a key step toward predicting and controlling antibiotic treatment of spatially structured bacterial populations, yielding fundamental biophysical insights into collective behavior and helping to guide strategies for more effective antibiotic stewardship.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

In Drosophila, we identified the full repertoire of taste cells and receptors involved in feeding initiation towards a glutamate-rich AA mixture, tryptone, using in vivo calcium imaging and the proboscis extension response (PER). We found that AA attraction occurs through sweet cells, whereas feeding aversion is mediated through Ionotropic Receptor 94e (IR94e) cells and bitter cells, dependent on concentration. Further, our results corroborate previous findings that ionotropic receptors IR76b, IR51b, and IR94e detect AAs in their respective cell types. Additionally, we describe a new role for the appetitive IR56d receptor and bitter gustatory receptors in detecting AAs.

The reasons underlying these changes in parasite virulence are manifold. Here, we investigated the importance for the infection outcome of order and timing of infection. We used a model of rodent coinfection between two parasites that do not compete for common resources, an intestinal nematode (Heligmosomoides polygyrus) and an apicomplexan protozoan (Plasmodium yoelii). During single infections, H. polygyrus induced only mild disease symptoms. Plasmodium produced a substantial reduction in the number of red blood cells but all mice recovered from the infection. A different picture emerged in coinfected hosts. Heligmosomoides maintained a profile of mostly asymptomatic infection whatever the order of the infection (first or second). On the contrary, P. yoelii incurred substantially higher costs in hosts that had been previously infected with H. polygyrus (independently of the timing of infection). We then investigated the possible reasons underlying the increase of Plasmodium virulence in coinfected hosts. We found that coinfected hosts were less able to control Plasmodium multiplication and to recover from infection-induced anemia. Coinfected hosts had similar levels of erythropoietin and similar renewal of lost red blood cells, resulting in decreased tolerance to Plasmodium infection. Experimental administration of erythropoietin in coinfected hosts, partially decreased the severity of disease symptoms and improved tolerance. The detoxification of free heme released during the lysis of red blood cells, and the expression of Th1 and anti-inflammatory cytokine genes were also similar between coinfected and single infected hosts. However, coinfected mice had higher proportions of regulatory T cells expressing the CTLA-4 immune checkpoint, suggesting an enhanced immunosuppressive activity of Tregs. Plasmodium infection also induced the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells, as coinfected mice had higher proportions of both PD-1+ and LAG-3+ CD8+ T cells, and an increase in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Overall, these results stress the importance of the order of infection as a major determinant of disease severity in coinfected hosts. We discuss the possible epidemiological and evolutionary consequences of these results.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

Here, we find that social isolation promotes aggression and increases investigatory behaviors leading up to aggression in both males and female mice. Genetic characterization of the neuropeptidergic population of Tachykinin-2 expressing (Tac2+) neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) reveals a population of predominately early-layer GABAergic neurons that are activated by aggressive encounters in isolated mice. Cells expressing the Neurokinin 3 receptor, which binds the peptide product of Tac2, are similarly activated by aggressive interactions in isolated mice. Loss of function perturbations targeting the co-release of Neurokinin B (NkB), the stimulatory peptide encoded by the gene Tac2, and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA from mPFC Tac2+ neurons, reveals dissociable functions for each signaling molecule in the distinct behaviors that tile an aggressive encounter. GABA transmission form Tac2+ neurons controls the release of aggression, whereas Tac2/NkB signaling controls the investigatory behaviors escalating to aggression. These findings reveal dissociable roles for opposing signaling molecules released from the same neuron in the control over aggression, suggesting a neurochemical mechanism by which internal states may exert coordinated, sequential effects on a broad array of behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

Finally, we identified two chlorophyll catabolites, pheophorbide-a and pyropheophorbide-a, in the larval frass extract. Pyropheophorbide-a reduces cell viability of and induces morphological changes in cells of MIA PaCa2; in addition, pheophorbide-a and pyropheophorbide-a inhibit the aggregation of amyloid {beta}-protein (human, 1-42). Therefore, the chemical structure and biological activity of host plant components are affected by the P. memnon metabolic system.

In many species, including humans, tubulins are expressed from multiple genes. While the resulting tubulin isotypes show only subtle sequence differences, microtubules made of distinct isotypes can differ in their dynamic behaviour, as well as in their structure, for example in the number of their protofilaments. In cells, tubulin isotypes co-polymerize into mixed-isotype microtubules. How the mixing of tubulin isotypes affects microtubule functionality is unknown. Here we show that co-polymerization of recombinant tubulin dimers containing two different human {beta}-tubulin isotypes, 1{beta}3 and 1{beta}4, generates sectioned microtubules in which tubulin content and protofilament number differ from one section to the next. We demonstrate that two microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), TPPP1 and optineurin (OPTN), bind differentially to these sections. Microtubules grown from natively mixed-isotype sources, either HeLa cells or mammalian brain tissue, also consist of sections that are differentially recognized by TPPP1 and OPTN, suggestive of isotype sorting.

Complementarity to the miRNA seed region (miRNA nucleotides 2-7) is typically both necessary and sufficient for repression. Here, we investigate unusual sites with extensive complementarity to the miRNA 3' region (nucleotide 9 and onwards) but without complementarity to the seed. Top 3'-only sites bind as well as top canonical sites and impart similar repression, which can be further boosted by as few as 2-3 additional pairs to the miRNA seed. Despite these similarities, 3'-only sites have slower association and dissociation rates than seed-matched sites. They also impart different conformations to bound AGO-miRNA complexes than do seed-matched sites, and individual miRNAs differ substantially with respect to how well they bind their respective 3'-only sites. Thus, pairing to the seed is not required for binding and repression, or for a target to gain access to the 3' region of the guide. Overall, for those miRNAs which recognize 3'-only sites, those sites are estimated to constitute 0.5-1% of the endogenous targetome, a proportion resembling that of other rare but functional site types, such as 3'-compensatory sites.

These communities are shaped by root exudates including plant specialized metabolites. Benzoxazinoids are such secreted compounds of maize. Individual microbes differ in their ability to tolerate and metabolize antimicrobial benzoxazinoids. To investigate how these traits combine in a community, we designed two synthetic communities of maize root bacteria that share six common strains and differ in their ability to metabolize benzoxazinoids based on the seventh strain. We exposed both communities to the benzoxazinoid MBOA (6-methoxybenzoxazolin-2(3H)-one) and found that the metabolizing community did not degrade MBOA to its aminophenoxazinone, as observed for individual strains, but as a community they formed the corresponding acetamide. MBOA shaped differential compositions of both communities and increased the fraction of MBOA-tolerant strains. The benzoxazinoid metabolizing community showed a higher tolerance to MBOA and was able to utilize MBOA as their sole carbon source for growth. Hence, bacterial interaction results in alternative benzoxazinoid metabolization and increases community performance in presence of these antimicrobial compounds. Future work is needed to uncover the genetics of this metabolic interaction and ecological consequences for the bacterial community and the host plant.

ImportanceWe investigated how maize root bacteria - alone or in community - tolerate and metabolize antimicrobial compounds of their host plant. We found the capacity to metabolize such a compound to impact bacterial community size and structure and most importantly, to beneeit community eitness. We also found that interacting bacteria redirected the metabolisation of the antimicrobial compound to an alternative degradation product. Our work highlights the need to study the team work of microbes to uncover their community traits to ultimately understand the ecological consequences for the bacterial community and eventually the host plant.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

Experimental evidence indicates that spike mutations, particularly the early D614G variant, alter the rate of this conformational shift, potentially increasing viral infectivity. To investigate how mutations reshape the conformational landscape, we conducted extensive weighted ensemble simulations of the Ancestral, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 spike strains along the RBD opening pathway. We observe that Ancestral, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 spike RBDs open differently, with Omicron BA.1 following a more direct opening profile until it reaches a ""super-open"" state wherein it begins to ""peel"", suggesting increased S1 flexibility. Via dynamical network analysis, we identified two allosteric communication networks uniting all S1 domains: the established N2R linker and a newly discovered anti-parallel R2N linker. In Delta and Omicron BA.1 variant spikes, RBD opening is facilitated by both linkers, while the Ancestral strain relies predominantly on the N2R linker. In the ancestral spike, the D614-K854 salt bridge impedes allosteric communication through the R2N linker, whereas the loss of this salt bridge in all subsequent VOCs alleviates local frustration and, we believe, accelerates RBD opening. Hydrogen-deuterium mass spectrometry experiments validate these altered dynamics in the D614 region across Ancestral, D614G, and Omicron BA.1 spikes. This study unveils a  hidden allosteric network, connecting the NTD to the RBD via the 614-proximal region, and the D614G mutation reshapes the fitness landscape of these critical viral glycoproteins.

Significance StatementOur work reveals how the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein reshapes its internal communication pathways and speeds up receptor binding domain (RBD) opening, providing mechanistic insight into the evolution and enhanced infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. We also describe differences in opening pathways and relative rates of opening for Delta and Omicron BA.1 spike RBDs relative to the original (Ancestral) coronavirus strain from Wuhan, China.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

Calcium imaging is such a key method which, however, records neuronal activity only indirectly and is therefore difficult to interpret. These difficulties arise primarily from the kinetics, nonlinearity, and sensitivity of the calcium indicator, but also depend on the methods for calcium signal analysis. Here, we evaluate the ability of the recently developed calcium indicator GCaMP8 to reveal neuronal spiking, and we investigate how existing spike inference methods (CASCADE, OASIS, MLSpike) should be adapted for optimal performance. We demonstrate, both for principal cells and interneurons, that algorithms require fine-tuning to obtain optimal results with GCaMP8 data. Specifically, supervised algorithms adapted for GCaMP8 result in more linear and therefore more accurate recovery of complex spiking events. In addition, our analysis of cortical ground truth recordings shows that GCaMP8s and GCaMP8m - but not GCaMP6, GCaMP7f or GCaMP8f - are able to reliably detect isolated action potentials for realistic noise levels. Finally, we demonstrate that, due to their fast rise times, GCaMP8 indicators support shorter closed-loop latencies for real-time detection of neuronal activity. Together, our study provides demonstrations, tools, and guidelines to optimally process and quantitatively interpret calcium signals obtained with GCaMP8.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

This study utilized a novel mouse model with dermal fibroblast specific expression of TLR4 on a TLR4-null background, which allows us to understand the sufficiency of skin fibroblast activation in pain development. Here we demonstrate that dermal fibroblast activation induces both acute inflammatory pain and hyperalgesic priming in both male and female mice. In vivo, activated dermal fibroblasts change cellular morphology in mice and humans. In vitro we observed pro-inflammatory cytokine production and activation of calcium signaling pathways. These data demonstrate that dermal fibroblast activation can cause acute pain and drive mechanisms involved in the transition to chronic pain.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

In each condition, more than 330 single neurons were recorded in 11 participants. Almost a third of neurons in posterior insula and a smaller subset in anterior insula responded to simple tones and clicks. Responsive neurons were distributed throughout posterior and anterior insula and showed preferred frequency tuning. Onset latencies in the insula were similar to those in the primary auditory cortex but response durations were significantly shorter.

Numerous approaches exist to reconstruct the phylogenetic trees by considering different biological data, such as DNA sequence, protein sequence, protein-protein interaction graph, etc. However, each method has its own strengths and weaknesses. Till date, no existing method guarantees to determine true phylogenetic trees all the times. Various studies identified distinct branch length configurations where the existing methods are inefficient to infer the correct tree topologies.
C_LIO_LIHere, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model, DeePhy, to reconstruct the phylogenetic trees from the unaligned sequences. The sequences are repre- sented on a two-dimensional coordinate plane by utilizing a biological semantics-based map- ping. Additionally, to assess the robustness of a method, here we also propose a novel boot- strapping technique to generate replicas from the unaligned sequences. We train the model on the triplet sequences, where the output is a triplet tree topology.
C_LIO_LIWe show that the well-trained DeePhy outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in inferring triplet tree topology. We experiment DeePhy on data simulated under numerous critical conditions and various branch length configurations. We conduct the McNemar test for comparing the performance of DeePhy and the state-of-the-art methods. The results exhibit that DeePhy is significantly more accurate and remarkably robust in determining the triplet tree topologies for most of the cases than that of the conventional methods. Again, various comparison metrics show that DeePhy also outperforms the conventional methods in inferring trees. Finally, to analyze the performance of DeePhy on real biological dataset, we apply it on Gadiformes dataset. Reassuringly, DeePhy reconstructs the phylogenetic tree from real biological data with known or widely accepted topologies.
C_LIO_LIAlthough various practical challenges still need to be taken care of, the outcomes of our study suggest that the deep learning approaches be a successful endeavour in inferring the accurate phylogenetic trees.

While prokaryotic TFs combine 1D and 3D diffusion to efficiently locate their binding sites, the target search of eukaryotic TFs within the chromatinized genome is poorly characterized. Here we combine in vivo and in vitro single-molecule imaging to dissect the role of DBD-flanking regions (DFRs) of the mammalian Sox2 and Sox17 TFs in searching for their binding sites. We demonstrate that the DFRSox2 dramatically enhances the search efficiency of Sox2 as compared to the negatively-charged DFRSox17. An enhanced search on naked DNA is primarily mediated by an increase in target recognition rate during 1D sliding. In contrast, target site recognition within nucleosomal DNA is mainly enhanced by increased nonspecific interactions with nucleosomes, facilitating binding to closed chromatin and reinforcing pioneering activity. These findings provide critical insights into the biophysical mechanisms governing TF target search on the chromatinized genome.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

Although advancements in whole genome sequencing (WGS) have improved surveillance and outbreak investigations, traditional single-colony sequencing methods overlook within-host diversity, potentially underestimating the complexity of infections. This study explores the genome-wide diversity of Salmonella strains recovered from stool samples of eight patients, with up to 20 isolates analysed per sample.

A total of 156 Salmonella enterica isolates were recovered. All isolates from individual patients displayed consistent serovars and sequence types. Despite the serotype consistency, microevolution was observed in S. Java ST149 and S. Java ST43, with SNP analyses revealing higher diversity (13 and 5 SNP differences, respectively) compared to the clonal populations of other serovars. Phylogenetic analysis of S. Java ST149 isolates from Patient 2 revealed distinct branching, driven by mutations in genes such as secY and cnoX, while S. Java ST43 isolates from Patient 1 displayed multiple clades with notable SNPs affecting transcriptional regulators.

Genome structure (GS) analyses using hybrid assemblies identified uniform GS1.0 across all isolates. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling revealed the presence of multidrug efflux pump genes (mdsA and mdsB) in all isolates. However, S. Typhimurium isolates from Patient 4 exhibited additional AMR genes, including sul2, aph(3)-Ib, and blaTEM-1, associated with an 8.7 kb resistance region. A single isolate from Patient 4 lacked these additional genes due to the deletion of a [~]19 kb genomic region, highlighting structural variation as a driver of phenotypic differences.

These findings emphasise the genetic diversity of Salmonella within hosts, particularly in serovars such as S. Java, and underscore the limitations of single-colony sequencing in capturing this complexity. The study highlights the utility of hybrid sequencing strategies for comprehensive analysis of genome variation, offering valuable insights into transmission dynamics, antimicrobial resistance, and evolutionary processes in Salmonella.

Impact statementThis study provides a transformative perspective on Salmonella genomics, uncovering the significant within-host diversity of Salmonella populations through the analysis of multiple single-colony isolates. By leveraging hybrid sequencing technologies, we reveal critical insights into the microevolution of Salmonella during infection, capturing genome-wide variation at both single nucleotide and chromosomal scales. Our findings highlight the inherent limitations of traditional single-colony sequencing in detecting within-host diversity, particularly in genetically diverse serovars such as S. Java ST149.

The identification of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants and structural genomic variation demonstrates the dynamic nature of Salmonella genomes, offering crucial implications for clinical management and public health surveillance. Importantly, we show that within-host diversity may influence epidemiological interpretations, particularly in outbreak investigations and source attribution, where genetic differences between isolates can mask deeper transmission links.

While hippocampus-projecting LCNA neurons responded to general social contacts, thalamus-projecting LCNA neurons tracked the aversive salience of social stimuli. Functional manipulations revealed a bidirectional role of thalamus-projecting LCNA neurons in social avoidance learning.

We therefore examined the genetic adaptations of Promethearchaeota after being frozen for >100 kyr by comparing metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the Kolyma Lowland, Siberia, to MAGs from other marine and terrestrial sediments worldwide. We reconstructed 22 Promethearchaeota MAGs from 5 classes (Heimdallarchaeia, Gerdarchaeia, Lokiarchaeia, Helarachaeia and Thorarchaeia). Six MAGs from the intracellular DNA fraction were > 70% complete before and after DNA repair, and therefore likely represent living Promethearchaeota that have maintained high DNA integrity under cryogenic conditions through geological time. These 6 MAGs were also over 7 times more abundant than all other Promethearchaeota MAGs based on read recruitment. These permafrost Promethearchaeota MAGs are closely related to other non-permafrost Promethearchaeota lineages at the family or genus level and share metabolic potential and genes for DNA and protein repair with them. This suggests that the ability to survive for >100 kyr in permafrost is a trait that is widespread within the Promethearchaeota. No genes were more prevalent in our permafrost MAGs compared to Promethearchaeota MAGs from other environments. The lack of detectable genetic change since these groups were frozen is consistent with the predicted state of inactivity. Furthermore, although DNA repair mechanisms were present in the Promethearchaeota/Eukaryote lineage before the eukaryotic split, Promethearchaeota protein repair mechanisms emerged after the split, suggesting that adaptations to long term dormancy, or aeonophily, may set modern Promethearchaeota apart from eukaryotes. Collectively, our study expands the known habitat range of many subgroups of Promethearchaeota to ancient marine permafrost and suggests they may have extraordinary long-term survivability under cryogenic conditions through geological time.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

Our data highlight the essential role of nuclear RNA degradation and processing in Drosophila oogenesis and provide a catalog of RNAs whose nuclear levels are regulated by these three complexes. We propose that Integrator, NEXT, and the nuclear exosome support oogenesis by ensuring that inappropriate transcription does not overwhelm the limited supply of proteins that bind, process, and traffic RNA.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

In a proof-of-principle application, we used STREAM-4D to analyze TMS-EEG and diffusion MRI tractography data in a neurotypical subject across three stimulation sites: premotor, parietal, and occipital cortex. STREAM-4D revealed extensive structural connections associated with the TMS-evoked source models, involving thalamocortical, ipsilateral cortico-cortical, and transcallosal cortico-cortical connections. Activity-weighted structural connectivity differed for the three stimulation sites but shared two extensively connected nodes: the ipsilateral thalamus and putamen.

How might hippocampal-vPFC interactions control the balance between behavioral exploration and exploitation? Using fMRI and reinforcement learning modeling, we investigated vPFC and hippocampal responses as humans explored and exploited a continuous one-dimensional space, with out-of-session and out-of-sample replication. The spatial distribution of rewards, or value landscape, modulated activity in the hippocampus and default network vPFC subregions, but not in ventrolateral prefrontal control subregions or medial orbitofrontal limbic subregions. While prefrontal default network and hippocampus displayed higher activity in less complex, easy-to-exploit value landscapes, vPFC-hippocampal connectivity increased in uncertain landscapes requiring exploration. Further, synchronization between prefrontal default network and posterior hippocampus scaled with behavioral exploration. Considered alongside electrophysiological studies, our findings suggest that locations to be explored are identified through coordinated activity binding prefrontal default network value representations to posterior hippocampal maps.

Significance StatementThe ventral prefrontal cortex represents goals and values, while the hippocampus contains maps of physical and abstract spaces. In recent years, neuroscientists have sought to understand how hippocampal-prefrontal interactions help us to solve complex problems such as deciding whether to exploit known rewards or explore in search of better alternatives. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and reinforcement learning modeling, we examine these interactions as humans explore and exploit an environment with a complex distribution of rewards or value landscape. We describe how this value landscape modulates activity and connectivity between prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, controlling the balance between exploration and exploitation.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

Borrelia is known to disseminate through organs, including the skin, joints, spinal cord, bladder, and heart, leading to Lyme arthritis, neuroborreliosis, and Lyme carditis. While previous studies have investigated the impact of LD on pregnancy in both mice and humans and have found the presence of B. burgdorferi in the uterus of mice, we studied the impact of LD on the non-pregnant female reproductive tract. We use a mouse model for LD and find an ongoing and severe infection of the reproductive tract of female mice, which persists up to 15-months post-inoculation. This infection results in uterine glandular cysts and endometrial hyperplasia as well as vaginal epithelial thickening, polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell epithelial infiltration, and epithelial desquamation into the vaginal lumen. Strikingly, we find that age has an impact on the extent of gynecologic pathology such that aged female mice (1-year old) that are reproductively senescent have more gynecologic pathology with infection compared to young mice (15-weeks old) when infected for the same length of time. Using large-scale electronic healthcare record data, we report that LD additionally results in increased infection-associated risk of menorrhagia (1.5-fold), miscarriage (1.62-fold), uterine fibroids (1.42-fold), and endometriosis (1.93-fold). Underreporting of gynecological outcomes is pervasive throughout many different infectious diseases, and LD-associated gynecological pathologies may have been similarly underappreciated in the field. This work suggests that further study of the female reproductive tract and the effects of B. burgdorferi infection therein will help clarify and expand the knowledge of myriad LD outcomes.

However, batch effects, arising from non-biological variations in sample collection, processing, sequencing platforms, or experimental protocols, can obscure biological signals, hinder data integration, and impact downstream analyses. Despite their critical impact, batch effects in ST datasets remain poorly defined and insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we propose a framework to categorize and define batch effects in ST and systematically evaluate the performance of ST methods with batch effect correction capabilities. Results: We categorized batch effects in ST into four types based on their sources: (1) Inter-slice, (2) Inter-sample, (3) Cross-protocol/platform, and (4) Intra-slice. Seven ST integration methods--DeepST, STAligner, GraphST, STitch3D, PRECAST, spatiAlign, and SPIRAL--were evaluated on benchmark datasets from human and mouse tissues. Using metrics such as graph connectivity, kBET, ASW, and iLISI, we assessed both the preservation of biological neighborhoods and the effectiveness of these methods in batch correction. Additionally, we applied STAligner for downstream analysis to compare results before and after batch correction, further highlighting the importance of batch effect correction in ST analysis. Conclusion: No single method is universally optimal. GraphST, PRECAST, SPIRAL, and STAligner performed well for same-platform integration, whereas SPIRAL and STAligner excelled in cross-platform settings. These findings highlight the need for robust and generalizable ST approaches with effective batch correction capabilities to facilitate the integration of multi-platform ST datasets in future research.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

Whether the level, structure, and content of ripple-nested activity are consistent across consecutive events or are tuned in each event remains unclear. By profiling individual ripples using laminar currents in the mouse hippocampus during sleep/rest, we identified Radsink and LMsink ripples featuring current sinks in stratum radiatum versus stratum lacunosum-moleculare, respectively. These two ripple profiles recruit neurons differently. Radsink ripples integrate recent motifs of waking coactivity, combining superficial and deep CA1 principal cells into denser, higher-dimensional patterns that undergo hour-long stable reactivation. In contrast, LMsink ripples contain core motifs of prior coactivity, engaging deep cells into sparser, lower-dimensional patterns that undergo a reactivation drift, gradually updating their pre-structured content for recent wakefulness. We propose that ripple-by-ripple diversity instantiates parallel reactivation channels for stable integration of recent wakefulness and flexible updating of prior internal representations.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911920

We identified human-specific epigenetic signatures including cis-regulatory regions and enhancer-promoter interactions and linked them to gene regulatory dynamics. Deep learning models revealed that complex regulatory grammar at cis-regulatory regions, including transcription factor binding sites, local context and higher-order chromatin organization, underlies species and cell type-specific differences. High-resolution Hi-C uncovered unexpected global shifts in 3D genome architecture in chimpanzee and gorilla neural stem cells while topologically associating domains remain remarkably conserved. Notably, species-specific genes interacted with multiple differentially accessible regions, suggesting that synergistic enhancer activation is a key mechanism driving epigenome evolution.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood, with ongoing debate about whether sensory neurons can be directly infected by the virus. In this study, human iPSC-derived sensory neurons were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, a mutant virus, or viral S1 proteins. Under control conditions, sensory neurons exhibited low expression of ACE2. However, exposure to BA.5 or S1 proteins significantly upregulated ACE2 expression in peripherin-positive sensory neurons. Virological analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, including olfactory neurons. Moreover, exposure to the live virus or S1 proteins induced TRPV1 upregulation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in axonal destruction. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that viral exposure enhanced cAMP signaling, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels, which collectively contributed to synaptic and axonal damage. Importantly, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist demonstrated neuroprotective effects. These findings underscore the need for further research into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TRPV1, as well as its downstream signaling pathways, to develop therapeutic strategies for preventing sensory neuron loss during viral infections.

While LC symptoms vary widely, neuropathy is one of the most prevalent symptoms and drastically affects quality of life. However, the underlying pathophysiology of LC neuropathy remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the prevalence and potential mechanisms of LC neuropathy in the largest LC neuropathy cohort to date.

MethodsWe conducted an observational study of 977 adults with LC at Dell Medical School. Participants underwent clinical assessments, skin punch biopsy, and comprehensive metabolic, endocrine and immunological profiling. A subset of patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment.

FindingsNeuropathic symptoms were reported by 55% (534/977) participants, with skin biopsy confirming small fiber neuropathy in 56.5% (48/85) cases, affecting both epidermal and autonomic nerve fibers. Common risk factors for neuropathy, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, did not fully explain neuropathic symptoms. While general immunological markers (lymphocyte, T cell, and B cell count and CRP) were unremarkable, unexpectedly, we detected anti-ganglioside antibodies (AGAs) in 25% of patients with LC neuropathy, a comparable rate to other AGA-associated neuropathies. Longitudinal testing revealed persistent AGA positivity, and multiple elevated AGAs in a subset of patients. In a pilot treatment cohort of eight patients, IVIG treatment resulted in improvement of patient reported neuropathic symptoms.

InterpretationOur findings reveal a high prevalence of small fiber neuropathy in LC, with evidence suggesting an autoimmune mechanism involving AGAs in one in four LC neuropathy patients. The therapeutic response to IVIG further supports an autoimmune pathophysiology, suggesting potential benefits of immunomodulation in LC neuropathy patients.","NA","medrxiv",1742162911921

To go much beyond this number, smaller and simpler genetic systems are needed to avoid significant technical challenges. Chloroplast genomes offer multiple advantages for codon compression and reassignment. Here we report a recoding scheme for the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast genome, in which two stop codons and one or more of the codons for arginine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine and serine, all of which have two cognate tRNAs, are absent, compressing the genetic code to 51 codons. Firstly, several recoding strategies were tested on the essential rpoA gene, encoding a subunit of the chloroplast RNA polymerase. A defined compression scheme, which relied on swapping the target codons with the permitted frequent codons, could replace the native protein coding sequence without affecting chloroplast protein expression levels or the strain fitness. The same strategy was successfully used for codon compression of ycf1, encoding a subunit of the chloroplast translocon, psaA and psbA, intron-containing highly expressed genes encoding reaction centres subunits of both photosystems, and an 8.5 kb operon encoding essential and non-essential genes. Finally, we tested degeneracy of the 51-codon genetic code by exploring the combinatorial design for the large subunit of RuBisCO, relying on restoration of photosynthesis in an rbcL mutant strain. More than 70 functional sequences with diverse codon adaptation indices were recovered. In all codon-compressed genes there was no observable penalty on photosynthetic growth.

Significance StatementWe demonstrate the use of a chloroplast genome as a synthetic biology platform to test modifications of the universal genetic code. Elimination of 13 of the 64 possible triplet codes (codons) was possible for several essential and/or highly expressed genes without affecting chloroplast function.

Here we present the GrimACE, the first fully standardised and automated cage-side monitoring tool for mice, the most widely used animals in research. The GrimACE uses computer vision to provide automated mouse grimace scale (MGS) assessment together with pose estimation in a dark, safe environment. We validated the system by analysing pain after brain surgeries (craniotomies) with head implants under two analgesia regimes. Human-expert and automated MGS scores showed very high correlation (Pearson's r=0.87). Both expert and automated scores revealed that a moderate increase in pain can be detected for up to 48 hours after surgeries, but that both a single dose of meloxicam (5mg/kg s.c.) or 3 doses of buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg) + meloxicam (5mg/kg s.c.) provide adequate and comparable pain management. Simultaneous pose estimation demonstrated that mice receiving buprenorphine + meloxicam showed increased movement 4h after surgery, indicative of hyperactivity, a well-known side-effect of opioid treatment. Significant weight loss was also detected in the buprenorphine + meloxicam treatment group compared to the meloxicam-only group. Additionally, detailed BehaviorFlow analysis and automated MGS scoring of control animals suggests that habituation to the GrimACE system is unnecessary, and that measurements can be repeated multiple times, ensuring standardised post-operative recovery monitoring.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911921

Combining Nirmatrelvir with the GRP78-antagonizing drug candidate HA15 strongly inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, to a far greater extent than either drug alone, as observed by diminished cytopathic effect, levels of detectable virus RNA, TCID50 titers, accumulation of the non-structural protein 3 (NSP3), as well as Spike and N proteins. The original SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as an Omicron variant were similarly susceptible towards the drug combination. Other GRP78 inhibitors or siRNAs targeting GRP78 also fortified the antiviral effect of Nirmatrelvir. In a hamster model of COVID-19, the combination of Nirmatrelvir with HA15 alleviated pneumonia-induced pulmonary atelectasis more effectively than the single drugs.

In heterodichogamy, two hermaphroditic morphs exploit distinct temporal reproductive niches by alternating phases of male and female flowering, promoting disassortative mating. This system is widespread within Juglandaceae, and known to be controlled by ancient balanced polymorphisms in walnuts (Juglans) and hickories (Carya). Here we identify distinct inheritance mechanisms controlling heterodichogamy in two separate Juglandaceae genera, the wingnuts (Pterocarya and Cyclocarya). We first document the occurrence of heterodichogamy in Pterocarya and map its genomic basis to haplotypes overlapping a single candidate gene in the FANTASTIC FOUR superfamily (GFAFL). These haplotypes segregate throughout the entire genus and the dominant haplotype controls female-first flowering. We show heterodichogamy in the sister genus Cyclocarya is associated with a distinct pair of ancient haplotypes at the same locus in both diploids and tetraploids, but with a dominant allele controlling male-first flowering. We infer a well-resolved fossil-calibrated phylogeny of Juglandaceae and date the divergence of the Pterocarya and Cyclocarya haplotypes to 51 and 44 million years ago, more recent than the divergence of these genera. In Pterocarya female-first heterozygotes, the dominant haplotype is associated with allele-specific suppression of the recessive copy of GFAFL during early male flower development. In Cyclocarya male-first heterozygotes, the dominant haplotype is associated with allele-specific activation of the recessive copy of GFAFL during male flower development, while the dominant copy itself shows higher expression in female flowers. We propose a model for the evolution of reciprocal sex matching in heterodichogamy through the combination of cis-regulatory divergence and allelic interactions involving  fast and  slow alleles at a single gene regulating flowering time. The non-independent expression of alleles in both systems is reminiscent of trans-sensing phenomena in other systems and suggests a mechanism mediated by DNA homology or an RNA intermediary. Notably, the dominant haplotypes in both genera show parallel architecture with a hemizygous region containing tandem duplicates of the same 1 kb motif downstream of the transcribed region of GFAFL which may be linked with such a mechanism. Our findings shed light on the molecular basis of heterodichogamy and contribute to an emerging view that diverse genetic pathways can be co-opted during its evolution and facilitate turnover in its genetic control.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911921

Despite this, only 3% of their encoded specialised metabolites have been matched to molecules and understanding how their biosynthesis is controlled is essential to fully exploit their potential. Here we use Streptomyces formicae and the formicamycin biosynthetic pathway as a model to understand the complex regulation of specialised metabolism. We analysed all three pathway-specific regulators and found that biosynthesis is subject to negative feedback and redox control via two MarR-family proteins while activation of the pathway is dependent on a cytoplasmic two-component system. Like many Streptomyces antibiotics, formicamycins are only produced in solid culture and biosynthesis is switched off in aerated liquid cultures. Here, we demonstrate that a redox-sensitive repressor named ForJ senses oxygen via a single cysteine residue that is required to repress formicamycin biosynthesis in liquid cultures.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911921

We present AlphaQuant, which introduces tree-based quantification. This approach organizes quantitative data into a hierarchical tree across levels. It allows differential analyses at fragment and MS1 level, recovering up to 50-fold more regulated proteins compared to a state-of-the-art approach. Using gradient boosting on tree features, we address the largely unsolved challenge of scoring quantification accuracy, as opposed to precision. Our method clusters peptides with similar quantitative behavior, providing a new approach to the protein grouping problem and enabling identification of regulated proteoforms directly from bottom-up data. Combined with deep learning classification, we infer phosphopeptides from proteome data alone, validating our findings with EGFR stimulation data. We then describe proteoform diversity across mouse tissues, revealing distinct patterns of post translational modifications and alternative splicing.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911921

Using Xenopus egg extracts, we show that a replication fork encountering an SSB on either the leading- or lagging-strand template produces a single-ended double-strand break (seDSB). These broken ends are efficiently resolved by homologous recombination to yield D-loops and erroneous end-to-end fusions. Surprisingly, DNA synthesis downstream of an seDSB is highly inefficient. In contrast, when two forks converge at an SSB, they generate a double-ended DSB (deDSB) that efficiently completes DNA synthesis through double-strand break repair that is not dependent on homologous recombination. Leading, but not lagging, seDSBs can undergo extensive nucleolytic degradation that disassembles the divergent fork. These  secondary collapse events efficiently resolve seDSBs but without completion of DNA synthesis. Moreover, PARP inhibition can enhance fork collapse at unmodified SSBs but not at abasic site SSBs, contrary to expectations. Our findings distinguish end resolution from replication completion and demonstrate flexibility in how PARP inhibition affects fork collapse.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911921

To successfully navigate between breeding and wintering quarters, they, in addition to other natural orientation cues, rely on their ability to sense the Earths magnetic field. For this reason, migratory birds have become key model species for studying the sensory mechanisms underlying magnetic field-guided navigation, as evidenced by the identification of several brain regions believed to be involved in processing magnetic field information. However, there is as yet no readily accessible, high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) brain atlas to serve as a common reference within and across studies. Here we provide the neuroscience research community with the first freely available, digital, high-resolution (25 {micro}m), 3D bird brain atlas. It is based on light microscopy images from ten Eurasian blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla), a night-migratory songbird widely used model species in magnetoreception and navigation research. We outline the individual steps for the creation of a brain atlas, from whole-brain imaging using serial-section, two-photon tomography, to the creation of an average template at an isotropic 25-{micro}m voxel size, and finally to brain area segmentation and annotation. In this first version of the atlas, we have mapped a total of 24 brain areas, including 6 principal compartments, 13 conspicuous anatomical subdivisions common to all bird species and 5 functionally defined areas of the visual and trigeminal sensory systems involved in processing magnetic field information. This atlas is accessible via the standardised BrainGlobe Atlas API, making it compatible with a growing suite of computational neuroanatomy tools provided by the BrainGlobe Initiative. This integration enables precise alignment of future experimental data to a common coordinate space, facilitating collaboration, data visualization and sharing. Furthermore, this resource enables the accurate localization and comparison of implanted devices, injection sites, and/or cell populations across individual brains, both within and across studies.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911921

It poses the difficult problem of continuous tracking of multiple agents, including both self and others. To understand how this tracking is implemented neurally, we examined responses of hippocampal neurons while humans performed a joystick-controlled continuous prey-pursuit task involving two simultaneously fleeing prey (and, in some cases, a predator) in a virtual open field. We found neural maps encoding the positions of all the agents. All maps were multiplexed in single neurons and were disambiguated by the use of the population coding principle of semi-orthogonal subspaces, which can facilitate cross-agent generalization. Some neurons, more common in the posterior hippocampus, had narrow tuning functions reminiscent of place cells, lower firing rates, and high information per spike; others, which were found in both anterior and posterior hippocampus, had broad tuning functions, higher firing rates, and less information per spike. Semi-orthogonalization was selectively associated with the broadly tuned neurons. These results suggest an answer to the problem of navigational individuation, that is, how mapping codes can distinguish different agents, and establish the neuronavigational foundations of pursuit.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911921

Prx1/AhpC-type peroxiredoxins are found throughout the eukaryotic kingdom, where multiple isoforms frequently coexist within the same cell and even in the same subcellular compartment. Long thought to form exclusively homooligomeric structures, we reveal that heterooligomerization is a conserved and important feature of eukaryotic Prx1/AhpC-type peroxiredoxins. We demonstrate that heterooligomer formation modulates peroxoredoxin oligomeric state and enhances structural stability. In yeast, Tsa1-Tsa2 peroxiredoxin heterodecamers form in response to oxidative stress and incorporated Tsa2 stabilizes the decameric state. Beyond yeast, we show that human PRDX1 and PRDX2, as well as plant and parasitic peroxiredoxins, engage in functional heterooligomerization. These findings challenge the long-held paradigm of peroxiredoxin homooligomerization and reveal a novel mechanism for regulating redox homeostasis. Our study provides new insights into peroxiredoxin structural plasticity with broad implications for redox biology, stress responses, and cellular adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1742162911921
