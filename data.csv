Previous studies support that pasteurization effectively inactivates avian influenza in milk and an earlier retail milk survey showed viral RNA, but no live virus could be detected in the dairy products tested. Because of the variety of products and processing methods in which milk is used, additional product testing was conducted to determine if HPAI viral RNA could be detected in retail dairy samples, and for positive quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) samples to be tested for presence of live virus. Revised protocols were developed to extract RNA from solid dairy products including cheese and butter. The solid dairy product was mechanically liquified with garnet and zirconium beads in a bead beater diluted 1 to 4 with BHI media. This pre-processing step was suitable in allowing efficient RNA extraction with standard methods. Trial studies were conducted with different cheese types with spiked in avian influenza virus to show that inoculation of the liquified cheese into embryonating chicken eggs was not toxic to the embryos and allowed virus replication. A total of 167 retail dairy samples, including a variety of cheeses, butter, ice cream, and fluid milk were collected as part of nationwide survey. A total of 17.4% (29/167) of the samples had detectable viral RNA by qRT-PCR targeting the matrix gene, but all samples were negative for live virus after testing with embryonating egg inoculation. The viral RNA was also evaluated by sequencing part of the hemagglutinin gene using a revised protocol optimized to deal with the fragmented viral RNA. The sequence analysis showed all viral RNA positive samples were highly similar to previously reported HPAI dairy cow isolates. Using the revised protocols, it was determined that HPAI viral RNA could be detected in a variety of dairy products, but existing pasteurizations methods effectively inactivate virus assuring consumer safety.","NA","medrxiv",1723673345366

AIM-NASH demonstrated high repeatability and reproducibility compared to manual scoring. AIM-NASH-assisted reads by expert MASH pathologists were superior to unassisted reads in accurately assessing inflammation, ballooning, NAS >= 4 with >=1 in each score category, and MASH resolution, while maintaining non-inferiority in steatosis and fibrosis assessment. These findings suggest AIM-NASH could mitigate reader variability, providing a more reliable assessment of therapeutics in MASH clinical trials.","NA","medrxiv",1723673345367

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

Although the importance of t-tubules is well established, and abnormalities are found in multiple muscle disorders, the mechanisms of t-tubule growth are currently unknown. We found that the branched actin nucleator Arp2/3 regulates t-tubule organisation in myofibers. Cortical actin limits t-tubule growth, suggesting that it must be locally disassembled to allow the t-tubule to grow. T-tubule overgrowth is limited by Arpc5-containing Arp2/3 iso-complexes, but not those containing Arpc5L. Loss of Arpc5 results in malformed t-tubule clusters, impaired triads, and asynchronous muscle contraction, as found in multiple muscle disorders. Therefore, limiting t-tubule overgrowth has a role in triad formation and myofiber contraction, providing a possible pathophysiological mechanism for these muscle disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

In Eurasia, prehistoric migration and population replacement have affected present-day humans. The available high-quality genetic evidence for prehistoric migration in eastern Eurasia, particularly in the Far East, is still limited. We succeeded in obtaining low-contaminant, high-coverage genomes from middle-Yayoi (>46-fold coverage) and Initial Jomon (>67-fold coverage) individuals from mainland Japan. This study demonstrated that the Yayoi individual exhibited a genetic profile distinct from that of the indigenous Jomon population of the Japanese archipelago, suggesting that Yayoi ancestry was connected to the peopling of the Eurasian continent. Our high-coverage genome provides interesting insights into the evolution of copy number polymorphisms related to the dietary styles of ancient Japanese people. The copy number estimates of the amylase gene for the Yayoi individual were comparable to those of present-day East Asians who have diets high in starch. This suggests that the population in the middle Yayoi period may have already adapted to high-starch diets, which may have been related to paddy rice agriculture introduced from the continent. Furthermore, the individual from the initial Jomon period showed high amylase copy numbers comparable to those from modern East Eurasia, including modern Japanese. This suggests that some Jomon people may have consumed a high-starch diet then. The high-coverage whole-genome sequence also revealed differences in the demographic backgrounds of the two ancestral populations during the Yayoi and Jomon periods. Our results shed light on the prehistorical events and origins of related migrations from Eurasia at that time and their genetic background, cultural transformations, and links to modern Japanese people.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

As a notable example, growth plate hypertrophic chondrocytes use cellular biogenesis and disproportionate fluid uptake to expand 10 to 20 times in size to drive lengthening of endochondral bone. Similarly, notochordal cells expand to one of the largest cell types in the developing embryo to drive axial extension. In zebrafish, the notochord vacuolated cells undergo vacuole fusion to form a single large, fluid-filled vacuole that fills the cytoplasmic space and contributes to vacuolated cell expansion. When this process goes awry the notochord lacks sufficient hydrostatic pressure to support vertebral bone deposition resulting in adult spines with misshapen vertebral bones and scoliosis. However, it remains unclear whether endochondral bone and the notochord share common genetic and cellular mechanisms for regulating cell and tissue expansion. Here, we demonstrate that the 5'inositol phosphatase gene, inppl1a, regulates notochord expansion, spine morphogenesis, and endochondral bone lengthening in zebrafish. Furthermore, we show that inppl1a regulates notochord expansion independent of vacuole fusion, thereby genetically decoupling these processes. We demonstrate that inppl1a dependent notochord expansion is essential to establish normal mechanical properties of the notochord to facilitate the development of a straight spine. Finally, we find that inppl1a is also important for endochondral bone lengthening in fish, as has been shown in the human INPPL1 related endochondral bone disorder Opsismodysplasia. Overall, this work reveals a conserved mechanism of cell size regulation that influences disparate tissues critical for skeletal development and short stature disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

Establishing methods to induce membrane rupture of organelles of interest is essential to analyze the downstream effects of membrane rupture; however, the spatiotemporal induction of rupture of specific membranes remains challenging. Here, we develop a series of optogenetic tools to induce organelle membrane rupture by using engineered Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), whose primary function is to form membrane pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) during apoptosis. When BAX is forced to target mitochondria, lysosomes, or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by replacing its C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) with organelle-targeting sequences, the BAX mutants rupture their target membranes. To regulate the activity of organelle-targeted BAX, the photosensitive light-oxygen-voltage-sensing 2 (LOV2) domain is fused to the N-terminus of BAX. The resulting LOV2-BAX fusion protein exhibits blue light-dependent membrane-rupture activity on various organelles, including mitochondria, the ER, and lysosomes. Thus, LOV2-BAX enables spatiotemporal induction of membrane rupture across a broad range of organelles, expanding research opportunities on the consequences of organelle membrane disruption.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

During cap-snatching, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (FluPol) binds to host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and the emerging transcript2,3. The FluPol endonuclease then cleaves a capped RNA fragment that sub-sequently acts as a primer for the transcription of viral genes4,5. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of FluPol bound to a transcribing Pol II in complex with the elongation factor DSIF in the pre-cleavage state. The structure shows that FluPol directly interacts with both Pol II and DSIF, which position the FluPol endonuclease domain near the RNA exit channel of Pol II. These interactions are important for the endonuclease activity of FluPol and FluPol activity in cells. A second structure trapped after cap-snatching shows that cleavage rearranges the capped RNA primer within the FluPol, directing the capped RNA 3'-end towards the FluPol polymerase active site for viral transcription initiation. Altogether, our results provide the molecular mechanisms of co-transcriptional cap-snatching by FluPol.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

The tournament consists of an in silico round, predicting biophysical properties from protein sequences, followed by an in vitro round where novel protein sequences are designed, expressed and characterized using automated methods. Upon completion, all datasets, experimental protocols, and methods are made publicly available. We detail the structure and outcomes of a pilot Tournament involving seven protein design teams, powered by six multi-objective datasets, with experimental characterization by our partner, International Flavors and Fragrances.

Ten extant subfamilies are currently described and Macropathinae, which comprises the entirety of the fauna in South America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, is thought to be the most ancient of these. The New Zealand rhaphidophorid fauna supports high phylogenetic diversity throughout its mesic zone, with most species occurring above-ground. In contrast, the Australian fauna is poorly known, with an apparently greater relative proportion of species utilising caves as refugia. A robust phylogenetic framework is needed to underpin future taxonomic work on the group and potentially contrasting patterns of taxonomic diversity within Macropathinae. Here, we performed fossil-calibrated phylogenetic analysis using whole mitochondrial genomes and nuclear markers to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Macropathinae, with a focus on the Australian fauna. By dramatically increasing taxon sampling relative to past studies, we recover the Australian fauna as rampantly polyphyletic, with the remaining Macropathinae nested amongst six distinct Australian lineages. Deep divergences between major clades imply additional Australian lineages remain undetected, either due to extinction or sampling bias, and have likely confounded past biogeographic signal. We infer the radiation of Macropathinae began during the Lower Jurassic prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana with a potential Pangaean origin for Rhaphidophoridae. Finally, we find evidence for several undescribed taxa of Australian Rhaphidophoridae, all of which qualify as short-range endemics, and discuss the conservation implications of these restricted distributions.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

Multivariable regression analysis investigated associations between quartiles of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate, and total fat, including saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats), dietary components (sodium, potassium, dietary fiber, and sodium-to-potassium ratio), and sleep variables (total sleep time [TST], sleep latency [SL], and % wakefulness after sleep onset [%WASO]).

Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI).

ResultsHigher protein intake was associated with longer TST in the 3rd (B = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.26) and 4th quartiles (B = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.27). Higher total fat intake was linked to shorter TST in the 3rd (B = -0.11, 95% CI = -0.20, -0.27) and 4th quartiles (B = -0.16, 95% CI = -0.25, -0.07). Higher carbohydrate intake was associated with shorter %WASO in the 3rd (B = -0.82, 95% CI = -1.37, -0.26) and 4th quartiles (B = -0.57, 95% CI = -1.13, -0.01), while higher total fat intake was linked to longer %WASO in the 4th quartile (B = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.06, 1.18). Higher dietary fiber intake was consistently associated with longer TST in the 3rd (B = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.02, 0.19) and 4th quartiles (B = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.26), shorter SL in the 2nd (B = -1.71, 95% CI = -2.66, -0.76), 3rd (B = -2.23, 95% CI = -3.19, -1.27), and 4th quartiles (B = -2.30, 95% CI = -3.27, -1.33), and shorter %WASO in the 2nd (B = -1.06, 95% CI = -1.61, -0.51), 3rd (B = -1.04, 95% CI = -1.59, -0.48), and 4th quartiles (B = -1.05, 95% CI = -1.61, -0.48). A higher sodium-to-potassium ratio was linked to shorter TST in the 3rd (B = -0.11, 95% CI = -0.20, -0.02) and 4th quartiles (B = -0.19, 95% CI = -0.28, -0.10), longer SL in the 2nd (B = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.08, 1.98) and 4th quartiles (B = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.53, 2.47), and longer %WASO in the 4th quartile (B = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.15, 1.28). Compositional data analysis, involving 6% changes in macronutrient proportions, showed higher protein intake correlated with longer TST (B = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.18, 0.35), while more monounsaturated fats were linked to longer SL (B = 4.64, 95% CI = 1.93, 7.34) and %WASO (B = 2.21, 95% CI = 0.63, 3.78). Higher polyunsaturated fat intake correlated with shorter TST (B = -0.22, 95% CI = -0.39, -0.05), shorter SL (B = -4.72, 95% CI = -6.58, -2.86), and shorter %WASO (B = -2.00, 95% CI = -3.08, -0.92).

ConclusionsThese findings highlight the intricate relationships between dietary factors and sleep outcomes. Prospective studies are warranted to determine whether dietary interventions result in positive sleep outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1723673345367

Previous studies, including our own research, have shown that specific interneuron subtypes are closely associated with particular pyramidal neuron types, forming stereotyped local inhibitory microcircuits. However, the developmental processes that establish these precise networks are not well understood. Here we show that pyramidal neuron types are instrumental in driving the terminal differentiation and maintaining the survival of specific associated interneuron subtypes. In a wild-type cortex, the relative abundance of different interneuron subtypes aligns precisely with the pyramidal neuron types to which they synaptically target. In Fezf2 mutant cortex, characterized by the absence of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons and an expansion of layer 6 intratelencephalic neurons, we observed a corresponding decrease in associated layer 5b interneurons and an increase in layer 6 subtypes. Interestingly, these shifts in composition are achieved through mechanisms specific to different interneuron types. While SST interneurons adjust their abundance to the change in pyramidal neuron prevalence through the regulation of programmed cell death, parvalbumin interneurons alter their identity. These findings illustrate two key strategies by which the dynamic interplay between pyramidal neurons and interneurons allows local microcircuits to be sculpted precisely. These insights underscore the precise roles of extrinsic signals from pyramidal cells in the establishment of interneuron diversity and their subsequent integration into local cortical microcircuits.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

However, the scalability of microalgae as a bioresource has been hindered by challenges such as costly biomass production related to vulnerability to pond crashes during large-scale cultivation. This study presents a pipeline for the genetic engineering and pilot-scale production of biodiesel and thermoplastic polyurethane precursors in the extremophile species Chlamydomonas pacifica. This extremophile microalga exhibits exceptional resilience to high pH, high salinity, and elevated temperatures. Initially, we evolved this strain to also have a high tolerance to high light intensity through mutagenesis, breeding, and selection. Subsequently, we genetically engineered C. pacifica to produce high levels of lipids and starch without compromising growth. We demonstrated the scalability of these engineered strains by cultivating them in pilot-scale raceway ponds and converting the resulting biomass into biodiesel and thermoplastic polyurethanes. This study showcases the complete cycle of transforming a newly discovered species into a commercially relevant commodity production strain. This research underscores the potential of extremophile algae, including C. pacifica, as a key species for the burgeoning sustainable bioeconomy, offering a viable path forward in mitigating environmental challenges and supporting global bioproduct demands.

Here, we sought to study the effects of a modified version of inflammatory soup on the excitability of human stem-cell derived sensory neurons. For this, we used a pre-existing and a novel stem cell line, modified to stably express the calcium sensor GCamP6f. Upon treatment with inflammatory soup, we observed no changes in neuronal transcription or functional responses upon calcium imaging, and only a very minor increase in resting membrane potential via whole cell patch clamping. Similarly small changes were observed when treating mouse primary sensory neurons with inflammatory soup. A semi-systematic re-examination of past literature further indicated that observed effects of inflammatory mediators on dissociated sensory neuron cultures are generally very small. We conclude that modelling inflammation-induced peripheral sensitization in vitro is non-trivial and will require careful selection of mediators and/or more complex, longitudinal multi-cellular setups. Especially in the latter, our novel GCamP6f induced-pluripotent stem cell line may be of value.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

Academic publishers are adapting to the transformative role of AI chatbots in producing or facilitating scientific research. This study aimed to examine the policies established by scientific, technical, and medical academic publishers for defining and regulating the responsible authors use of AI chatbots.

MethodsThis study performed a cross-sectional audit on the publicly available policies of 163 academic publishers, indexed as members of the International Association of the Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers (STM). Data extraction of publicly available policies on the webpages of all STM academic publishers was performed independently in duplicate with content analysis reviewed by a third contributor (September 2023 - December 2023). Data was categorized into policy elements, such as  proofreading and  image generation. Counts and percentages of  yes (i.e., permitted),  no, and  N/A were established for each policy element.

ResultsA total of 56/163 (34.4%) STM academic publishers had a publicly available policy guiding the authors use of AI chatbots. No policy allowed authorship accreditations for AI chatbots (or other generative technology). Most (49/56 or 87.5%) required specific disclosure of AI chatbot use. Four policies/publishers placed a complete ban on the use of AI tools by authors.

ConclusionsOnly a third of STM academic publishers had publicly available policies as of December 2023. A re-examination of all STM members in 12-18 months may uncover evolving approaches toward AI chatbot use with more academic publishers having a policy.","NA","medrxiv",1723673345367

These various TLRa-SNP adjuvant constructs induce unique acute cytokine and immune-signaling profiles, leading to specific Th-responses that could be of interest depending on the target disease for prevention. In a murine vaccine study, the adjuvants greatly improved the potency, durability, breadth, and neutralization of both COVID-19 and HIV vaccine candidates, suggesting the potential broad application of these adjuvant constructs to a range of different antigens. Overall, this work demonstrates a modular TLRa-SNP adjuvant platform which could improve the design of vaccines for and dramatically impact modern vaccine development.

To answer this question, we recorded M1 activity while monkeys performed a variety of tasks with the forearm in a range of postures. We found that posture- and goal-related components of neural population activity were separable and resided in nearly orthogonal subspaces. The posture subspace was stable across tasks. Within each task, neural trajectories for each goal had similar shapes across postures. Our results reveal a simpler organization of posture information in M1 than previously recognized. The compartmentalization of posture and goal information might allow the two to be flexibly combined in the service of our broad repertoire of actions.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

Most mammals are susceptible to progressive age-related hearing loss; however, the evolution of biosonar, which requires the ability to hear low-intensity echoes from outgoing sonar signals, may have selected against the development of hearing deficits in echolocating bats. Although many echolocating bats exhibit exceptional longevity and rely on acoustic behaviors for survival to old age, relatively little is known about the aging bat auditory system. In this study, we used DNA methylation to estimate the ages of wild-caught big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and measured hearing sensitivity in young and aging bats using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). We found no evidence for hearing deficits in aging bats, demonstrated by comparable thresholds and similar ABR wave and DPOAE amplitudes across age groups. We additionally found no significant histological evidence for cochlear aging, with similar hair cell counts, afferent, and efferent innervation patterns in young and aging bats. Here we demonstrate that big brown bats show minimal evidence for age-related loss of peripheral hearing sensitivity and therefore represent informative models for investigating mechanisms that may preserve hearing function over a long lifetime.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

Basal cells are tissue-resident airway stem cells that enact regeneration, yet the mechanisms regulating their proliferation and differentiation remain incompletely understood. To identify compounds that promote primary human airway basal cell proliferation, we performed phenotype-based compound screening of 1,429 compounds (from the ENZO and Prestwick chemical libraries) in 384-well format using cells transduced with lentiviral luciferase. 16 pro-proliferative compounds validated in independent donor cell cultures, with several hit compounds activating the Wnt signalling pathway. The effects of compounds on proliferation were further explored in concentration-response, colony formation and 3D organoid assays. Structurally and functionally related compounds that more potently induced both Wnt activation and basal cell proliferation were investigated. One such compound, 1-azakenpaullone, induced Wnt target gene activation and basal cell proliferation in mice in the absence of tracheal injury. Our results demonstrate the pro-proliferative effect of small-molecule Wnt activators on airway basal cells.

Despite their tight companionship with humans, yeast species that are domesticated or pathogenic can also live on trees. Here we used over 300 genomes of S. cerevisiae from oaks and other trees to determine whether tree-associated populations are genetically distinct from domesticated lineages and estimate the timing of forest lineage divergence. We found populations on trees are highly structured within Europe, Japan, and North America. Approximate estimates of when forest lineages diverged out of Asia and into North America and Europe coincide with the end of the last ice age, the spread of agriculture, and the onset of fermentation by humans. It appears that migration from human-associated environments to trees is ongoing. Indeed, patterns of ancestry in the genomes of three recent migrants from the trees of North America to Europe could be explained by the human response to the Great French Wine Blight. Our results suggest that human-assisted migration affects forest populations, albeit rarely. Such migration events may even have shaped the global distribution of S. cerevisiae. Given the potential for lasting impacts due to yeast migration between human and natural environments, it seems important to understand the evolution of human commensals and pathogens in wild niches.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

Currently, age-related chronic diseases account for over 90% of annual healthcare expenditures (more than $4.1 trillion) in the US alone. Thus, new therapies to improve healthspan and reduce the burden of chronic disease are needed. Herein, we conducted a phase 3 controlled clinical trial to evaluate the biological age (BA) effects of different therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) modalities in ambulatory individuals. We longitudinally profiled the subjects to measure changes in the epigenome, proteome, metabolome, glycome, and shifts in immune cell composition (cytomics). We demonstrate that administering TPE supplemented with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (TPE-IVIG) on a biweekly regime (two sessions in the first week, followed by a three-week break) is a robust therapy for BA rejuvenation. This intervention induced coordinated cellular and molecular  omics responses, reversed age-related immune decline, and modulated key cellular senescence-associated proteins. Integrative analysis revealed baseline biomarkers associated with successful responses, indicating that TPE-IVIG treatment benefits those with a poorer baseline health status. In summary, this is the first multi-omics study to examine the effectiveness of various TPE modalities, which demonstrate biological age rejuvenation and the molecular features associated with this rejuvenation.","NA","medrxiv",1723673345367

GroEL also binds translating ribosomes in vivo, suggesting an additional role in cotranslational folding. Here, we used biochemical reconstitution, structural proteomics and electron microscopy to study the mechanism by which GroEL/ES engages nascent polypeptides. We show that GroEL binds nascent chains on the inside of its cavity via the apical domains and disordered C-terminal tails, resulting in local structural destabilization of the substrate. Ribosome-tethered nascent proteins are partially encapsulated upon GroES binding to GroEL, and refold in the chaperonin cavity. Reconstitution of chaperone competition at the ribosome shows that both Trigger factor and GroEL can be accommodated on long nascent chains, but GroEL and DnaK are mutually antagonistic. Our findings extend the role of GroEL/ES in de novo protein folding, and reveal an unexpected plasticity of the chaperonin mechanism that allows cotranslational substrate encapsulation.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

There is evidence that distinct movements can be generated by changes in activity dynamics within a common pool of motoneurons, or by selectively engaging specific subsets of motoneurons in a task-dependent manner. However, in most cases we have an incomplete understanding of the patterns of motoneuron activity that generate distinct actions and how upstream premotor circuits select and assemble such motor programmes. In this study, we used two closely related but kinematically distinct types of saccadic eye movement in larval zebrafish as a model to examine circuit control of movement diversity. In contrast to the prevailing view of a final common pathway, we found that in oculomotor nucleus, distinct subsets of motoneurons were engaged for each saccade type. This type-specific recruitment was topographically organised and aligned with ultrastructural differ-ences in motoneuron morphology and afferent synaptic innervation. Medially located motoneu-rons were active for both saccade types and circuit tracing revealed a type-agnostic premotor pathway that appears to control their recruitment. By contrast, a laterally located subset of motoneurons was specifically active for hunting-associated saccades and received premotor in-put from pretectal hunting command neurons. Our data support a model in which generalist and action-specific premotor pathways engage distinct subsets of motoneurons to elicit varied movements of the same body part that subserve distinct behavioural functions.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

Immunoglobulin and T cell receptor loci of most bat species have not been annotated, despite the recurrent role of bats as viral reservoirs and sources of zoonotic pathogens. We investigated the genetic structure and function of IgH loci across the largest bat family, Vespertilionidae, focusing on big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). We discovered that E. fuscus and ten other species within Vespertilionidae have two complete, functional, and distinct immunoglobulin heavy chain loci on separate chromosomes. This locus organization is previously unknown in mammals, but is reminiscent of more limited duplicated loci in teleost fish. Single cell transcriptomic data validate functional rearrangement and expression of immunoglobulin heavy chains of both loci in the expressed repertoire of Eptesicus fuscus, with maintenance of allelic exclusion, bias of usage toward the smaller and more compact IgH locus, and evidence of differential selection of antigen-experienced B cells and plasma cells varying by IgH locus use. This represents a unique mechanism for mammalian humoral immunity and may contribute to bat resistance to viral pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

Using a chemical-genetic approach, we identified genes in Escherichia coli that are important for growth in G4-stabilizing conditions. Reducing levels of elongation factor Tu or slowing translation elongation with chloramphenicol suppress the effects of G4 stabilization. In contrast, reducing expression of certain translation termination or ribosome recycling proteins is detrimental to growth in G4-stabilizing conditions. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses demonstrate that ribosome assembly factors and other proteins involved in translation are less abundant in G4-stabilizing conditions. Our integrated systems approach allowed us to propose a model for how RNA G4s can present barriers to E. coli growth and that reducing the rate of translation can compensate for G4-related stress.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

The class A beta-lactamase blaTEM-1 is often carried by co-amoxiclav-resistant pathogens, but exhibits high phenotypic heterogeneity, making genotype-phenotype predictions challenging. We present a curated dataset of n=377 E. coli isolates representing all 8 known phylogroups, where the only acquired beta-lactamase is blaTEM-1. For all isolates, we generate hybrid assemblies and co-amoxiclav MICs, and for a subset (n=67/377), blaTEM-1 qPCR expression data. First, we test whether certain E. coli lineages are intrinsically better or worse at expressing blaTEM-1, for example, due to lineage differences in regulatory systems, which are challenging to directly quantify. Using genotypic features of the isolates (blaTEM-1 promoter variants and copy number), we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model for blaTEM-1 expression that controls for phylogeny. We establish that blaTEM-1 expression intrinsically varies across the phylogeny, with some lineages (e.g. phylogroups B1 and C, ST12) better at expression than others (e.g. phylogroups E and F, ST372). Next, we test whether phylogenetic variation in expression influences the resistance of the isolates. With a second model, we use genotypic features (blaTEM-1 promoter variants, copy number, duplications; ampC promoter variants; efflux pump AcrF presence) to predict isolate MIC, again controlling for phylogeny. Lastly, we use a third model to demonstrate that the phylogenetic influence on blaTEM-1 expression causally drives the variation in co-amoxiclav MIC. This underscores the importance of incorporating phylogeny into genotype-phenotype predictions, and the study of resistance more generally.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

Hence, technologies for producing authentically glycosylated IgGs are in high demand. While attempts to engineer Escherichia coli for this purpose have been described, they have met limited success due in part to the lack of available oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) enzymes that can install N-linked glycans within the QYNST sequon of the IgG CH2 domain. Here, we identified a previously uncharacterized single-subunit OST (ssOST) from the bacterium Desulfovibrio marinus that exhibited greatly relaxed substrate specificity and, as a result, was able to catalyze glycosylation of native CH2 domains in the context of both a hinge-Fc fragment and a full-length IgG. Although the attached glycans were bacterial in origin, conversion to a homogeneous, asialo complex-type G2 N-glycan at the QYNST sequon of the E. coli-derived hinge-Fc was achieved via chemoenzymatic glycan remodeling. Importantly, the resulting G2-hinge-Fc exhibited strong binding to human Fc{gamma}RIIIa (CD16a), one of the most potent receptors for eliciting antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Taken together, the discovery of DmPglB provides previously unavailable biocatalytic capabilities to the bacterial glycoprotein engineering toolbox and opens the door to using E. coli for the production and glycoengineering of human IgGs and fragments derived thereof.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

Despite this initial effort, the proportion of COVID-19 patients treated with CCP during the first two years of the pandemic (2020-2021) was very low (approximately 2% of individuals hospitalized for COVID-19). In this study, we estimated the number of actual inpatient lives saved by CCP treatment in Italy using national mortality data, and CCP mortality reduction data from meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and real-world data.

Consequently, aggregate copy numbers are typically analyzed, overlooking variation between gene copies.

Pangenomes contain diverse sequences of gene copies and enable the study of sequence-resolved CNVs. We developed a method, ctyper, to discover sequence-resolved CNVs in NGS data by leveraging CNV genes from pangenomes. From 118 public assemblies, we constructed a database of 3,351 CNV genes, distinguishing each gene copy as a resolved allele. We used phylogenetic trees to organize alleles into highly similar allele-types that revealed events of linked small variants due to stratification, structural variation, conversion, and duplication. Saturation analysis showed that new samples share an average of 97.8% CNV alleles with the database. The ctyper method traces individual gene copies in NGS data to their nearest alleles in the database and identifies allele-specific copy numbers using multivariate linear regression on k-mer counts and phylogenetic clustering. Applying ctyper to 1000 Genomes Project (1kgp) samples showed Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium on 99.3% of alleles and a 97.6% F1 score on genotypes based on 641 1kgp trios. Leave-one-out analysis on 39 assemblies matched to 1kgp samples showed that 96.5% of variants in query sequences match the genotyped allele. Genotyping 1kgp data revealed 226 population-specific CNVs, including a conversion on SMN2 to SMN1, potentially impacting Spinal Muscular Atrophy diagnosis in Africans.

Our results revealed two models of CNV: recent CNVs due to ongoing duplications and polymorphic CNVs from ancient paralogs missing from the reference. To measure the functional impact of CNVs, after merging allele-types, we conducted genome-wide Quantitative Trait Locus analysis on 451 1kgp samples with Geuvadis rRNA-seqs. Using a linear mixed model, our genotyping enables the inference of relative expression levels of paralogs within a gene family. In a global evolutionary context, 150 out of 1,890 paralogs (7.94%) and 546 out of 16,628 orthologs (3.28%) had significantly different expression levels, suggesting divergent expression from original genes. Specific examples include lower expression on the converted SMN and increased expression on translocated AMY2B (GTEx pancreas data). Our method enables large cohort studies on complex CNVs to uncover hidden health impacts and overcome reference bias.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

However, the translation from patterns of allele frequency change to rapid adaptation of complex traits remains unresolved. We used abdominal pigmentation in Drosophila melanogaster as a model phenotype to address the nature, genetic architecture, and repeatability of rapid adaptation in the field. We show that D. melanogaster pigmentation evolves as a highly parallel and deterministic response to shared environmental gradients across latitude and season in natural North American populations. We then experimentally evolved replicate, genetically diverse fly populations in field mesocosms to remove any confounding effects of demography and/or cryptic structure that may drive patterns in wild populations; we show that pigmentation rapidly responds, in parallel, in fewer than ten generations. Thus, pigmentation evolves concordantly in response to spatial and temporal climatic gradients. We next examined whether phenotypic differentiation was associated with allele frequency change at loci with established links to genetic variance in pigmentation in natural populations. We found that across all spatial and temporal scales, phenotypic patterns were associated with variation at pigmentation-related loci, and the sets of genes we identified in each context were largely nonoverlapping. Therefore, our findings suggest that parallel phenotypic evolution is associated with an unpredictable genomic response, with distinct components of the polygenic architecture shifting across each environmental gradient to produce redundant adaptive patterns.

Significance StatementShifts in global climate conditions have heightened our need to understand the dynamics and pace of adaptation in natural populations. In order to anticipate the population-level response to rapidly changing environmental conditions, we need to understand whether trait evolution is predictable over short timescales, and whether the genetic basis of adaptation is shared or distinct across multiple timescales. Here, we explored parallelism in the adaptive response of a complex phenotype, D. melanogaster pigmentation, to shared conditions that varied over multiple spatiotemporal scales. Our results demonstrate that while phenotypic adaptation proceeds as a predictable response to environmental gradients, even over short timescales, the genetic basis of the adaptive response is variable and nuanced across spatial and temporal contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

Recent intracortical BMIs have shown unprecedented successes in decoding user intentions, however the hand movements restored by FES have largely been limited to predetermined grasps. Restoring dexterous hand movements will require continuous control of many biomechanically linked degrees-of-freedom in the hand, such as wrist and finger flexion, that would form the basis of those movements. Here we investigate the ability to restore simultaneous wrist and finger flexion, which would enable grasping with a controlled hand posture and assist in manipulating objects once grasped. We demonstrate that intramuscular FES can enable monkeys with temporarily paralyzed hands to move their fingers and wrist across a functional range of motion, spanning an average 88.6 degrees at the metacarpophalangeal joint flexion and 71.3 degrees of wrist flexion, and intramuscular FES can control both joints simultaneously in a real-time task. Additionally, we demonstrate a monkey using an intracortical BMI to control the wrist and finger flexion in a virtual hand, both before and after the hand is temporarily paralyzed, even achieving success rates and acquisition times equivalent to able-bodied control with BMI control after temporary paralysis in two sessions.

However, media reporting in the UK has increasingly identified cases of children collapsing in schools, which are claimed to be associated with vaping and putatively the vaping of a drug, variously reported as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)  synthetic cannabis or  spice. We therefore conducted the first study to identify and quantity SCs in e-cigarettes routinely collected from schools. We sampled 27 schools from geographically distinct regions of England, representing a very broad range of social metrics (free school meals, persistent absenteeism, and SEN). The material was sampled by self-submission by individual schools of e-cigarettes seized during normal school operation and transferred to us for analysis via local police forces. We found a remarkably consistent picture where SCs were detected in 17.5 % of all e-cigarettes sampled, and in 21 of 27 (78 %) of all sampled schools. Moreover, the percentage of SC e-cigarettes positively correlated with a metric of social deprivation, the fraction of pupils eligible for free school meals. The SC positive e-cigarettes were almost entirely found in e-cigarette liquid bottles and refillable e-cigarette devices, with very few identified in single use e-cigarette products. Within the positive samples we found an average SC concentration of 1.03 mg mL-1 with a maximum of 3.6 mg mL-1. In contrast to the high prevalence of SCs, few samples contained THC (1.6 %). We suggest that pupils are being sold SC e-cigarettes as  cannabis and may be unaware they are consuming (and sometimes supplying) considerably more harmful drugs. Our findings are immediately crucial to policy policing and healthcare in the UK as well as to educational bodies and schools.","NA","medrxiv",1723673345367

Here, we provide evidence that mitochondrial activity is controlled in a tissue-specific manner through a non-canonical cytoplasmic function of the transcription factor FOXG1. Using zebrafish and human models of the neurodevelopmental disorder, FOXG1 Syndrome, we found that FOXG1 mutations inducing a premature stop codon unexpectedly lead to the production of a short C-terminal peptide. The expression of this truncated protein is responsible for an excess of excitatory neurons and a structural, functional, and translational mitochondrial phenotype in mutants. We demonstrate that this activity is a gain of function, normally carried out by a cleavage product in wildtype. Both peptides promote the translation of mitochondrially-encoded transcripts, are preferentially transported to the mitochondria, and interact with mito-ribosomal proteins. These findings unveil a mechanism that integrates cell fate decisions with metabolic output. Adjusting the dosage of the mutant peptide rescues aspects of FOXG1 Syndrome, offering a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of disorders involving mitochondrial dysfunctions.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

We previously demonstrated that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can enhance or suppress entrainment to rhythmic auditory stimuli, depending on the timing between the electrical and auditory signals, although tACS effects are primarily modulatory. This study further investigated entrainment to tACS and auditory rhythms when the electrical and auditory signals were presented together (Experiment 1, N = 34) or independently (Experiment 2, N = 24; Experiment 3, N = 12). We hypothesized that tACS effects would be more pronounced when the auditory rhythm was made less perceptually salient to reduce the competition with the electrical rhythm. Participants detected silent gaps in modulated or unmodulated noise stimuli. In Experiment 1, auditory stimuli predominated in entraining behavior. While behavioral entrainment to sound rhythms was affected by the modulation depth of the auditory stimulus, entrainment to tACS was not. In Experiment 2, with no rhythmic information from the sound, 16 of 24 participants showed significant behavioral entrainment to tACS, although the most effective tACS frequency varied across participants. An oscillator model with a free parameter for the individual resonance frequency produced profiles similar to those we observed behaviorally. In Experiment 3, both neural and behavioral entrainment to rhythmic sounds were affected by the auditory stimulus frequency, but again the most effective entraining frequency varied across participants. Our findings suggest that tACS effects depend on the individuals preferred frequency when there is no competition with sensory stimuli, emphasizing the importance of targeting individual frequencies in tACS experiments. When both sensory and electrical stimuli are rhythmic and compete, sensory stimuli prevail, indicating the superiority of sensory stimulation in modulating behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

The method is demonstrated by application to the assembly process of the human Nuclear Pore Complex in the context of the reforming nuclear envelope during mitotic cell division, based on live-cell correlated electron tomography, bulk fluorescence correlation spectroscopy-calibrated quantitative live imaging, and a structural model of the fully-assembled Nuclear Pore Complex. Modeling of the assembly process improves the model precision over static integrative structure modeling alone.

However, the gap between the predicted and observed genetic heritability estimates when using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small indel data remains. Large genomic rearrangements, known as structural variants (SVs), have the potential to account for this missing genetic heritability. By leveraging data from two ongoing cohort studies of aging and dementia, the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP), we performed genome-wide association analysis testing around 20,000 common SVs from 1,088 participants with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. A range of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (AD/ADRD) clinical and pathologic traits were examined. Given the limited sample size, no genome-wide significant association was found, but we mapped SVs across 81 AD risk loci and discovered 22 SVs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with GWAS lead variants and directly associated with AD/ADRD phenotypes (nominal P < 0.05). The strongest association was a deletion of an Alu element in the 3'UTR of the TMEM106B gene. This SV was in high LD with the respective AD GWAS locus and was associated with multiple AD/ADRD phenotypes, including tangle density, TDP-43, and cognitive resilience. The deletion of this element was also linked to lower TMEM106B protein abundance. We also found a 22 kb deletion associated with depression in ROSMAP and bearing similar association patterns as AD GWAS SNPs at the IQCK locus. In addition, genome-wide scans allowed the identification of 7 SVs, with no LD with SNPs and nominally associated with AD/ADRD traits. This result suggests potentially new ADRD risk loci not discoverable using SNP data. Among these findings, we highlight a 5.6 kb duplication of coding regions of the gene C1orf186 at chromosome 1 associated with indices of cognitive impairment, decline, and resilience. While further replication in independent datasets is needed to validate these findings, our results support the potential roles of common structural variations in the pathogenesis of AD/ADRD.","NA","medrxiv",1723673345367

While work- and collision-based models do a reasonable job of relating mechanical work to metabolic cost at a system level, these models may not map to the underlying force and work demands of muscle, which directly affects energy expenditure. We collected motion capture, force, electromyography and ultrasound data from the main power producing muscles during uphill and downhill walking between +/- 15% grade. These data were used to evaluate a musculoskeletal modelling approach to simulate muscle force- and work-related costs that could be compared to metabolic power that we measured using indirect calorimetry. Muscle force-related costs (activation heat rate + maintenance heat rate) increased at steeper up- and down-hill grades and were moderately correlated with mean joint moments. Muscle work-related costs (mechanical work rate + shortening / lengthening heat rate) increased as grade became more positive and were strongly correlated with net joint work. Compared to traditional models, the inclusion of a term to account for muscle force-related costs should lead to a more explanatory cost model that maps directly to the mechanical demands of muscle.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

These turns occur as motor sequences accompanied by neural sequences, in which defined neurons activate in a stereotyped order during each turn. Distinct neurons in this sequence respond to sensory cues, anticipate upcoming turn directions, and drive movement, linking key features of this sensorimotor behavior across time.

Epigenetic clocks have been trained almost exclusively using blood-based tissues but there is growing interest in estimating epigenetic age using less-invasive oral-based tissues (i.e., buccal or saliva) in both research and commercial settings. However, differentiated cell types across body tissues exhibit unique DNA methylation landscapes and age-related alterations to the DNA methylome. Applying epigenetic clocks derived from blood-based tissues to estimate epigenetic age of oral-based tissues may introduce biases. We tested the within-person comparability of common epigenetic clocks across five tissue types: buccal epithelial, saliva, dry blood spots, buffy coat (i.e., leukocytes), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We tested 284 distinct tissue samples from 83 individuals aged 9-70 years. Overall, there were significant within-person differences in epigenetic clock estimates from oral-based versus blood-based tissues, with average differences of almost 30 years observed in some age clocks. In addition, most epigenetic clock estimates of blood-based tissues exhibited low correlation with estimates from oral-based tissues despite controlling for cellular proportions and other technical factors. Our findings indicate that application of blood-derived epigenetic clocks in oral-based tissues may not yield comparable estimates of epigenetic age, highlighting the need for careful consideration of tissue type when estimating epigenetic age.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

While cis-meQTLs exhibited population-specific patterns, primarily due to differences in minor allele frequencies, shared cis-meQTLs showed high concordance across ancestries. Notably, cis-heritability estimates revealed significantly higher mean values in the AA population (0.09) compared to the EA population (0.04). Furthermore, we developed population-specific DNAm imputation models using Elastic Net, enabling methylome-wide association studies (MWAS) for 1,976,046 and 2,657,581 methylation sites in EA and AA, respectively.

The mechanisms of lineage restriction remain enigmatic. We previously defined occlusion as a mode of gene silencing wherein affected genes lack the transcriptional potency to be activated by their cognate transcription factors (TFs). Here, we present a comprehensive mechanistic basis of lineage restriction as driven by gene occlusion. Specifically, we show that genes can become occluded simply by the default action of chromatinization in the absence of TF binding, that naive pluripotent stem cells establish full developmental potency via their capacity to erase occlusion, that primed pluripotent cells shut down this deocclusion ability in preparation for differentiation, that differentiating cells become increasingly restricted in their fate potency by the irreversible occlusion of lineage-inappropriate genes, and that stem cells employ placeholder factors (PFs) to protect silent genes needed for later activation from premature occlusion. Collectively, these mechanisms drive lineage restriction whereby the transcriptionally potent portion of the genome shrinks progressively during differentiation, rendering the fate potency of developing cells to also dwindle progressively.

Compaction of the fragmented Golgi facilitates stepwise recruitment of the microtubule nucleation factors AKAP9 and {gamma}-tubulin within a discrete period that corresponds with acentrosomal Golgi-mediated microtubule nucleation. Furthermore, disruption of AKAP9 or {gamma}-tubulin recruitment compromises microtubule nucleation leading to impaired regeneration. Crucially, these mechanisms are conserved in the contexts of in vivo rat sciatic nerve transection and in primary human peripheral neurons.

Results17 interviews with pharmacists (pharmacy owners n=7; employed pharmacists n=6; locums n=4) and 24 with community members (Black African women n=6; other women n=2; young adults aged 18-25 years n=6; transgender people n=6; female sex workers n=4) were carried out. Capability barriers included sub-optimal awareness and knowledge of PrEP, pharmacy facilities, and pharmacist roles in delivering public health services. Opportunity barriers included lack of staff capacity, privacy and pharmacy screening and monitoring facilities. Motivational barriers included a concern that increased access could increase sexually transmitted infections and involve a financial cost. Capability facilitators included awareness raising, HIV and PrEP training and education. Opportunity facilitators included PrEP appointments and the accessibility of pharmacies. Motivational facilitators included a preference for pharmacy delivery over other models (e.g., sexual health, GP), and a belief that it would be discrete and less stigmatising.

ConclusionPharmacy PrEP delivery is acceptable but for it to be feasible, results point to the need for the development of a behaviour change intervention focusing on education, training and awareness raising, targeting pharmacists and community members to stimulate patient activation and de-stigmatise HIV. This intervention would need to be facilitated by system and environmental changes (e.g., commissioning service).

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSLocation, sigma of sexual health clinics and lack of PrEP awareness limits PrEP access for key groups among whom new HIV acquisitions remain high. Previous research and the UK government suggests PrEP provision via community pharmacies as a potential way of improving PrEP access and health equity.

What this study addsThis is the first research study to explore the barriers to and facilitators of pharmacy PrEP delivery for pharmacists and community members in the UK. To increase capabilities and motivation, training and awareness raising is needed. To increase opportunities and motivation, environmental and system level changes are needed.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyResults point to the acceptability of pharmacy PrEP delivery, but for it to be feasible behaviour change interventions supported by system and environmental changes are needed.","NA","medrxiv",1723673345367

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1723673345367

In two areas within the Hill Antechamber and the Dinaledi Chamber this work uncovered concentrations of abundant Homo naledi fossils including articulated, matrix-supported skeletal regions consistent with rapid covering by sediment prior to the decomposition of soft tissue. We additionally re-examine the spatial positioning of skeletal material and associated sediments within the Puzzle Box area, from which abundant H. naledi remains representing a minimum of six individuals were recovered in 2013 and 2014. Multiple lines of evidence exclude the hypothesis that skeletal remains from these three areas come from bodies that decomposed on the floor of the chamber or within a shallow depression prior to burial by sediments. The spatial positioning of skeletal material, the topography of the subsystem, and observations on sediments within and surrounding features exclude the hypothesis that rapid burial by sediment was a result of gravity-driven slumping or spontaneous movement of sediments. We present a minimal hypothesis of hominin cultural burial and test the evidence from all three areas, finding that this hypothesis is most compatible with the pattern of evidence. These results suggest that mortuary behavior including cultural burial was part of the repertoire of Homo naledi.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

The mechanisms of control have been shown to operate at various levels, but there is growing evidence to suggest that rRNA modification patterns play a key role in driving translational modulation of the ribosome. We investigated the intricate relationship between modification status and the decoding activity of the ribosome. We found that the level of 2-O-methylation at specific nucleotides in the rRNA affects the properties of the ribosome, with consequences for both Saccharomyces. cerevisiae cell growth and antibiotic sensitivity. More precisely, we demonstrate that methylations within the peptide exit tunnel play an important role in nascent peptide folding. We also demonstrate the modulation of IRES-driven translation by variable methylation at the intersubunit surface of the 60S ribosomal subunit. These findings deepen our understanding of the mechanisms by which 2-O-methylation confers functional specificity on the ribosome.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1723673345367

For transfer plasmids used in making AAV vectors, which are widely used in gene therapy, about 40% carried mutations in ITR regions due to their inherent instability, which is influenced by flanking GC content. We also list genes difficult to clone into plasmid or package into virus due to their toxicity.

Neither ncRNA nor multinucleated adult human skeletal muscle is ideally studied using sequencing technologies, so using a customised RNA profiling pipeline and quantitative network modelling we studies cell-type specific ncRNA responses during muscle growth at scale. We completed five human resistance-training studies (n=144 subjects) to stimulate growth, and found 61% of individuals successfully accrued muscle mass. One hundred and ten ncRNAs were modulated in vivo and a network model of the muscle transcriptome (n=437) assigned these to functional pathways or single-cell types. We replicated the few known hypertrophy-related ncRNAs, including CYTOR - which in humans was leukocyte-associated in vivo (FDR = 4.9 x10-7). Numerous novel hypertrophy linked ncRNAs included PPP1CB-DT (myofibril assembly genes, FDR = 8.15 x 10-8), and EEF1A1P24 and TMSB4XP8 (vascular remodelling and angiogenesis genes, FDR = 2.77 x 10-5). We discovered that hypertrophy linked MYREM has a specific myonuclear expression pattern in vivo using spatial transcriptomic probes. Our multi-layered analyses established that single-cell type associations of ncRNA are identifiable from bulk muscle transcriptomic data, and that hypertrophy-linked ncRNA genes mediate their association with muscle growth via multiple cell types.

In particular, clustering remains one of the most common tools to dissect the chemical space. Unfortunately, most current approaches present unfavorable time and memory scaling, which makes them unsuitable to handle million- and billion-sized sets. Here, we propose to bypass these problems with a time- and memory-efficient clustering algorithm, BitBIRCH. This method uses a tree structure similar to the one found in the Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies (BIRCH) algorithm to ensure O(N) time scaling. BitBIRCH leverages the instant similarity (iSIM) formalism to process binary fingerprints, allowing the use of Tanimoto similarity, and reducing memory requirements. Our tests show that BitBIRCH is already > 1,000 times faster than standard implementations of the Taylor-Butina clustering for libraries with 1,500,000 molecules. BitBIRCH increases efficiency without compromising the quality of the resulting clusters. We explore strategies to handle large sets, which we applied in the clustering of one billion molecules under 5 hours using a parallel/iterative BitBIRCH approximation.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

MethodsThis study uses the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to investigate the potential relationship between vaccinations and the incidence of NMOSD, AE, and MOGAD. Potential risk factors, such as age, sex, type of vaccine, and previous history of autoimmune diseases, were examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

ResultsOur analysis included 161 cases: 72 NMOSD, 82 AE, and 7 MOGAD. The COVID-19 vaccine was implicated in 19/72 (26.3%) NMOSD, 43/82 (52.4%) of AE and 6/7 (85.7%) of MOGAD. The subacute temporal profile (OR 24.4, p = 0.004) and the presence of any comorbidity (OR 12.49, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with hospitalization for those with NMOSD. The subacute onset of symptoms and encephalopathy was statistically significant for hospitalization (OR 6.15, p = 0.048) and (OR 10.3, p = 0.005) respectively for patients with AE. Anti-NMDAR (N-methyl D-aspartate) antibodies were observed in 16/24 (66.7%) of AE. Treatment often involved high-dose corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

ConclusionsMost cases of vaccine induced NMOSD, AE, and MOGAD occurred secondary to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The subacute onset of symptoms and the presence of encephalopathy was most associated with hospitalization.","NA","medrxiv",1723673345367

To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Warm White Light-Emitting Diode (LED), Cool White LED, Blue LED, and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic Puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation, and husbandry programs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic Puffin strandings remains to be the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine if aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1723673345367

Specifically, we enter n variations of k pattern classes (n*k patterns) onto a cortex-like balanced inhibitory-excitatory network with heterogeneous neurons, and let the pattern spread within the recurrent network. We show that we can identify high mutual-information (MI) neurons as major information-bearing elements within each pattern representation. We employ a simple one-shot adaptive (learning) process focusing on high MI neurons and inhibition. Such  localist plasticity has high efficiency, because it requires only few adaptations for each pattern. Specifically, we store k=10 patterns of size s=400 in a 1000/1200 neuron network. We stimulate high MI neurons and in this way recall patterns, such that the whole network represents this pattern. We assess the quality of the representation (a) before learning, when entering the pattern into a naive network and (b) after learning, on the adapted network, during recall. The recalled patterns could be easily recognized by a trained classifier. The pattern  unfolds over the recurrent network with high similarity, albeit compressed, with respect to the original input pattern. We discuss the distribution of neuron properties in the network, and find that an initial Gaussian or uniform distribution changes into a more heavy-tailed, lognormal distribution during the adaptation process. The remarkable result is that we are able to achieve reliable pattern recall by stimulating only high information neurons. This work has interesting technical applications, and provides a biologically-inspired model of cortical memory.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

The aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity of earwax on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli isolated from skin and stool respectively. Bacteriological investigations were carried out using culture and morphological characteristics, conventional biochemical tests and antibiotic susceptibility testing of both earwax and conventional antibiotics against the presumptive isolates. Occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus (58.3%) and Escherichia coli (45.8%) in skin and stool samples were respectively determined based on cultural and morphological characteristics. Conventional biochemical tests were carried out on the 14 and 10 presumptive Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli isolates and then 10 and 8 presumptive isolates were detected respectively. The antibacterial activity of the test agent was determined using the agar well diffusion technique; five different concentrations (20% v/v, 40% v/v, 60% v/v, 80% v/v, and 100% v/v) of the test agents were evaluated against the bacterial isolates. The earwax showed antibacterial activity against both isolates (except the 20% v/v for Staphylococcus aureus) at all concentrations used with antibacterial activity directly proportional to earwax concentration and a better antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (zone of inhibition 20mm) aureus than Escherichia coli. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out on the 10(41.7%) and 8(33.3%) presumptive isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli respectively based on Kirby Bauer method. Highest rate of susceptibilities of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates to antibiotics were observed in Erythromycin (100%), while for Escherichia coli were observed in Erythromycin and Levofloxacin (100%). Meanwhile, highest rate of resistant to Staphylococcus aureus isolates were observed in Gentamicin (100%) while for Escherichia coli was observed in Amoxicillin (100%). This study shows that earwax plays a critical role in the fight against infectious microorganisms as some of the antibiotics.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to biological alignment. We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins with a chain of thought.

Here, we sequenced and analyzed 382 full-length OROV genomes from human samples collected between 2022 and 2024 from all four states, aiming to trace the origin and genetic evolution of OROV leading to the current outbreak. Genomic analyses revealed that the recent upsurge of OROV cases in the Brazilian Amazon region coincides with the emergence of a novel reassortant viral lineage containing the M segment of viruses detected in the eastern Amazon region from 2009 to 2018 and the L and S segments of viruses detected in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador from 2008 to 2021. The novel reassortant OROV lineage likely emerged in the Central region of the AM state between 2010 and 2014 and displayed a long-range silent dispersion during the second half of the 2010s. The 2022-2024 OROV epidemic was spatially segregated into three major subpopulations located in RR, AMACRO (a bordering region between AC, RO, and AM-Southern region), and AM-Central (which includes the Amazonas capital, Manaus) regions. The peak of OROV transmissions in all regions occurred during the rainy season in the Amazon basin. Furthermore, our phylodynamics reconstructions showed that OROV spread was driven mainly by short-range (< 2 km) movements, with an average dispersal rate [&le;] 1.2 km/day, consistent with the pattern of an active flight of infected vectors. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion (22%) of long-range (> 10 km) OROV migrations were also detected, consistent with viral dispersion via human activities. Our data provides an unprecedented view of the real-time spread and evolution of a neglected emergent human pathogen. Moreover, our results emphasize the need for widespread, long-term genomic surveillance to better understand the real burden of OROV within and beyond the Amazon region.","NA","medrxiv",1723673345367

Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g. upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% and 14% of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56.

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345367

Identifying and controlling dose-dependent transgenes require tools for precisely titrating expression. To this end, we developed a highly modular, extensible framework called DIAL for building editable promoters that allow for fine-scale, heritable changes in transgene expression. Using DIAL, we increase expression by recombinase-mediated excision of spacers between the binding sites of a synthetic zinc finger transcription factor and the core promoter. By nesting varying numbers and lengths of spacers, DIAL generates a tunable range of unimodal setpoints from a single promoter. Through small-molecule control of transcription factors and recombinases, DIAL supports temporally defined, user-guided control of transgene expression that is extensible to additional transcription factors. Lentiviral delivery of DIAL generates multiple setpoints in primary cells and iPSCs. As promoter editing generates stable states, DIAL setpoints are heritable, facilitating mapping of transgene levels to phenotypes. The DIAL framework opens new opportunities for tailoring transgene expression and improving the predictability and performance of gene circuits across diverse applications.

HighlightsPromoter editing generates unimodal setpoints from a single synthetic promoter

DIAL setpoints are tuned by the length of an excisable spacer within the promoter

DIAL setpoints are uniform and robust to varying levels of the transcription factor

DIAL transmits transient inputs into heritable promoter states

The TET-DIAL system enables small-molecule activation at defined setpoints

However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.","NA","biorxiv",1723673345368
