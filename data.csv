These experiments are currently conducted by thousands of high school students and can offer an unprecedented window into biofilm adaptation while building a community of young researchers. Providing high school students access to research experiences improves learning and can have positive and long-lasting impacts on their attitudes towards science. Moreover, student research can make impactful scientific contributions. Through EvolvingSTEM, students evolve populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens in a biofilm bead model and observe heritable changes in colony morphology. Genome sequencing of 70 mutants that they picked identified parallel mutations in genes known to regulate biofilm growth (wsp, yfiBNR, morA, fuzY). We also uncovered novel adaptations: loss-of-function mutations in phosphodiesterase PFLU0185 that did not alter colony morphology, and mutations affecting periplasmic disulfide bond formation producing small colonies. PFLU0185 mutations consistently reached high frequencies and phenotyping revealed roles in cyclic di-GMP regulation, biofilm formation, and motility, prompting us to name this gene bmo (biofilm and motility optimizer). Competition experiments and microscopy demonstrated bmo mutants employ generalist strategies and coexist with the ancestor and specialist mutants through niche differentiation. Consequently, phenotypic diversity is maintained, with smooth (ancestral and bmo) colonies consistently outnumbering wrinkly and fuzzy variants. The study advances understanding of biofilm genetic architecture while demonstrating that student-led research can uncover mechanisms of microbial adaptation relevant to Pseudomonas infection biology and provide transformative STEM experiences. IMPORTANCE: Bacterial biofilms dominate microbial life, yet their evolutionary genetics remain incompletely understood. This science education project engages thousands of high school students in experimental evolution, yielding discoveries about biofilm adaptation while transforming their science education. Selected mutants included PFLU0185/bmo, a conserved phosphodiesterase that helps bacteria balance the competing demands of attachment and dispersal essential for biofilm life cycle success. The finding that smooth-colony generalists rather than conspicuous variants dominate biofilm adaptation adds to our understanding of the process of niche differentiation in biofilms. This work also demonstrates the power of distributed research networks for discovery of new genetic pathways of adaptation. Students gained authentic research experience, potentially inspiring them to join the next generation of scientists, while identifying mutants adapted to discrete conditions that maintain diversity within biofilms. This synergy between education and discovery offers a scalable model for addressing complex biological questions while developing scientific literacy in diverse classrooms.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997233

While allelic pleiotropy describes variant effects on both local and distal genes or a mixture of molecular effects on a single gene, here we specifically investigate allelic expression ""proxitropy"": where a single variant influences the expression of multiple, neighboring genes. We introduce a multi-gene eQTL mapping framework - cis-principal component expression QTL (cis-pc eQTL or pcQTL) - to identify variants associated with shared axes of expression variation across a cluster of neighboring genes. We perform pcQTL mapping in 13 GTEx human tissues and discover novel loci undetected by single-gene approaches. In total, we identify an average of 1396 pcQTLs/tissue, 27% of which were not discovered by single-gene methods. These novel pcQTL colocalized with an additional 142 GWAS trait-associated variants and increased the number of colocalizations by 34% over single-gene QTL mapping. These findings highlight that moving beyond single-gene-at-a-time approaches toward multi-gene methods can offer a more comprehensive view of gene regulation and complex trait-associated variation.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

Because variable RBDs of different SARS-CoV-2 strains must bind to the same human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for viral cell entry and infection, we hypothesize that designing a protein with the same or very similar hACE2 binding interface might have a broad-spectrum effect against various SARS-CoV-2 strains. The designed protein binds specifically to the WT-RBD (with micromolar affinity) but not to RBDs from other SARS-CoV-2 strains. However, two rounds of the E. coli display and Magnetic Cell Sorting (MACS) selection are sufficient to yield a protein named CYN1 with nanomolar binding affinities not only to the WT-RBD but also to those of Omicron BA.1, XBB.1.16, and JN.1. Molecular dynamics simulations and free-energy hotspot analysis revealed that CYN1's broader spectrum capability stems from its engagement of essentially all ACE2 hotspot residues critical for WT-RBD binding, unlike the designed protein. The discovery of CYN1, differing by only four mutations from the designed protein, confirms that targeting the small interface of human viral receptors, rather than the entire receptor, offers a viable strategy for developing broad-spectrum inhibitors. This approach minimizes potential off-target effects arising from receptor multifunctionality.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

This hypothesis seems at odds with evidence from large-scale neuronal recordings in mice showing that neuronal population activity is high-dimensional. To demonstrate that low-dimensional latent dynamics and high-dimensional activity can be two sides of the same coin, we present an analytically solvable recurrent neural network (RNN) model whose dynamics can be exactly reduced to a low-dimensional dynamical system, but generates an activity manifold that has a high linear embedding dimension. This raises the question: Do low-dimensional latents explain the high-dimensional activity observed in mouse visual cortex? Spectral theory tells us that the covariance eigenspectrum alone does not allow us to recover the dimensionality of the latents, which can be low or high, when neurons are nonlinear. To address this indeterminacy, we develop Neural Cross-Encoder (NCE), an interpretable, nonlinear latent variable modeling method for neuronal recordings, and find that high-dimensional neuronal responses to drifting gratings and sponta-neous activity in visual cortex can be reduced to low-dimensional latents, while the responses to natural images cannot. We conclude that the high-dimensional activity measured in certain conditions, such as in the absence of a stimulus, is explained by low-dimensional latents that are nonlinearly processed by individual neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

However, the role of condensates in driving disease etiology remains poorly understood. Here, we identify myeloid leukemia factor 2 (MLF2) as a disease-agnostic biomarker for phase transitions, including stress granules and nuclear condensates associated with dystonia. Exploiting fluorophore-derivatized MLF2 constructs, we developed a high-content platform and computational pipeline to screen modulators of NE condensates across chemical and genetic space. We identified RNF26 and ZNF335 as protective factors that prevent the buildup of nuclear condensates sequestering K48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins. Chemical screening identified four FDA-approved drugs that potently modulate condensates by resolving polyubiquitinated cargo and MLF2 accumulation. Our exploratory integrated chemical-genetics approach suggests that modulation of zinc, and potentially autophagy and oxidative stress, is critical for condensate modulation and nuclear proteostasis, offering potential therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders. Application of our platform to a genome-wide CRISPR KO screen identified strong enrichment of candidate genes linked to primary microcephaly and related neurodevelopmental disorders. Two hypomorphic microcephaly-associated alleles of ZNF335 failed to rescue nuclear condensate accumulation in ZNF335 KO cells, suggesting that aberrant condensates and impaired nuclear proteostasis may contribute to the pathogenesis of microcephaly.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

Each sense organ is composed of two glial cells, called the sheath and socket, and one or more neurons. A major challenge in studying their development has been the lack of methods to directly observe these structures in the embryo. Here, we mine a recently published high-resolution ultrastructural dataset of a comma-stage embryo that provides an untapped resource for visualizing early developmental events. From this dataset we reconstructed all head sense organs (two amphid (AM), four cephalic (CEP), six inner labial (IL), four outer labial quadrant (OLQ), and two outer labial lateral (OLL)). Symmetric sense organs were at different stages of morphogenesis, allowing us to infer developmental steps by which they form. First, we found that the sheath glial cell begins wrapping its partner neurons at the distal tip of the dendrites where it self-fuses into a seamless tube and then ""zippers"" down the dendrite. In many cases, sheath glia wrap the progenitors of partner neurons prior to their terminal division. After sheath wrapping has begun, the socket glia wraps the sheath glia circumferentially before presumably elongating to form the mature sheath-socket channel. We also observed transient interactions not found in the mature animal, such as amphid sheath glia wrapping the AUA neuron, that may reflect ancestral relationships. This study demonstrates the value of large public EM datasets that can be mined for new insights, and sheds light on how neurons and glia undergo coordinated morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

Cyclic peptides offer greater stability and potential oral delivery, but their de novo design with computational methods as agonists is unproven. Here, we used the EvoBind AI platform to design cyclic peptide agonists for GCGR from sequence alone, without any structural templates or prior binding site information. EvoBind consistently identified the receptors activation surface, producing peptides that also activated GLP1R. Of three synthesised peptides, two showed potent dual activation of GCGR and GLP1R in cAMP assays, while all three activate GLP1R, with the 18-residue design achieving EC50 values of 32 nM (GLP1R) and 542 nM (GCGR), rivalling natural hormones. The designed sequences show no similarity to known agonists, and structural modelling indicates that they adopt novel binding modes compatible with active-state stabilisation. This is made possible by EvoBinds purely sequence-based, template-free approach, which enables the discovery of alternative solutions that are inaccessible to structure-guided methods. This study presents the first successful blind de novo design of a cyclic peptide agonist for a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), using only the receptor sequence as input. The findings highlight EvoBinds capacity to go beyond static binding, offering a generalisable strategy for therapeutic discovery through target-agnostic, sequence-driven peptide design.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

Using longitudinal data collected at baseline and Year 2 from 2,949 individuals (ages 8.9-13.5) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, we show that baseline resting-state functional connectivity (FC) more strongly predicts future cognitive ability than concurrent cognitive ability. Models trained on baseline FC to predict baseline cognition generalize better to Year 2 data, suggesting that brain-cognition relationships strengthen over time. Intriguingly, baseline FC outperforms longitudinal FC change in predicting future cognitive ability. Differences in measurement reliability do not fully explain this discrepancy: although FC change is less reliable (intraclass correlation, ICC = 0.24) than baseline FC (ICC = 0.56), matching baseline FC reliability by shortening scan time only partially narrows the predictive gap. Furthermore, neither baseline FC nor FC change meaningfully predicts longitudinal change in cognitive ability. We also identify converging and diverging predictive network features across cross-sectional and longitudinal models of brain-cognition relationships, revealing a multivariate twist on Simpsons paradox. Together, these findings suggest that during early adolescence, stable individual differences in brain functional network organization exert a stronger influence on future cognitive outcomes than short-term changes.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

We investigated the mechanism by which a fungal endophyte, Macrophomina phaseolina (F80), enhances Arabidopsis iron nutrition.
C_LIO_LIFungal-coumarin interactions were assessed by profiling metabolites and measuring iron mobilisation in F80 cultures supplemented with specific coumarins, alongside quantifying growth performance and iron content in Arabidopsis coumarin-biosynthesis mutants inoculated with F80.
C_LIO_LIOur findings reveal that an interaction between the coumarin scopoletin and F80 in the rhizosphere rescues plant growth under iron-limiting conditions by resolving the iron mobility bottleneck. F80 exhibits a capacity to modify scopoletin into iron-chelating catechol coumarin esculetin, thereby releasing available iron.

TDP-43 is a nucleic acid-binding protein involved in transcriptional repression, mRNA splicing, and the regulation of retrotransposable elements (RTEs) and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). RTEs and ERVs are mobile genetic elements that constitute about 45% of our genome. These virus-like elements encode the capacity to replicate through an RNA intermediate and insert cDNA copies at de novo chromosomal locations. Their expression is a proven source of DNA damage and inflammatory signaling. Research in Drosophila has demonstrated a causal role of RTEs/ERVs in mediating both intracellular toxicity of TDP-43 and the intercellular spread of these toxic effects from glia to neurons. RTEs and ERVs are inappropriately expressed in postmortem tissues from ALS, FTD, and Alzheimers Disease (AD) patients, as well as in cell culture in response to TDP-43 disruption, suggesting that the findings in Drosophila may be conserved across species. But the role of RTEs and ERVs has not yet been examined in a vertebrate model of TDP-43 pathology. To investigate the functional contributions of RTEs in vertebrates, we utilized an established transgenic mouse model that overexpresses moderate levels of either human wild-type TDP-43 (hTDP-43-WT) or a mutant version with a specific causal amino acid substitution (hTDP-43-Q331K) associated with some inherited forms of the disease. Through RNA-sequencing of the motor cortex, and imaging of a LINE-1-EGFP retrotransposon indicator cassette, we found that the TDP-43 transgenic animals exhibit broad expression of RTEs and ERVs, along with replication of LINE-1 in glia and neurons in the motor cortex. This expression begins at the age of onset of neurological phenotypes, earlier in the hTDP-43-Q331K animals and much later in hTDP-43-WT. Although the motor defects progressively worsen over time, the LINE-1-EGFP replication reporter transiently labels spatially clustered groups of neurons and glia at the time of onset of motor symptoms. These EGFP-labeled neurons undergo cell death and are therefore lost over time. Unlabeled cells also die as a function of distance from the clusters of LINE-1-EGFP labeled neurons and glial cells. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that TDP-43 pathology triggers RTE/ERV expression in the motor cortex, that such expression marks cells for programmed cell death, with non-cell autonomous effects on nearby neurons and glial cells.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

We introduce GeneChat, a multi-modal large language model designed to generate free-form, natural language descriptions of gene functions directly from nucleotide sequences and textual prompts. GeneChat integrates three components: a DNABERT-2-based gene encoder optimized for long-range genomic context, an adaptor that aligns gene representations with the input space of a large language model, and Vicuna-13B, a fine-tuned LLaMA-2 variant used to produce coherent functional narratives. Trained on over 50,000 genes from the NCBI database, GeneChat outperforms GPT-4o on BLEU and METEOR metrics, demonstrating superior ability to generate accurate, context-aware, and semantically rich descriptions. This work highlights the potential of foundation models for advancing interpretable and scalable gene function prediction in a free-form, language-driven paradigm.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

Caveolar dynamics, such as movement within the plasma membrane or endocytosis, relies on precise shaping of the highly curved caveolar necks. The dynamin-like EHD2 ATPase is proposed to form an oligomeric scaffold around the caveolar neck, but its detailed molecular action is poorly understood. Here, we employed cryo-electron tomography to elucidate structures of EHD2 filaments oligomerized on tubulated liposomes. EHD2 filaments form a highly curved membrane scaffold which stabilizes a sophisticated tubular membrane geometry with undulations along the tube's axis. An amino-terminal sequence facilitates this geometry by inserting into the membrane, thereby acting as a spacer between adjacent filaments. Moreover, in endothelial cells lacking EHD2, caveolar necks become narrower and elongated. Our structural work provides the molecular framework for understanding EHD2 scaffold formation and its cellular function in caveolar dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

However, the quantitative contribution of post-transcriptional mechanisms to cancer transcriptome dynamics remains unclear. Here, we systematically measured mRNA dynamics across diverse breast cancer models, revealing that mRNA stability significantly shapes gene expression variability. To decipher the regulatory grammar underlying these dynamics, we developed GreyHound, an interpretable multimodal deep-learning framework integrating RNA sequence features and RNA-binding protein (RBP) expression. GreyHound identified an extensive network of RBPs and their regulons underlying variations in mRNA stability. Among these, we uncovered a metastasis-suppressive regulatory axis centered on the RNA-binding protein RBMS3 and its post-transcriptional control of the redox regulator TXNIP. Functional and molecular analyses revealed that RBMS3 depletion resulted in targeted transcript destabilization, which was associated with poor clinical outcomes and enhanced metastatic potential in xenograft models. Using in vivo epistasis studies, we confirmed that RBMS3 regulation of TXNIP mRNA stability drives this metastasis-suppressive program. These findings position the RBMS3-TXNIP regulatory axis as a key post-transcriptional mechanism in breast cancer and illustrate how interpretable models of RNA dynamics can uncover hidden regulatory programs in disease.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

We investigated vocal individuality in male territorial calls of two populations of little owls (Athene noctua) with different densities. Further, to explore the potential influence of local population distribution on individuality, we also examined isolated males without neighbours and clumped males with neighbours. Our findings indicate higher individuality at higher densities across both scenarios, measured using two individuality metrics: Beecher's information statistic and Discrimination score. Additionally, clumped males exhibited significantly lower acoustic niche overlaps compared to isolated males, suggesting that the immediate social environment might be more influential than larger-scale population density patterns.

Slowing or reversing the ageing process would therefore drive significant and broad benefits to human health. Previously, the Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, with or without c-MYC: OSK(M)) have been shown to rejuvenate cells based on accurate predictors of age known as epigenetic clocks. Unfortunately, OSK(M) induces dangerous pluripotency pathways, making it unsuitable for therapeutic use. To overcome this therapeutic barrier, we screened for novel factors by optimising directly for age reversal rather than for pluripotency. We trained a transcriptomic ageing clock, unhindered by the low throughput of bulk DNA methylation assays, to enable a screen of unprecedented scale and granularity. Our platform identified SB000, the first single gene intervention to rejuvenate cells from multiple germ layers with efficacy rivalling the Yamanaka factors. Cells rejuvenated by SB000 retain their somatic identity, without evidence of pluripotency or loss of function. These results reveal that decoupling pluripotency from cell rejuvenation does not remove the ability to rejuvenate multiple cell types. This discovery paves the way for cell rejuvenation therapeutics that can be broadly applied across age-driven diseases.

Here, we engineered an optogenetic tool (mt-optoIDR) that allowed for controlled formation of synthetic condensates upon light activation in live mitochondria. Using live cell super-resolution microscopy, we visualized the nucleation of small, yet elongated condensates (mt-opto-condensates), which recapitulated the morphologies of endogenous mitochondrial condensates. We decoupled the contribution of the double membranes from the environment within the matrix by overexpressing the dominant negative mutant of a membrane fusion protein (Drp1K38A). The resulting bulbous mitochondria had significantly more dynamic condensates that coarsened into a single, prominent droplet. These observations inform how mitochondrial membranes can limit the growth and dynamics of the condensates they enclose, without the need of additional regulatory mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

In mammals, the menthol receptor, TRPM8, is activated by temperatures below ~26{degrees}C and is essential for the perception of cold or chemical cooling agents. A fascinating, yet still unachieved goal is to elucidate structural mechanisms whereby TRPM8 or other thermosensitive channels are gated by changes in ambient temperature. Recent studies using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have attempted to address this challenging question but are limited by difficulties in visualizing temperature-evoked conformational substates or assessing the energetic landscape governing gating transitions. Here, we close this gap by using cryo-EM to visualize TRPM8 channels in cellular membranes, where bona fide menthol- and cold-evoked open states are captured. We identify a novel semi-swapped architecture in which interdigitation of channel subunits is substantially rearranged following repositioning of the S6 transmembrane helix and elements of the pore region. By combining this structural analysis with thermodynamic measurements using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we are able to pinpoint the pore and TRP helices as key regions undergoing stimulus-evoked conformational dynamics that drive channel gating. Structural mechanisms associated with activation are validated by comparison of human TRPM8 with the menthol-sensitive, but relatively cold-insensitive avian orthologue. We propose a free energy landscape to explain channel gating by cold or cooling agents.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

PTHrP has been clinically implicated as a putative regulator of cachexia, with serum PTHrP levels correlating with increased weight loss in PDAC patients. Here we show that cachectic PDAC patients have high expression of tumor PTHrP and use a genetically engineered mouse model to functionally demonstrate that deletion of Pthlh (encoding the PTHrP protein) blocks cachectic wasting, dramatically extending overall survival. The re-expression of PTHrP in lowly cachectic models is sufficient to induce wasting and reduce survival in mice, which is reversed by the conditional deletion of the PTHrP receptor, Pth1r, in adipocytes. Mechanistically, tumor-derived PTHrP suppresses de novo lipogenesis in adipocytes, leading to a molecular rewiring of adipose depots to promote wasting in the cachectic state. Finally, the pharmacological disruption of the PTHrP-PTH1R signaling axis abrogates wasting, highlighting that a targeted disruption of tumor-adipose crosstalk is an effective means to limit cachexia.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

We used this system to study the quantitative relationship between Wnt signaling in space and time and the resulting AP patterns. We found that rather than a smoothly varying gradient along the axis, signaling is elevated in midbrain compared to either surrounding region. The timing, rather than the amplitude or duration, of the Wnt response played the most important role in setting axial coordinates. These results establish a simple system for studying the patterning of the human nervous system and elucidate how cells interpret Wnt dynamics to determine their position along the AP axis.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

BMP-dependent patterning of the secondary body axis is ancestral for Bilateria and possibly also for the bilaterian sister clade Cnidaria. However, the variety of levels of centralization of the nervous systems in Bilateria - from diffuse to fully centralized - as well as the lack of centralization of the nervous system in Cnidaria, suggest that BMP signaling cannot be perceived as a universally ""anti-neural"" signal. Here we use transgenic reporter lines in the anthozoan cnidarian Nematostella to show that BMP signaling is active in distinct neuronal populations. Moreover, attenuation of BMP signaling followed by RNA-Seq shows that BMP signaling is a positive regulator of many neuronal genes, including the top-tier neural progenitor marker soxB(2). Further, we analyze BMP signaling activity in the true jellyfish Aurelia and box jellyfish Tripedalia proving that BMP signaling in the diffuse cnidarian nervous system is not an anthozoan but an ancestral cnidarian feature, shared by anthozoans and medusozoans.

Mutations and certain post-translational modifications impact its aggregation propensity and pathogenicity. Glycation, a non-enzymatic modification enhanced during hyperglycemia and aging, both known risk factors for PD, has been implicated in -Syn pathology. Although preformed -Syn-fibrils induce PD-like phenotypes in mice, the impact of glycation on their pathogenicity is unclear. In the current study, we glycated -Syn using methylglyoxal (MGO), a potent glycating agent, resulting in altered biophysical characteristics in comparison to non-glycated -Syn. Glycation inhibited the formation of typical beta sheet structures under aggregating conditions. Despite that, glycated -Syn assemblies induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation to a similar extent as the non-glycated -Syn fibrils upon their injection in the mouse substantia nigra (SN). However, these glycated assemblies triggered higher neuroinflammation and increased accumulation of receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) compared to non-glycated fibrils. Consequently, an earlier onset of neuromuscular deficits and anxiety was observed in these mice. Thus, glycation of -Syn causes distinct PD-associated pathology compared to non-glycated -Syn, causing an earlier onset of motor symptoms. These findings provide insight into how glycation of -Syn due to hyperglycemia may contribute to an increased risk of PD in diabetic populations.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

Despite the large body of research on the neurobiology of stress, we have a poor understanding of how trauma rewires social circuits in the brain. To identify how social circuits are re-organized by stress, we interrogated the role of the ventral hippocampus (VH), a key node for both the orchestration of emotionally-relevant behavior and the integration of sensory information. Using a footshock-based model of traumatic stress, we established that a single exposure to a series of unpredictable, inescapable footshocks was sufficient to negatively alter social behavior, resulting in increased violence and social hesitancy. Critically, we found that stress-induced changes to social behavior engaged neural ensembles in the VH, a critical node in the regulation of emotion states. Using a virally-mediated, activity-dependent cellular tagging approach to label two neural ensembles activated by temporally distinct experiences, we were surprised to find that stress-induced violence and stress-induced social hesitancy recruited largely non-overlapping populations of cells in the VH, in contrast to higher degrees of ensemble overlap in unstressed control mice, suggesting that stress biases the brain towards stronger differentiation of distinct social states. Additionally, we found that activity of VH neurons was required for stress-induced aggression. Finally, we found that stress-induced changes to social behaviors and VH activity profiles could be reversed by the introduction of social buffering post-stress. Collectively, our findings suggest that stress drives the VH to dissociably encode specific behavioral states, rather than a single state of negative valence, consistent with a role for multiple structures and distributed ensembles in the modulation of traumatic stress.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

The therapeutic is an optimized ""peptide decoy"" based on the viruss human cell target ACE2 and, as such, may have more general applicability across coronavirus family members that use ACE2 for cellular entry. We experimentally verify a comprehensive, rational optimization strategy of the peptide through improved binding, helical content, and solubility from its native sequence. These techniques may have general applicability for helical peptide optimization for other therapeutic targets as well. Importantly, techniques also exist for protecting helical peptides in vivo for improved delivery. Peptides are readily modifiable with single residue substitutions for quick response to mutated targets, and they typically have relatively low toxicity and ease of manufacturing, making peptides extremely attractive as biological therapeutics against viral pathogens. The general concept of using peptide decoys across other viral human cell targets is also discussed.

Author SummaryAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has ended, SARS-CoV-2 virus still causes hundreds of deaths each week world-wide. The virus uses a human cell receptor called ACE2 to latch on and enter cells. Here, the small critical attachment segment of ACE2 is developed as a ""decoy"" molecule thereby protecting host cells and significantly reducing viral replication, which is the role of a therapeutic agent. The effective segment in this case is called a helical peptide and it was optimized for better binding, solubility, and stability using rational methods based on our understanding of this class of molecule.

Moreover, future viruses from this family of coronaviruses may likely use ACE2 as their host cell receptor, as recently demonstrated in the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Virus of bats and, therefore, the ACE2 decoy therapeutic may have future applications as well. Development of a broader range of decoy molecules for different viruses using different human cell receptors may represent a forward-thinking approach to prepare for future pandemics and outbreaks.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

One such program is the Interferon-Responsive Microglia state (IRM), which has been identified in developmental windows, aging, and disease. While the functional importance of this state is becoming increasingly clear, our understanding of the regulatory networks that govern IRM induction remain incomplete. To systematically identify genetic regulators of the IRM state, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen in human iPSC-derived microglia (iPS-Microglia) using IFIT1 as a representative IRM marker. We identified 772 genes that modulate IRM, including canonical type I interferon signaling genes (IFNAR2, TYK2, STAT1/2, USP18) and novel regulators. We uncovered a non-canonical role for the CCR4-NOT complex subunit CNOT10 in IRM activation, independent of its traditional function. This work provides a comprehensive resource for dissecting IRM biology and highlights both established and novel targets for modulating microglial interferon signaling in health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1749506997234

This broadband activity indicates spontaneous fluctuations in excitation-inhibition (E:I) balance across vigilance states and has recently been shown to systematically covary across the respiratory cycle during waking resting state. We used simultaneous EEG and respiratory recordings over a full night of sleep collected from N = 23 healthy participants to unravel the nested dynamics of respiration phase-locked excitability states across the wake-sleep cycle. We demonstrate a prominent phase shift in the coupling of aperiodic brain activity to respiratory rhythms as participants were transitioning from wakefulness to sleep. Moreover, respiration-brain coupling became more consistent both across and within participants, as interindividual as well as intraindividual variability systematically lessened from wakefulness and the transition to sleep towards deeper sleep stages. Our results suggest that respiration phase-locked changes in E:I balance conceivably add to sleep stage-specific neural signatures of REM and NREM sleep, highlighting the complexity of brain-body coupling during sleep.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

While there have been thousands of host-pathogen PPIs determined to date, the lack of structural information for these impedes the study of the prevalence of molecular mimicry and convergent evolution of protein interaction interfaces. To address this, we benchmarked AlphaFold2 and 3 for prediction of structures of host-pathogen interactions observing that accurate models can be retrieved when ranking by modelling confidence, despite an overall low performance. We predicted structures for 6,782 pathogen-human PPIs yielding 803 models of higher confidence. Most pathogen proteins interacting with a common human protein are predicted to do so via the same interface, suggesting a high degree of convergent evolution of protein interaction interfaces. When comparing structural models from host-pathogen and host-host interactions, we observe that a majority of pathogen proteins are predicted to target existing human PPI interfaces. We categorized instances of mimicry into different modes, occurring at different frequencies: 1) via the same domain family (least common); 2) via a similar structural motif; and 3) via a similar linear motif (most common). We selected examples of linear motif interactions for binding assay testing, confirming 8 out of 12 predicted interfaces, including 3 viral linear motif interactions. This validates AlphaFold's ability to model some host-pathogen interactions and the mechanisms underlying molecular mimicry. This work showcases the value of large-scale structural modelling to study convergent evolution of host-pathogen interactions and how molecular mimicry may contribute to infection or host defense.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

We describe a novel mechanism whereby JIP4 regulates lysosomal cystine storage by controlling the abundance of cystinosin (CTNS), the transporter responsible for lysosomal cystine efflux. To this end, JIP4, previously characterized as a motor adaptor and kinase signaling scaffold, suppresses TMEM55B-dependent ubiquitylation of CTNS. Loss of JIP4 reduces CTNS protein levels, leading to lysosomal cystine accumulation and lysosomal storage defects that phenocopy loss of CTNS in both human cells and the renal proximal tubules of JIP4 knockout mice. These phenotypes mirror cystinosis, the lysosomal storage disease caused by CTNS loss-of-function. Our findings thus reveal a fundamental process that controls the efflux of lysosomal cystine and has relevance to understanding human disease arising from JIP4 mutations.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

However, how distinct -synuclein strains are formed in vivo remains unknown. Here, we examined whether unique strains of self-propagating -synuclein aggregates can arise within a consistent molecular environment. Unexpectedly, we observed conformational heterogeneity between individual preparations of -synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) generated by polymerizing recombinant wild-type or A53T-mutant human -synuclein under identical conditions. Moreover, we found that -synuclein aggregates formed spontaneously in the brains of a transgenic synucleinopathy mouse model were conformationally diverse, leading to the identification of three distinct disease subtypes. Propagation of putative PFF- and brain-derived -synuclein strains in mice initiated several distinct synucleinopathies, characterized by differences in disease onset times, cerebral -synuclein deposition patterns, and the conformational attributes of -synuclein aggregates. The conformational diversity of -synuclein aggregates across PFF preparations and between the brains of individual transgenic mice demonstrates that -synuclein can spontaneously form multiple self-propagating strains within an identical environment both in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that stochastic misfolding into distinct aggregate structures drives the emergence of -synuclein strains and implies that the intrinsic variability of common synucleinopathy research tools must be considered when designing and interpreting experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

In this study, we generated multiple new alleles of bik1 and pbl1 by CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing and systematically analyzed these mutants alongside existing T-DNA insertional lines. These analyses reinforced the central role of BIK1 and PBL1 in pattern-triggered immunity mediated by both receptor kinases and receptor-like proteins. At the same time, however, we revealed several pleiotropic phenotypes associated with T-DNA insertions that are not necessarily linked to loss of BIK1 or PBL1 function.

As cells differentiate collectively, it raises the question of how tissue-level properties affect instructive cues of decision-making. Here, we show that a tissue rigidity phase transition guides patterning by tuning the length-scales and time-scales of morphogen signalling. By combining rigidity percolation theory, reaction-diffusion modelling, quantitative imaging, optogenetics and single-cell transcriptomics in zebrafish, we uncover dynamical global tissue rigidity patterns that actively shape the Nodal morphogen gradient by restricting ligand dispersal and accelerating its signalling activity. In this self-generated mechanism, Nodal, besides driving meso-endoderm fate specification, increases cell-cell adhesion strength via regulating planar cell polarity genes. Once adhesion strength reaches a critical point, it triggers a rigidity transition which collapses tissue porosity. The abrupt tissue reorganisation negatively feeds back on Nodal signalling impacting both its length-scales, by limiting Nodal diffusivity, and its time-scales, by speeding up the expression of its antagonist Lefty, thereby ensuring timely signal termination and robust patterning. Overall, we reveal how emergent properties set the spatiotemporal dynamics of morphogen gradients, uncovering macroscopic mechanisms of pattern formation.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

The plant CLV3/EMBRYO-SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) small-signaling peptide family exemplifies these challenges. Although genetic studies in model systems have identified shared roles for a few CLE genes and species-specific redundancies, an evolutionary analysis of the entire family over deep time could empower predictive and experimental dissections of functions obscured by redundancy. We developed a scanning pipeline that de novo annotated CLE genes from 2,000 genomes representing 1,000 species, uncovering thousands of previously undetected family members and producing a comprehensive phylogenetic reconstruction and tracing of the family's evolution and sequence diversification over 140 million years. Computational modeling of coding and cis-regulatory regions predicted lineage-specific asymmetries in paralog redundancy, stemming from ancestral amino acids in the functional core of the dodecapeptide and partial conservation of promoter elements. We tested these predictions using two genome-editing strategies in Solanaceae. Base-editing of deeply conserved residues in the CLV3 dodecapeptide and its paralogs across three species confirmed their critical roles in repressing stem-cell proliferation, and multiplex CRISPR knockouts of the 52 tomato CLE genes resolved pairwise and higher-order redundancies, revealing previously uncharacterized regulators of shoot architecture and plant size. These findings show how both peptide and cis-regulatory erosion shape CLE redundancy and provide a framework for detecting and translating deep evolutionary signals into testable genetic hypotheses across compositionally complex gene families.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

However, the family Drosophilidae encompasses over 4000 species, spanning deep evolutionary divergences and diverse ecologies. Here, we use immune challenge with the gram-negative pathogen Providencia rettgeri to investigate the conservation and evolution of immune responses in three non-model drosophilid species, Hirtodrosophila cameraria, H. confusa, and Scaptodrosophila deflexa, each of which diverged from D. melanogaster over 45 million years ago. Results We find that all three species retain a core set of immune signaling and recognition genes, but exhibit substantial variation in effector gene content and inducibility. In particular, Scaptodrosophila deflexa lacks orthologs of multiple antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) known from D. melanogaster, including DptA, AttA, and AttC, and shows little transcriptional response to bacterial-challenge with Providencia rettgeri. In contrast, both of the Hirtodrosophila species exhibit substantial transcriptional responses, including strong induction of canonical Imd pathway genes. Microbiome profiling of our samples revealed higher Providencia abundance in H. cameraria, and high levels of the defensive symbiont Spiroplasma in S. deflexa, potentially explaining differences in infection outcome. Our combined annotation and expression analysis of these species also allowed us to identify 20 novel AMP-like candidates, many with structural features like known AMPs. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the feasibility of functional immune analyses in non-model Drosophila species and reveals striking lineage-specific differences in immune gene repertoire and expression.

It remains unclear how the limited set of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) and other proteins activated by these cytokine receptors can encode the observed diversity of immune cell phenotypes. To understand how signaling downstream of cytokines control immune cell phenotype, we sought to map the structure of Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling domains to cell signaling and resulting CAR T cell function. We recombined 14 signaling motifs to construct a library of [~]30,000 constitutively active synthetic cytokine receptors (SCRs) with intracellular domains composed of novel signaling motif combinations that activate different signaling cascades. We experimentally tested [~]450 SCRs which generated a range of CAR T cell memory, cytotoxicity, and proliferation. SCRs with pSTAT1 and 3 signaling generated effector memory CAR T cells, while SCRs with strong pSTAT5 generated effector CAR T cells with potent anti-tumor activity. To map the structure-signaling-phenotype landscape we trained models to predict signaling and CAR T cell phenotype that result from varied motif combinations. From neural network predictions we identified features, including strong STAT5 and Shc signaling, that promote unsafe autonomous CAR T cell proliferation. Models also revealed a trade-off between memory and cytotoxicity, with a Pareto front encoded by a continuous change in signaling. These results demonstrate that recombination of a limited set of signaling motifs creates a continuous spectrum of signaling that encodes a corresponding spectrum of cell phenotype. This work synthetically expands the combinatorial space of JAK/STAT signaling and provides a foundation for rational design of CAR T cells with improved cytotoxicity, memory, and safety profiles.

To better understand the progression of tangle pathophysiology, we characterized tangle maturity level predilection of 15 tau antibodies recognizing a broad range of linear, phosphorylation, conformational, and truncation epitopes in the hippocampus of 24 postmortem brains. We developed the tangle maturity scoring system to semi-quantitatively evaluate each tangle maturity level. Based on proportions of tangle maturity levels, we classified antibodies as ""early"" (mostly pretangles and mature tangles), ""middling"" (mature tangles with pretangles and ghost tangles), and ""advanced"" (mostly ghost tangles and mature tangles) tangle maturity markers. To summarize tangle maturity predilection, we developed the tangle maturity scale to integrate individual tangle maturity scores. Correlations showed stronger relationships between tangle maturity scale and subsector thickness for more advanced tangle maturity markers in CA1 and subiculum, whereas Braak tangle stage remained consistently correlated throughout markers of the tangle lifespan. To aid in scoring hippocampi, we used machine learning to recognize tangle maturity levels, which performed comparably to a domain expert and showed similar relationships by Spearman correlation. Pattern recognition software was used to assess tangle and neuritic tau burden separately, which generally correlated with Braak stage and neuronal counts. However, tangle-derived tau burden more consistently correlated with hippocampal subsector thickness. In conclusion, we developed manual and automated scoring systems to evaluate tangle maturity levels, demonstrating early 4R, phosphorylated, and oligomeric tau accumulation preceding more advanced 3R and truncated tau. Our study provides supportive evidence of disease-relevant ordering of tau posttranslational modifications in the brain, which may have implications for theragnostic development. These findings underscore the promise of computerized quantitative analyses (i.e., pathomics) for high-throughput feature extraction from whole-slide images to enhance our understanding of microscopically observed morphologic changes.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

Results from our study provide strong evidence against the hypothesis that ME blood factors differentially affect healthy myoblast mitochondrial phenotypes in vitro.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

Here, we show that dendritic inhibition terminates plateaus in an all-or-none manner. Plateaus were initially resistant to inhibition but became increasingly susceptible to termination as they progressed. Between two distinct subtypes of dendrite-targeting interneurons, OLMNdnf generated slower postsynaptic currents that terminated plateaus more effectively than OLM2. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) were necessary for plateaus, which were prolonged by blocking small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK). A single-compartment model with these two conductances recapitulated core experimental findings and provided a mechanistic explanation for terminations. Plateaus arose from VGCCs maintained in the active state by sustained Ca2+ influx, a positive feedback loop that was quasi-balanced by ISK. Inhibition terminated plateaus by driving the membrane potential below a dynamic threshold to deactivate VGCCs and end the positive feedback loop. Lastly, two-photon Ca2+ imaging showed that plateaus evoke large dendritic Ca2+ transients that were graded by terminations. Overall, our results demonstrate how the feedback inhibitory circuit interacts with intrinsic cellular mechanisms to regulate plateau potentials and shape dendritic Ca2+ signals in CA1-PYRs.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1749506997234

Here, we compared the identified motor unit (MU) discharge patterns from decomposed electromyography signals acquired during triangular dorsiflexion contractions up to 70% of maximal voluntary force (MVF) between resistance-trained, endurance-trained, and untrained individuals (n=23 in each group). We then estimated intrinsic motoneuron properties and garnered insight about the proportion of excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory inputs contributing to motor commands across contraction intensities in each group. Participants also performed a task where a triangular contraction was superimposed onto a sustained one designed to challenge inhibitory control of dendritic persistent inward currents (PICs). Both trained groups demonstrated greater MU discharge rates with greater ascending discharge rate modulation during higher contraction forces ([&ge;]50% MVF), which were accompanied by more linear MU discharge patterns and greater post-acceleration attenuation slopes of the ascending discharge rates. No differences in discharge rate hysteresis or the discharge rate characteristics during the sombrero tasks between groups, suggesting no differences in neuromodulatory input. Conversely, resistance-compared to endurance-trained individuals exhibited greater acceleration slopes during lower contractions forces ([&le;]50% MVF), indicating the possibility of enhanced initial activation of PICs. Collectively, the greater and more linear MU discharge patterns in the trained groups either suggests a more reciprocal (i.e., push-pull) excitation-inhibition coupling during higher contraction forces or enhanced excitatory synaptic input to the motor pool, which might underpin greater force production of trained individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

Cultured cells under physical confinement have been shown to experience mechanical stress due to deformation of the nucleus. Nuclear deformation can lead to loss of nuclear integrity and DNA damage, and it has been proposed to underlie cancer initiation and progression. In vivo, the consequences of physical confinement on physiological, developmental cell migration remain so far unexplored. Here, we use the zebrafish neural crest as an in vivo model to address how multipotent embryonic cells respond to physical confinement during developmental migration. By measuring the extracellular space from head to tail along the embryonic body axis, we found that the level of tissue scale confinement increases along the antero-posterior axis. We found that neural crest experience dramatic nuclear deformation during their migrating between adjacent tissues, which quantitatively scales with tissue confinement. By using complementary genetic and mechanical strategies to ablate the surrounding tissue, we observe a rescue of nuclear deformation in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that while deformation of the NC nucleus causes stretching of the nuclear envelope, it does not cause DNA damage even upon extreme deformations. Instead, cells adapt, by decreasing both their DNA damage and LaminB2 levels upon entering confined spaces. In summary, we establish the neural crest as a physiological framework uncovering a dynamic adaptation to tissue confinement in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

While plasma-derived EVs have been explored as biomarkers in MS, little is known about EVs in CNS tissue. Here, we characterize EVs from postmortem white matter (WM) of MS and control brains. EVs were separated by differential centrifugation followed by size exclusion chromatography and characterized using nanoflow cytometry, single-particle reflectance imaging sensing (SP-IRIS), and transmission electron microscopy. EV size, yield, and morphology did not differ significantly between MS and control samples. Proteomic analyses revealed downregulation of synaptic and mitochondrial proteins and upregulation of complement and inflammatory proteins and pathways in MS WM EVs. This suggests that EVs reflect ongoing synaptic pathology, metabolic dysfunction, and CNS-compartmentalized inflammation and that they may actively contribute to these pathological processes. Deconvolution analyses suggests a shift in EV cellular origin, with an increased astrocytic and decreased neuronal EV contributions in MS. Several proteomic changes we observed in CNS-derived EVs have also been reported in circulating EVs of people with MS, establishing this CNS tissue EV study as a valuable resource for identifying biomarker candidates for brain-derived plasma EV studies.

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

In Azotobacter vinelandii and many other members of Proteobacteria, the two-component system NifL-NifA controls the expression of nif genes that encode the nitrogen fixation machinery. The NifL-NifA system evolved the ability to integrate several environmental cues, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon availability. The nitrogen fixation machinery is thereby only activated under strictly favorable conditions, enabling diazotrophs to thrive in competitive environments. Whilst genetic and biochemical studies have enlightened our understanding of how NifL represses NifA, the molecular basis of NifA sequestration by NifL depends on structural information on their interaction. Here, we present mechanistic insights into how nitrogen fixation is regulated by combining biochemical and genetic approaches with a low-resolution cryo-EM map of the oxidized NifL-NifA complex. Our findings define the interaction surface between NifL and NifA and reveal how this interaction can be manipulated to generate bacterial strains with increased nitrogen fixation rates able to secrete surplus nitrogen outside the cell, a crucial step in engineering improved nitrogen delivery to crop plants.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

Despite its popularity, the PR task hinges on a low-dimensional behavioral readout--breakpoint, or the maximum work requirement subjects are willing to complete before abandoning the task. Here, we show that with a simple modification, the PR task can be transformed into an optimization problem reminiscent of the patch-leaving foraging scenario, which has been analyzed extensively by behavioral ecologists, psychologists, and neuroscientists. In the Progressive Ratio with Reset (PRR) task, rats perform the PR task on one lever, but can press a second lever to reset the current ratio requirement back to its lowest value at the cost of enduring a reset delay, during which both levers are retracted. Rats used the reset lever adaptively on the PRR task, and their ratio reset decisions were sensitive to the cost of the reset delay. We derived an approach for computing the optimal bout length--the number of rewards to earn before pressing the reset lever that produces the greatest long-term rate of reward--and found that rats flexibly changed their behavior to approximate the optimal strategy. However, rats showed a systematic bias for bout lengths that exceeded the optimal length, an effect reminiscent of ""overharvesting"" in patch-leaving tasks. The PRR task thus represents a novel means of testing whether and how rats adapt their behavior to the cost-benefit structure of the environment in a way that connects deeply to the broader literature on associative learning and optimal foraging theory.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

Some antibiotics have the potential to mediate interference competition by triggering a bacterial stress response that subsequently activates endogenous viruses integrated in bacterial genomes (prophages). Canonically, this activation is regulated by the SOS response upon DNA damage. Here we show that a metabolite produced by natural isolates of Vibrio ordalii circumvents the SOS response by directly triggering prophage induction in other Vibrio species, co-occurring in the same environment. While the metabolite was previously classified as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, we observe how it acts as a peptide deformylase inhibitor that specifically induces certain prophages, even when target bacterial cells carry multiple other prophages. Its biosynthetic gene cluster, or ord cluster, also encodes its own peptide deformylase (OrdE) which provides self-immunity to producer strains. Likewise, among natural Vibrio isolates that carry similar prophages, resistance against the ord metabolite was found in those that had acquired a divergent second peptide deformylase. Finally, we show that prophage induction by the ord cluster prevents slower-growing producer strains from being outcompeted by their otherwise fast-growing competitors if they carry an inducible prophage. Thus, we demonstrate how natural products play additional impactful roles in communities beyond antibiotic activity and that prophage induction serves as an interference competition strategy, sustaining community diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

Here, we present OriGene, a self-evolving multiagent system that functions as a virtual disease biologist, systematically identifying original and mechanistically grounded therapeutic targets at scale. OriGene coordinates specialized agents that reason over diverse modalities, including genetic data, protein networks, pharmacological profiles, clinical records, and literature evidence, to generate and prioritize target discovery hypotheses. Through a self-evolving framework, OriGene continuously integrates human and experimental feedback to iteratively refine its core thinking templates, tool composition, and analytical protocols, thereby enhancing both accuracy and adaptability over time. To comprehensively evaluate its performance, we established TRQA, a benchmark comprising over 1,900 expert-level question-answer pairs spanning a wide range of diseases and target classes. OriGene consistently outperforms human experts, leading research agents, and state-of-the-art large language models in accuracy, recall, and robustness, particularly under conditions of data sparsity or noise. Critically, OriGene nominated previously underexplored therapeutic targets for liver (GPR160) and colorectal cancer (ARG2), which demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in patient-derived organoid and tumor fragment models mirroring human clinical exposures. These findings demonstrate OriGenes potential as a scalable and adaptive platform for AI-driven discovery of mechanistically grounded therapeutic targets, offering a new paradigm to accelerate drug development.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

The pathogenesis of LC is incompletely understood. In this study, we performed comprehensive cellular and transcriptional immunometabolic profiling within a cohort that included SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (NC, N=30) and individuals with prior COVID-19 ([~]4-months) who fully recovered (RC, N=38) or went on to experience Long COVID symptoms (N=58). Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. Our findings support a profound and persistent immunometabolic dysfunction that follows SARS-CoV-2 which may form the pathophysiologic substrate for LC. Our findings suggest that trials of therapeutics that help restore immune and metabolic homeostasis may be warranted to prevent, reduce, or resolve LC symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1749506997234

Yet the cognition driving this dynamic--and its broader implications--remains poorly understood. Here, we show that nest-building zebra finches follow a copy-if-dissatisfied strategy, but only when social information aligns with recent experience: after observing a conspecific build a nest, males were more likely to choose the demonstrated 'social' material--particularly on their first choice--if they had previously used low-quality material. Using Bayesian cognitive modelling, we estimated how latent learning mechanisms underpinned males' material choices, identifying two asocial and two social governing parameters. These parameters provide the first formal evidence for the cognitive basis of birds' nest building. Forward simulations informed--but not prescripted--by these parameters approximated observed material-choice trajectories, supporting their causal role. Additional simulations targeting simplified real-world contexts showed that payoff structure--not (dis)satisfaction--drove social material choice, though higher rewards did not proportionally boost its use, offering preliminary insights into the mechanisms underlying material-use variation more broadly. Our study illustrates how computational modelling can robustly link behaviour to underlying learning mechanisms and probe the generalisability of animal cognition--a rarity in this field.","NA","biorxiv",1749506997234

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1749506997234

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1749506997234

We demonstrate the real world implications of the use of testing and evaluate adverse events and outcomes in individuals who did not receive pharmacogenomic testing for clopidogrel.

MethodsWe analyzed ~100K individuals with paired EHR and exome sequencing data from population health studies administered at multiple medical centers using the Helix Exome+(R) assay. We inferred clopidogrel dosage by processing the prescription with an LLM. We identified all instances of individuals with at least one prescription that is not in concordance with their CYP2C19 genotype. Lastly, we identify instances of thrombosis using a comprehensive codeset based on ICD9, ICD10, and SNOMED terms.

ResultsWe identified 16,140 prescriptions of clopidogrel given to 3,853 participants. We found that 29% of these individuals have a mismatch between the recommended clopidogrel dosage guideline based on their CYP2C19 genotype and their actual prescribed daily dosage. 25% of poor metabolizers experienced thrombosis, with 40% occurring within 2 months of treatment. Poor and intermediate metabolizers receiving clopidogrel are much more likely to experience thrombosis and myocardial infarction (binomial p-value = 0.001).

ConclusionsWe estimate a 38% excess of adverse events occur in poor and intermediate metabolizers relative to normal and rapid metabolizers. The lack of testing may be responsible for 1 thrombosis event per every ~30 people prescribed clopidogrel.","NA","medrxiv",1749506997234

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.
