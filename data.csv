With no known effective FDA-approved treatments for either condition, patient-reported outcomes of treatments are invaluable for guiding management strategies in patient care and generating new avenues for research. Here, we present the results of an ME/CFS and Long COVID treatment survey with responses from 3,925 patients. We assessed the experiences of these patients with more than 150 treatments, as well as their demographics, symptoms, and comorbidities. Patients with each condition who participated in the study shared similar symptom profiles, including all the core symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g., 89.7% of ME/CFS and 79.4% of Long COVID reported post-exertional malaise (PEM). Treatments with the greatest perceived benefits were identified, which had varied effects on different core symptoms. In addition, treatment responses were significantly correlated (R{superscript 2} = 0.68) between the two patient groups. Patient subgroups with distinct profiles of symptoms and comorbidities showed varied responses to treatments, e.g., a POTS-dominant cluster benefiting from autonomic modulators and a cognitive-dysfunction cluster from CNS stimulants. This study underscores the symptomatic and therapeutic similarities between ME/CFS and Long COVID and highlights the commonalities and nuanced complexities of infection-associated chronic diseases and related conditions. Insights from patient-reported experiences, in the absence of approved treatments, provide urgently needed real-world evidence for targeted therapies in patient care and for developing future clinical trials.

While prior analyses have shown the benefit of primary vaccination, the effect of booster vaccination on preventing long COVID caused by an Omicron infection has not been fully investigated. This systematic review identified 31 observational studies, among which 11 were deemed suitable for pairwise meta-analyses. Herein, the pooled risk of long COVID was 22-29% (P<0.0001 and P<0.0001, respectively) lower for vaccinated (any vaccination) populations versus unvaccinated (10 studies); 19% (P<0.0001) lower for primary course vaccination versus no vaccination (3 studies); 26% (P<0.0001) lower for booster vaccination versus no vaccination (4 studies) and 23% (P=0.0044) lower for booster vaccination versus primary course vaccination (3 studies). These findings indicate that booster vaccination can provide additional protection against long COVID; thereby, highlighting the importance of seasonal vaccination against new SARS-CoV-2 variants.","NA","medrxiv",1733177297900

Deep learning protein design approaches like ProteinMPNN have shown strong performance both in creating novel proteins or stabilizing existing ones. However, it is unlikely that the stability of the designs will significantly exceed that of the natural proteins in the training set, which are biophysically only marginally stable. Therefore, we collected predicted protein structures from hyperthermophiles, which differ substantially in their amino acid composition from mesophiles. Notably, ProteinMPNN fails to recover their unique amino acid composition. Here we show that a retrained network on predicted proteins from hyperthermophiles, termed HyperMPNN, not only recovers this unique amino acid composition but can also be applied to proteins from non-hyperthermophiles. Using this novel approach on a protein nanoparticle with a melting temperature of 65{degrees}C resulted in designs remaining stable at 95{degrees}C. In conclusion, we created a new way to design highly thermostable proteins through self-supervised learning on data from hyperthermophiles.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297900

Modern assemblies commonly feature megabase-long sequences frequently spanning entire chromosomes. The increase in the assembly contiguity and the reduced number of assembly contigs also implies that whole-genome alignment is no longer an embarrassingly parallel problem. The conventional method of aligning sequences of the query genome in parallel is to utilize a single thread per sequence. This results in poor CPU utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we designed optimizations to accelerate whole-genome alignment on multi-core processors and implemented them in a commonly used aligner, minimap2. Our improvements include a fine-grained parallel chaining method and a fast mechanism for differentiating primary and secondary chains. Our approach accelerates alignment of human, plant, and primate genomes by 1.6x to 7.2x without compromising accuracy.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297900

Although some alternative coding TF isoforms have been experimentally studied, a genome-wide characterisation of all such isoforms in normal human physiology is still lacking. Here, we integrate RNA sequencing and protein domain data to reveal the expression levels, tissue specificity and putative functional classes of alternative coding isoforms of human TF genes. We found that isoforms lacking a DNA-binding domain (DBD) are annotated for almost a third of known TF genes, comprise 17% of all annotated TF isoforms and likely reverse the regulatory effects of DBD-containing isoforms. Considering all coding TF isoforms, we uncovered 536 switches between the highest-expressed alternative isoforms produced by 360 TF genes across 43 adult tissues. We predicted functional consequences of these switches using a functional annotation of structural domains present in switching isoforms. Furthermore, we found 45 isoform switches between the brain and non-brain tissues and interpreted six of these switches in detail. Finally, we assembled a literature-based compendium of human TF genes with experimentally studied alternative isoforms. In total, our results suggest that the switches of alternative coding TF isoforms between adult tissues represent a widespread, yet understudied, functional mechanism.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297900

The replisome-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAIP mitigates this threat by ubiquitylating the CMG helicase in mitosis, leading to disassembly of stalled replisomes, fork cleavage, and restoration of chromosome structure by alternative end-joining. Here, we show that replisome disassembly requires TRAIP phosphorylation by the mitotic Cyclin B-CDK1 kinase, as well as TTF2, a SWI/SNF ATPase previously implicated in the eviction of RNA polymerase from mitotic chromosomes. We find that TTF2 tethers TRAIP to replisomes using an N-terminal Zinc finger that binds to phosphorylated TRAIP and an adjacent TTF2 peptide that contacts the CMG-associated leading strand DNA polymerase {varepsilon}. This TRAIP-TTF2-pol {varepsilon} bridge, which forms independently of the TTF2 ATPase domain, is essential to promote CMG unloading and stalled fork breakage. Conversely, RNAPII eviction from mitotic chromosomes requires the ATPase activity of TTF2. We conclude that in mitosis, replisomes undergo a CDK- and TTF2-dependent structural reorganization that underlies the cellular response to incompletely replicated DNA.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297900

Here we show that for oblique plane microscopes (OPM), a subset of LSFM where a single primary objective is used for illumination and detection, light-sheet stabilization can be achieved without expending sample fluorescence. Our method achieves ~57nm axial precision and maintains the light-sheet well within the depth of focus of the detection system for hour-long acquisition runs in a lab environment that would otherwise detune the system.

Recently, a two-step mechanism, with the enzymes cytochrome P450 2J19 (CYP2J19) and 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1-like (BDH1L), was described for the biosynthesis of red ketocarotenoids from yellow dietary carotenoids in the retina and plumage of birds. A common assumption has been that all birds with ketocarotenoid-based plumage coloration used this CYP2J19/BDH1L mechanism to produce red feathers. We tested this assumption in house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus) by examining the catalytic function of the house finch homologs of these enzymes and tracking their expression in molting birds. We found that CYP2J19 and BDH1L did not catalyze the production of 3-hydroxy-echinenone (3-OH-echinenone), the primary red plumage pigment of house finches, when provided with common dietary carotenoid substrates. Moreover, gene expression analyses revealed little to no expression of CYP2J19 in liver tissue or growing feather follicles, the putative sites of pigment metabolism in molting house finches. Finally, although the hepatic mitochondria of house finches have high concentrations of 3-OH-echinenone, observations using fluorescent markers suggest that both CYP2J19 and BDH1L localize to the endomembrane system rather than the mitochondria. We propose that house finches and other birds that deposit 3-OH-echinenone as their primary red plumage pigment use an alternative enzymatic pathway to produce their characteristic red ketocarotenoid-based coloration.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297900

Using the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), we examined the role of self-identified background group and genetic ancestry proportions in gene-environment interactions influencing the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and a polygenic score for BMI (PGSBMI).

MethodsWeighted univariate and multivariable generalized linear models were executed to compare the effects of environmental variables identified a priori by McArdle et al. 2021. Both Amerindigenous (AME) ancestry proportion and background group identity were statistically modeled as confounders both through stratified and joint analyses to understand their influence on the relationship between BMI and PGSBMI, while incorporating gene-environment interactions of PGS x diet and PGS x age-at-immigration.

ResultsAfter complex survey weighting, 7,075 participants remained in the analytic sample, representing individuals of six background groups: Central American, Cuban, Dominican, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and South American. The distributions of key environmental and sociocultural variables were heterogeneous between Hispanic/Latino background groups. Associations of these variables with AME ancestry were similarly heterogeneous upon stratification, indicating confounding by background group. In a predictive model for BMI incorporating health, immigration, and environmental variables, PGSBMI performance decreased with increasing AME ancestry proportion. In this model, most statistically significant GxE interactions lost significance after ancestry and background stratification, except for PGS x age-at-immigration interactions in some strata: Mexican background individuals born in the US compared to those >=21 years old at migration ({beta}=1.33, p<0.01), Dominican background individuals 6-12 years old at migration compared to those >=21 years old at migration ({beta}=4.38, p<0.001), and Cuban background individuals 0-5 years old at migration compared to those >=21 years old at migration ({beta}=2.20, p=0.015), where US-born includes individuals born in the US 50 states/DC.

ConclusionsControlling for self-identified background group identity and genetic ancestry did not eliminate statistically significant differences in interactions between AME ancestry and environmental variables in certain strata of AME ancestry among some Hispanic/Latino background groups in HCHS/SOL.","NA","medrxiv",1733177297900

With the advance of population genomics, studies in diverse organisms revealed supergenes associated with a myriad of complex traits, ranging from morphology to sexual behavior, from butterfly wing patterns to floral morphs. Two supergenes have been described on non-homologous social chromosomes in two ant lineages, Solenopsis and Formica, that diverged more than 90 million years ago. In both lineages, the supergene is associated with social polymorphism, where some colonies are headed by a single queen (monogyne) while others harbor multiple queens (polygyne). We discovered a new supergene associated with similar social polymorphism in the desert ant Cataglyphis niger. Although Cataglyphis is more closely related to Formica than to Solenopsis, the social chromosome in C. niger is homologous to the Solenopsis social chromosome, with conservation of synteny in gene content as well as gene order. Therefore, this is an ancient chromosome dating back to the common ancestor of Solenopsis and Cataglyphis, at least 90 million years ago. Previous work dated the Solenopsis supergene to be only one million years old, therefore, we propose that the two supergenes have evolved independently in the two diverged lineages on this ancient social chromosome. We surveyed hymenopteran genomes to discover a bee chromosome homologous to the ants social chromosome. The conservation of the gene set on these homologous chromosomes in ants and bees suggests that this chromosome plays an important role in social behavior across social Hymenoptera. We hypothesize that the conserved gene set in the social chromosome was repeatedly used as a pre-adapted toolkit for the evolution of social traits in general and specifically in the evolution of polygyne social structure in ants.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297900

However, most non-model organisms lack integral genomic resources such as reference genomes and recombination maps, limiting accurate evolutionary inference. Here, we explore the consequences of reference genome bias on the inference of genetic diversity, demographic histories, and recombination rates using gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), which, like most members of Canidae, are traditionally mapped to the dog (Canis lupus familiaris) reference genome. Whole genome sequence data from gray foxes were mapped to the gray fox reference genome and two heterospecific canid references (dog and Arctic fox; Vulpes lagopus). Our results reveal that reference bias significantly affects population genomic analyses. Mapping to the conspecific gray fox genome improved read pairing, increased detection of SNPs, especially rare variants, and reduced spurious variants. Estimates of nucleotide diversity ({pi}) and genetic differentiation (FST) were higher using the gray fox genome. We observed that mapping to heterospecific references leads to underestimates of population sizes, distorted demographic trajectories, and more variable recombination rates. These effects are further complicated by population-specific biases, which vary in their magnitude and direction across populations, highlighting the need for tailored approaches to mitigate reference bias. Importantly, FST outlier detection also differed among references, affecting functional interpretations. Collectively, this work addresses a critical gap in the rapidly expanding field of non-model species genomics by demonstrating the importance of using conspecific genomic resources in evolutionary research and illustrating how reliance on distantly related reference genomes can distort population genetic analyses.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297900

Mechanical cues exerted by shear stress from the blood flow remodel an initial vascular plexus into a ramifying array of large and small vessels. As plasma starts to fill vascular lumens, these forces trigger changes in EC gene expression and dynamic alterations in cell shape and cell adhesion, as cuboidal angioblasts elongate and flatten into ECs. Little is known about how embryonic ECs sense and transduce hemodynamic signals as vessels form in vivo. Here, we report a critical requirement for the Lats1 and Lats2 Hippo pathway kinases during this process. We show that when Lats1/2 are genetically deleted in ECs, embryos develop severe defects in blood vessel formation, which lead to embryonic lethality by E11.5. We find that initial vessel patterning and circulation initiate properly, however remodeling of the initial vascular plexus fails due to lumen collapse and altered blood flow. When Lats1/2 are knocked down using siRNA approaches in cultured ECs, cells fail to elongate and polarize, similar to ECs in the mutant embryos. In addition, VE-cadherin (VEcad) based junctions fail to mature under shear stress. These data show that Lats1/2 deficient cells no longer respond to laminar shear stress, both in vivo and in vitro. This work identifies the Hippo pathway kinases Lats1 and Lats2 as critical transducers of biomechanical cues during the early steps of blood vessel remodeling. This study will provide new targets for treatment of vascular diseases and new directions for efforts to generate vascularized tissues for replacement therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297900

Early-life adversity (ELA) is a risk for human affective disorders involving dysregulated reward behaviors. In mice, ELA causes anhedonia-like behaviors in males and augmented reward motivation in females, indicating sex-dependent disruption of reward circuit operations. We recently identified a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expressing GABAergic projection from basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) that governs reward-seeking deficits in adult ELA males, but not females. Methods: To probe the sex-specific role of this projection in reward behaviors, adult male and female CRH-Cre mice raised in control or ELA conditions received excitatory or inhibitory Cre-dependent DREADDs in BLA, and then clozapine N-oxide or vehicle to NAc medial shell during reward behaviors. We determined the cell identity of the projection using immunostaining and electrophysiology. Using tissue clearing, light sheet fluorescence microscopy and deep learning pipelines, we mapped brain-wide BLA CRH+ axonal projections to uncover sex differences in innervation. Results: Chemogenetic manipulations in male mice demonstrated inhibitory effects of the CRH+ BLA-NAc projection on reward behaviors, whereas neither excitation nor inhibition influenced female behaviors. Molecular and electrophysiological cell-identities of the projection did not vary by sex. By contrast, comprehensive whole-brain mapping uncovered significant differences in NAc innervation patterns that were both sex and ELA-dependent, as well as selective changes of innervation of other brain regions. Conclusions: The CRH/GABA BLA-NAc projection that influences reward behaviors in males differs structurally and functionally in females, uncovering potential mechanisms for the profound sex-specific impacts of ELA on reward behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297901

These two groups of taxa show contrasting trends in the molecular mechanisms of 3D chromatin organization and long-term evolutionary dynamics of cis-regulatory element (CREs) conservation. To help us identify shared versus derived features that could be responsible for the evolution of these different regulatory architectures in animals, we studied the evolution and organization of the regulatory genome of echinoderms, a lineage whose phylogenetic position and relatively slow molecular evolution has proven particularly useful for evolutionary studies. First, using PacBio and HiC data, we generated new reference genome assemblies for two species belonging to two different echinoderm classes: the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the bat sea star Patiria miniata. Second, we characterized their 3D chromatin architecture, identifying TAD-like domains in echinoderms that, like in flies, do not seem to be associated with CTCF motif orientation. Third, we systematically profiled CREs during sea star and sea urchin development using ATAC-seq, comparing their regulatory logic and dynamics over multiple developmental stages. Finally, we investigated sea urchin and sea star CRE evolution across multiple evolutionary distances and timescales, from closely related species to other echinoderm classes and deuterostome lineages. This showed the presence of several thousand elements conserved for hundreds of millions of years, revealing a vertebrate-like pattern of CRE evolution that probably constitutes an ancestral property of the regulatory evolution of animals.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297901

By combining unbiased Polylox barcoding with computational inference, we comprehensively mapped tissue macrophage ontogeny in mice from gastrulation to adult organs. Our data reveal a lineage tree of all tissue macrophages. This tree originates from a pan-hematopoietic progenitor at embryonic day (E)6.5 and branches, via oligolineage progenitors (E7.5-E9.5), into organ-specific macrophage lineages by E10.5. Barcode analysis in embryonic tissues and adult organ fragments suggests that local macrophage colonies, formed by organ-specific progenitors, persist into adulthood. Indeed, spatial fate mapping with Polytope barcoding detects local Kupffer cell colonies of the size predicted by the lineage tree model. Our findings uncover the origin of tissue-resident macrophages from a lineage tree, and show how holistic barcoding can comprehensively map complex cellular lineage specification.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297901

Under heat stress, global transcription and translation are inhibited, while the expression of chaperone proteins are preferentially favored. As the direct link between mRNA transcription and protein translation, tRNA expression is intricately regulated during the stress response. Despite extensive research into the heat shock response (HSR), the regulation of tRNA expression by RNA Polymerase III (Pol III) transcription has yet to be fully elucidated in mammalian cells. Here, we examine the regulation of Pol III transcription during different stages of heat shock stress in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We observe that Pol III transcription is downregulated after 30 minutes of heat shock, followed by an overall increase in transcription after 60 minutes of heat shock. This effect is more evident in tRNAs, though other Pol III gene targets are also similarly affected. Notably, we show that the downregulation at 30 minutes of heat shock is independent of HSF1, the master transcription factor of the HSR, but that the subsequent increase in expression at 60 minutes requires HSF1. Taken together, these results demonstrate an adaptive RNA Pol III response to heat stress, and an intricate relationship between the canonical HSR and tRNA expression.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297901

Current rapid rewarming methods are unreliable at maintaining water temperature between the gold standard range of 37{degrees}C and 39{degrees}C. However, immersion circulators can precisely maintain this temperature range throughout rewarming, potentially leading to better patient outcomes following frostbite injury. In-vitro rewarming trials were conducted using frozen wild boar (Sus scrofa) legs to evaluate 3 rewarming methods: sink and faucet, bucket, and immersion circulator. Porcine leg temperature and water temperature were measured every minute over the 30 minute duration of each trial. The immersion circulator method proved to be the most efficient at reaching the target tissue temperature (9 minutes) while maintaining the least variability in water temperature (0% of time spent below 37{degrees}C). Our study concludes that the immersion circulator method is superior to other methods as it achieves faster and more consistent rewarming.

The application of pseudoalignment to large reference sequences - like the genome - is, however, not trivial, due to the large size of the references or ""targets"" (i.e. chromosomes) and the presence of repetitive sequences within an individual reference sequence. This can lead to multiple matching locations for a k-mer within a single reference, which in turn can lead to false positive mappings and incorrect reference assignments for a read when the colors across the k-mer matches for a read are aggregated. Even when the read is determined to map to the appropriate reference, the increased occurrence of k-mer multi-matches within a reference can prevent the determination of the correct approximate position of the read, which is often critical in applications that map short reads to the genome. We propose a new and modified pseudoalignment scheme that partitions each reference into ""virtual colors"". These are essentially overlapping bins of fixed maximal extent on the reference sequences that are treated as distinct ""colors"" from the perspective of the pseudoalignment algorithm. A mapped k-mer is assigned a virtual color id that encodes the combination of the reference and within-reference bin in which the k-mer occurs. When the k-mers across a read are aggregated, the intersection is performed on virtual colors instead of the original colors (references), to determine the compatible set of targets (bins). The virtual colors can then be mapped back to the original references to provide the final mappings. The projection of the original reference sequences into virtual color space, and the corresponding modifications to the pseudoalignment procedure, can be applied dynamically at program invocation and without any modification of the underlying index itself. This makes the setting and modification of instance-appropriate parameters efficient and straightforward and the approach widely applicable. We apply this modified pseudoalignment procedure to process and map single-cell ATAC-seq data in our new tool alevin-fry-atac. We compare alevin-fry-atac to both Chromap and Cell Ranger ATAC. Alevin-fry-atac is highly scalable and, when using 32 threads, is approximately 1.78 times faster than Chromap (the second fastest approach) while using approximately 3 times less memory and mapping slightly more reads. The resulting peaks and clusters generated from alevin-fry-atac show high concordance with those obtained from both Chromap and the Cell Ranger ATAC pipeline, demonstrating that virtual color-enhanced pseudoalignment directly to the genome provides a fast, memory-frugal, and accurate alternative to existing approaches for single-cell ATAC-seq processing. The development of alevin-fry-atac brings single-cell ATAC-seq processing into a unified ecosystem with single-cell RNA-seq processing (via alevin-fry) to work toward providing a truly open alternative to many of the varied capabilities of CellRanger. Furthermore, our modified pseudoalignment approach should be easily applicable and extendable to other genome-centric mapping-based tasks and modalities such as standard DNA-seq, DNase-seq, Chip-seq and Hi-C.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297901

Patients with PTSD often have high healthcare utilization rates, particularly for acute services. This study examines the association between medical cannabis treatment and healthcare utilization among patients with PTSD.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using cross-sectional data with tem-poral elements, derived from administrative records provided by Leafwell, among patients with PTSD. The cohort was defined based on medical cannabis use: the treated group included patients who had used medical cannabis for at least one year (returning for medical card renewal), while the untreated group consisted of cannabis-naive patients reporting no prior cannabis use. The primary outcomes were healthcare utilization within the past six months, including at least one urgent care visit, emergency department (ED) visit, or hospitalization related to their primary medical condition. We used inverse probability weighting with regression adjustment (IPWRA) to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of medical cannabis use on healthcare utilization, controlling for key demographics and health factors, including PTSD severity. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of our findings.

ResultsAmong the 1,946 participants, the treated group (n = 1,261) had significantly lower healthcare utilization rates compared to the untreated group (n = 685). Using the doubly robust IPWRA model, medical cannabis treatment was associated with a significant 35.6% reduction in urgent care visits (coefficient = -0.024, Standard Error (SE) = 0.0117) and a 35.1% reduction in ED visits (coefficient = -0.027, SE = 0.0124). Hospitalization rates were 26.3% lower among the treated group but did not reach statistical significance. Sensitivity analyses utilizing alternative ATE estimation strategies displayed consistent reductions in urgent care and ED visits among cannabis users, though hospitalizations remained non-significant. Adjusting the IPWRA models tolerance levels strengthened the found associations while maintaining strong covariate balance. Fewer than 2% of the treated group reported an adverse event.

DiscussionThese findings suggest that medical cannabis treatment among patients with PTSD may be associated with reduced utilization of urgent care and ED services. This relationship remains robust across multiple statistical models and sensitivity analyses, underscoring the potential role of medical cannabis in reducing acute healthcare needs in this population. Further longitudinal research is warranted to explore causality and assess its impact on hospitalization rates.","NA","medrxiv",1733177297901

To uncover the evolutionary diversity of ribosome biogenesis, we analyzed over 30,000 bacterial genomes and revealed that Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR), also known as the phylum Patescibacteria, characterized by reduced genomes and smaller ribosomes, has about half the average number of RBFs compared with non-CPR bacteria. Notably, key RBFs such as der, obgE, and rbfA, considered indispensable, are conserved in only around 20%-70% of CPR genomes. Since such repertoires were not observed in reduced genomes of other phyla, CPR presumably diverged early in bacterial evolution. We further confirmed that ribosomal structural changes correlate with reduced RBFs, evidencing co-evolution between RBFs and the ribosome. These findings suggest that ribosomal biogenesis is more flexible than recognized, and the small cell and genome sizes of CPR bacteria and their early divergence may influence the unusual repertoires of RBFs.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297901

By training a decoder to estimate navigational heading and velocity from PPC activity during virtual navigation, we discovered that mice could immediately navigate toward goal locations when control was switched to BMI. No learning or adaptation was observed during BMI, indicating that naturally occurring PPC activity patterns are sufficient to drive navigational trajectories in real time. During successful BMI trials, decoded trajectories decoupled from the mouses physical movements, suggesting that PPC activity relates to intended trajectories. Our work demonstrates a role for PPC in navigation and offers a BMI approach for investigating causal links between neural activity and behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297901

Analyzing disease-related gene transcripts from patient cells would improve detection of mutations that have been missed or misinterpreted in terms of pathogenicity during routine genome sequencing. However, the analysis of transcripts is complicated by the fact that a biopsy of the affected tissue is often not appropriate, and many disease-associated genes are not expressed in tissues or cells that can be easily obtained from patients. Here, using CRISPR/Cas-mediated transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) we developed a robust and efficient approach to activate genes in skin-derived fibroblasts and in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy individuals. This approach was successfully applied to blood samples from patients with inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD). We were able to efficiently activate several IRD-linked genes and detect the corresponding transcripts using different diagnostically relevant methods such as RT-qPCR, RT-PCR and long- and short-read RNA sequencing. The detection and analysis of known and unknown mRNA isoforms demonstrates the potential of CRISPRa-mediated transcriptional activation in PBMCs.

However, OrthoRep-based GOI evolution has almost always started from single GOI sequences, limiting the number of locations on a fitness landscape from where evolutionary search begins. Here, we present a simple approach for the high-efficiency integration of GOI libraries onto OrthoRep.

We demonstrate our method's utility through the straightforward construction of mock nanobody libraries encoded on OrthoRep, from which rare binders were reliably enriched.

The content of naturalistic stimuli is rich and continuous. The fMRI signals of naturalistic stimuli are complex and include different components. A major challenge is isolate the stimuli-induced signals while simultaneously tracking the brains responses to these stimuli in real-time. To this end, we have developed a user-friendly graphical interface toolbox called NaDyNet (Naturalistic Dynamic Network Toolbox), which integrates existing dynamic brain network analysis methods and their enhanced versions. The main features of NaDyNet are: 1) extracting signals of interest from naturalistic fMRI signals; 2) incorporating six commonly used dynamic analysis methods and three static analysis methods; 3) enhanced versions of these dynamic methods by adopting inter-subject analysis to eliminate the effects of non-interest signals; 4) performing K-means clustering analysis to identify temporally reoccurring states along with their temporal and spatial attributes. We then introduced the rationale for incorporating inter-subject analysis to improve existing dynamic brain network analysis methods, and presented numerous examples. We also summarized research progress in comparing methodological efficacy, offered our recommendations for method selection in dynamic network analysis, and discussed the limitations of current approaches and directions for future research.

While cellular aging is associated with functional changes across many cellular components contributing to the collective decline in cellular function, little is known about how it affects CME. Here we show that CME dynamics are significantly altered during replicative aging in budding yeast, with older cells having slower assembly of early and coat CME modules, resulting in longer endocytic turnover and reduced cargo internalization. This change in CME dynamics is mother cell-specific and is not observed in daughter cells. We identified vacuolar pH, a key driver of aging phenotypes in budding yeast, as a central player in this modulation of CME dynamics during aging. Perturbing vacuolar pH in young cells mimics aging-like CME dynamics, while maintaining an acidic vacuolar pH in aging cells preserves CME dynamics typical of young cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the vacuolar pH effect on CME is regulated through TORC1 via the effector kinase Npr1. These findings establish vacuolar pH as a critical regulator of CME during cellular aging, and strengthen its role in the overall cellular aging process in budding yeast.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297901

Their mechanisms of pathogenicity are not well-understood but are likely governed by effectors, secreted proteins that manipulate host cellular processes to facilitate infection and suppress immune responses. We sought to understand how three effector candidates (EFC1, EFC2, and EFC3) expressed in the first stages of Austropuccinia psidii (myrtle rust) infection influence pathogenicity. We experimentally tested gene function through application of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and characterised the genomic landscape of putative effectors expressed during infection to assess whether putative effectors are needed for infection, and whether they are under selection pressure. One of the three screened candidates, EFC1, met our criteria of an effector in that it was predicted to be secreted, and was needed to cause but not maintain infection. We identified that this effector belongs to a gene family of intragenomic variants in tandem repeats flanked by transposable elements. Single nucleotide polymorphisms among these variants have signatures of non-neutral selection. This effector has predicted structural homology to a glycosaminoglycan-binding domain and may have a role in pectin or chitin-binding.

Unlike the structure of an enzyme which is directly impacted by its sequence, substrate specificity as an enzyme attribute involves a rather indirect relationship with sequence as it also depends on structural aspects that dictate substrate accessibility and active site dynamics. In this study, we explore the performance of classifier-based machine learning models trained on curated sequence and structural data for a class of glycosyltransferases (GTs), namely GT-Bs, to understand their substrate specificity determining factors. GTs enable the transfer of sugar moieties to other biomolecules such as oligosaccharides or proteins and are found in all kingdoms of life. In plants, GTs participate in the biosynthesis of plant cell wall biopolymers (eg: hemicelluloses and pectins) and are an integral part of the enzymatic machinery that enables the storage of carbon and energy as plant biomass. To elucidate the substrate specificity of uncharacterized GT-Bs, we constructed multi-label machine learning models (Support Vector Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive-Bayes, Random Forest) that incorporate both sequence and structural features. These models achieve good predictive accuracies on test datasets. However, despite our use of structural information, we highlight that there is further scope for improvement in training these models to draw interpretable relationships between sequence, structure and substrate specificity determining motifs in GT-Bs.","NA","biorxiv",1733177297901

These central nervous system disorders impact both the structure and function of the brain and may lead to imaging changes that precede symptoms. Patients with ADRD or PD have long asymptomatic phases that exhibit significant heterogeneity. Hence, quantitative measures that can provide early disease indicators are necessary to improve patient stratification, clinical care, and clinical trial design. This work uses machine learning techniques to derive such a quantitative marker from T1-weighted (T1w) brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

MethodsIn this retrospective study, we developed machine learning (ML) based disease-specific scores based on T1w brain MRI utilizing Parkinsons Disease Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts. We evaluated the potential of ML-based scores for early diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of ADRD and PD in an independent large-scale population-based longitudinal cohort, UK Biobank.

Findings1,826 dementia images from 731 participants, 3,161 healthy control images from 925 participants from the ADNI cohort, 684 PD images from 319 participants, and 232 healthy control images from 145 participants from the PPMI cohort were used to train machine learning models. The classification performance is 0.94 [95% CI: 0.93-0.96] area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for ADRD detection and 0.63 [95% CI: 0.57-0.71] for PD detection using 790 extracted structural brain features. The most predictive regions include the hippocampus and temporal brain regions in ADRD and the substantia nigra in PD. The normalized ML models probabilistic output (ADRD and PD imaging scores) was evaluated on 42,835 participants with imaging data from the UK Biobank. There are 66 cases for ADRD and 40 PD cases whose T1 brain MRI is available during pre-diagnostic phases. For diagnosis occurrence events within 5 years, the integrated survival model achieves a time-dependent AUC of 0.86 [95% CI: 0.80-0.92] for dementia and 0.89 [95% CI: 0.85-0.94] for PD. ADRD imaging score is strongly associated with dementia-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.76 [95% CI: 1.50-2.05] per S.D. of imaging score), and PD imaging score shows association with PD-free survival (hazard ratio 2.33 [95% CI: 1.55-3.50]) in our integrated model. HR and prevalence increased stepwise over imaging score quartiles for PD, demonstrating heterogeneity. As a proxy for diagnosis, we validated AD/PD polygenic risk scores of 42,835 subjects against the imaging scores, showing a highly significant association after adjusting for covariates. In both the PPMI and ADNI cohorts, the scores are associated with clinical assessments, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and pathological markers, which include amyloid and tau. Finally, imaging scores are associated with polygenic risk scores for multiple diseases. Our results suggest that we can use imaging scores to assess the genetic architecture of such disorders in the future.

InterpretationOur study demonstrates the use of quantitative markers generated using machine learning techniques for ADRD and PD. We show that disease probability scores obtained from brain structural features are useful for early detection, prognosis prediction, and monitoring disease progression.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for articles published in English from database inception to May 11, 2023, about the use of machine learning on brain imaging data for Alzheimers disease (AD), dementia, and Parkinsons disease (PD) populations. We used search terms ""machine learning"" AND ""brain imaging"" AND ""neurodegenerative disorders"" AND ""quantitative biomarkers"". The search identified 25 studies. Most of these studies are focused on Alzheimers disease. They use machine learning to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia or to build a classification tool. Many studies also focused on positron emission tomography (PET) images rather than cost-effective T1w MRI images in their analysis. None of the studies have focused on detecting disease during the asymptomatic phase of dementia and PD. Identified studies are limited in sample size (order of hundred samples) and extracted features. The assessments of the clinical utility of machine learning models predicted disease probabilities are scarce. Significantly, no attempts were made to validate the algorithm in an external cohort. In this work, we have limited our review to scientific studies that are transparent and reproducible, including those that provide code and validate their findings on a reasonable sample size.

Added value of this studyThis study developed machine learning based quantitative scores to measure the risk, severity, and prognosis of Alzheimers disease and related dementias (ADRD) and Parkinsons disease (PD) using brain imaging data. Neurodegenerative disorders affect multiple body functions and exhibit significant etiology and clinical presentation variation. Patients with these conditions may experience prolonged asymptomatic periods. Disease-modifying therapies are most effective during the early asymptomatic stage of the disease, making early intervention a crucial factor. However, the lack of biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease progression monitoring remains a significant obstacle to achieving this goal. We leveraged disease-specific cohorts ADNI (1,826 images from 731 dementia participants) and PPMI (684 images from 329 PD participants) to develop a machine learning classifier for AD and PD detection using T1w brain imaging data. We obtain disease-specific imaging scores from these trained models using the normalized disease probability score. In a sizable external biobank, UK Biobank (42,835 participants), we found these scores show strong predictive power in determining the occurrence of PD or dementia during a 5-year followup. The occurrence of PD increased stepwise over ascending imaging score quantiles representing heterogeneity within the PD population. Imaging scores are also associated with pathological and clinical assessment measures. Our study indicates this could be a single numeric indicator representing disease-specific abnormality in T1w brain imaging modality. The association of imaging scores with the polygenic risk score of related disorders implies the genetic basis of these scores. We also identified top brain regions associated with dementia and Parkinsons disease using feature interpretation tools.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe findings should improve our ability to create practical passive surveillance plans for individuals with a heightened risk of occurrence of neurodegenerative disease. We have shown that imaging scores complement other risk factors, such as age and polygenic risk scores for early detection. The integrated model could serve as a tool for early interventions and study enrollment. Understanding the genetic basis of imaging scores can provide valuable insights into the biology of neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, these high-accuracy models able to facilitate accurate early detection at the biobank scale can empower precision medicine trial recruitment strategies as well as paths of care for the future. We have included the development of an interactive web server (https://ndds-brainimaging-ml.streamlit.app) that empowers the community to process their own data based on our models and explore the utility and applicability of these findings for themselves. Users can easily upload a Nifti or DICOM file containing their MRI image, and we handle the entire pre-processing and prediction process. All computations are performed on the Google Cloud Platform. In addition, we provide an interpretation of the ML prediction highlighting areas of the brain that have contributed to the decision and a what-if-analysis tool where users explore different scenarios and their effect on prediction.","NA","medrxiv",1733177297901

Previous literature suggests that measures of brain function might be more sensitive to neuropathologic burden during the preclinical stage of AD than conventional measures of macrostructure, such as cortical thickness. However, among studies that used resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) acquisitions with Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast, most employed connectivity-based analytic approaches, which discard information about the amplitude of spontaneous brain activity. Consequently, little is known about the effects of amyloid and tau pathology on BOLD amplitude. To address this knowledge gap, we characterized the effects of preclinical and prodromal AD on the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of the BOLD signal both at the whole-brain level and, at a more granular level, focused on subregions of the medial temporal lobe. We observed reduced ALFF in both preclinical and prodromal AD. In preclinical AD, amyloid positivity was associated with a spatially diffuse ALFF reduction in the frontal, medial parietal, and lateral temporal association cortices, while tau pathology was negatively associated with ALFF in the entorhinal cortex. These ALFF effects were observed in the absence of observable macrostructural changes in preclinical AD and remained after adjusting for structural atrophy in prodromal AD, indicating that ALFF offers additional sensitivity to early disease processes beyond what is provided by traditional structural imaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration. We conclude that ALFF may be a promising imaging-based biomarker for assessing the effects of amyloid-clearing immunotherapies in preclinical AD.","NA","medrxiv",1733177297901

Yet research to date has not compared these patients with healthy controls with a history of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, making it difficult to understand why certain COVID patients develop post-COVID cognitive symptoms while others do not. The objective of this pilot study was to compare two groups of laboratory-confirmed post-COVID patients, with and without cognitive symptoms, on measures of cognitive and psychological functioning, self-reported perceptions of functional status and quality of life, and biomarkers of stress, inflammation, and neuroplasticity.

MethodsUsing a case-control design, 17 participants were recruited from a healthcare system in western Michigan, USA in 2022 through 2024. All participants were aged 25-65 and had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test confirming previous COVID-19 infection. Ten participants reported cognitive symptoms (long COVID group) while seven were fully recovered with no residual symptoms (controls). All participants underwent an interview on their self-rated health and quality of life, a battery of neurocognitive tests, and blood draw for biomarker analysis.

ResultsNo group differences were detected for neuropsychological test measures except for letter fluency where the long COVID group scored significantly lower (p<.05). The long COVID group had significantly lower ratings than controls on quality of life, physical health, emotional functioning, and psychological well-being. Serum levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), a biomarker of brain plasticity, were significantly lower in the long COVID group, which was significantly more likely than controls to have serum levels of inflammatory marker (interleukin (IL)-10) values greater than or equal to the median (p=0.015).

ConclusionBiomarker analyses suggest possible prolonged inflammatory processes in long COVID patients compared to fully recovered patients. Results of decreased neuroplastic functioning give credence to patients reports of post-COVID changes in brain function.","NA","medrxiv",1733177297901

These variants are thought to act during fetal development to influence the formation of different heart structures. However, identifying the genes, pathways, and cell types that mediate these effects has been challenging due to the immense diversity of cell types involved in heart development as well as the superimposed complexities of interpreting noncoding sequences. As such, understanding the molecular functions of both noncoding and coding variants remains paramount to our fundamental understanding of cardiac development and CHD. Here, we created a gene regulation map of the healthy human fetal heart across developmental time, and applied it to interpret the functions of variants associated with CHD and quantitative cardiac traits. We collected single-cell multiomic data from 734,000 single cells sampled from 41 fetal hearts spanning post-conception weeks 6 to 22, enabling the construction of gene regulation maps in 90 cardiac cell types and states, including rare populations of cardiac conduction cells. Through an unbiased analysis of all 90 cell types, we find that both rare coding variants associated with CHD and common noncoding variants associated with valve traits converge to affect valvular interstitial cells (VICs). VICs are enriched for high expression of known CHD genes previously identified through mapping of rare coding variants. Eight CHD genes, as well as other genes in similar molecular pathways, are linked to common noncoding variants associated with other valve diseases or traits via enhancers in VICs. In addition, certain common noncoding variants impact enhancers with activities highly specific to particular subanatomic structures in the heart, illuminating how such variants can impact specific aspects of heart structure and function. Together, these results implicate new enhancers, genes, and cell types in the genetic etiology of CHD, identify molecular convergence of common noncoding and rare coding variants on VICs, and suggest a more expansive view of the cell types instrumental in genetic risk for CHD, beyond the working cardiomyocyte.

However, healthcare decision makers need evidence of cost effectiveness to understand the cost/benefit of adopting this approach.

MethodsTo evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different smoking cessation interventions, and service delivery, we used a Markov model, adapted from previous National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on smoking cessation. This uses long-term epidemiological data to capture the prevalence of the smoking-related illnesses, where prevalence is estimated based on age, sex, and smoking status. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to capture joint parameter uncertainty.

ResultsAll smoking cessation interventions appeared cost-effective at a threshold of {pound}20,000 per quality-adjusted life year, compared to no intervention or behavioural support alone. Offering immediate smoking cessation as part of lung cancer screening appointments, compared with usual care (onward referral to stop smoking services) was also estimated to be cost-effective with a net monetary benefit of {pound}2,198 per person, and a saving of between {pound}34 and {pound}79 per person in reduced workplace absenteeism among working age attendees. Estimated healthcare cost savings were more than four times greater in the most deprived quintile compared to the least deprived, alongside a fivefold increase in QALYs accrued.

ConclusionsSmoking cessation interventions within lung cancer screening are cost-effective and should be integrated so that treatment is initiated during screening visits. This is likely to reduce overall costs to the health service, and wider integrated care systems, improve quality and length of life, and may lessen health inequalities.

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topic?C_ST_ABSSmoking cessation interventions are known to be cost-effective in general. However, their cost-effectiveness specifically within lung cancer screening programmes, where they are not routinely commissioned, remains to be established.

What this study addsThis health economic analysis estimates that offering smoking cessation immediately within a lung cancer screening visits is a cost-effective intervention, with a substantial return on investment for the healthcare service, alongside a reduction in health inequalities and an increase in productivity for the wider economy.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyThis economic evaluation will provide those commissioning and planning healthcare services with evidence that supports the case for funding smoking cessation services integrated within lung cancer screening programmes as immediate, opt-out services.","NA","medrxiv",1733177297901

PREVENT-19 (NCT04611802/2019nCoV-301), a pivotal phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated robust efficacy of a primary, 2-dose series of NVX-CoV2373 against COVID-19.

MethodsProtocol expansions to PREVENT-19 included enrollment of adolescents (aged 12 to <18 years) and administration of 3rd and 4th doses of NVX-CoV2373 to adults and adolescents. Participants randomized 2:1 received NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart; 3rd and 4th doses were administered [&ge;]6 months after the preceding dose. Secondary and additional assessments included post-3rd- and 4th-dose immune responses (neutralizing antibody [nAb], anti-rS IgG, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-receptor binding inhibition [hACE2-RBI]) and response durability (post-3rd dose) to ancestral virus; cross-reactivity to Omicron subvariants; safety; and reactogenicity.

ResultsImmune responses were observed against ancestral virus after two doses of NVX-CoV2373 but not after placebo. In both adults and adolescents, additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 increased nAb titers, anti-rS IgG levels, and hACE2-RBI; durable responses were recorded 8 months post 3rd dose. nAb responses post 3rd dose were noninferior to those post primary series. Cross-reactivity to BA.5 and BQ.1.1 variants was also observed, with anti-rS IgG levels post 3rd or 4th dose exceeding previously reported correlates of protection. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated, with no new safety signals.

ConclusionsNVX-CoV2373 elicited robust and durable humoral immune responses to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 as a 3rd and 4th dose after the primary series in adults and adolescents. Cross-reactivity to relevant variants provides insight into potential protection against antigenically related, but shifted, viral strains. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated with no new safety signals. These results support the utility of this vaccine platform and continued updates, based on currently circulating strains, to help effectively combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsThis phase 3, open-label study (2019nCoV-312/NCT05875701) enrolled participants who received one dose of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 protein-based vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) in an earlier study (2019nCoV-307/NCT05463068) after a primary series and possibly one additional dose of mRNA vaccine. In the current study, participants received an additional dose of protein-based vaccine (ancestral [n=104] or Omicron BA.5 [n=40]) at least 180 days after their previous study dose. The primary objective was demonstration of noninferiority of neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers induced by the dose in this study versus the first dose of NVX-CoV-2373 in the earlier study. Safety was also evaluated.

ResultsA total of 144 participants were enrolled. The ratio of anti-Wuhan nAbs (GMT, IU/mL [95% CI]) at Day 28 after this study dose (ancestral 393.2 [318.0-468.2]) versus previous study dose (396.6 [328.7-478.6]) was 1.0 (0.8, 1.2), meeting noninferiority. The seroresponse rate difference between doses was 7.4% (95% CI = -1.2%-16.5%), also meeting noninferiority. Omicron BA.5 nAb titers suggest cross-protection against emerging variants. The nAb ratio at Day 28 between Omicron dose in this study (835.0 [597.1-1167.6]) versus previous study ancestral dose (436.0 [305.6-622.2]) was 1.9 (1.5-2.5), exceeding superiority criterion. Local and systemic reactions were similar between doses and strains in both studies.

ConclusionsA heterologous regimen of two adjuvanted recombinant spike protein-based vaccine doses after mRNA vaccination produced robust immune responses, exhibiting cross-reactivity to newer variants.","NA","medrxiv",1733177297901

From 2022, the national vaccination programme has been run twice per year, prioritising older age groups or those classified as clinically vulnerable. Here we assess the trends in COVID-19 outcomes between September 2023 and April 2024, using national-level data held by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

MethodsData linkage of national-level COVID-19 episode data, NHS emergency and hospital attendance data, and death registrations were used to analyse COVID-19 outcomes. Outcomes were defined as COVID-19 associated A&E attendances, hospital admissions, severe hospitalisations, and deaths.

The number and rate of each COVID-19 outcome category between September 2023 and April 2024 was calculated, stratified by clinical risk status and age and sex.

ResultsThe most common COVID-19 outcomes during this time-period were A&E attendance and hospital admission, with the rates highest among those aged 75 and over. Among this age group, all outcomes disproportionately affect those who have been identified as at clinical risk and those who were immunosuppressed.

High rates of A&E attendance and hospital admission were also observed among infants (under 6 months old) but were lower for more severe outcomes.

DiscussionGroups that were most affected by COVID-19 outcomes were currently prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination in England, which will help protect against more severe outcomes including admission to intensive care and death.

Routine national levels surveillance of COVID-19 outcomes is essential to monitor populations most of severe disease and informing vaccination policy.","NA","medrxiv",1733177297901

Immunity has been acquired through natural infection, primary and booster vaccination, while protection has been lost through waning immunity and viral mutation. During the height of the pandemic in England, the main aim was to rapidly protect the population and large supplies of vaccine were pre-purchased, eliminating the need for cost-effective calculations. As we move to an era where for the majority of the population SARS-CoV-2 infections cause relatively mild disease, and vaccine stocks need to be re-purchased, it is important we consider the cost-effectiveness and economic value of COVID-19 vaccination programmes.

MethodsHere using data from 2023 and 2024 in England on COVID-19 hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths, coupled with bespoke health economic costs, we consider the willingness to pay threshold for COVID-19 vaccines in different age and risk groups. We partition the population into sixteen 5-year age-groups and three risk groups (no-risk, at-risk and immunosuppressed) and calculate the health savings, in terms of costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), per vaccine dose. We adopt three different methodological approaches to estimate the level of vaccine protection leading to five different estimates of efficacy.

FindingsWillingness to pay thresholds vary from less than {pound}1 for younger age-groups without any risk factors, to over {pound}100 for older age-groups with comorbidities that place them at risk. This extreme non-linear dependence on age, means that despite the different method of estimating vaccine efficacy, there is considerable qualitative agreement on the willingness to pay threshold, and therefore which ages it is cost-effective to vaccinate. For pre-purchased vaccine, where the only cost is administration ({approx}{pound}10), a twice-yearly universal booster offer to all those aged 70 and over is cost-effective (the benefits outweigh the administration costs), while for the at-risk group this could be extended to those over 65. When the vaccine cost is included, the cost-effective ages reduce, such that at a total cost of {pound}30 (for vaccine and administration) universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 75; while at {pound}60 universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 80.

InterpretationThe historic offer of COVID-19 vaccination to those 65 and over for the autumn 2023 programme and those over 75 for the spring 2023 programme, aligns with our cost-effective threshold for pre-purchased vaccine when the only cost was administration. However, for future programmes, when vaccine costs are included, the age-thresholds slowly increase thereby demonstrating the continued importance of protecting the eldest and most vulnerable in the population.","NA","medrxiv",1733177297901

Some of these clones represent a first step towards cancer whereas others may contribute to ageing and other diseases. However, our understanding of the clonal landscapes of human tissues, and their impact on cancer risk, ageing and disease, remains limited due to the challenge of detecting somatic mutations present in small numbers of cells. Here, we introduce a new version of nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq)11, a duplex sequencing method with error rates <5 errors per billion base pairs, which is compatible with whole-exome and targeted gene sequencing. Deep sequencing of polyclonal samples with single-molecule sensitivity enables the simultaneous detection of mutations in large numbers of clones, yielding accurate somatic mutation rates, mutational signatures and driver mutation frequencies in any tissue. Applying targeted NanoSeq to 1,042 non-invasive samples of oral epithelium and 371 samples of blood from a twin cohort, we found an unprecedentedly rich landscape of selection, with 49 genes under positive selection driving clonal expansions in the oral epithelium, over 62,000 driver mutations, and evidence of negative selection in some genes. The high number of positively selected mutations in multiple genes provides high-resolution maps of selection across coding and non-coding sites, a form of in vivo saturation mutagenesis. Multivariate regression models enable mutational epidemiology studies on how carcinogenic exposures and cancer risk factors, such as age, tobacco or alcohol, alter the acquisition and selection of somatic mutations. Accurate single-molecule sequencing has the potential to unveil the polyclonal landscape of any tissue, providing a powerful tool to study early carcinogenesis, cancer prevention and the role of somatic mutations in ageing and disease.","NA","medrxiv",1733177297901

Genomic analysis has identified a lineage with limited internal diversity most closely related to a genome sequence from a sporadic case sampled in 2014 in Uganda, though the lineages have diverged from a common ancestor that was circulating for decades in the animal reservoir.

Notably, the data also provide evidence that the outbreak resulted from a single zoonotic transmission event with limited human-to-human transmission, rather than multiple independent zoonotic transmission events. The Rwandan MVD outbreak prompted a thorough investigation that included contact tracing, clinical assessment, travel history, sequencing, and serology testing, to trace the viruss origin. Results of investigations linked the index case to a mining cave inhabited by Rousettus aegyptiacus (the Egyptian fruit bat), where three individuals tested seropositive for IgG and IgM, further supporting the zoonotic origin of the outbreak through human-animal interactions.","NA","medrxiv",1733177297901
