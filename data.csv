Persistently elevated autoantibodies have been found in some individuals with long COVID (LC). Using a >21,000 human protein array, we identified diverse AAB targets in LC patients that correlated with their symptoms. Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness. Our findings suggest that targeting AABs could benefit some LC patients.","NA","medrxiv",1718834920629

Here, we report a broad survey of plasmids from hundreds of academic and industrial labs worldwide. We show that nearly half of them contained design and/or sequence errors. For transfer plasmids used in making AAV vectors, which are widely used in gene therapy, about 40% carried mutations in ITR regions due to their inherent instability, which is influenced by flanking GC content. We also list genes difficult to clone into plasmid or package into virus due to their toxicity. Our finding raises serious concerns over the trustworthiness of lab-made plasmids, which parallels the underappreciated mycoplasma contamination and misidentified mammalian cell lines reported previously, and highlights the need for community-wide standards to uphold the quality of this ubiquitous reagent in research and medicine.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1718834920629

Despite being modular, composed of multiple zooids and supporting tissues, colonies function as a single physiological unit. A major question in the biology of colonies is the cellular mechanism of generating structurally and functionally distinct colony parts. The cnidarian Hydractinia establishes colonies with different types of zooids (polyps), interconnected by a gastrovascular system that is attached to the substrate and known as stolons. We obtained single cell transcriptomic profiles of ~200K Hydractinia cells, including isolated stolons and two polyp types. We characterised the major Hydractinia cell types and quantified their abundance across colony parts. Overall, we find that distinct colony parts are characterised primarily by distinct combinations of shared cell types and to a lesser extent by part-specific cell types. Therefore, we propose that both cell type combinations, as well as rarer cell type innovations, have been the main mechanism in the evolution of coloniality in cnidarians. We identified cell type-specific transcription factors (TFs) and gene networks expressed within these cell types. Notably, we discovered a previously unidentified, stolon-specific cell type, which expresses enzymes related to biomineralization and chitin synthesis, reminiscent of molluscan shell matrix proteins that may represent a crucial adaptation to the animal's habitat. In summary, the Hydractinia cell atlas elucidates the fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying coloniality.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

Such discordance has hampered interpretation and convergence of research findings across the field. To address this problem, we have developed the Network Correspondence Toolbox (NCT) to permit researchers to examine and report spatial correspondence between their novel neuroimaging results and sixteen widely used functional brain atlases, consistent with recommended reporting standards developed by the Organization for Human Brain Mapping. The atlases included in the toolbox show some topographical convergence for specific networks, such as those labeled as default or visual. Network naming varies across atlases, particularly for networks spanning frontoparietal association cortices. For this reason, quantitative comparison with multiple atlases is recommended to benchmark novel neuroimaging findings. We provide several exemplar demonstrations using the Human Connectome Project task fMRI results and UK Biobank independent component analysis maps to illustrate how researchers can use the NCT to report their own findings through quantitative evaluation against multiple published atlases. The NCT provides a convenient means for computing Dice coefficients with spin test permutations to determine the magnitude and statistical significance of correspondence among user-defined maps and existing atlas labels. The NCT also includes functionality to incorporate additional atlases in the future. The adoption of the NCT will make it easier for network neuroscience researchers to report their findings in a standardized manner, thus aiding reproducibility and facilitating comparisons between studies to produce interdisciplinary insights.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

While protein localization in the thermophilic model archaeon S. acidocaldarius has been achieved using antibodies with fluorescent probes in fixed cells, the use of thermostable fluorescent proteins in thermophilic archaea has so far been unsuccessful. Given the significance of live protein localization in the field of archaeal cell biology, we aimed to identify fluorescent proteins for use in S. acidocaldarius. To achieve this, we expressed various previously published and optimized thermostable fluorescent proteins along with fusion proteins of interest and analyzed the cells using flow cytometry and (thermo-) fluorescent microscopy. Of the tested proteins, Thermal Green Protein (TGP) exhibited the brightest fluorescence when expressed in Sulfolobus cells. By optimizing the linker between TGP and a protein of interest, we could additionally successfully fuse proteins with minimal loss of fluorescence. TGP-CdvB and TGP-PCNA1 fusions displayed localization patterns consistent with previous immunolocalization experiments. These initial results in protein localization in S. acidocaldarius at high temperatures, combined with recent advancements in thermomicroscopy, open new avenues in the field of archaeal cell biology.

BiomiX incorporates diverse omics data. DESeq2/Limma packages analyze transcriptomics data, while statistical tests determine metabolomics peaks. The metabolomics annotation uses the mass-to-charge ratio in the CEU Mass Mediator database and fragmentation spectra in the TidyMass package while Methylomics analysis is performed using the ChAMP R package. Multiomics Factor Analysis (MOFA) integration and interpretation identifies common sources of variations among omics. BiomiX provides comprehensive outputs, including statistics and report figures, also integrating EnrichR and GSEA for biological process exploration. Subgroup analysis based on user gene panels enhances comparisons. BiomiX implements MOFA automatically, selecting the optimal MOFA model to discriminate the two cohorts being compared while providing interpretation tools for the discriminant MOFA factors. The interpretation relies on innovative bibliography research on Pubmed, which provides the articles most related to the discriminant factor contributors. The interpretation is also supported by clinical data correlation with the discriminant MOFA factors and pathways analyses of the top factor contributors. The integration of single and multi-omics analysis in a standalone tool, together with the implementation of MOFA and its interpretability by literature, constitute a step forward in the multi-omics landscape in line with the FAIR data principles.

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1718834920629

Emerging research suggests that ME/CFS and Long COVID exhibit overlapping metabolic symptoms, indicating possible shared metabolic dysfunctions. This study aims to systematically explore these shared metabolic disturbances and their potential treatments. Utilizing our novel metabolic modeling method, GPMM, we identified the key metabolic irregularities in patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID, notably the downregulation of the alanine and aspartate metabolism pathway, and the arginine and proline metabolism pathway. Genome-wide knockout analyses indicated that supplementation with aspartate (ASP) or asparagine (ASN) could potentially ameliorate these metabolic deficiencies. Further metabolic assessments in Long COVID patients highlighted the significant downregulation of ASP in both blood and muscle, supporting our predictions. Consequently, we propose that the combination of l-ornithine and l-aspartate (LOLA) offers a promising approach to alleviate metabolic symptoms in both ME/CFS and Long COVID patients. This study not only elucidates the shared metabolic pathways in ME/CFS and Long COVID but also positions LOLA as a viable candidate for future clinical trials.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

Conflicting models have proposed either a fluid-like or solid-like nature for the intranuclear microenvironment. To reconcile this discrepancy, we investigated the 3D structure and properties of the nuclear interior using experiments and computer simulations. We reveal a novel mechanism where newly synthesized RNA interacts with SAF-A (scaffold attachment factor A, or HNRNPU), forming interconnected microgels degraded by the exonuclease XRN2, leading to dynamic cycles of gelation and fluidization. This emergent microgel network depends on transcription, and is disrupted by SAF-A depletion. It also decreases protein mobility and regulates chromatin compaction by modulating microphase separation, thereby opening transcriptionally active regions. This tunable intranuclear network exhibits scale-dependent fluid- and solid-like features, that we suggest may regulate transcription by controlling access to regulatory proteins and polymerases.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

Despite years of study, however, how Notch induces the transcription of its target genes remains unclear. Here, we comprehensively examined the response to human Notch1 across a time course of activation using genomic assays of nascent RNA and chromatin accessibility. These data revealed that Notch induces target gene transcription primarily by releasing paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), in contrast to prevailing models suggesting that Notch acts by promoting chromatin accessibility. Indeed, we found that open chromatin is established at Notch-responsive regulatory elements prior to Notch signaling, through SWI/SNF-mediated remodeling. Notch activation, however, elicited no further chromatin opening at these loci. Together, these studies reveal that the nuclear response to Notch signaling is dictated by the pre-existing chromatin state and RNAPII distribution at time of signal activation.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

One molecule consistently referenced as a delineator of a putative immunosuppressive M2 state is the surface protein CD206. We thus made a novel conditional CD206 (Mrc1) knock-in mouse to specifically visualize and/or deplete CD206+ M2-like TAMs and assess their correspondence with pro-tumoral immunity. Early, but not late depletion of CD206+ macrophages and monocytes (here, Mono/Macs) led to an indirect loss of a key anti-tumor network of NK cells, conventional type I dendritic cells (cDC1) and CD8 T cells. Among myeloid cells, we found that the CD206+ TAMs are the primary producers of CXCL9, and able to differentially attract activated CD8 T cells. In contrast, a population of stress-responsive TAMs (Hypoxic or Spp1+) and immature monocytes, which lack CD206 expression and become prominent following early depletion, expressed markedly diminished levels of CXCL9. Those NK and CD8 T cells which enter CD206-depleted tumors express vastly reduced levels of the corresponding receptor Cxcr3, the cDC1-attracting chemokine Xcl1 and cDC1 growth factor Flt3l transcripts. Consistent with the loss of this critical network, early CD206+ TAM depletion decreased tumor control by antigen specific CD8 T cells in mice. Likewise, in humans, the CD206Replete, but not the CD206Depleted Mono/Mac gene signature correlated robustly with CD8 T cell, NK cell and stimulatory cDC1 gene signatures and transcriptomic signatures skewed towards CD206Replete Mono/Macs associated with better survival. Together, these findings negate the unqualified classification of CD206+ M2-like macrophages as immunosuppressive by illuminating contexts for their role in organizing a critical tumor-reactive archetype of immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

Here, we generated an ancient DNA time transect consisting of 219 individuals with genome-wide data from 47 sites in this region, supplemented by 97 new radiocarbon dates. Spanning from the Early Bronze Age 5000 years ago to the so-called  Migration Period that followed the fall of the Western Roman Empire, we document a largely persisting local gene pool that continuously assimilated migrants from Anatolia/Levant and the populations of the adjacent Eurasian steppe. More specifically, we observe these admixture events as early as the Middle Bronze Age. Starting with Late Antiquity (late first century AD), we also detect an increasing number of individuals with more southern ancestry, more frequently associated with urban centers - landmarks of the early Christianization in eastern Georgia. Finally, in the Early Medieval Period starting 400 AD, we observe genetic outlier individuals with ancestry from the Central Eurasian steppe, with artificial cranial deformations (ACD) in several cases. At the same time, we reveal that many individuals with ACD descended from native South Caucasus groups, indicating that the local population likely adopted this cultural practice.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

Control of gene expression by GPCRs has been studied almost exclusively at the transcriptional level, neglecting an extensive amount of regulation that takes place translationally. Hence, little is known about the nature and mechanisms of gene-specific post-transcriptional regulation downstream of receptor activation. Here, we apply an unbiased multiomics approach to delineate an extensive translational regulatory program initiated by the prototypical beta2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2-AR) and provide mechanistic insights into how these processes are orchestrated. Using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), we identify nearly 120 novel gene targets of adrenergic receptor activity which expression is exclusively regulated at the level of translation. We next show that all translational changes are induced selectively by endosomal {beta}2-ARs. We further report that this proceeds through activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Specifically, within the set of translational GPCR targets we discover significant enrichment of genes with 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, a gene class classically known to be translationally regulated by mTOR. We then demonstrate that endosomal {beta}2-ARs are required for mTOR activation and subsequent mTOR-dependent TOP mRNA translation. Together, this comprehensive analysis of drug-induced translational regulation establishes a critical role for location-biased GPCR signaling in fine-tuning the cellular protein landscape.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

Therefore, the abundance variation of regulatory proteins across unstimulated single cells can be associatively linked with their response to stimulation. Here we developed an approach that leverages this association across individual cells and nuclei to systematically identify potential regulators of biological processes, followed by targeted validation. Specifically, we applied this approach to identify regulators of nucleocytoplasmic protein transport in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To this end, we quantified the proteomes of 3,412 individual nuclei, sampling the dynamic response to LPS treatment, and linking functional variability to proteomic variability. Minutes after the stimulation, the protein transport in individual nuclei correlated strongly with the abundance of known protein transport regulators, thus revealing the impact of natural protein variability on functional cellular response. We found that simple biophysical constraints, such as the quantity of nuclear pores, partially explain the variability in LPS-induced nucleocytoplasmic transport. Among the many proteins newly identified to be associated with the response, we selected 16 for targeted validation by knockdown. The knockdown phenotypes confirmed the inferences derived from natural protein and functional variation of single nuclei, thus demonstrating the potential of (sub-)single-cell proteomics to infer functional regulation. We expect this approach to generalize to broad applications and enhance the functional interpretability of single-cell omics data.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

Low education is frequently pointed to as a potential key factor, due to its robust relationship with dementia risk. Impact of education is notoriously difficult to assess, however, because of associations with multiple other risk and protective factors, and large population-representative samples are required to tease the relationships apart. Here, we studied 207,814 Norwegian men born between 1950 and 1959 who underwent compulsory cognitive testing during military conscription as young adults, to systematically test associations of education, cognition, and other potentially important factors. While low education was associated with increased risk for dementia diagnosis (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37, CI: 1.17-1.60), this association was fully explained by earlier cognitive test scores (HR = 1.08, CI: .91-1.28). In contrast, low cognitive score was associated with double risk of later dementia diagnosis, even when taking education into account (HR = 2.00, CI: 1.65-2.42). This relationship survived controlling for early-life socioeconomic status and was replicated within pairs of brothers. The latter finding suggests that genetic and environmental factors shared within families, such as common genetics, parental education, childhood socioeconomic status, or other shared experiences, cannot account for the association. Rather, independent, non-familial factors are more important. In contrast, within-family factors accounted for the relationship between low education and diagnosis risk. In conclusion, implementing measures to increase cognitive function in childhood and adolescence appears to be a more promising strategy for reducing dementia burden.","NA","medrxiv",1718834920629

Defects in endothelial mechanoresponses can perturb tissue remodelling and functions leading to cardiovascular disease progression. In this context, the precise mechanisms of endothelial mechanoresponses contributing to normal and diseased tissue functioning remain elusive. Here, we sought to uncover how flow-mediated transcriptional regulation drives endothelial mechanoresponses in healthy and atherosclerotic-prone tissues. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we identify novel mechanosensitive genes in response to healthy unidirectional flow (UF) and athero-prone disturbed flow (DF). We find that the transcription as well as protein expression of Four-and-a-half LIM protein 2 (FHL2) are enriched in athero-prone DF both in vitro and in vivo. We then demonstrate that the exogenous expression of FHL2 is necessary and sufficient to drive discontinuous adherens junction morphology and increased tissue permeability. This athero-prone phenotype requires the force-sensitive binding of FHL2 to actin. In turn, the force-dependent localisation of FHL2 to stress fibres promotes microtubule dynamics to release the RhoGEF, GEF-H1, and activate the Rho-ROCK pathway. Thus, we unravelled a novel mechanochemical feedback wherein force-dependent FHL2 localisation promotes hypercontractility. This misregulated mechanoresponse creates highly permeable tissues, depicting classic hallmarks of atherosclerosis progression. Overall, we highlight crucial functions for the FHL2 force-sensitivity in tuning multi-scale endothelial mechanoresponses.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

The mitotic spindle, the self-organized microtubule structure driving chromosome segregation, scales in size with the available cytoplasm. Yet, the relationship between spindle size and chromosome movement remains poorly understood. Here, we address how the movement of chromosomes changes during the cleavage divisions of the Drosophila blastoderm. We show that the speed of chromosome separation gradually decreases during the 4 nuclear divisions of the blastoderm. This reduction in speed is accompanied by a similar reduction in the length of the spindle, thus ensuring that these two quantities are tightly linked. Using a combination of genetic and quantitative imaging approaches, we find that two processes contribute to controlling the speed at which chromosomes move at mitotic exit: the activity of molecular motors important for microtubule depolymerization and the cell cycle oscillator. Specifically, we found that the levels of Klp10A, Klp67A, and Klp59C, three kinesin-like proteins important for microtubule depolymerization, contribute to setting the speed of chromosome separation. This observation is supported by quantification of microtubule dynamics indicating that poleward flux rate scales with the length of the spindle. Perturbations of the cell cycle oscillator using heterozygous mutants of mitotic kinases and phosphatases revealed that the duration of anaphase increases during the blastoderm cycles and is the major regulator of chromosome velocity. Thus, our work suggests a potential link between the biochemical rate of mitotic exit and the forces exerted by the spindle.

Here, we used a whole genome alignment between two maize genotypes to identify polymorphic structural variants and then genotyped a large maize diversity panel for these variants using short-read sequencing data. We characterized variation of SVs within the panel and identified SV polymorphisms that are associated with life history traits and genotype-by-environment interactions. While most of the SVs associated with traits contained TEs, only one of the SV's boundaries clearly matched TE breakpoints indicative of a TE insertion, whereas the other polymorphisms were likely caused by deletions. All of the SVs associated with traits were in linkage disequilibrium with nearby single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), suggesting that this method did not identify variants that would have been missed in a SNP association study.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

Here, we leveraged unbiased single-nucleus transcriptional profiling to identify expression of the secreted glycoprotein Reelin (encoded by the Reln gene) as a marker of cocaine-activated neuronal ensembles within the rat NAc. Multiplexed in situ detection confirmed selective expression of the immediate early gene Fos in Reln+ neurons after cocaine experience, and also revealed enrichment of Reln mRNA in Drd1+ medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in both the rat and human brain. Using a novel CRISPR interference strategy enabling selective Reln knockdown in the adult NAc, we observed altered expression of genes linked to calcium signaling, emergence of a transcriptional trajectory consistent with loss of cocaine sensitivity, and a striking decrease in MSN intrinsic excitability. At the behavioral level, loss of Reln prevented cocaine locomotor sensitization, abolished cocaine place preference memory, and decreased cocaine self-administration behavior. Together, these results identify Reelin as a critical mechanistic link between ensemble participation and cocaine-induced behavioral adaptations.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

Research on host-pathogen interactions and host immunity in various leafy greens benefits from advanced biotechnological tools. The absence of specialised tools for spinach, however, constrains our understanding of spinach immunity. Here, we explored the potential of Type III Secretion System (T3SS)-mediated delivery to study the activity of pathogen effectors in spinach. We identified the Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (DC3000) polymutant D36E, which lacks 36 known T3SS effectors (T3Es), as a promising T3SS-dependent effector delivery system in spinach. Unlike DC3000, which causes visual disease symptoms on spinach, D36E did not induce visible disease symptoms. Using D36E effector delivery, we screened 28 known DC3000 T3Es individually on spinach for effects on disease symptom development, bacterial proliferation reflecting bacterial virulence, and ROS bursts as a proxy for early immune responses. All three assays identified T3Es AvrE1 and HopM1 as crucial determinants of DC3000-like infection on spinach. Additionally, we observed that the T3E HopAD1 strongly suppressed ROS production in spinach. We present the first experimental evidence of plant pathogen effector activities in spinach. By establishing the D36E-effector delivery system in spinach, we pave the way for high-throughput effector studies on spinach.

Here, we identify a unique molecular battle between the classical biotype of Vibrio cholerae and virulent phages ICP1, ICP2, and ICP3. We show that classical biotype strains resist almost all isolates of these phages due to a 25-kb genomic island harboring several putative anti-phage systems. We observed that one of these systems, Nezha, encoding SIR2-like and helicase proteins, inhibited the replication of all three phages. Bacterial SIR2-like enzymes degrade the essential metabolic coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), thereby preventing replication of the invading phage. In support of this mechanism, we identified one phage isolate, ICP1_2001, which circumvents Nezha by encoding two putative NAD+ regeneration enzymes. By restoring the NAD+ pool, we hypothesize that this system antagonizes Nezha without directly interacting with either protein and should be able to antagonize other anti-phage systems that deplete NAD+.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

Individuals of the same species undergo independent TE insertions, causing genetic variability upon which natural selection acts. This can lead to improved adaptation of individuals to their environment. The advent of third-generation sequencing has enabled use of multiple whole-genome de novo assemblies for a given species, avoiding bias introduced by a single reference genome. We developed a new pipeline, panREPET, for such data. It compares TE copies between each pair of individuals then identifies copies shared by a group of individuals. This gives the exact sequence and genomic context of each TE copy. We describe here TE insertions shared among 54 Brachypodium distachyon genomes. We were able to date two major TE bursts corresponding to major climate events: 22 kya during the Last Glacial Maximum and 10 kya during the Holocene.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

Despite significant progress in understanding these individual processes, the mechanism orchestrating these two fates and their effects on root architecture and secondary growth remain unclear. Here we combined lineage tracing with molecular genetics to study the fate dynamics of XPP cells. We showed that developmentally arrested lateral root primordia (LRP) that fail to emerge as lateral roots, gradually obtain cambium identity thus contributing to secondary growth. Conversely, pre-established procambium identity within XPP cells can be reverted to LR identity when simulated by auxin, an important player in LR development. This competence for auxin-induced LR formation from XPP cells, termed LR potency, however, decreases as the root matures. We found key cambium regulators play essential roles in shaping LR potency by promoting cambium activation and inhibiting LR development. Consistently, corresponding mutants with impaired cambium activity display broader LR potency. Moreover, cytokinins, essential players in cambium development, facilitate the identity transition of LRPs to cambium and reduce LR potency through key cambium regulators. Overall, our findings highlight the inherent cellular plasticity of XPP cells and elucidate how plant hormones influence root architecture and secondary growth through balancing the two cell fates of XPP cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

While individual nontarget binding events may be low affinity, the sheer number of such interactions could present a challenge for gene regulation by degrading its precision or possibly leading to an erroneous induction state. Chromatin can prevent nontarget binding by rendering DNA physically inaccessible to TFs, at the cost of energy-consuming remodeling orchestrated by pioneer factors (PFs). Under what conditions and by how much can chromatin reduce regulatory errors on a global scale? We use a theoretical approach to compare two scenarios for gene regulation: one that relies on TF binding to free DNA alone, and one that uses a combination of TFs and chromatin-regulating PFs to achieve desired gene expression patterns. We find, first, that chromatin effectively silences groups of genes that should be simultaneously OFF, thereby allowing more accurate graded control of expression for the remaining ON genes. Second, chromatin buffers the deleterious consequences of nontarget binding as the number of OFF genes grows, permitting a substantial expansion in regulatory complexity. Third, chromatin-based regulation productively co-opts nontarget TF binding for ON genes in order to establish a ""leaky"" baseline expression level, which targeted activator or repressor binding subsequently up- or down-modulates. Thus, on a global scale, using chromatin simultaneously alleviates pressure for high specificity of regulatory interactions and enables an increase in genome size with minimal impact on global expression error.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

During foraging as well as during sleep, population activity drifted continuously and unidirectionally along a one-dimensional manifold. Boundaries between events were associated with discrete shifts in state space, suggesting that LEC dynamics directly reflect event segmentation. During tasks with a recurring temporal structure, activity traveled additionally in directions orthogonal to the flow of drift, enabling the LEC population to multiplex event information across different timescales. Taken together, these results identify a hierarchically organized neural coding scheme for segmenting and organizing events in time.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

Adolescence is considered a crucial period for the maturation of excitation-inhibition balance. This has been primarily observed in animal studies, yet human in vivo evidence on adolescent maturation of the excitation-inhibition balance at the individual level is limited. Here, we developed an individualized in vivo marker of regional excitation-inhibition balance in human adolescents, estimated using large-scale simulations of biophysical network models fitted to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from two independent cross-sectional (N = 752) and longitudinal (N = 149) cohorts. We found a widespread relative increase of inhibition in association cortices paralleled by a relative age-related increase of excitation, or lack of change, in sensorimotor areas across both datasets. This developmental pattern co-aligned with multiscale markers of sensorimotor-association differentiation. The spatial pattern of excitation-inhibition development in adolescence was robust to inter-individual variability of structural connectomes and modeling configurations. Notably, we found that alternative simulation-based markers of excitation-inhibition balance show a variable sensitivity to maturational change. Taken together, our study highlights an increase of inhibition during adolescence in association areas using cross sectional and longitudinal data, and provides a robust computational framework to estimate microcircuit maturation in vivo at the individual level.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

Early drug discovery campaigns focused on STING activation as a promising platform for cancer immunotherapy yet failed in multiple clinical trials due to lack of efficacy thus far. Current research and development activities concentrate on STING inhibition for treating autoimmune disease and neuroinflammation. While the progression of STING activators into the clinic has been successful, the discovery and clinical progression of STING inhibitors remain elusive. Questions persist about the molecular properties needed to distinguish between a STING activator and inhibitor, particularly within SAVI disease, a monogenic autoinflammatory disease that renders STING constitutively active. Here we leverage an orthosteric STING activator and inhibitor from the same chemical series to discover that STING M271 is a critical residue for molecular activation. The M271CH3 NMR chemical shifts reveal a unique molecular signature for pharmacological or genetically driven activation and inhibition that is not captured by x-ray crystallography. Additionally, M271 directly interacts with the most common SAVI mutation, V155M, and using an orthosteric STING inhibitor, we show partial rescue and molecular correction of STING V155M. Finally, these data present insights into therapeutic STING molecular correction for treating SAVI patients. Our results elucidate an unappreciated structural interaction critical for STING modulation that could be utilized as a molecular diagnostic tool for drug discovery. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time how the therapeutic requirements of a molecular corrector differ from an orthosteric STING inhibitor, and why this is important for the SAVI disease population.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

The complexity of carotenoid-based color evolution in nature remains poorly characterized. Here, we examine the long-tailed finch Poephila acuticauda, an Australian songbird with two hybridizing subspecies that differ in bill coloration: yellow in western subspecies acuticauda and red in eastern subspecies hecki. We characterize the carotenoid composition of each subspecies and find that yellow bills can be explained by the loss of C(4)-oxidation, thus blocking yellow dietary pigments from being metabolized to red. Combining linked-read genomic sequencing and reflectance spectrophotometry measurements of bill color collected from wild-sampled finches and laboratory crosses, we identify four loci that together explain 53% of variance in this trait. The two loci of largest effect contain the genes CYP2J19, an essential enzyme for the ketolation via C(4)-oxidation of dietary carotenoids, and TTC39B, an enhancer of ketocarotenoid production. Evolutionary genealogy reconstruction indicates that the red-billed phenotype is ancestral and that yellow alleles at both CYP2J19 and TTC39B arose and fixed in acuticauda approximately 100 kya. Yellow alleles then introgressed into hecki less than 5 kya. Across all four loci, acuticauda derived variants show evidence of selective sweeps, implying that yellow bill coloration has been favored by natural selection. Our study suggests that the frequent adaptive evolutionary transitions between red and yellow ornamentation in nature can have a simple genetic basis.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

In many animals, prey capture demands the orchestrated activation of multiple brain regions, showcasing the intricate interplay between sensory processing, decision-making, and motor execution. These properties make prey capture a prime paradigm in neuroscience. Further, its ubiquity across species make it ideal for comparative investigations and for studying the evolution of cognition. However, despite recent technological advances in the collection and analysis of behavioral data, experimental approaches for prey catch are lagging behind. To bridge this gap, we created PreyTouch - a novel system for performing prey capture experiments on a touch screen. PreyTouch incorporates flexible presentation of prey stimulus, accurate monitoring of predator strikes and automated rewarding. Its real time processing enables closing the loop between predator movement and prey dynamics for studying predator-prey interactions. Further, the system is optimized for automated long-term experiments and features a web-ui for remote control and monitoring. We successfully validate PreyTouch by conducting long-term prey capture experiments on the lizard, Pogona Vitticeps. These data revealed the existence of prey preferences, complex prey attack patterns, and fast learning of prey dynamics. The unique properties offered by PreyTouch combined with the ubiquity of prey capture behaviors across animals establish it as a valuable platform for comparatively studying animal cognition.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

With no current treatments or reliable diagnostic markers, there is an urgent need to define the molecular underpinnings of these conditions. By studying bioenergetic characteristics of peripheral blood lymphocytes in over 16 healthy controls, 15 ME/CFS, and 15 LC, we find both ME/CFS and LC donors exhibit signs of elevated oxidative stress, relative to healthy controls, especially in the memory subset. Using a combination of flow cytometry, bulk RNA-seq analysis, mass spectrometry, and systems chemistry analysis, we also observed aberrations in ROS clearance pathways including elevated glutathione levels, decreases in mitochondrial superoxide dismutase levels, and glutathione peroxidase 4 mediated lipid oxidative damage. Critically, these changes in redox pathways show striking sex-specific trends. While females diagnosed with ME/CFS exhibit higher total ROS and mitochondrial calcium levels, males with an ME/CFS diagnosis have normal ROS levels, but larger changes in lipid oxidative damage. Further analyses show that higher ROS levels correlates with hyperproliferation of T cells in females, consistent with the known role of elevated ROS levels in the initiation of proliferation. This hyperproliferation of T cells can be attenuated by metformin, suggesting this FDA-approved drug as a possible treatment, as also suggested by a recent clinical study of LC patients. Thus, we report that both ME/CFS and LC are mechanistically related and could be diagnosed with quantitative blood cell measurements. We also suggest that effective, patient tailored drugs might be discovered using standard lymphocyte stimulation assays.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

Muscle samples were analyzed for amino acid concentrations, muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and associated anabolic signaling. Following exercise, peak plasma levels of EAA and leucine were similar between groups, but the area under the curve was ~11% and ~28% lower in Young (p<0.01). Absolute levels of muscle EAA and leucine peaked 60 min after exercise, with ~15 and ~21 % higher concentrations in the exercising leg (p<0.01) but with no difference between groups.

Total levels of Rheb (~ 45%), LAT1 (~ 31%) and Rag B (~ 31%) were higher in Old (p<0.001). Lean and healthy old men do not manifest AR as evidenced by potent increases in MPS and mTORC1 signalling following EAA intake and exercise. Maintained anabolic sensitivity with age appears to be a function of a compensatory increase in basal levels of proteins involved in anabolic signalling. Therefore, our results suggest that age per se does not appear to cause AR in human skeletal muscle.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

The isothermal system studied here models an abundant geological environment of the prebiotic Earth, in which water is continuously evaporated at the point of contact with the gas flows, inducing up-concentration and circular flow patterns at the gas-water interface through momentum transfer. We show experimentally that this setting drives a 30-fold accumulation of nucleic acids and their periodic separation by a 3-fold reduction in salt and product concentration.

Different ligands/agonists upon binding to the same GPCR can invoke contrasting behavioral effects. Key examples are the divergent signaling signatures evoked by hallucinogenic versus non-hallucinogenic agonists at the serotonin2A (5-HT2A) receptor.7 We asked whether probing PI(4,5)P2 dynamics could uncover the earliest of differences in signaling that arise upon distinct ligands binding to the 5-HT2A receptor. The challenge was to track rapid < 1 min PI(4,5)P2 dynamics in living systems.8 Here we report a computationally-designed, rapid-response, reversible, photo-stable, fluorescent probe that permeates living cells, neurons, and a multicellular organism within few min of direct incubation and distinctly visualizes PI(4,5)P2 pools, in an optical imaging setup. This novel probe facilitates rapid tracking of seconds to sub-minute PI(4,5)P2 dynamics that arise from ligand-binding at the serotonergic receptor. Our results reveal that a hallucinogenic ligand at the 5-HT2A receptor leads to a slower rate of PI(4,5)P2 depletion when compared to a non-hallucinogenic ligand, but has a sustained longer effect. The ability of our designer chemical probe in timing early seconds-minute timescale lipid dynamics in living cells opens avenues for tracking early time-point molecular events in neuronal response to chemical and physical stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

In contrast to all previously cloned stripe rust genes, the incompletely dominant Yr84 phenotype is conferred through the coordinated function of paired nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeats (NLR) genes CNL and NL. We hypothesize that based on their genomic organization, annotation, expression profiles and predicted protein structure, CNL functions as a sensor NLR (sNLR) responsible for effector recognition, and NL acts as a helper NLR (hNLR) initiating downstream resistance cascades.

Bacteria which consistently colonise roots of specific plants across distinct environments, known as that plants core root microbiome, are particularly promising due to their colonisation competency. However, traditional, culture-based techniques can overlook promising PGPB which do not display commonly screened for plant growth promoting traits. Although numerous studies have isolated beneficial root bacteria, few have combined bacterial metabarcoding with culture-based techniques to identify novel biofertiliser candidates. In a two-pronged approach, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to define the core root microbiome of the model cereal plant, Brachypodium distachyon, grown in four distinct soils. From 7,042 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) detected in root fractions, only 40 ASVs were common at a prevalence of 80%. Core ASVs primarily belonged to the class Alphaproteobacteria, with the remainder comprising Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Chloroflexia, Gammaproteobacteria and Negativicutes. Secondly, B. distachyon root-associated bacterial strains were isolated from plants grown in the aforementioned soils. Of 207 root-associated isolates, 10 were identified as members of the core root microbiome, with the majority not displaying commonly screened for plant growth promoting traits. However, in a semi-hydroponic system, a core Bacillus and Rhodococcus strain significantly increased B. distachyon shoot dry weight by 32.8% and 40.0%, respectively. Additionally, two core Bacillus strains significantly increased root dry weight by 79.7 and 52.3%.

It is driven by membrane-bound autophagy receptors that display cytoplasmic intrinsically disordered modules (IDRs) engaging Atg8/LC3/GABARAP (LC3). Studies on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-phagy receptors of the FAM134 family revealed the importance of sequential FAM134 proteins phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and clustering for execution of the ER-phagy programs. In this model, ER fragmentation is promoted/facilitated by the membrane-remodeling function of FAM134 reticulon homology domains (RHDs). However, RHDs are not conserved in ER-phagy receptors. The question that we tackle in this work is if activation of ER-phagy receptors anchored at the ER membrane with conventional membrane spanning domains, i.e., most of the ER-phagy receptors known to date, eventually trigger ER remodeling and fragmentation, and how. Here, we show that the membrane-tethering modules of ER-phagy receptors (RHDs for FAM134B, single/multi spanning transmembrane domains for TEX264 and SEC62) determine the sub-compartmental distribution of the receptors but are dispensable for ER fragmentation, regardless of their propensity to remodel the ER membrane. Rather, ER fragmentation is promoted by the ER-phagy receptors intrinsically disordered region (IDR) modules that are a conserved feature of all ER-phagy receptors exposed at the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane. Since cytoplasmic IDRs with net negative charge are conserved in autophagy receptors at the limiting membrane of other organelles, we anticipate that conserved mechanisms of organelle fragmentation driven by cytoplasmic exposed IDRs could operate in eukaryotic cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

Using a technique known as kriging, developed in earth sciences, we examined whether the spatial organisation of brain regions showing positive activity could be predicted based on the spatial layout of regions showing activity decreases (and vice versa). Consistent with this hypothesis we established the spatial distribution of regions showing reductions in activity could predict (i) regions showing task-relevant increases in activity in both groups of humans and single individuals; (ii) patterns of neural activity captured by calcium imaging in mice; and, (iii) showed a high degree of generalisability across task contexts.

Here we examined the degree to which NRC proteins from multiple Solanaceae species are sensitive to suppression by SS15 and tested hypotheses about adaptive evolution of the binding interface between the SS15 inhibitor and NRC proteins. Whereas all tested orthologs of NRC2 were inhibited by SS15, some natural variants of NRC1 and NRC3 are insensitive to SS15 suppression. Ancestral sequence reconstruction combined with functional assays revealed that NRC3 transitioned from an ancestral suppressed form to an insensitive one over 19 million years ago. Our analyses revealed the evolutionary trajectory of coevolution between a parasite inhibitor and its NLR immune receptor target, identifying key evolutionary transitions in helper NLRs that counteract this inhibition.

However, the precise mechanisms underlying these benefits in the context of Alzheimer disease (AD) remain poorly understood. METHODS: To investigate muscle-to-brain axis signaling in response to amyloid {beta} (A{beta})-induced toxicity, we generated 5xFAD transgenic female mice with enhanced skeletal muscle function (5xFAD;cTFEB;HSACre) at prodromal (4-months old) and late (8-months old) symptomatic stages. RESULTS: Skeletal muscle TFEB overexpression reduced A{beta} plaque accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus at both ages and rescued behavioral neurocognitive deficits in 8-months-old 5xFAD mice. These changes were associated with transcriptional and protein remodeling of neurotrophic signaling and synaptic integrity, partially due to the CNS-targeting myokine prosaposin (PSAP). DISCUSSION: Our findings implicate the muscle-to-brain axis as a novel neuroprotective pathway against amyloid pathogenesis in AD.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920629

These chromosomes are delayed in congression to the metaphase plate and prone to segregation errors. Yet, their mechanism of congression remains elusive. By using stimulated emission depletion (STED) and lattice light-sheet (LLS) microscopy, here we show that polar chromosomes require a unique congression step to transit across the spindle pole. This step occurs independently of the known congression drivers, including CENP-E, kinetochore dynein, chromokinesins, and actomyosin. Instead, it relies on the pivoting of chromosome-carrying astral microtubules around the centrosome towards the spindle surface. During pivoting, polar chromosomes form complex attachments with astral microtubules that persist throughout the process. By altering the kinesin-5 Eg5/KIF11 activity to reverse, restore, or block spindle elongation, we show that spindle elongation drives the pivoting and dictates its direction and magnitude. We reveal impaired spindle elongation as a major cause of congression defects and segregation errors of polar chromosomes in RPE1 cells after Mps1 kinase inhibition, and in the high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma OVSAHO cells. Increasing spindle elongation efficiency by depleting the kinesin-4 KIF4A rescued polar chromosomes in OVSAHO cells, supporting the causal relationship between spindle elongation and resolution of polar chromosomes. We conclude that polar chromosomes depend on spindle elongation to propel the pivoting of their astral microtubules, enabling their contact with the spindle surface, congression, and proper segregation. In the context of disease, our findings suggest that altering spindle elongation has the potential to modify mitotic errors in certain cancer cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

However, such highly dynamic, viscoelastic, mesoscopic, intracellular membraneless bodies can undergo aberrant liquid-to-solid transitions into a range of amyloid-like species. The formation of such pathological assemblies necessitates their clearance by the cellular protein quality control machinery comprising molecular chaperones. Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying the chaperone-mediated regulation of protein homeostasis within biomolecular condensates remains elusive. Here, we present a unique case demonstrating that a heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40), Ydj1, promotes the heterotypic phase separation of intrinsically disordered tau via intermolecular electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Through a diverse array of tools involving high-resolution fluorescence imaging, single-droplet steady-state and picosecond time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, and single-molecule FRET (Forster resonance energy transfer), we elucidate the diverse structural conformations of tau present within phase-separated heterotypic condensates that are otherwise predisposed to aggregation. Our vibrational Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy data show that the presence of Ydj1 in tau-Ydj1 condensates abolishes the formation of amyloid fibrils, unlike tau-only droplets. By sequentially deleting segments, we identify amyloidogenic hexapeptide motifs located in the hydrophobic microtubule-binding region of tau that foster contacts with the peptide-binding regions of Ydj1, promoting the formation of tau-Ydj1 binary condensates. Additionally, we show that the underlying network of interactions governing these condensates can be further tuned by RNA. Our results underscore an intriguing interplay of molecular drivers that govern chaperone-associated phase separation, with broader implications for the chaperoning of a wide range of intrinsically disordered proteins involved in physiology and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

However, it is still not well-known what role spatial and temporal variation in natural selection play in the maintenance of naturally occurring hybrid zones. To identify whether hybridization is adaptive between two closely related monkeyflower species, Mimulus guttatus and Mimulus laciniatus, we performed repeated reciprocal transplants between natural hybrid and pure species populations. We planted parental genotypes along with multiple experimental hybrid generations in a dry (2021) and extremely wet (2023) year in the Sierra Nevada, CA. By taking fine scale environmental measurements, we found that the environment of the hybrid zone is more similar to M. laciniatuss seasonally dry rocky outcrop habitat than M. guttatuss moist meadows. In our transplants hybridization does not appear to be maintained by a consistent fitness advantage of hybrids over parental species in hybrid zones, but rather a lack of strong selection against hybrids. We also found higher fitness of the drought adapted species, M. laciniatus, than M. guttatus in both species habitats, as well as phenotypic selection for M. laciniatus-like traits in the hybrid habitat in the dry year of our experiment. These findings suggest that in this system hybridization might function to introduce drought-adapted traits and genes from M. laciniatus into M. guttatus, specifically in years with limited soil moisture. However, we also find evidence of genetic incompatibilities in second generation hybrids in the wetter year, which may balance a selective advantage of M. laciniatus introgression. Therefore, we find that hybridization in this system is both potentially adaptive and costly, and that the interaction of positive and negative selection likely determines patterns of gene flow between these Mimulus species.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

Nonetheless, most methods for spliced/unspliced inference (such as RNA velocity tools) focus on individual samples, and rarely allow comparisons between groups of samples (e.g., healthy vs. diseased). Furthermore, this kind of inference is challenging, because spliced and unspliced mRNA abundance is characterized by a high degree of quantification uncertainty, due to the prevalence of multi-mapping reads, i.e., reads compatible with multiple transcripts (or genes), and/or with both their spliced and unspliced versions.

ResultsHere, we present DifferentialRegulation, a Bayesian hierarchical method to discover changes between experimental conditions with respect to the relative abundance of unspliced mRNA (over the total mRNA). We model the quantification uncertainty via a latent variable approach, where reads are allocated to their gene/transcript of origin, and to the respective splice version. We designed several benchmarks where our approach shows good performance, in terms of sensitivity and error control, versus state-of-the-art competitors. Importantly, our tool is flexible, and works with both bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data.

Deciphering the evolutionary dynamics of mosquito populations country-wide is essential for designing effective and sustainable national and subnational tailored strategies to accelerate malaria elimination efforts. Here, we employed genome-wide association studies through pooled template sequencing to compare four eco-geographically different populations of the major vector, Anopheles funestus, across a South North transect in Cameroon, aiming to identify genomic signatures of adaptive responses to insecticides. Our analysis revealed limited population structure within Northern and Central regions (FST<0.02), suggesting extensive gene flow, while populations from the Littoral/Coastal region exhibited more distinct genetic patterns (FST>0.049). Greater genetic differentiation was observed at known resistance-associated loci, resistance-to-pyrethroids 1 (rp1) (2R chromosome) and CYP9 (X chromosome), with varying signatures of positive selection across populations. Allelic variation between variants underscores the pervasive impact of selection pressures, with rp1 variants more prevalent in Central and Northern populations (FST>0.3), and the CYP9 associated variants more pronounced in the Littoral/Coastal region (FST =0.29). Evidence of selective sweeps was supported by negative Tajimas D and reduced genetic diversity in all populations, particularly in Central (Elende) and Northern (Tibati) regions. Genomic variant analysis identified novel missense mutations and signatures of complex genomic alterations such as duplications, deletions, transposable element (TE) insertions, and chromosomal inversions, all associated with selective sweeps. A 4.3 kb TE insertion was fixed in all populations with Njombe Littoral/Coastal population, showing higher frequency of CYP9K1 (G454A), a known resistance allele and TE upstream compared to elsewhere. Our study uncovered regional variations in insecticide resistance candidate variants, emphasizing the need for a streamlined DNA-based diagnostic assay for genomic surveillance across Africa. These findings will contribute to the development of tailored resistance management strategies crucial for addressing the dynamic challenges of malaria control in Cameroon.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

These recurring localized tissue deformations arise due to transient contractions of the supracellular ectodermal actomyosin fibers that focus mechanical strain at defect sites. We further show that stabilization of aster-shaped defects is disrupted by perturbations of the Wnt signaling pathway. We propose a closed-loop feedback mechanism promoting head organizer formation, and develop a biophysical model of regenerating Hydra tissues that incorporates a morphogen source activated by mechanical strain and an alignment interaction directing fibers along morphogen gradients. We suggest that this positive feedback loop leads to mechanical strain focusing at defect sites, enhancing local morphogen production and promoting robust organizer formation.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

The power to detect a trait-associated variant in GWAS is a function of frequency and effect size --- but for traits under selection, the effect size of a variant determines the strength of selection against it, constraining its frequency. To account for GWAS ascertainment, we propose studying the joint distribution of allele frequencies across populations, conditional on the frequencies in the GWAS cohort. Before considering these conditional frequency spectra, we first characterized the impact of selection and non-equilibrium demography on allele frequency dynamics forwards and backwards in time. We then used these results to understand conditional frequency spectra under realistic human demography. Finally, we investigated empirical conditional frequency spectra for GWAS variants associated with 106 complex traits, finding compelling evidence for either stabilizing or purifying selection. Our results provide insight into polygenic score portability and other properties of variants ascertained with GWAS, highlighting the utility of conditional frequency spectra.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

Although the exact mechanisms underlying its maturation remain elusive, spontaneous activity patterns in the retina, known as retinal waves, have been shown to contribute to this developmental process. Retinal waves exhibit complex spatio-temporal statistics and contribute to the establishment of circuit connectivity and function in the visual system, including the formation of retinotopic maps and the refinement of receptive fields in downstream areas such as the thalamus and visual cortex. Recent work in mice has shown that retinal waves have statistical features matching those of natural visual stimuli, such as optic flow, suggesting that they could prime the visual system for motion processing upon vision onset. Motivated by these findings, we examined whether artificial neural network (ANN) models trained on natural movies show improved performance if pre-trained with retinal waves. We employed the spatio-temporally complex task of next-frame prediction, in which the ANN was trained to predict the next frame based on preceding input frames of a movie. We found that pre-training ANNs with retinal waves enhances the processing of real-world visual stimuli and accelerates learning. Strikingly, even when matching the total training time by merely replacing initial training epochs on naturalistic stimuli with exposure to retinal waves, an ANN trained on retinal waves temporarily outperforms one trained solely on natural movies. Similar to observations made in biological systems, we also found that pre-training with spontaneous activity refines the receptive field of ANN neurons. Overall, our work sheds light on the functional role of spatio-temporally patterned spontaneous activity in the processing of motion in natural scenes, suggesting it acts as a training signal to prepare the developing visual system for adult visual processing.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

Investigating traits and molecular factors mediating acclimation to stress combinations is essential for the development of climate change-resilient field crops. Here, we studied the morphological, physiological, and molecular responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to i) co-occurring high temperature and drought and ii) flooding sequentially followed by drought, both of which have increased in frequency due to climate change. A set of 15 physiological and morphological traits were assessed during single and combined stresses. By combining these comprehensive trait analyses with transcriptome characterization, we established the generally additive effects of simultaneous or sequential stresses on plant morphology and physiology compared to the corresponding individual stresses. Although drought had a mild effect in both stress combinations, a unique transcriptome signature emerged upon combination with high temperature simultaneously or flooding sequentially. Molecular processes identified as important for multi-stress resilience included plastid-nucleus communication, ABA signaling and photo-acclimation. Based on the RNA-seq data, a set of 39 genes was identified as potential multi-stress response regulators. Mutants were tested to validate their contribution to plant survival and phenotypic acclimation under combined stress. We confirmed the involvement of several genes in regulating phenotypic acclimation traits.

Polyamines are an abundant class of aliphatic molecules that play essential roles in fundamental cellular processes across the tree of life. Surprisingly, the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to polyamines encountered during infection, and acquisition of a polyamine resistance locus has been implicated in spread of the prominent USA300 methicillin-resistant S. aureus lineage. At present, alternative pathways of polyamine resistance in staphylococci are largely unknown. Here we applied experimental evolution to identify novel mechanisms and consequences of S. aureus adaption when exposed to increasing concentrations of the polyamine spermine. Evolved populations of S. aureus exhibited striking evidence of parallel adaptation, accumulating independent mutations in the potassium transporter genes ktrA and ktrD. Mutations in either ktrA or ktrD are sufficient to confer polyamine resistance and function in an additive manner. Moreover, we find that ktr mutations provide increased resistance to multiple classes of unrelated cationic antibiotics, suggesting a common mechanism of resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, ktr mutants exhibit alterations in cell surface charge indicative of reduced affinity and uptake of cationic molecules. Finally, we observe that laboratory-evolved ktr mutations are also present in diverse natural S. aureus isolates, suggesting these mutations may contribute to antimicrobial resistance during human infections. Collectively this study identifies a new role for potassium transport in S. aureus polyamine resistance with consequences for susceptibility to both host-derived and clinically-used antimicrobials.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) is an analysis paradigm that aims to address this challenge. dFC consists of a time-varying matrix (dFC matrix) expressing how pairwise interactions across brain areas change with time. However, the main dFC approaches have been developed and applied mostly empirically, lacking a unifying theoretical frame-work, a general interpretation, and a common set of measures to quantify the dFC matrices properties. Moreover, the dFC field has been lacking ad-hoc algorithms to compute and process the matrices efficiently. This has prevented the field to show its full potential with high-dimensional datasets and/or real time applications.

With this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Symmetric Connectivity Matrix analysis framework (DySCo), with its associated repository. DySCo is a unifying approach that allows the study brain signals at different spatio-temporal scales, down to voxel level, that is computationally ultrafast. DySCo unifies in a single theoretical framework the most employed dFC matrices, which share a common mathematical structure. Doing so it allows:

O_LIA new interpretation of dFC that further justifies its use to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of data interactions in a form that is easily translatable across different imaging modalities.
C_LIO_LIThe introduction of the the Recurrence Matrix EVD to compute and store the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of all types of dFC matrices in an efficent manner that is orders of magnitude faster than naive algorithms, and without loss of information.
C_LIO_LITo simply define quantities of interest for the dynamic analyses such as: the amount of connectivity (norm of a matrix) the similarity between matrices, their informational complexity.
C_LI

The methodology developed here is validated on both a synthetic dataset and a rest/N-back task experimental paradigm - the fMRI Human Connectome Project dataset. We demonstrate that all the measures proposed are highly sensitive to changes in brain configurations. To illustrate the computational efficiency of the DySCo toolbox, we perform the analysis at the voxel-level, a computationally very demanding task which is easily afforded by the RMEVD algorithm.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

It has recently been found that odour representations in the piriform cortex (PCx) can also contain information about their spatial context. However, the precise origins of this information within the brain and its subsequent integration into the microcircuitry of the PCx remains unknown. In this study, we focus on the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) as a candidate for carrying spatial contextual information to the PCx, to investigate how it affects the PCx microcircuit and its response to olfactory inputs. Utilising mice brain slices, we performed patch clamp recordings targeting both superficial (SP) and deep (DP) pyramidal neurons, as well as parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) inhibitory interneurons. Concurrently, we optogenetically stimulated excitatory LEC projections to study their impact on PCx activity. We found that LEC inputs are heterogeneously distributed in the PCx microcircuit, evoking larger excitatory currents in SP and PV neurons compared to DP and SOM neurons, respectively, due to their higher monosynaptic connectivity. Moreover, LEC inputs exert a differential effect on the inhibitory circuits, activating PV while suppressing SOM interneurons. We further studied the interaction among LEC inputs and the sensory afferent signals originating from the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) onto the PCx. Our findings demonstrated that both SP and DP neurons show a general increase in their spiking response when LEC and LOT are simultaneously activated. Notably, DP neurons exhibit a sharpening of their response attributable to LEC-induced inhibition that effectively suppresses the delayed spikes evoked by LOT stimulation. These observations suggest a regulatory mechanism whereby LEC inputs inhibit recurrent activity by activating PV interneurons. Our results show that LEC afferents reconfigure PCx activity and contribute to the understanding of how odour objects are formed within the PCx integrating both olfactory and contextual information.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

Many of the specimens studied have been excavated and stored for a significant duration prior to their proteomic analysis. Human handling and storage environments therefore provide ample opportunities for protein contamination onto and into specimens of interest to palaeoproteomic studies. As such, modern protein contamination limits access to endogenous proteomes. Here, we compare five approaches of bone protein decontamination applied to a Pleistocene Equus sp. bone fragment contaminated with a modern dog salivary proteome. We find that all tested methods reduce the protein contamination, but with different efficiencies. We find that a brief bleach wash is the most effective approach in removing modern protein contamination, and that no additional damage is caused to the endogenous proteome by this treatment. Next, we apply this approach to a hominin tooth found at Khudji, a Late Pleistocene archaeological site in Tajikistan. We demonstrate that a brief bleach wash removes almost all human skin protein contamination while retaining the endogenous hominin dentine proteome. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of the Khudji dentine proteome allowed determination that the specimen likely represents a Neanderthal, extending the fossil evidence for Neanderthals in Central Asia.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

It is a dynamic structure that assembles and disassembles in response to intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli while maintaining remarkable stability and tightly controlled length. Although cilium assembly is well-understood, less is known about the molecular players and pathways governing their stability, length and disassembly. Here, we elucidated the function of Ccdc66, a microtubule-associated protein linked to ciliopathies, in cilium maintenance and disassembly in mouse epithelial cells. We found that Ccdc66 depletion disrupts cilium disassembly, length and stability, but does not affect assembly in these cells. Live imaging of these processes revealed that cilia in Ccdc66-depleted cells frequently fluctuate in length and exhibit increased ectocytosis from the cilium tip. Phenotypic rescue experiments and in vitro microtubule stabilization assays showed that Ccdc66 mediates these functions via regulating the stability of microtubules. Temporal proximity mapping of CCDC66 identified potential new regulators and molecular pathways involved in cilium disassembly. Additionally, depletion of CCDC66 compromised Hedgehog and Wnt pathway activation and disrupted epithelial cell organization and polarity in two-dimensional and three-dimensional cultures. Collectively, our results define Ccdc66 as a new microtubule-stabilizing factor that regulates cilium stability and disassembly, providing insights into the mechanisms of cilium homeostasis and the pathologies associated with Ccdc66.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

High quality genomic data for the deeply divergent, morphologically constrained chitons, would be expected to offer an opportunity to explore ancient genetic traits and evolutionary mechanisms preserved across the long span of animal evolution. We present a comparative analysis of five reference quality genomes, including four de novo assemblies, covering all major chiton clades: Lepidopleurida (Deshayesiella sirenkoi), Callochitonida (Callochiton septemvalvis) and Chitonida (Acanthochitona discrepans and A. rubrolineata), and an updated phylogeny for the phylum. Comparison with conchiferan genomes recovers 20 ancient molluscan linkage groups (MLGs) that are relatively conserved in bivalve karyotypes, but subject to re-ordering, rearrangement, fusion, and early occurring duplication (or fission) in chitons and conchiferan genomes. Two congeners each have 8 haploid chromosomes, results of two independent fusion events from the karyotype of their most recent common ancestor. The largest number of novel fusions is in the supposedly most plesiomorphic clade Lepidopleurida, and the chitonid Liolophura japonica has a partial genome duplication, extending the known occurrence of large-scale gene duplication within Mollusca. The extreme and dynamic genome rearrangements in this class stands in contrast to most other animals and is not explained by accumulated change since the deep divergence time of this clade.

Given the paucity of approved therapeutic strategies for this lifestyle disorder, dietary interventions may prove effective. We evaluated how green jackfruit flour (JF) prevents MASH and progression to HCC and its underlying mechanisms. The study utilized two murine models that mimicked human MASLD disease: (i) a diet-induced MASH model; (ii) a MASH-HCC model induced by diet and a very low dose of CCl4. C57Bl/6 mice were fed with chow (CD) or western diet (WD) with normal (NW) or sugar water (SW) for 12 weeks, then randomized to receive either 5 kcal% green jackfruit flour (JF) or an equal volume of placebo flour (PB). The biochemical, histological, and molecular analyses were assessed. JF significantly reduced body weight, liver injury, insulin resistance, and alleviated obesity, steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor development in WDSW or WDSW/CCl4 mice compared to placebo groups. Furthermore, JF activated AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and inhibited MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways in MASH and MASH-HCC experimental models, respectively. This was supported by sodium propionate treatment, the primary short-chain fatty acid entering the liver from JFs soluble fiber microbial fermentation, which also regulated AMPK and MAPK signaling in cellular models of MASH and HCC, respectively. Hence, our findings present strong evidence of JFs therapeutic potential in the prevention of MASH and MASH-HCC, warranting further investigation of JFs efficacy as a dietary intervention in clinical trials.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1718834920630

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms.

Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state. These results demonstrate the transmission of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus at a non-traditional interface and to a new and highly relevant livestock species, underscoring the ability of the virus to cross species barriers.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3, which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 and KP.2.3, which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded. We report the value of wastewater sequencing to track avian influenza.","NA","medrxiv",1718834920630

The central biological question about HD pathogenesis has been how the disease-causing DNA repeat expansion (CAGn) in the huntingtin (HTT) gene leads to neurodegeneration after decades of apparent latency. Inherited HTT alleles with a longer CAG repeat hasten disease onset; the length of this repeat also changes over time, generating somatic mosaicism, and genes that regulate DNA-repeat stability can influence HD age-at-onset. To understand the relationship between a cells CAG-repeat length and its biological state, we developed a single-cell method for measuring CAG-repeat length together with genome-wide RNA expression. We found that the HTT CAG repeat expands from 40-45 CAGs to 100-500+ CAGs in HD-vulnerable SPNs but not in other striatal cell types, with these long DNA-repeat expansions acquired at different times by individual SPNs. Surprisingly, somatic expansion from 40 to 150 CAGs had no apparent effect upon gene expression - but neurons with 150-500+ CAGs shared profound gene-expression changes. These expression changes involved hundreds of genes, escalated alongside further CAG-repeat expansion, eroded positive and then negative features of neuronal identity, and culminated in expression of senescence/apoptosis genes. Rates of striatal neuron loss across HD stages reflected the rates at which neurons entered this biologically distorted state. Our results suggest that HTT CAG repeats in striatal neurons undergo decades of biologically quiet expansion, then, as they asynchronously cross a high threshold, cause SPNs to degenerate quickly and asynchronously. We conclude that, at any moment in the course of HD, most neurons have an innocuous (but unstable) huntingtin gene, and that HD pathogenesis is a DNA process for almost all of a neurons life.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920630

Here we propose adding two sub-genotypic levels of virus classification, named major and minor lineages. These lineages have high thresholds for phylogenetic distance and clade size, rendering them stable between phylogenetic studies. We present an assignment tool to show that the proposed lineages are useful for regional, national and sub-national discussions of relevant DENV diversity. Moreover, the proposed lineages are robust to classification using partial genome sequences. We provide a standardized neutral descriptor of DENV diversity with which we can identify and track lineages of potential epidemiological and/or clinical importance.

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1718834920631

These ruminants were presumed not to be hosts for IAVs. Previously, IAV-positive mammalian species were hunters and scavengers, possibly getting infected while feeding on infected birds. It is now presumed that H5N1 viruses that circulate in US dairy cattle transmit through a mammary gland route, in contrast to transmission by aerosols via the respiratory tract, although the latter cannot be excluded. The receptor display in the mammary and respiratory tract in cows for IAVs is unknown. Here, we used recombinant HA proteins representing current circulating and classical H5 viruses to determine the distribution of IAV receptors in the respiratory and mammary tract tissues of cows and goats. Most of the sialome of the cow and goat respiratory tract is lined with sialic acid modifications such as N-glycolyl and O-acetyl, which are not bound by IAV. Interestingly, the H5 protein representing the cow isolates bound significantly in the mammary gland, whereas classical H5 proteins failed to do so. Furthermore, whereas the 9-O-acetyl modification is prominent in all tissues tested, the 5-N-glycolyl modification is not, resulting in the display of receptors for avian IAV hemagglutinins. This could explain the high levels of virus found in these tissues and milk, adding supporting data to this possible virus transmission route.","NA","biorxiv",1718834920631

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.
