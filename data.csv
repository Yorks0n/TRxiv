MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 33 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time- dependent covariate) was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, including adjusting for influenza activity as an effect modifier.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43920 (82.2%) were vaccinated by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1130 (2.12%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over time the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the risk of influenza was not significantly different during periods when influenza activity was low (HR, .70; 95% C.I., .42 - 1.15; P = .15) or medium (HR, 1.20; 95% C.I., .86 - 1.67; P = .28), but was significantly higher for the vaccinated state than the unvaccinated state when influenza activity was high (HR, 1.33; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.64; P = .009).

ConclusionsThis study was unable to find a protective influence of influenza vaccination among working-aged adults during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season and found that influenza vaccination was associated with a higher risk of influenza when influenza activity was high.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find a protective influence of influenza vaccination during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season and found a significantly higher risk of influenza with vaccination when influenza activity was high.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1761689378852

To correctly determine the contributions of each fluorophore's signal to the high parameter data an accurate unmixing matrix needs to be generated. Even with single-stained controls, however, these matrixes include errors such as spillover spread, which compounds with each additional parameter, functionally limiting panel design. An additional source of errors is heterogeneity of cellular autofluorescence, which can affect both the unmixing matrix and misalign signals when the matrix is applied to individual cells in complex cell mixtures. Here we developed AutoSpectral, a statistical approach to automate the production of minimal-residual error unmixing matrixes and pair multiple distinct multifluorescent spectra to individual cells within a mixed sample, via an R-based software tool. AutoSpectral improves unmixing accuracy, improving incorrectly assigned cell positions by up to 9000-fold, reduces spread, particularly in samples with variable autofluorescence, and allows multi-lineage analysis of mixed populations, providing superior data for spectral flow cytometry experiments.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/Y004450/1;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""222442/A/21/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

Since 2019, chicks on the New Zealand mainland have been affected by a deadly neonatal disease called respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), contributing to a decline to fewer than 143 breeding pairs. To investigate the putative genetic basis of this disease, we generated high-quality whole-genome data from 249 individuals spanning the species range, including from the New Zealand mainland (Northern range) and subantarctic Enderby and Campbell Islands (Southern). Population genomic analyses unexpectedly revealed three deeply divergent lineages with negligible gene flow, consistent with recognition of three distinct subspecies.

Phylogenetic divergence dating suggests that these splits predate human arrival by several millennia, with the Northern lineage diverging from the Southern populations 5-16 ka. Genome scans for local adaptation revealed regions of strong differentiation, and genome-wide association analyses identified candidate immune and respiratory genes linked to RDS. In partnership with Ng[a]i Tahu, who hold indigenous guardianship over yellow-eyed penguins, we recommend recognition of three subspecies, urgent conservation action for the critically small and rapidly declining Northern subspecies, and the need for immediate population size and trend assessments for Auckland and Campbell Island populations.","[{""name"":""Genomics Aotearoa"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

A typical cell contains ~1000s of copies of mtDNA, but how this copy number is stably maintained is unclear. Here, we track mtDNA copy number (mtCN) recovery in K562 cells following transient, chemically induced depletion to uncover principles of mtCN stability. Below a critical mtCN, ETC activity fails to sustain the proton motive force (PMF) and de novo pyrimidine synthesis - both required for mtDNA replication. PMF-dependent processes like Fe-S cluster biogenesis are also disrupted and stress responses are activated that impair cell proliferation and limit further mtCN dilution by cell division. Nonetheless, mtDNA replication and recovery remain possible via mtDNA-independent PMF, generated by complex V reversal, and uridine salvage. Once mtCN is restored, the ETC and forward complex V activity re-engage, stress responses subside, and proliferation recommences. Each cell division then dilutes mtDNA, serving as a built-in brake on mtCN. Our findings suggest that mtCN homeostasis emerges from the balance of two opposing PMF-driven processes - mtDNA replication and cell proliferation - revealing a bioenergetic logic that preserves mtDNA euploidy through repeated cell divisions.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K00CA212468;K99GM145848;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

Here, we investigate the evolutionary origins and virological properties of a recently reported mink-derived HKU5-related coronavirus (nvHKU5r-CoV). Phylogenetic and recombination analyses reveal that nvHKU5r-CoV originated from bat HKU5-like viruses circulating in southeastern China. We characterize the spike loop2 region as a critical determinant of ACE2 receptor specificity, directly interacting with the receptor, and show that the bat HKU5r-CoV with the closest loop2 sequence to nvHKU5r-CoV could already utilize mink ACE2. Using AlphaFold3, we predicted spike-ACE2 binding interfaces consistent with our experimental infectivity results. Targeted mutagenesis demonstrates that a single amino acid substitution (R548S) enables robust entry of nvHKU5r-CoV via human ACE2. We further show that this substitution can arise in vitro during hACE2-expressing cell infection with a replication-competent VSV system. Molecular dating suggests that nvHKU5r-CoV transmitted from bats to mink within the last decade, consistent with an expansion of mink fur farming in China. Overall, our findings highlight the zoonotic potential of these viruses and the molecular and structural determinants underlying it, while emphasizing fur farming as a major risk factor for how bat HKU5r-CoVs can transmit to farmed animals and ultimately humans.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

In mammals, three main neuronal pathways through the BG have been described - the direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways - which together orchestrate many aspects of learning and behavior. In songbirds, cell types associated with striatal and pallidal components appear intermingled in a single basal ganglia nucleus, Area X, essential for song learning. This allows for the dense reconstruction of the entire circuit within a compact volume. Here, we introduce the first vertebrate basal ganglia connectome, comprising over 8,500 automated neuron reconstructions connected by about 20 million synapses. High image quality and automated reconstruction allowed analysis with minimal manual proofreading. Based on direct anatomical measurement of synaptic connectivity, we confirm that a direct, indirect and hyperdirect pathway can be traced through Area X. However, detailed morphological and connectomic analysis revealed no clearly distinct direct and indirect medium spiny neuron subpopulations, and a dominance of the direct and hyperdirect pathway. In addition to previously identified neuron types in Area X, we could distinguish three novel GABAergic neuron types, two of which are major output targets of GPe neurons, leading to novel feedback circuitry within Area X. We further found unexpectedly strong neuronal interconnectivity and recurrency between neurons associated with all pathways. Our data thus challenge the universality of the view of the basal ganglia as an information processor organized into discrete feedforward pathways.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

The structures reveal a conserved overall architecture and rRNA modification landscape compared to other mammals, and provide an atomic-level view of the unique break in the 28S rRNA. This cleavage event, located in the D6 expansion segment, is structurally stabilized by a network of interactions with surrounding ribosomal proteins, maintaining the integrity of the large subunit. Our comparative analysis revealed that this compensatory network preserves a canonical architecture nearly indistinguishable from intact mouse and human ribosomes. These findings resolve the structural basis of this unique cleavage, showing that it is a stable, integrated feature whose function is likely linked to more subtle regulatory mechanisms, rather than inducing major structural rearrangements.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""KU3222/3-1 to M.K.;""},{""name"":""Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012kf4317"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""to A.R.;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""789128  to G.R.L.;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

Current methods, often linear and reliant on summary statistics, fail to capture complex genetic interactions and discard valuable individual-level information. We introduce PRSformer, a scalable deep learning architecture designed for end-to-end, multitask disease prediction directly from million-scale individual genotypes. PRSformer employs neighborhood attention, achieving linear O(L) complexity per layer, making Transformers tractable for genome-scale inputs. Crucially, PRSformer utilizes a stacking of these efficient attention layers, progressively increasing the effective receptive field to model local dependencies (e.g., within linkage disequilibrium blocks) before integrating information across wider genomic regions. This design, tailored for genomics, allows PRSformer to learn complex, potentially non-linear and long-range interactions directly from raw genotypes. We demonstrate PRSformer's effectiveness using a unique large private cohort (N{approx}5M) for predicting 18 autoimmune and inflammatory conditions using L{approx}140k variants. PRSformer significantly outperforms highly optimized linear models trained on the same individual-level data and state-of-the-art summary-statistic-based methods (LDPred2) derived from the same cohort, quantifying the benefits of non-linear modeling and multitask learning at scale. Furthermore, experiments reveal that the advantage of non-linearity emerges primarily at large sample sizes (N>1M), and that a multi-ancestry trained model improves generalization, establishing PRSformer as a new framework for deep learning in population-scale genomics.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

Here, we show how HAESA-LIKE 3 (HSL3) specifically recognizes the folded, disulfide-stabilized CTNIP/SCREW phytocytokines in Arabidopsis. Quantitative binding assays define a minimal CTNIP4 region required for high-affinity HSL3 interaction and signaling activation. A 2.12 [A] crystal structure of the HSL3-CTNIP4 complex reveals a unique C-terminal receptor pocket that accommodates the peptides cyclic architecture through a combination of hydrophobic and polar contacts, a feature absent in the closely related HAE/HSL LRR-RKs. The cyclic CTNIP4 fold further establishes a largely hydrophobic interface that bridges HSL3 to the SERK co-receptor, forming a distinct activation surface. Together, these structural, biochemical and physiological insights uncover a previously unrecognised mechanism of peptide perception and receptor activation, highlighting how subtle architectural variations enable precise ligand selectivity among highly conserved plant receptor kinases.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_204526;10001549;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 1061-2023;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""773153;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

To stabilize proteins during simulation, Martini is typically combined with structure-based force fields such as elastic network models (ENMs) or G[o] models. While these approaches preserve global folds and capture protein flexibility, their ability to reproduce conformational dynamics remains unclear. Here, we benchmark Martini combined with ENMs or G[o] models on three folded proteins and show that both approaches struggle to sample the conformational space observed in atomistic simulations, even when uniform interaction strengths or equilibrium bond distances are adjusted. This limitation arises from the assumption of a uniform interaction network, in which all bond energies are equal. To overcome this, we present a fully automated, perturbation-based optimization approach for G[o] networks, PoG[o], that iteratively refines a non-uniform G[o] network against a pre-computed atomistic free energy landscape in essential conformational space. Our approach converges rapidly, yielding CG ensembles in close agreement with reference atomistic simulations. As a cross-validation, the optimization also improves the root-mean-square fluctuation profile.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""449750155 – RTG 2756, Project A1;""},{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PGSD-599306-205;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

There is robust evidence on the role of right-hemisphere frontoparietal dysfunction, interhemispheric structural disconnection and maladaptive activity in the left hemisphere in the persistence of neglect. However, the specific impact of right frontoparietal dysfunction on the functional (re)organization of the left hemisphere remains poorly understood. In this study, we introduce a novel application of functional connectivity gradient analysis to investigate macroscale functional reorganization in the non-lesioned left hemisphere of patients with chronic left spatial neglect. Focusing on resting-state fMRI data, we demonstrate that abnormal segregation patterns in the left frontoparietal and default mode networks are robustly associated with neglect severity and spatial attentional bias. Notably, the principal gradient--typically capturing a global unimodal-to-transmodal hierarchy--was altered in these patients, suggesting a reorganization favoring lateralized unimodal networks. We also show that the structural integrity of the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) plays a key role in shaping these functional dynamics. These findings reveal a previously overlooked aspect of neglect pathophysiology: the maladaptive dominance of the non-lesioned hemispheres intrinsic architecture. By combining innovative gradient-based metrics with classical lesion approaches, our study offers a new framework for understanding neglect as an emergent property of large-scale network imbalance, with clinical implications for diagnosis and intervention, and theoretical consequences for models of hemispheric asymmetries and conscious access.

Understanding and optimising transgene expression is crucial for a wide variety of applications which range from investigating basic biology, synthetic biology, recombinant protein production to gene therapy. However, precise control over the timing and location of transgene expression remains a key limitation, particularly in therapeutic contexts where specificity and compactness are critical. To address limitations of traditional promoter-based transgene construct approaches, we developed TRANCERs (TRanscriptionally Autonomous enhaNCERs), a modular and compact system that transforms cell type-specific enhancers into standalone sources of productive transcription. To accomplish this, we leveraged basic facets of enhancer function as well as known and novel principles of transcript stability and nuclear export. We demonstrate that TRANCERs can drive lineage-restricted expression of both reporter and therapeutic genes across multiple mammalian cell types both in vitro and in vivo, and that this expression pattern faithfully mirrors the activity of the enhancer element used. Enhancer elements are the most cell type specific element in the mammalian genome and are used to drive development, differentiation and cellular responses to extrinsic signals. Therefore, the TRANCER system allows for the generation of specific stable expression constructs for all conceivable situations for which a native enhancer exists with the required activity pattern. Furthermore, we show that the TRANCER system is compatible with previously published machine learning derived artificial enhancer sequences suggesting the possibility even for specific bespoke expression patterns that do not exist in nature. This, combined with a significantly reduced vector footprint ideal for size-constrained delivery systems such as lentiviral vectors, means that the TRANCER system represent a significant step forward in our ability to control gene expression for both basic biology and therapeutic applications.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MC_UU_00016/14;MC_UU_00029/3;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""225220/Z/22/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

However, some species undergo programmed DNA elimination (PDE), whereby specific genome regions are removed from somatic cell lineages early during development, leading to distinct germline and somatic genomes. Since its discovery in parasitic nematodes over a century ago, PDE has been observed in diverse eukaryotes, including ciliates, arthropods, and vertebrates. However, the function, mechanisms, and evolutionary origins of PDE remain poorly understood. Here, we report the unexpected discovery of PDE in three early-diverging Caenorhabditis species. Using long-read and chromatin conformation capture sequencing, we reconstructed germline and somatic genomes for all three species, and found that between 0.7 and 2.3% of the genome is eliminated during the 8- to 16-cell stage of embryogenesis, including the telomeres and regions within chromosomes. Elimination of regions within chromosomes results in fragmentation of the six germline chromosomes into 8-15 somatic chromosomes. The sites of elimination are precise, and we identified conserved motifs that likely recruit a nuclease to induce double-strand breaks. The newly formed somatic chromosome ends are healed by de novo telomere addition. A small number of genes are eliminated in each species, some of which have C. elegans orthologues with essential germline functions. A subset of elimination sites are orthologous across species, and some coincide with genome rearrangement sites. The phylogenetic distribution of PDE suggests that it was present in the last common Caenorhabditis ancestor and subsequently lost early during the evolution of many species, including C. elegans.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""220540/Z/20/A;""},{""name"":""Japan Science and Technology Agency"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00097mb19"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JPMJCR18S7;JPMJCR24B4;""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JP23K17400;JP24H00549;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which SHIP1 mediates its role in suppressing inflammatory pathways, with a focus on human microglia. Our findings illuminate an essential role for SHIP1 in endosome maturation and lysosomal function. We show that SHIP1 localizes to both the plasma membrane and to endo-lysosomal compartments and binds to the CapZ family of proteins, which are important for endosome maturation. Reduction of SHIP1 levels via genome editing impairs endosome maturation and lysosomal function, leading to lipid droplet accumulation and leakage of lysosomal cathepsin B into the cytosol, which in turn activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. CITE-seq profiling of SHIP1-deficient microglia revealed a shift from an immune-responsive state toward a DAM-like, phagocytic state, accompanied by impaired response to LPS and enhanced phagocytosis of synaptic material and apoptotic neurons via TREM2. While amyloid {beta} uptake was not affected, amyloid {beta} accumulated intracellularly due to defective lysosomal degradation, further driving lipid droplet formation. Together, these results identify SHIP1 as a regulator of endo-lysosomal function and selective phagocytosis of lipid-rich substrates in microglia. These findings have important implications for therapeutic hypotheses that target SHIP1 for treatment of AD, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U01AG072572;R01AG055909;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CS-02018-191971;""},{""name"":""Alzheimer's Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0375f4d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Zenith Award;""},{""name"":""Harvard Medical School"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wevmz92"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Edward R. and Anne G.

Such a decrease is often linked to the impact of visual memory decay and the sensory transformation of visual target positional information into haptic-specific coordinates. It is, however, unclear whether this holds for haptically encoded spatial locations, where the target and reaching arm positions are both defined through haptics. Here, we asked participants to perform memory-guided right-handed reaching movements toward targets held with the left hand. In the Delay block, the left hand was removed after 2 seconds, and a right-handed reach was performed after a variable delay of 2, 4, or 6 seconds. In the No-delay block, the left hand was on the target for the entire duration of the trial. Targets were positioned in front (Center) and to the Left of the participants, such that the posture of the left arm during encoding was either the same or different from the final posture of the contralateral reaching arm. The introduction of the shortest delay caused a decrease in accuracy and precision, indicating that on-line haptic inputs play a crucial role in guiding reaching movements. However, performance did not worsen with longer delays, particularly when the two arms were in similar postures. Our findings suggest that postural information may contribute to guiding actions when on-line haptic feedback is unavailable.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

The determinants of male reproductive success in egalitarian societies are less well understood. We investigated male reproductive monopolization in wild Guinea baboons (Papio papio), an egalitarian multilevel society in which one-male ""units"" are nested within larger social groups (""parties"") and male-male contest competition is low. Using nine years of behavioral and genetic data from five parties, we examined how reproductive success is distributed across males at different social levels. Paternity data show that 93% of the 71 infants were sired by the female's ""unit male"", with rare extra-unit paternities consistent with limited control models. Within parties, reproduction was shared among multiple unit males, resulting in low reproductive skew. The most successful males accounted for 23-40% of paternities within parties, well below the proportions reported in strictly hierarchical species. Takeovers of females were rare, suggesting male restraint. Reproductive success, assessed as the number of unit females, was positively associated with dominance ratings, yet males with average dominance ratings had the largest units. Altogether, prime-age was a better predictor of reproductive success than dominance. In conclusion, male Guinea baboons' reproductive success is shaped less by dominance and more by long-term associations with females, who play an active role in inter-sexual relationships. Our study emphasizes the need to move beyond frameworks focused solely on dominance-based mechanisms and to incorporate species-specific social organization when evaluating reproductive strategies.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""254142454 / GRK 2070;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

Most neuroscience research with OPMs to date has investigated neural responses below 70 Hz, but higher frequencies are also of interest.

To assess the upper bounds of OPM sensitivity we used the stereotypical retinal response to flashes of light. Retinal responses to light flashes characteristically exhibit a neural response above 70 Hz called the oscillatory potential (OP) when recorded with electroretinography (ERG). Here we adopt the term retinal high frequency oscillation (rHFO) to include measurement of similar activity with OPMs. Our comparison of magnetoretinography (MRG) and ERG shows that rHFO can be measured up to 140 Hz using rubidium-based zero-field OPMs.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC-StG-640448;""},{""name"":""diabetesforeningen"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Travel Grant;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DFG KO 5321/3-1;TR 408/11-1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

However, its relationship with stroke remains uncertain: some studies have reported a significant association between CHIP and stroke risk, while others, including large biobank analyses, found no association after adjustment. To resolve these conflicting findings, we analyzed genomic and clinical data from 800,160 participants with genetic sequencing and medical records across the Vanderbilt BioVU, NIH AllofUs, and UK Biobank. Stroke events were identified and classified as ischemic or hemorrhagic using ICD codes. Results from the three cohorts were meta-analyzed with previously published results. Subgroup analyses were conducted by driver gene, clone size, sex and menopausal status. In addition, genetically predicted levels of 27 plasma cytokines were assessed as potential modifiers of CHIP-associated stroke risk. CHIP was associated with increased risk of incident stroke in each cohort and in the meta-analysis (HR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.13-1.27; P = 2.21 x 10-10). This association was observed for both ischemic (HR = 1.18) and hemorrhagic (HR = 1.30) stroke subtypes. Gene-specific analyses showed strong associations for JAK2 (HR = 2.46) and TET2 (HR = 1.40). DNMT3A demonstrated weak but significant associations (HR = 1.11). CHIP was associated with stroke risk in both sexes; however, among women, the association was evident in postmenopausal (HR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.16-1.92; P = 1.91 x 10-3) but not in premenopausal participants (HR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.36-1.43, P = 0.33). Among participants with CHIP, but not among participants without CHIP, genetically predicted levels of IL-1RAP were predictive of risk for stroke, suggesting IL-1RAP as a modifier of the CHIP-associated risk for stroke. Collectively, this large-scale, multi-cohort study establishes CHIP as an important determinant of incident stroke risk and IL-1-mediated inflammation as a targetable pathway to reduce this risk.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1761689378852

We co-cultured host cells with live, stool-derived gut microbiomes from Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria, Malaysia, and the United States, and quantified transcriptional responses using RNA-seq. We found that urban microbiomes affected innate immune pathways, including TNF signaling and bacterial antigen recognition. We also found that high-diversity microbiomes elicited a stronger host transcriptional response, while low-diversity microbiomes triggered epithelial restructuring and glycolysis. Finally, specific taxa driving these effects, including Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bacteroides dorei, correlated with lifestyle factors such as diet. These findings demonstrate that urbanization-associated microbiome changes directly influence host epithelial gene expression.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35-GM128716;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""261376515; SFB 1182; C5.1;261376515; SFB 1182; C5.2;426660215;2167-390884018;""},{""name"":""European Research Council (ERC)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101126254;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

DESIGNCross-sectional study.

SETTING49 biomedical journals published by BMJ Group.

PARTICIPANTSSubmitting authors of 25,114 empirical research manuscripts including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, submitted between 8 April 2024 and 6 November 2024.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESPrevalence of manuscripts with self-disclosed use of AI, types of AI tools used, the tasks they assisted with and factors associated with disclosure.

RESULTSThere was a total of 25,114 eligible submissions: Asia (13,505; 53.8%), Europe (6,523; 26.0%), North America (2,795; 11.1%), Africa (1,196; 4.8%), Oceania (708; 2.8%), and South America (387; 1.5%). A total of 1,431 submissions (5.7%) disclosed the use of AI. The most frequently reported AI tools used were Generative AI Chatbots (812/1431; 56.7%) and writing assistants (182; 12.7%). The majority of authors who disclosed AI use reported using it to improve the quality of their writing (1,248/1,431; 87%). Additionally, translation (107; 7.5%), generating data and output (87, 6.1%), literature searches (49; 3.4%), analyzing data (31; 2.2%), image processing or analysis (49; 3.4%), code writing (15; 1.0%), and managing references (14; 0.9%) were mentioned as tasks AI assisted with.

Authors from South America (OR=1.75; 95%-CI: 1.22-2.49) and Europe (OR=1.28; 95%-CI: 1.14-1.45) were significantly more likely to disclose AI use than those from Asia. Conversely, each additional author reduced disclosure odds by 1% (OR=0.99, 95%-CI: 0.97-0.99). Acceptance rate, impact factor, type of journal, and peer review model) were not associated with AI use disclosure.

CONCLUSIONSWe found that only a small proportion (5.7%) of submitting authors disclosed AI use, which is substantially lower than proportions reported in surveys. Improving the quality of writing was the primarily task AI assisted with and AI Chatbots were the most commonly disclosed tool. Authors may be uncertain about what AI use requires disclosure or may be hesitant to declare it.

What is already known on this topic{blacksquare} Artificial intelligence is increasingly used in the conduct of scientific research and writing of publications and the way it is used is changing rapidly.
{blacksquare}Leading publishers and editorial organizations dedicated to promoting integrity and best practices in academic publishing have issued policies requiring authors to disclose all AI use in their content.
{blacksquare}Previous surveys show that a substantial proportion of researchers (28% to 76%) say they have used AI in their research.


What this study adds{blacksquare} This study of a process for mandatory declaration of AI use in research manuscripts submitted to 49 biomedical journals found a prevalence of only 5.7%, which is substantially lower than use reported in surveys.
{blacksquare}Improving the quality of writing was the most common reported task performed by AI, and generative AI Chatbots are the most frequently disclosed AI tool used.


How this study might affect research, practice or policy{blacksquare} Current mandatory questions on AI use may have only limited value and other measures are needed to improve declaration and to support detection of undisclosed use.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1761689378852

The Pm3 allelic series in wheat encodes NLR receptors that recognize avirulence (AVR) effectors of wheat powdery mildew. Here, we show that near-identical Pm3 alleles vary greatly in resistance efficacy and broadness against a global mildew isolate collection and subsequently use this model system to study the mechanisms underlying broad-spectrum resistance. We demonstrate that two alleles, Pm3d and Pm3e, provide resistance against the majority of isolates worldwide, by each recognizing two AVR effectors from powdery mildew, thereby lowering the risk of resistance breakdown. While Pm3d recognizes two closely related RNase-like AVR effectors, Pm3e detects two structurally diverse AVRs, including an effector belonging to a large, uncharacterized protein family with a novel structural fold. Using chimeric Pm3 NLRs, we identify specificity-defining polymorphisms of Pm3d and Pm3e against their diverse effector targets. Lastly, we demonstrate that Pm3d and Pm3e activities can be combined in engineered Pm3 NLRs, thereby further extending their recognition spectrum. Our findings highlight the potential of Pm3 immune receptors for long-lasting wheat protection by demonstrating their versatility in recognizing structurally diverse effectors and their amenability to NLR engineering.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

However, the large number of features generated by functional connectivity approaches may overfit the data. These problems can be overcome with either feature selection (FS) or dimensionality reduction (DR), which can be applied to less complex models. We utilize two open-source datasets to compare the performance of DR/FS methods on cognitive task decoding using a suite of ML classifiers. New Method While DR and FS methods have been used previously in decoding research, no systematic comparison of their performance has been undertaken. Here, we compare available methods using commonly utilized machine learning libraries to establish which methods provide the best predictive performance. We then conduct statistical tests to examine the relative contributions of DR and FS methods and classifiers on decoding accuracy. Results Neither DR or FS was found to be superior. However, differences were identified across datasets and tasks. In the majority of methods and datasets, a peak in predictive performance was found using a small percentage of the total number of original features. Comparison with existing methods Some methods perform better than the baseline method of prediction with all available features or selecting features randomly. Decoding performance utilizing the HCP datasets with certain DR/FS methods exceeds that of deep learning approaches. Conclusions Simple machine learning models with DR/FS have competitive decoding performance. These results suggest a sweet spot for the tradeoff between the retention of features and predictive accuracy.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

In contrast, individuals with depression and low self-esteem are more likely to attribute failures to internal causes and successes to external causes. At the same time, depression and low self-esteem are associated with negatively biased self-related learning and self-beliefs. Although causal attributions have been shown to influence belief formation and updating, the dynamic interaction between real-time attributions and self-related learning remains poorly understood. In this study, we used a validated self-related learning task to investigate how internal versus external attributions of performance feedback affect the formation of self-beliefs and how these processes relate to depressive symptoms and self-esteem. Drawing on a computational model that incorporates prediction error valence and causal attributions, we found that participants updated their self-beliefs less when feedback was attributed to external causes. Furthermore, individuals with higher levels of depression and lower self-esteem showed a stronger negativity bias in learning. Lower self-esteem was also linked to a reduced self-serving bias in attributions. These findings provide insight into the cognitive mechanisms that may contribute to the development and maintenance of negative self-beliefs commonly observed in depression.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""KU 3955/3-1;MU 4373/1-1; MU 4373/1-3; KR 3803/11-1; 3803/14-1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

Resistance to FHB in wheat is broadly classified as resistance to initial infection (type I) or resistance to disease spread within the spike (type II). A high level of type I FHB resistance was reported in an accession of wheat wild relative Triticum timopheevii. Hexaploid wheat-T. timopheevii introgression lines carrying a segment of the short arm of chromosome 3G (Chr3G) of this accession expressed high levels of FHB resistance following spray inoculation. Further analyses of these introgression lines showed that the Chr3G segment confers a potent type II resistance, accompanied by improved grain weight retention, and reduced deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation in grain. These results indicate that the Chr3G resistance has the potential to dramatically reduce FHB susceptibility and DON accumulation in grain in wheat cultivars. An introgression of a segment of Chr7At into the short arm of chromosome Chr7A also enhanced type II FHB resistance.","[{""name"":""BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/P016855/1;BB/X011003/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

All previously characterized retrons produce high levels of multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) in the cell by reverse transcription, which acts as an antitoxin in the absence of phage infection. However, we describe here a non-canonical mechanism for Type VI retrons, which do not produce detectable msDNA in the absence of phage, yet still provide phage defense. Focusing primarily on Retron-Vpa2, a Type VI retron from Vibrio parahaemolyticus, we show broad defense against phages and identify triggers of the system within phage recombination systems. Within the Retron-Vpa2 operon, we find a highly enriched, structured transcript that we term a hybrid RNA (hyRNA), which contains both the retrons reverse transcription template and a translationally repressed toxic effector coding sequence. We find that phage infection induces the accumulation of high levels of msDNA and that this msDNA is necessary for derepressing translation of the antiviral toxin. These findings present key biological and mechanistic insights into a distinct group of retrons while highlighting the diversity of systems that participate in bacterial immunity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

In the vertebrate spinal cord, progenitors are patterned into molecularly defined domains, but how lineage relationships shape neuronal diversity and function has remained unclear. Here, we combine genomic barcoding with single- cell RNA sequencing in chick and human embryos to generate cell-type-resolved clonal maps. We find that spinal neurogenesis follows a hierarchical organisation in which the neural tube first partitions into five broad subdivisions that resolve into the eleven progenitor domains generating the cardinal neuronal classes. This bifurcating architecture implies a patterning mechanism of sequential binary decisions. The most prominent lineage restriction occurs at the embryonic alar-basal boundary, separating sensory-processing from motor-control circuits. Individual progenitors generate neurons across multiple temporal waves while remaining constrained within their lineage subdivision, demonstrating persistence of spatial identity despite temporal competence changes. Among sensory populations, we identify two developmental routes, via unifated or bifated progenitors, to pain- and itch-processing interneurons. These principles are conserved between chick and human, with clonal analysis in human embryos revealing that most fate choices are resolved by six weeks post-conception. Together, these findings provide a framework for spinal cord development and reveal lineage compartmentalisation as a fundamental principle in neural circuit assembly and evolution.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC001051),;""},{""name"":""Wellcome"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC001051;220379/D/20/Z;218670/Z/19/Z;215116/Z/18/Z;""},{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC001051;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""742138;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""792-2021;""},{""name"":""UKRI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X031225/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

VPS13C readily binds lysosomes under mechanical or osmotic tension in anticipation of membrane lesions. The latter trigger a conformational change in the proteins C-terminus, involving its ATG2C domain acting as sensor of damage-induced lipid packing defects. We show that ER-lysosome contacts formed by VPS13C provide critical binding platforms for OSBP/ORPs to enable efficient ER wrapping of damaged lysosomes.

Acute stress is known to impact the hippocampus but may have opposite effects on these competing functions. That is, although stress impairs episodic encoding, it may instead enhance statistical learning. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested how stress influences the hippocampal pathways and subfields that support episodic encoding and statistical learning while participants performed a task that engaged both processes. Across several analyses, stress biased hippocampal processing in favour of statistical learning, suppressing pattern separation between events in the dentate gyrus and enhancing the representation of statistically predictive features. Furthermore, stress drove the hippocampal monosynaptic pathway to support statistical learning rather than episodic encoding during predictive situations. Together, these data suggest that acute stress elicits targeted, adaptive changes in hippocampal pathways which may facilitate predicting and responding to upcoming events.","[{""name"":""NIMH"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R21MH128740;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

In particular, Oceanians and South Asians independently inherited DNA from a deeply diverged Denisovan population which was likely isolated in South Asia. This supports an early migration of the ancestors of Oceanians through South Asia followed by the later arrival of the ancestors of present-day South Asians. East Asians do not share this Denisovan component in their genomes, suggesting that their ancestors arrived independently, perhaps by a northerly route.

Conventional genetic engineering of hiPSC lines requires a laborious process involving transfection, selection and expansion that can result in karyotypic abnormalities or transgene silencing during differentiation, limiting their applications. Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) delivery is a potential alternative integration-free method for durable expression of transgenes. Here, we used saRNA to deliver transcription factors and functional reporters in hiPSCs and demonstrate that expression can persist for weeks. Specifically, saRNA delivery enables highly efficient forward programming to Ngn2-induced neurons and enables measurement of functional reporters over time. We show that a single transfection of saRNA encoded jRCaMP1b reporter in hiPSCs generates sustained expression throughout differentiation to 3D cardiac spheroids. The persistence of the reporter allows measurement of calcium dynamics at a single-cell and population level over weeks, allowing tracking of cardiomyocyte maturation and drug responses. Together, our systematic analysis shows that saRNA provides sustained transgene expression in hiPSCs, supporting integration- free cell-fate programming and measurement of functional reporters in clinically relevant model systems.

Butyrate, a gut microbial metabolite, has been found to be reduced in AD patients; butyrate supplementation improved cognition and decreased amyloid burden in animal models. However, the precise underlying mechanisms are unclear. Our previous studies have demonstrated that insulin signaling impacts A transport kinetics at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we investigated the effect of butyrate treatment on intra-endothelial A accumulation and BBB integrity by modulating the insulin signaling pathway. The effect of butyrate on A accumulation was assessed by flow cytometry in BBB cell culture models. Insulin signaling activation and the expression of various receptors and transporters at the BBB were evaluated by Western blots and confocal microscopy. The roles of various molecular mediators were confirmed using specific inhibitors (MK2206, Trametinib, Rapamycin, VX-745). The effect of butyrate on the expression of BBB receptors and transporters that play a critical role in A trafficking was examined in mouse brains colonized with butyrate-producing bacteria via immunohistochemistry. Butyrate significantly decreased A{beta}42 accumulation in endothelial cells. This effect was associated with insulin signaling pathway activation, particularly AKT and ERK phosphorylation. Inhibitor studies established the critical role of these specific arms, as co-incubation with MK2206 (AKT inhibitor) or Trametinib (ERK inhibitor) reversed the protective effect of butyrate and increased A{beta}42 accumulation. However, mTOR and p38 inhibitors did not show a similar effect. In addition, butyrate restored P-glycoprotein efflux transporter expression and claudin-5 tight junction protein levels that were reduced with A{beta} treatment. These effects were supported by in vivo work, which demonstrated the upregulation of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2). This protein is associated with AKT activation and extracellular matrix stabilization in mice colonized with butyrate-producing bacteria. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that butyrate decreases A{beta}42 uptake at the BBB endothelium by activating the AKT and ERK arms of the insulin signaling pathway. These changes may also improve the integrity of BBB tight junctions by increasing claudin-5 expression and extracellular matrix, and by upregulating TIMP-2 expression. This study highlights butyrate's potential as a therapeutic modulator of AD-related BBB dysfunction.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

While not the primary cause of the disease, this impairment is associated with disease progression. In the 5xFAD mouse model, monocyte differentiation was found to be disrupted due to a maladaptive bone marrow (BM) response, driven by type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling. A similar phenotype was found in circulating monocytes from AD patients compared to healthy controls. Blocking IFN-I with monoclonal antibodies or using chimeric AD mice with BM from mice lacking the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR1) alleviated myelopoiesis dysfunction, normalized monocyte phenotypes, and reduced cognitive impairment. These improvements in myeloid function were accompanied by an increased homing of monocyte-derived macrophages in the AD brain.

In 21 healthy adults, resting-state EEG data was collected before and after placebo or diazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of type A {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors. The shape of individual cycles in the alpha band was then derived using empirical mode decomposition, followed by extraction of principal components (PCs) describing specific facets of alpha shape. Results of this approach show that all shape features were unchanged following placebo. In contrast, diazepam was associated with complex changes in several shape features, including peak-trough shape and edge speed. While changes in shape were apparent in all cortical lobes, the strongest alterations were specific to sensorimotor and parietal cortices.

However, sampling root exudates and rhizosphere soil remains challenging due to the low throughput and destructive nature of the process.
C_LIO_LIWe used the staple crop barley [Hordeum vulgare] as a model to benchmark different sampling approaches for simultaneous exudation and microbiota profiling of soil-grown plants.
C_LIO_LIExudate profiles and total dissolved organic carbon exudation rates were consistent across different sampling approaches, whereas root biomass, root morphology measurements, and organic nitrogen exudation varied.
C_LIO_LIHigh-throughput amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of phylogenetic markers and nitrogen cycle-selected genes revealed a protocol-specific footprint in the composition and abundance of rhizosphere bacterial and fungal microbiota. Yet, on average, 75% of microbes enriched in, and differentiating between, barley rhizosphere and unplanted soil controls were recovered across all the sampling approaches evaluated.
C_LIO_LIOur results demonstrated that, under the tested conditions, different sampling approaches produced comparable microbiota and exudation patterns, enabling the integrated study of root exudation and microbial profiles from the same plant.

Our results on both active and inactive state GPCRs show that our automation strategy generalizes easily to new target classes, and that complete automation of data processing is straightforward to achieve in CryoSPARC.

More than half of human proteins, however, contain mixtures of disordered regions and one or more folded domains, and the biological function of these multi-domain proteins depends on the interplay between the folded and disordered regions. Here, we developed AF-CALVADOS, a coarse-grained simulation model that is informed by AlphaFold to model the dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins and multi-domain proteins containing mixtures of folded and disordered regions. AF-CALVADOS leverages information from AlphaFold 2 to model folded regions that we then integrate with the coarse-grained CALVADOS model. Our automated framework makes it possible to perform simulations of any soluble folded or disordered protein without manually defined folded regions, enabling scaling to the proteome level. We validate AF-CALVADOS using experimental data and consistency between our simulations and the AlphaFold 2 predicted aligned error matrix. We demonstrate the scalability of AF-CALVADOS by performing simulations of 12,483 cytosolic human proteins and make the data freely available; we envisage that large-scale simulation data generated by AF-CALVADOS can be used to benchmark or train machine learning models for flexible, multi-domain proteins. The conformational ensembles can be used to study sequence-dynamics-function relationships at scale, and can shed light on the interplay between folded and disordered regions.

These artifacts can affect demultiplexing accuracy and downstream analyses.

ResultsWe performed a rapid barcoding experiment on 66 diagnostic samples and found that 83% of reads carried the expected single-barcode pattern, while 17% contained multiple barcodes or other artifacts. Current demultiplexers, including the widely used Dorado, fail to correctly handle these complex cases, leaving approximately 7% of reads partially trimmed and contaminated with adapter fragments. Additional issues include the presence of two barcodes at the same read end--either identical, originating from the same sample, or different, introduced after pooling. The latter can lead to barcode bleeding when the outer barcode is incorrectly selected. To address these challenges, we developed Barbell, a pattern-aware demultiplexer that detects all barcode configurations. Barbell reduces trimming errors by three orders of magnitude, minimizes barcode bleeding, and supports custom experimental setups such as shorter barcodes, dual-end barcodes, and custom flank sequences.

ConclusionsOur results highlight the impact of complex barcode attachments in Nanopore sequencing and demonstrate that Barbell drastically reduces their effects on downstream analyses.

Here, we introduce TF-MAPs, a scalable and general platform to chart complete functional maps of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. We apply TF-MAPS to three human disease TFs: HNF1A, FOXG1 and FOXP1. Allostery in all three proteins is distance-dependent, anisotropic, and couples the DNA-binding interface to the protein surface. The allosteric surfaces of FOXG1 and FOXP1 are quite diverged, revealing a potential for protein-specific regulation in protein families. All three TFs have potentially druggable pockets where mutations have strong functional effects on binding, either within the binding interface or distant from it. Using TF-MAPS it should be possible to chart functional and allosteric maps for hundreds of human TFs and other DNA-binding proteins to understand DNA recognition and TF regulation, to mechanistically interpret clinical variants, and to guide the development of TF-modulating therapeutics.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Sanger Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cy4wa09"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Grant reference: 220540/Z/20/A, ‘Wellcome Sanger Institute Quinquennial Review 2021-2026’;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

It facilitates molecular evolution and has been characterized in a variety of biological systems, but studies of prokaryotic promoters are limited. Prokaryotic promoters are non-coding DNA sequences that regulate transcription. The main housekeeping promoters ({sigma}70) share two sequence motifs called the -35 and the -10 box that are spaced 17{+/-}1 base pairs (bps) apart. The sequence of these boxes, their distance, and the existence of multiple nearby boxes can determine promoter strength, the ability of a promoter to drive high levels of transcription. Here we used computational modelling to show that the mutational robustness of {sigma}70 promoters - the persistence of promoter strength upon mutation - correlates with promoter strength itself. Mutational robustness is also influenced by potential overlaps between -10 and -35 boxes, and by specific positions within the boxes. It is higher when the boxes are exactly 17 bps apart. These findings can be partially explained by the flexibility of -35 boxes, which enables adjacent bases to create overlapping and new -35 boxes. Our work can help to engineer synthetic promoters for strength and robustness, and to understand the dynamics of promoter evolution.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""31003A_172887;310030_208174;""},{""name"":""University of Zurich"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02crff812"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FK-23-120;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

We identified transcriptional regulators for each of these states and characterized 31 regulators at the single-cell transcriptomic and cell-surface proteome level in two distinct iPSC-derived microglia models.

However, astrocytes contribution to cognitive operations like reinforcement learning (RL) remains unclear. To examine this, we trained mice on a RL dependent probabilistic decision-making task. We attenuated ACD across distinct striatal regions, finding that ACD attenuation specifically in ventral striatum (VS) increased decision noisiness and impaired reward-guided choice. This effect was largely due to a reduction in ""win-stay"" behavior. Using in-vivo calcium imaging, we found that VS ACD correlated with reward prediction errors (RPEs). Furthermore, these trial-by-trial ACD fluctuations predicted trial-by-trial choice variability. Finally, ex-vivo slice electrophysiology and computational modeling revealed two mechanisms through which astrocytes could regulate behavioral variability: by regulating presynaptic excitatory-inhibitory balance, and by sharing RPE signals across populations of striatal neurons. Together, these results suggest that VS astrocytes contribute to cortico-striatal functions to mediate decision noisiness.","[{""name"":""Army Research Office"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""78259-NS-MUR;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH135646;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

Central to the viral life cycle is the viral L-protein, a crucial and multifunctional protein which both transcribes and replicates the viral genome. Here, we present the cryoEM structures of an RNA free and a 5 promoter bound complex, describing the core catalytic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We observe an RdRp that is substantially larger than related L-proteins and contains domain insertions unique to the nairovirus family. The 5 RNA promoter is found in a tight RNA hairpin stabilised by a single base pair, with 5 binding triggering the closure of protein over the RNA. Functional analysis of the endonuclease and RdRp activities reveals an enzyme which is capable of both activities and demonstrate RdRp inhibition by known antiviral nucleosides. These data advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind genome replication and transcription, that will help inform future antiviral development.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

Oct4, a master regulator of pluripotency, exemplifies this capacity as it can bind nucleosome-occupied DNA. Yet, how Oct4 reshapes chromatin fibres beyond the scale of a single nucleosome has remained unclear. Here, we harness our near-atomistic coarse-grained chromatin model to dissect how full-length Oct4 interacts with chromatin fibres of varying nucleosomal repeat lengths. We find that Oct4 increases DNA accessibility not by decondensing chromatin, but by driving fibres into compact liquid-like states in which nucleosomes breathe, reorient, exchange neighbours, and transiently expose DNA. Oct4 binds preferentially to linker DNA through its structured POU domains, while its disordered activation domains mediate cluster formation: a three-stage process consisting of nucleation of small clusters, attachment to chromatin via the DNA binding domains, and growth that is amplified when long DNA linkers enable fibre bending and looping. Oct4 clusters deform chromatin and bridge distal DNA segments in a stoichiometry- and linker length-dependent manner, revealing a tunable mechanism for controlling higher-order structure. Together, our results establish how Oct4 exploits multivalency, nucleosome breathing, and chromatin flexibility to reorganise fibres into liquid-like states that reconcile condensation with enhanced accessibility, providing a physical route to overcome the transcription-factor  search problem and activate silenced genes during reprogramming.","[{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X02332X/1;EP/Z002028/1;EP/X035603/1;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""803326;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

However, emerging viral variants have escaped all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved NAb treatments, underscoring the urgent need for effective therapeutic alternatives. Using a nanoluciferase (Nluc)-expressing attenuated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 lacking the open reading frames (ORF) 3a and 7b ({Delta}3a7b-Nluc), we characterized resistance profiles of two broadly protective NAbs targeting the S receptor binding domain (RBD) in S1 (1301B7) and the stem helix domain (SH) in S2 (1249A8). Serial passaging of {Delta}3a7b-Nluc under selective pressure identified a 1301B7 antibody-resistant mutants (ARM-B7) harboring an RBD mutation (S371F) that conferred resistance to 1301B7 and other RBD-directed NAbs (Casirivimab, SC27 and Sotrovimab). In contrast, no ARM emerged under treatment with 1249A8, or an antibody cocktail of 1301B7 (RBD) + 1249A8 (SH). These findings demonstrate that S2 SH-targeting NAbs shows higher genetic barrier to resistance than S1 RBD-targeting NAbs, and that a NAbs cocktail therapy targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD and S2 SH offers the most effective strategy to prevent the emergence of escape mutations. Together, our findings provide critical insights into developing next-generation resistance-evading NAb therapies against SARS-CoV-2, and potentially other coronaviruses, and demonstrate the value of using our attenuated viral platforms for the safe identification of ARM without the potential biosafety concerns of doing these experiments using wild-type (WT) forms of SARS-CoV-2.

SIGNIFICANCEThe clinical efficacy of early SARS-CoV-2 NAbs has been challenged by the emergence of escape viral variants, highlighting an urgent need to anticipate resistance. Using a luminescent attenuated SARS-CoV-2 platform, we profiled resistant mutations against two broadly protective SARS-CoV-2 NAbs. Passage of {Delta}3a7b-Nluc in the presence of a NAb targeting the RBD S1 domain (1301B7) readily selected for an ARM, whereas passage in the presence of an SH S2 domain NAb (1249A8) did not. Notably, a cocktail of 1301B7 and 1249A8 created a high barrier of selecting SARS-CoV-2 ARM, preventing the emergence of resistant variants. We identified an S371F mutation in the S1 RBD of ARM-B7 that confers resistance to 1301B7 and other S1 RBD-targeting NAbs. These results highlight the importance of combination therapies targeting both variable RBD S1 and conserved SH S2 domain for the efficient treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and to prevent the emerge of NAb-induced escape mutations.","[{""name"":""NIAID"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 AI161363;75N93021C00014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

While clonal expansions in the hematopoietic system have been extensively characterized and reported to be nearly ubiquitous, clonal mosaicism (CM) has more recently also been described across multiple solid tissues. However, outstanding questions remain about the parameters and processes of human somatic evolution in non-cancerous solid human tissues, including when clones arise, how they evolve over time, and what mechanisms lead to their expansion. Questions of timing and clonal dynamics can be addressed through phylogenetic reconstruction, which serves as a  temporal microscope, while uncovering the mechanisms of expansion necessitates simultaneous phenotypic profiling. To address this gap, here we develop Single-cell Miniaturized Automated Reverse Transcription and Primary Template-directed Amplification (SMART-PTA) for joint single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing for large scale and cost efficient interrogation of solid tissue CM. We established a workflow that generates hundreds of matched single-cell whole genome and transcriptome libraries within a week. We profiled phenotypically normal esophagus tissue from four aged donors and used somatic variants to build high-resolution single-cell lineages from >2,700 cells with accompanying transcriptomic information, reconstructing >70 years of somatic evolution. T cell expansions identified from T cell receptor (TCR) sequences validated the clonal structure of the single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based phylogenies and phylogenetic cross-correlation analysis showed that epithelial cells had higher degrees of shared ancestry by spatial location compared to immune cells. Mapping mutation signatures to the phylogenetic tree revealed the emergence of tobacco/alcohol exposure-related signatures later in life, consistent with the donors exposure histories. We identified variants in driver genes that were previously reported in the phenotypically normal esophagus, detecting clonal expansions harboring mutations in genes including TP53 and FAT1. We mapped the evolution of clones with both monoallelic as well as biallelic TP53 loss, including a clone associated with high expression of cell cycling genes and higher chromosome instability. Leveraging the matched transcriptome data, we uncovered cell type biases in mutant clones, with a higher proportion of TP53 or FAT1-mutant cells in an earlier basal epithelial cell state compared to wild-type cells. We further observed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) events on chromosome 9q that spanned the NOTCH1 locus in up to [~]35% of epithelial cells. Mapping CNLOH events to the phylogenetic tree revealed a striking pattern in which CNLOH was separately acquired many times, reflecting convergent evolution. Cells with CNLOH events were biased towards the earlier basal epithelial state, suggestive of a selective advantage that leads to prevalent recurrence of chr9q CNLOH. Together, we demonstrate that SMART-PTA is an efficient, scalable approach for single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome profiling to build phenotypically annotated single-cell phylogenies with enough throughput and power for application to normal tissue somatic evolution. Moreover, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the esophageal epithelium at high scale and resolution, providing a window into the dynamics and processes that shape clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues throughout a lifespan.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3NS132139;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R33 CA267219;""},{""name"":""NIDDK"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30 DK132710;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RM1HG011014;""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01d35cw23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Career Award for Medical Scientists;""},{""name"":""Vallee Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05nmp3276"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Scholar Award;""},{""name"":""Blood Cancer United"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00v7th354"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MacMillan Family Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

Here, we developed a new computational framework to minimize negative transfer for domain-adaptive brain decoding by reframing source selection as a mixture model parameter estimation problem, allowing each source subject to contribute through a continuous mixture weight rather than being outright included or excluded. To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer. Collectively, this research advances toward a more principled and generalizable brain decoding framework, laying the mathematical foundation for scalable brain-computer interfaces and other applications in computational neuroscience.","[{""name"":""Schroeder Institute for Brain Innovation and Recovery"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

A promising strategy for ""proteome editing"" is to use bifunctional molecules (e.g. PROteolysis-Targeting Chimeras or PROTACs1) that bring a target protein into proximity with a degradation or stabilization effector, but their broader application is constrained by a limited repertoire of well-characterized target or effector ""handles"". We asked whether coupling de novo protein design to a multiplex screening framework could address this gap by accelerating the discovery of effector handles for intracellular protein degradation, stabilization, or relocalization. Using LABEL-seq2, a sequencing-based assay that enables multiplex, quantitative measurement of protein abundance, we screened 9,715 de novo designed candidate effector handles for their ability to recruit a target protein to components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system3 (UPS) (FBXL12, TRAF2, UCHL1, USP38) or the autophagy pathway4 (GABARAP, GABARAPL2, MAP1LC3A). In a single experiment, we discovered hundreds of de novo designed effector handles that reproducibly drove either intracellular degradation (n = 277) or stabilization (n = 204) of a reporter protein. Validation of a subset of these hits in an orthogonal assay confirmed that sequencing-based measurements from the primary screen reliably reflected changes in intracellular abundance of the target protein. Successful effector handles were discovered for both the UPS (n = 194) and autophagy (n = 287) pathways, which provide complementary routes for programmable proteome editing. Autophagy-recruiting effector handles generalized to endogenous targets, as substituting the reporter-specific target handle with a high-affinity MCL1 binder5 reduced endogenous levels of this intracellular oncoprotein6. Moreover, directing autophagy-recruiting effector handles to the outer mitochondrial membrane dramatically perturbed mitochondrial networks in a manner consistent with synthetic tethering and sequestration7,8. Beyond generating a diverse repertoire of protein abundance or localization effector handles, our results establish a scalable, low-cost platform that links deep learning-guided protein design to functional cellular readouts, and chart a course toward a general framework for programmable proteome editing.","[{""name"":""National Heart Lung and Blood Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012pb6c26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31HL168982;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T32GM136534;""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV-043758;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG010632;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility.

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

While open models for unconstrained ""minibinder"" design have shown great experimental promise, methods for designing binders in specific formats, such as antibodies, have lagged behind in experimental success rates. In this work, we present mBER, an open-source protein binder design system capable of designing antibody-format binders with state-of-the-art experimental success rates. mBER builds on the ColabDesign framework, achieving successful antibody design primarily through the inclusion of informative sequence and structure conditioning information. Using mBER, we designed two libraries comprising over 1 million VHH binders against 436 diverse targets. We experimentally screened the two libraries against 145 of these targets, resulting in a dataset of over 100 million binding interactions. We achieved specific and significant design success against 45% of targets. In a filtered set of designs, we detect binding rates to specific epitopes as high as 38%. Through mBER, we demonstrate that format-specific binder design is possible with no additional training of underlying folding and language models. This work represents the largest reported de novo protein design and validation campaign, and one of the first open-source methods to demonstrate double-digit percentage experimental success rates for antibody binder design.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

Here, we present a spatially resolved, multi-omics framework that integrates whole-organ 3D imaging at cellular resolution with targeted proteomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic profiling to detect and characterize microscopic tubal lesions. Using this platform, we identified a total of 99 STICs and their presumed precursors that harbor TP53 mutations in morphologically unremarkable tubal epithelium in all five specimens obtained from cancer-free organ donors with average-risk of developing ovarian cancer. Although these lesions comprised only 0.2% of the epithelial compartment, they displayed geographic diversity, immune exclusion, metabolic rewiring, and DNA copy number changes among lesions and normal fallopian tube epithelium discovered alterations in STIC-associated genes and the pathways they control. In sum, this platform provides a comprehensive 3D atlas of early neoplastic transformation, yielding mechanistic insights into tumor initiation and informing clinical screening strategies for detecting cancer precursors in whole organs at cellular resolution.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U54CA268083;RO1CA300052;UG3CA275681;P50CA228991;R01GM149976;U01AI167892;5R01NS111039;R21NS125395;U54 HL165443;U54 DK 134301;R01 HL170107;U2CCA271891;""},{""name"":""Sloan research fellow award, a CZI Scialog award, and UCSD Startup funds"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Johns Hopkins University and Instituto Superior Técnico student exchange program (HOPTEC and FLAD)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Richard W.

This is especially a problem in children, where cancer survivors experience a subsequent high risk of bone mineral deficits and fractures, normally seen in the older population. Here, we model this to show that early-life treatment with a single dose of the commonly used chemotherapy cisplatin profoundly impairs late-life bone health, and that these bone deficits are completely resolved through treatment with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). While we had previously shown that this same strategy protects against chemotherapy induced female infertility, this maintenance of aged bone health appears to be unrelated to endocrine changes due to protection of the ovarian reserve. Rather, this is driven by altered phosphorus homeostasis and protection against renal damage, which otherwise increases parathyroid hormone secretion to mobilise calcium stores from bone. Overall, this work highlights a new approach for maintaining healthy bone ageing in cancer survivors.","[{""name"":""American Federation for Aging Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/000r61a05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Hevolution/AFAR New Investigator Award in Aging Biology;""},{""name"":""National Health and Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/011kf5r70"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""APP1139763;APP1127821;APP2009940;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

Here, we question this view by demonstrating cross-communication between distinct arbitrium systems. Using prototypical arbitrium phages, we demonstrate that AimP peptides bind and repress unrelated AimR receptors, promoting lysogeny and reducing prophage induction. Structural and binding assays reveal conserved residues enabling cross-recognition while preserving specificity. In mixed lysogenic cultures, these interactions shape induction outcomes, demonstrating ecological relevance. We extent these findings to infection contexts, showing that arbitrium signalling influences outcomes in cells harbouring prophages with compatible communicating systems.

Using GPX1 and GPX4, selenoenzymes that mitigate oxidative stress, as reporters, we performed genome-wide knockout screens to identify regulators of selenocysteine incorporation. This revealed that selenoprotein production is limited by ribosome collisions that occur at inefficiently decoded selenocysteine codons. Accordingly, slowed translation elongation reduced collisions and enhanced selenocysteine decoding. Oxidative stress also slowed translation elongation and augmented selenoprotein production. We identified translation elongation factor EEF1G as a sensor of oxidized glutathione that couples the cellular redox state to translation elongation rate. Oxidative stress sensing by EEF1G slows translation, enhancing production of detoxifying selenoproteins to restore homeostasis.

Little is known, however, about whether and how phages can establish long-term genetic stability. We addressed this eco-evolutionary question in an open marine animal associated system, through two longitudinal samplings years apart in an oyster farm, obtaining >1,000 virulent phages and >600 Vibrio crassostreae strains. Surprisingly, lineages of phage and bacteria were very persistent, with some phages remaining strictly identical after four years. The phage-vibrio infection network remained modular with multiple lineages co-habitating within individual oysters for long periods of time. Seasonal restriction of V. crassostreae, overwintering in wild oysters, and limited viral decay may explain phage stability. Oysters also act as hotspots of activity of diverse mobile genetic element (MGE), hosting plasmids, prophages, phage-plasmids and entirely new classes of satellite-plasmids. Our findings demonstrate how nested ecological constraints can stabilize viral lineages: oysters house vibrio populations that escape host immunity, vibrios restrict phages via receptors and defenses, and satellites parasitize their cognate helper phages. We suggest that ecological context can favor the long-term maintenance of viral lineages and stabilize MGE persistence in the ocean, even amid ongoing mutation and antagonistic co-evolution.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""884988;""},{""name"":""Canada Excellence Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02tvrwm90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-00051;""},{""name"":""FRQ-NT, Fonds des leaders John-R.-Evans"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""44584;""},{""name"":""ANR"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""20-CE35-0014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has allowed proteome-scale quantification of hundreds of thousands of ubiquitination sites (ubi-sites), however the functional importance and regulatory roles of most ubi-sites remain undefined. Here, we assembled a human reference ubiquitinome of 108,341 ubi-sites by harmonizing public proteomics data. We identified a core subset of ubi-sites under evolutionary constraint through alignment of ubiquitin proteomics data from six non-human species, and determined ultra-conserved ubi-sites recurring at regulatory hotspots within protein domains. Perturbation proteomics revealed that these highly conserved ubi-sites are more likely to regulate signaling functions rather than proteasomal degradation. To further prioritize functional ubi-sites with roles in cellular signaling, we constructed a functional score for more than 100,000 ubi-sites by integrating evolutionary, proteomic, and structural features using machine learning. Our score identifies ubi-sites regulating diverse protein functions and rationalizes mechanisms of genetic disease. Finally, we employed chemical genomics to validate the functional relevance of high-scoring ubi-sites and leveraged genetic code expansion to demonstrate that ubiquitination of K320 in the RNA-regulator ELAVL1 disrupts RNA binding.

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761689378852
