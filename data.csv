In North America, infections in novel avian and mammalian species suggest the potential for changing ecology and establishment of new animal reservoirs. Outbreaks among domestic birds have persisted despite aggressive culling, necessitating a re-examination of how these outbreaks were sparked and maintained. To recover how these viruses were introduced and disseminated in North America, we analyzed 1,818 Hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences sampled from North American wild birds, domestic birds and mammals from November 2021-September 2023 using Bayesian phylodynamic approaches. Using HA, we infer that the North American panzootic was driven by ~8 independent introductions into North America via the Atlantic and Pacific Flyways, followed by rapid dissemination westward via wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, shorebirds, and Galliformes, while species such as songbirds, raptors, and owls mostly acted as dead-end hosts. Unlike the epizootic of 2015, outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by ~46-113 independent introductions from wild birds, with some onward transmission. Backyard birds were infected ~10 days earlier on average than birds in commercial poultry production settings, suggesting that they could act as early warning signals for transmission upticks in a given area. Our findings support wild birds as an emerging reservoir for HPAI transmission in North America and suggest continuous surveillance of wild Anseriformes and shorebirds as crucial for outbreak inference. Future prevention of agricultural outbreaks may require investment in strategies that reduce transmission at the wild bird/agriculture interface, and investigation of backyard birds as putative early warning signs.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1734818874642

However, opioids are prone to side effects which limit their effectiveness as analgesics and can lead to opioid use disorders or, even, lethal overdose. The systemic administration of opioid agonists makes it both very difficult to decipher their underlying circuit mechanisms of action and to limit drug action to specific receptor subpopulations to isolate therapeutic effects from adverse side effects. Here we design, synthesize, and characterize a reversibly photoswitchable morphinan agonist termed azo-morphine-3 (AM-3) which interconverts from low to high efficacy in response to different wavelengths of light to enable optical control of MOR signaling. Cryo-EM structures of the low efficacy trans and high efficacy cis states of AM-3 bound to the MOR reveal distinct binding modes of the photoswitchable azobenzene moiety, each inducing unique structural dynamics, providing insight into the molecular basis of agonist efficacy. In mice, AM-3 drives reversible and repeatable optical control of anti-nociception with a reduced side effect profile owing to its restriction to the periphery and its ability to be locally activated at the site of pain.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Central to this defense is the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where UBR4 acts as essential E4 ubiquitin ligase, amplifying degradation marks on defective proteins. Our cryo-EM analysis of UBR4 in complex with its cofactors KCMF1 and CALM1 reveals a massive 1.3 MDa ring structure, featuring a central substrate-binding arena and flexibly attached catalytic units. Structural data illustrate how UBR4 binds substrate and extends K48-specific ubiquitin chains. Importantly, efficient substrate targeting depends on both pre-ubiquitination and specific N-degrons, with KCMF1 acting as key substrate filter. Furthermore, we show that the architecture of the E4 megacomplex is conserved across eukaryotes but with species specific adaptations, allowing UBR4 to perform its precisely tuned quality-control function in diverse cellular environments.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Viral sequencing during the pandemic allowed us to track disease spread, quickly identify new variants, and guide the development of vaccines. Tiled amplicon sequencing, in which a panel of primers is used for multiplex amplification of fragments across an entire genome, was the cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. The speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of this method led to its implementation in academic and public health laboratories across the world and adaptation to a broad range of viral pathogens. However, similar methods are not available for larger bacterial genomes, for which whole-genome sequencing typically requires in vitro culture. This increases costs, error rates and turnaround times. The need to culture poses particular problems for medically important bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which are slow to grow and challenging to culture. As a proof of concept, we developed two novel whole-genome amplicon panels for M. tuberculosis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Applying our amplicon panels to clinical samples, we show the ability to classify pathogen subgroups and to reliably identify markers of drug resistance without culturing. Development of this work in clinical settings has the potential to dramatically reduce the time of diagnosis of drug resistance for multiple drugs in parallel, enabling earlier intervention for high priority pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

The structure of the TCRm/pMHC complex at 2.05 Angstrom resolution revealed a rigid TCR-like docking mode with an unusual degree of focus on the up-facing NY-ESO-1 side chains, suggesting the potential for reduced off-target reactivity.

By contrast, Marchantia-specific immune mechanisms have not been explored. In this study, we investigated the genetic basis of quantitative resistance in M. polymorpha against the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum nymphaeae, a naturally occurring compatible parasite. Through a combination of phenotypic, cytological and transcriptomic approaches, combined with genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identified key defense-related genes and pathways. Transcriptomic analyses performed on two lines with contrasting suceptibilities to the pathogen revealed a strong overlap in immune responses between M. polymorpha and angiosperms, including the upregulation of PR proteins, transcription factors typically associated with biotic stresses, and enzymes involved in specialized metabolism. Leveraging the biological and genetic variability present in a collection of natural M. polymorpha accessions, highlight the role of horizontally transferred microbial-like terpene synthase (MTPSL) genes, which may contribute to the exceptional terpene diversity in liverworts and play a role in pathogen resistance. GWAS uncovered candidate loci associated with resistance traits, implicating both core immune components and specialized metabolic pathways.

Mixotrophy in ciliates is commonplace, but has been investigated at a cellular and molecular level almost entirely in one organism, Paramecium bursaria. Reliance on just one model system makes it difficult to know which cell biological aspects of this system represent general features of ciliate mixotrophy versus accidental features of the specific organism. Here we describe the cell biology and genome of the giant heterotrichous ciliate Stentor pyriformis. We show that this giant unicellular organism contains Chlorella variabilis as its endosymbiont, that the Chlorella can live freely outside the host, that within the host the Chlorella cells are docked near the cell surface, surrounded by microtubule ""baskets"", and that the photosynthetic efficiency of the Chlorella is reduced inside the Stentor cell compared to when it is free-living outside the host, with photon energy instead being shunted to non-photochemical quenching. Compared to the non-mixotrophic Stentor coeruleus, S. pyriformis has several distinct cellular features that may be related to endosymbiosis: the presence of microtubule baskets, which are absent in S. coeruleus; positive rather than negative phototaxis, which is likely an adaptation to allow the photosynthetic symbionts access to sufficient light; and a lack of pigment in the host cell, which may be an adaptation to tolerate high light levels. Compared to P. bursaria, S. pyriformis has several similar cellular features: in both organisms, the symbiont is a strain of Chlorella variabilis; the Chlorella endosymbiont retains the ability to live freely when separated from the host; and the algal symbionts contained in perialgal vesicles are docked at the cell surface. One potentially informative difference between P. bursaria and S. pyriformis is that S. pyriformis employs a standard genetic code, similar to other Stentor species but different from most other ciliates, including P. bursaria, which use a non-standard code in which one or more stop-codons are respecified to encode amino acids. This difference in genetic code could serve as a barrier to impede gene transfer from symbiont to host in other ciliates, but this would not be a factor in S. pyriformis. A second cell biological difference is that whereas P. bursaria performs phototaxis by a kinetic accumulation mechanism, in which swimming is non-directional but cells slow down in regions of higher light intensity, S. pyriformis performs directed swimming towards the direction of high light intensity. However, as in P. bursaria, phototaxis in S. pyriformis requires the presence of the Chlorella, implying a potential flow of information from the symbiont to direct the orientation and swimming of the host cell. We propose that S. pyriformis will serve as a useful model system for studying the evolution of mixotrophy and endosymbiosis, with unique advantages in terms of size and regenerative ability as well as distinct cellular and genomic features compared with other mixotrophic ciliate models.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

However, the mechanism(s) by which changes in LD composition and dynamics contribute to pathophysiology of these disorders remains unclear. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a droplet associated protein with a common risk variant (E4) that confers the largest increase in genetic risk for late-onset AD. E4 is associated with both increased neuroinflammation and excess LD accumulation. In the current study, we sought to quantitatively profile the lipid and protein composition of LDs between the neutral E3 and risk variant E4, to gain insight into potential LD-driven contributions to AD pathogenesis. Targeted replacement mice expressing human E3 or E4 were injected with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and after 24 hours, hepatic lipid droplets were isolated for proteomic and lipidomic analyses. Lipidomics revealed a shift in the distribution of glycerophospholipids in E4 LDs with a concomitant increase in phosphatidylcholine species, and overall, the baseline profile of E4 LDs resembled that of the LPS-treated groups. Quantitative proteomics showed that LDs from E4 mice are enriched for proteins involved in protein/vesicle transport but have decreased levels of proteins involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation. Interestingly, proteins associated with LDs showed substantial overlap with previously published lists of AD postmortem tissue and microglia -omics studies, suggesting a potential role for LDs in modulating AD risk or progression. Given this, we exposed primary microglia from the same E3 or E4 mice to exogenous lipid, inflammatory stimulation, necroptotic N2A cells (nN2A), or a combination of treatments to evaluate LD formation and its impact on the cells immune state. Microglia from E4 mice accumulated more LDs in every condition tested, at baseline, and following addition of fatty acids, LPS stimulation, or nN2As. E4 microglia also secreted significantly more cytokines (TNF, IL-1b, IL-10) than E3 microglia in the control, oleic acid, and nN2A treatment conditions, yet showed a blunted response to LPS. In sum, these results suggest that E4 microglia accumulate more LDs compared to E3 microglia and that E4 is associated with a basal LD composition that resembles a pro-inflammatory cell. Together with the high overlap of the LD proteome with established AD-associated datasets, these data further support the idea that alterations in LD dynamics, particularly within microglia, may contribute to the increased risk for AD associated with APOE4.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

To date, almost all megaphages have evaded cultivation, with only phage G being in active culture for over 50 years. We examined with multiomics this five decades long cultivated history from nine different laboratories with five different lab variants to the modern era. In this work, we resolved the five complete phage G genomes, the particle proteome, de novo methylome, and used artificial intelligence (AI) to annotate the genome of phage G. Phage G is one of the largest phages with a size of >0.6 {micro}m, about half the width of the host cell, and a 499 kbp, non-permuted, linear genome that has, uniquely among known phages, two pairs of ends. Its closest known relative is Moose phage W30-1 which was metagenomically assembled without cultivation from a moose rumen sample. Phage G has >650 protein-coding open reading frames (ORFs), with >65% being hypothetical proteins with no known function, with the rest of the genome geared towards nucleic acid replication (e.g., helicases, polymerases, endonucleases) and are structural in nature (e.g., capsid, tail, portal, terminase). The genome encodes a 35 kbp stretch with 66 ORFs without any known functional homology, a cryptic genomic region that is roughly the size of phage lambda. Phage G has an expansive repertoire of auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) acquired from its bacterial host, including a phoH,ftsZ,UvsX/RecA-like, gyrA, gyrB,and DHFR. Furthermore, AMGs discovered in phage G could manipulate host sporulation (sspD, RsfA, spoK) and antiviral escape genes (e.g., anti-CBass nuclease and Anti-Pycsar protein). Phage proteomics found >15% of the protein ORFs were present in either the wild-type or mutant variants of phage G, including genes involved in replication (e.g.,UvsX/RecA-like), host sporulation, as well as structural genes (e.g., capsid, tail, portal). The methylome of phage G was localized to the cryptic region with limited functional homology, with supervised machine learning (i.e., HMMs) was unable to resolve this region, but was resolved with protein structural AI. This cryptic region was a hot spot for methylation at 32%, where many of the functions of the ORF are still unknown. Our study represents a doorway into the complexity of the genomic repertoire of the only cultivated megaphage, highlighting five decades of continuous cultivation for the first time.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

These distortions result in surrogate maps that imperfectly preserve spatial autocorrelation, yielding inflated false positive rates.

An example of an important social association is that between breeding partners - a key social connection in monogamously breeding species. The selection of a breeding partner begins well before reproduction for many species, and this process can have consequences for subsequent reproductive success. Thus, the non-breeding season can shape behaviour during the breeding season. However, it is currently unknown how outcomes in the breeding season can impact associate choice during the non-breeding season, as studying this has been limited due to requiring high volumes of individual social data across both contexts. This study used three years of wild great tit social data from Wytham Woods, Oxford, UK, to examine social associations between pairs classified with respect to prior and future relationship status. We found a distinct behavioural pattern in divorced pairs, which was present from early in the winter, suggesting that the act of divorce occurs soon after the completion of the breeding season. Pairs forming for the first time behaved similarly to divorced pairs earlier in the season, but became similar to faithful pairs throughout the winter. On a finer spatiotemporal scale the behaviour of faithful and divorced birds diverged over the winter. These results provide the first evidence of when divorce occurs in paired great tits, while suggesting that different behaviours may drive behavioural divorce at different times.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

They infect and cause disease in humans, animals and plants but also play crucial roles in the ecology of microbial communities. Tolerance to genetic change, high-mutation rates, adaptations to hosts and immune escape has driven high divergence of viral genes, hampering their functional annotation and phylogenetic inference. The protein structure is more conserved than sequence and can be used for searches of distant homologs and evolutionary analysis of divergent proteins. Structures of viral proteins are traditionally underrepresented in public databases, but recent advances in protein structure prediction allows us to address this issue. Combining two state-of-the-art approaches, AlphaFold2-ColabFold and ESMFold, we predicted models for 85,000 proteins from 4,400 human and animal viruses, expanding the structural coverage for viral proteins by 30 times compared to experimental structures. We also performed structural and network analyses of the models to demonstrate their utility for functional annotation and inference of distant phylogenetic relationships. Taking this approach, we examined the deep evolutionary history of viral class-I fusion glycoproteins, gaining insights on the origins of coronavirus spike protein. To enable further discoveries, we have created Viro3D (https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/), a virus species-centred protein structure database. It allows users to search, browse and download protein models from a virus of interest and explore similar structures present in other virus species. This resource will facilitate fundamental molecular virology, investigation of virus evolution, and may enable structure-informed design of therapies and vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

However, effectively controlling these models to generate novel sequences with desired functions remains a major challenge. Here, we show that Evo, a 7-billion parameter genomic language model, can perform function-guided design that generalizes beyond natural sequences. By learning semantic relationships across multiple genes, Evo enables a genomic ""autocomplete"" in which a DNA prompt encoding a desired function instructs the model to generate novel DNA sequences that can be mined for similar functions. We term this process ""semantic mining,"" which, unlike traditional genome mining, can access a sequence landscape unconstrained by discovered evolutionary innovation. We validate this approach by experimentally testing the activity of generated anti-CRISPR proteins and toxin-antitoxin systems, including de novo genes with no significant homology to any natural protein. Strikingly, in-context protein design with Evo achieves potent activity and high experimental success rates even in the absence of structural hypotheses, known evolutionary conservation, or task-specific fine-tuning. We then use Evo to autocomplete millions of prompts to produce SynGenome, a first-of-its-kind database containing over 120 billion base pairs of AI-generated genomic sequences that enables semantic mining across many possible functions. The semantic mining paradigm enables functional exploration that ventures beyond the observed evolutionary universe.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Despite its clinical success, the mechanism through which daptomycin exerts its antibacterial properties has remained controversial. Much of the debate is focused around daptomycin's ability to depolarise the cytoplasmic membrane, potential formation of large membrane pores, and its more recently discovered capability to inhibit cell wall synthesis and disturb membrane lipid domain organisation through interactions with cell wall precursor lipids. Here we show that, rather than representing different facets of a single underlying activity, daptomycin exhibits two independent antibacterial mechanisms of action: (i) targeting of cell wall precursor lipids that leads to cell wall synthesis inhibition and (ii) membrane depolarisation that does not rely on interactions with cell wall precursor lipids. This dual mechanism of action provides an explanation for the frequently disagreeing findings obtained through in vivo and in vitro studies and explains why resistance development towards daptomycin is slow and multifactorial. In a broader context, this demonstrates that dual mechanism antibiotics can be clinically successful and exhibit favourable characteristics in terms of real-world, clinically relevant resistance development.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Nonlinear Hawkes process models can capture a large range of spiking dynamics, but remain difficult to interpret, due to their discontinuous and stochastic nature. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework based on a piecewise deterministic Markov process representation of the nonlinear Hawkes process (NH-PDMP) followed by a diffusion approximation. We analytically derive stability conditions and dynamical properties of the obtained diffusion processes for single-neuron and network models. We established the accuracy of the diffusion approximation framework by comparing it with exact continuous-time simulations of the original neuronal NH-PDMP models. Our framework offers an analytical and geometric account of the neuronal dynamics repertoire captured by nonlinear Hawkes process models, both for the canonical responses of single-neurons and neuronal-network dynamics, such as winner-take-all and traveling wave phenomena. Applied to human and nonhuman primate recordings of neuronal spiking activity during speech processing and motor tasks, respectively, our approach revealed that task features can be retrieved from the dynamical landscape of the fitted models. The combination of NH-PDMP representations and diffusion approximations thus provides a novel dynamical analysis framework to reveal single-neuron and neuronal-population dynamics directly from models fitted to spiking data.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Specifically, we focused on hyperconnected 3D regulatory hubs and demonstrated that hub-interacting genes exhibit high and coordinated expression at the single-cell level and strong association with oncogenic programs that distinguish IDH-wt glioblastoma patients from low-grade glioma. Epigenetic silencing of a recurrent 3D enhancer hub--with an uncharacterized role in glioblastoma--was sufficient to cause concordant downregulation of multiple hub-connected genes along with significant shifts in transcriptional states and reduced clonogenicity. By integrating published datasets from other cancer types, we also identified both ''universal '' and cancer type-specific 3D regulatory hubs which enrich for varying oncogenic programs and nominate specific factors associated with worse outcomes. Genetic alterations, such as focal duplications, could explain only a small fraction of the detected hyperconnected hubs and their increased activity.

Microbiomes have the capacity to influence their hosts' fitnesses, but the conditions under which such influences contribute to evolution are not clear. This is due in part to a lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework for describing the combined effects of host and associated microbes on phenotypic variation. Here we begin to address this gap by extending the foundations of quantitative genetic theory to include host-associated microbes, as well as alleles of hosts, as factors that explain quantitative host trait variation. We introduce a way to partition host-associated microbiomes into componenents relevant for predicting a microbiome-mediated response to selection. We then apply our general framework to a simulation model of microbiome inheritance to illustrate principles for predicting host trait dynamics, and to generalize classical narrow and broad sense heritabilities to account for microbial effects. We demonstrate that microbiome-mediated responses to host selection can arise from various transmission modes, not solely vertical, with the contribution of non-vertical modes depending on host life history. Our work lays a foundation for integrating microbiome-mediated host variation and adaptation into our understanding of natural variation.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

In Stage 1 of the project, a list of potential trustworthiness checks was created. The checks on this list must be evaluated to determine which should be included in the INSPECT-SR tool.

MethodsWe attempted to apply 72 trustworthiness checks to RCTs in 50 Cochrane Reviews. For each, we recorded whether the check was passed, failed or possibly failed, or whether it was not feasible to complete the check. Following application of the checks, we recorded whether we had concerns about the authenticity of each RCT. We repeated each meta-analysis after removing RCTs flagged by each check, and again after removing RCTs where we had concerns about authenticity, to estimate the impact of trustworthiness assessment. Trustworthiness assessments were compared to Risk of Bias and GRADE assessments in the reviews.

Results95 RCTs were assessed. Following application of the checks, assessors had some or serious concerns about the authenticity of 25% and 6% of the RCTs, respectively. Removing RCTs with either some or serious concerns resulted in 22% of meta-analyses having no remaining RCTs. However, many checks proved difficult to understand or implement, which may have led to unwarranted scepticism in some instances. Furthermore, we restricted assessment to meta-analyses with no more than 5 RCTs, which will distort the impact on results. No relationship was identified between trustworthiness assessment and Risk of Bias or GRADE.

ConclusionsThis study supports the case for routine trustworthiness assessment in systematic reviews, as problematic studies do not appear to be flagged by Risk of Bias assessment. The study produced evidence on the feasibility and impact of trustworthiness checks. These results will be used, in conjunction with those from a subsequent Delphi process, to determine which checks should be included in the INSPECT-SR tool.

Plain language summarySystematic reviews collate evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to find out whether health interventions are safe and effective. However, it is now recognised that the findings of some RCTs are not genuine, and some of these studies appear to have been fabricated. Various checks for these ""problematic"" RCTs have been proposed, but it is necessary to evaluate these checks to find out which are useful and which are feasible. We applied a comprehensive list of ""trustworthiness checks"" to 95 RCTs in 50 systematic reviews to learn more about them, and to see how often performing the checks would lead us to classify RCTs as being potentially inauthentic. We found that applying the checks led to concerns about the authenticity of around 1 in 3 RCTs. However, we found that many of the checks were difficult to perform and could have been misinterpreted. This might have led us to be overly sceptical in some cases. The findings from this study will be used, alongside other evidence, to decide which of these checks should be performed routinely to try to identify problematic RCTs, to stop them from being mistaken for genuine studies and potentially being used to inform healthcare decisions.

This affords the opportunity to reveal molecular principles that govern the pre-implantation stages of mammalian development. We leveraged a multipurpose allele for acute protein depletion and efficient immunoprecipitation to dissect the molecular functions of the chromatin repressor EHMT2, a candidate antagonist of the mESC-to-2CLC transition. This allowed us to define categories of EHMT2 target genes characterized by distinct modes of EHMT2 chromatin engagement and repression. Most notably, EHMT2 directly represses large clusters of co-regulated gene loci that comprise a significant fraction of the 2CLC-specific transcriptome by initiating H3K9me2 spreading from distal LINE-1 elements. EHMT2 counteracts the recruitment of the activator DPPA2/4 to promoter-proximal endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) at 2CLC genes. EHMT2 depletion elevates the expression of ZGA-associated transcripts in 2CLCs and synergizes with spliceosome inhibition and retinoic acid signaling in facilitating the mESC-to-2CLC transition. In contrast to ZGA-associated genes, repression of germ layer-associated transcripts by EHMT2 occurs outside of gene clusters in collaboration with ZFP462 and entails binding to non-repeat enhancers. Our observations show that EHMT2 attenuates the bidirectional differentiation potential of mouse pluripotent stem cells and define molecular modes for locus-specific transcriptional repression by this essential histone methyltransferase.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Condensation can be driven by phase separation of proteins, and involves highly dynamic, multivalent, and weak interactions of their intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Understanding these interactions has been limited by the lack of large-scale experimental methods capable of generating thermodynamic data. Here, we develop and use Condensate Partitioning by mRNA-Display (CPmD) to directly measure the energetics of the partitioning of almost 100,000 peptides of 14 to 40 amino acid length into condensates formed by an IDR, that of the germ granule protein Dead-box helicase 4 (DDX4). This large set of peptides contained many that were derived from DDX4 itself, as well as a tiling library of a significant fraction of all experimentally characterised IDRs. We show that the results of such large scale partitioning studies yield a uniquely quantitative picture of the driving forces that govern IDR condensate formation of DDX4, as well as partitioning of other sequences into its condensates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the derived set of interactions is also able to quantitatively explain condensate formation of unrelated sequences.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Most cases of eukaryote HGT reported to date are inter-domain transfers and only few studies have investigated eukaryote-to-eukaryote HGTs. Furthermore, the extent to which HGT has contributed to the gene repertoire of some lineages such as vertebrates remains unclear. Here, we performed a large-scale survey of HGT among 242 species of ray-finned fishes. We found strong evidence supporting 18 teleost-to-teleost HGT events that involve 17 different genes in 11 teleost fish orders. The genes involved in these transfers show lower synonymous divergence than expected under vertical transmission, their phylogeny is inconsistent with that of teleost fishes, and high nucleotide similarity on these genes between donor and recipient lineages extends to non-coding regions. The distribution of HGT events in the teleost tree is heterogenous, with eight of the 18 transfers occurring between the same two orders (Osmeriformes and Clupeiformes). Besides the previously reported transfer of an antifreeze protein, most transferred genes play roles in immunity, suggesting that such genes are more likely than others to confer strong selective advantage to the recipient species. Overall, our work shows that teleost-to-teleost HGT has occurred on multiple occasions and it will be worth further quantifying these transfers and evaluating their impact on teleost evolution as more genomes are being sequenced.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

However, whether and to what degree L1 activity directly impacts genome integrity is unclear. Here, we apply whole-genome sequencing to experimental models of L1 expression to comprehensively define the spectrum of genomic changes caused by L1. We provide definitive evidence that L1 expression frequently and directly causes both local and long-range chromosomal rearrangements, small and large segmental copy-number alterations, and subclonal copy-number heterogeneity due to ongoing chromosomal instability. Mechanistically, all these alterations arise from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by L1-encoded ORF2p. The processing of ORF2p-generated DSB ends prior to their ligation can produce diverse rearrangements of the target sequences. Ligation between DSB ends generated at distal loci can generate either stable chromosomes or unstable dicentric, acentric, or ring chromosomes that undergo subsequent evolution through breakage-fusion bridge cycles or DNA fragmentation. Together, these findings suggest L1 is a potent mutagenic force capable of driving genome evolution beyond simple insertions.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1734818874642

Although this process involves coordinated interaction between vessels, neurons and glial cells, its dysregulation in neuroinflammation is not well understood. We used in vivo mesoscopic functional ultrasound imaging to monitor cerebral blood volume changes during neuroinflammation in rats injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the visual cortex, under resting-state or visual stimulation, combined to advanced ex vivo techniques for glial cell reactivity analysis. Cortical neuroinflammation induced large oscillatory hemodynamic traveling waves in the frequency band of vasomotion (~0.1 Hz) in both anesthetized and awake rats. Vasomotor waves traveled through large distances between adjacent penetrating vessels, spanning the entire cortex thickness, and even extending to subcortical areas. Moreover, vasomotion amplitude correlated with microglial morphology changes and was significantly reduced by astrocytic toxins, suggesting that both microglia and astrocytes are involved in the enhancement of vasomotion during neuroinflammation. Notably, functional connectivity was increased under this oscillatory state and functional hyperemia was exacerbated. These findings reveal new spatiotemporal properties and cellular mechanisms of cerebral vasomotion, and suggest that this is a major component of brain hemodynamics in pathological states. Moreover, reactive microglia and astrocytes are participating to increased vasomotion during neuroinflammation. These results call for a reassessment of vasomotion and traveling waves as primary phenomena when imaging brain hemodynamic activity, particularly in conditions associated with neuroinflammation.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

This study aims to explore how pesticide exposure disrupts key brain regions involved in Parkinson's disease pathology by reshaping gene regulatory landscapes. Using the well-established rotenone rat model of the disease, we performed H3K27ac ChIP-sequencing to profile active regulatory elements in the substantia nigra and cortex. In this model, rotenone distributes uniformly throughout the brain, and the degree of complex I inhibition is equivalent in cortical and substantia nigra neurons. Despite the uniformity of complex I inhibition, we identified widespread epigenomic differences, with brain region specific acetylation patterns associated with rotenone exposure. We showed consistent changes in transcriptomic activity by RNA-sequencing. Our results indicate there is a strong immune response to rotenone localised to the substantia nigra and highlight an enrichment of immune-related motifs in this brain region, suggesting that the immune response is at least partially driven by gene regulatory mechanisms. We also noted an increase in C1q complement pathway activity in the substantia nigra. In contrast, we identified widespread dysregulation of synaptic function at the gene regulatory level in the cortex of these same rats. Our results highlight a role for gene regulatory mechanisms potentially mediating the effects of pesticide exposure, driving region-specific functional responses in the brain that may contribute to the pathology and selective vulnerability that characterise Parkinson's disease.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Currently known phage counter-defense systems are specific to (the activity of) the targeted bacterial defense system. Here, we uncover a mechanism by which the T7 bacteriophage broadly counteracts bacterial defenses using protein phosphorylation. We show that the T7 protein kinase (T7K), which was believed to specifically redirect the function of a few host proteins, is in fact a hyper-promiscuous, dual-specificity kinase enacting a massive wave of phosphorylation on virtually all host and phage proteins during infection. The scale of phosphorylation vastly exceeds the number of previously known phosphorylation events in E. coli, has no sequence motif specificity, and results in a higher proteome-wide phosphorylation density than that of mammalian cells which encode ~ 500 kinases. Stoichiometry analysis of phosphorylation sites revealed a strong bias of T7K activity towards nucleic acid-binding substrates, which we show is mediated by its C-terminal DNA-binding domain. This specificity for highly stoichiometric phosphorylation of nucleic acid-binding proteins enables the deactivation of DNA-targeting or -containing bacterial defense systems. We provide mechanistic insight into how T7K weakens two such defense systems, Retron-Eco9 and DarTG1, through specific phosphorylation events, with single phosphomimetic mutations in key sites of the toxins abolishing defense. Finally, by screening a large collection of E. coli strains, we provide evidence of broad counter-defense capacities for T7K in nature, as strains counteracted contain diverse bacterial defense systems.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

However, in 2021, Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face challenges regarding supply of COVID-19 vaccines. Indonesia, as a public sector vaccine manufacturing in developing countries was developed COVID-19 vaccine using a platform based on recombinant subunit proteins, a Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 formulated with combination of Alhydrogel and CpG Oligodeoxynucleotides 1018 (CpG). In this study, we report the preclinical study including immunogenicity, toxicity and efficacy of vaccine in animal models. The vaccine immunogenicity tested in mice and non-human primates, the toxicity was done in rodents and non-rodents and challenged study and efficacy was done in non-human primates (NHPs) model. The animal model was vaccinated intramuscularly (IM). The serology result in mice and non-human primates showed significant antibody titers and neutralizing antibody responses compared to the RBD formulations adjuvanted with Alhydrogel only. Safety study in Wistar rats and New Zealand rabbits for single-dose (acute toxicity) and repeated-dose (sub-chronic toxicity) showed no abnormalities in the animals organs and behaviors and no deaths were reported in tested animals. Two doses of vaccination have been shown to protect NHPs against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as detected by drastic viral reduction from sample swab in nasal, anal, trachea and nasal wash in 7 days after virus challenged, also viral load measurement from lung and BAL tissue showed negative result, which gave better result than negative control and control vaccine group.

Here, we employ whole-brain functional imaging at cellular resolution in larval zebrafish, combined with anatomical and spatial genetic expression profile databases, to investigate the structural and genetic basis of functional brain networks. We show that mesoscopic functional connectivity (FC) is a robust measure of brain activity that captures the individuality of larvae. Using a public dataset of thousands of single-neuron reconstructions, we reveal a strong coupling between FC and structural connectivity (SC). Numerous properties of the connectome that account for indirect pathways and diffusion mechanisms individually and collectively predict interregional correlations. The hierarchical modular structure of SC and FC significantly overlaps in space, and modules identified within the connectome constrain the shape of both spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity patterns. Using visual stimuli and tail monitoring, we identify a functional network gradient that maps onto the sensorimotor function of brain regions. Finally, we identify a set of genes whose co-expression in brain regions significantly predicts regional FC.

The anatomy, as well as alterations in neurological diseases such as epilepsy, suggest that chandelier cells exert an important inhibitory control on action potential initiation. However, their functional role remains unclear, including whether their effect is indeed inhibitory or excitatory. One reason is that there is a relative gap in electrophysiological theory about the electrical effect of axo-axonic synapses. This contribution uses resistive coupling theory, a simplification of cable theory based on the observation that the small initial segment is resistively coupled to the large cell body acting as a current sink, to fill this gap. The main theoretical finding is that a synaptic input at the proximal axon shifts the action potential threshold by an amount equal to the product of synaptic conductance, driving force at threshold, and axial axonal resistance between the soma and either the synapse or of the middle of the initial segment, whichever is closer.

Protein design has been harnessed to generate pore-containing transmembrane proteins, but the capability to design ion selectivity based on the interactions between ions and selectivity filter residues, a crucial feature of native ion channels, has been constrained by the lack of methods to place the metal-coordinating residues with atomic-level precision. Here we describe a bottom-up RFdiffusion-based approach to construct Ca2+ channels from defined selectivity filter residue geometries, and use this approach to design symmetric oligomeric channels with Ca2+ selectivity filters having different coordination numbers and different geometries at the entrance of a wide pore buttressed by multiple transmembrane helices. The designed channel proteins assemble into homogenous pore-containing particles, and for both tetrameric and hexameric ion-coordinating configurations, patch-clamp experiments show that the designed channels have higher conductances for Ca2+ than for Na+ and other divalent ions (Sr2+ and Mg2+). Cryo-electron microscopy indicates that the design method has high accuracy: the structure of the hexameric Ca2+ channel is nearly identical to the design model. Our bottom-up design approach now enables the testing of hypotheses relating filter geometry to ion selectivity by direct construction, and provides a roadmap for creating selective ion channels for a wide range of applications.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) isolate genes and their regulatory elements within the same topological neighborhood, avoiding crosstalk between regulatory elements. Perturbation of domain boundaries causes aberrant genomic contacts and gene expression misregulation. Architectural proteins such as CTCF and the cohesin complex are critical to form boundaries. However, we still lack a complete understanding of what makes a boundary more effective at insulating genomic contacts than others. To understand how domains are structured, we experimentally classified boundaries according to their chromatin accessibility as a proxy of protein occupancy in K562 human cells. We found that highly accessible boundaries are occupied by more proteins, are more robust contact insulators, have a more conserved CTCF DNA-binding motif and are more conserved across cell types in contrast to less accessible ones. By exploring the proteins enriched at boundaries with different accessibility, we found that CTCF and cohesin, together with REST, form a module, and ZFN316, together with EMSY, form another module, and both modules occupy boundaries very frequently. Finally, by using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genetic edition of ZNF316 DNA-binding motif at a robust domain boundary, we demonstrate that ZNF316 can block chromatin contacts in the absence of CTCF. Our results emphasize the importance of protein combination and abundance to support boundary strength and propose ZNF316 as a novel architectural protein.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

A WGD occurred in an ancestor of arachnopulmonates (spiders, scorpions, and their relatives), which provides an important independent comparison to WGDs in other animals like vertebrates and horseshoe crabs. After WGD, arachnopulmonates retained many duplicated copies (ohnologues) of key developmental genes including the clusters of homeobox genes many of which have been inferred to have undergone subfunctionalisation. However, there has been little systematic analyses of gene regulatory sequences and comparison of the expression of ohnologues versus their single-copy orthologues between arachnids. Here we compared the regions of accessible chromatin and gene expression of ohnologues and single-copy genes during three specified embryonic stages between an arachnopulmonate arachnid, the spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum and a non-arachnopulmonate arachnid, the harvestman Phalangium opilio. We found that the expression of each spider ohnologue was lower than their single-copy orthologues in the harvestman providing further evidence for subfunctionalisation. However, this was not reflected in a reduction in peaks of accessible chromatin because both spider ohnologues and single-copy genes had more peaks than the harvestman genes. We also found peaks of open chromatin that increased in the late stage associated with activation of genes expressed later during embryogenesis in both species. Taken together, our study provides the first genome-wide comparison of gene regulatory sequences and gene expression in an arachnopulmonate and a non-arachnopulmonate and thus provides new insights into the impact of the arachnopulmonate WGD.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

However, quantifying the flexibility of surface-tethered biomolecules in aqueous environments has been difficult due to a lack of experimental tools. Here we introduce SurFlex microscopy, a method based on fluorescence anisotropy that exploits the relationship between the conformational dynamics of a tethered molecule and the rotational diffusion of an attached fluorophore to extract information about molecular flexibility. By analyzing the polarization state of photons emitted after polarized excitation, we quantify apparent molecular flexibilities that include effects of tethering, self-interactions and buffer conditions. We first demonstrate the capabilities of SurFlex microscopy by measuring the flexibility of bilayer-tethered single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of different lengths and nucleotide sequences. We find that sequence significantly impacts ssDNA flexibility, consistent with theoretical estimates, with weak intramolecular interactions in random sequences leading to higher apparent stiffness. Interestingly, we show that a pathological DNA sequence linked to Huntingtons disease exhibits unusual flexibility despite intramolecular interactions. We next extend SurFlex microscopy to live cells by measuring surface glycoprotein flexibility on red blood cells using fluorescent lectins. We show that trypsinization decreases glycan fluctuations, demonstrating that modifications to the cell surface can alter the flexibility of remaining surface molecules. SurFlex microscopy provides a new tool for quantifying molecular flexibility that can be used to study the role of tethered surface molecules in fundamental biological processes.

Significance statementBiomolecules immobilized on one end play crucial roles in diverse cellular processes, from cell-cell signaling through surface receptors to the formation of DNA secondary structures. However, measuring biomolecular flexibility on surfaces has remained challenging. Here we present SurFlex microscopy, a technique that uses fluorescence anisotropy to quantify the flexibility of surface-anchored molecules. By analyzing the rotational dynamics of fluorophores attached to the ends of fluctuating biomolecules, SurFlex microscopy can be used to quantify persistence length. We demonstrate its capabilities by measuring sequence-dependent flexibility of DNA and crowding-dependent changes in glycan flexibility on native cell surfaces. This method opens new avenues for understanding how biomolecular flexibility influences key biological processes, such as those at cell surfaces during cell-cell contact formation and subsequent signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Accurate data integration is essential to distinguish cell types with sufficient granularity, thereby reflecting true biological patterns, and to create reliable reference datasets for the community. In this context, the latest version of Seurat (v5) introduced a multi-layered object structure to facilitate the integration of scRNA-seq datasets in a unified manner.

However, xenografts relying solely on cancer cells are ineffective for optimal tumor tissue formation. Additionally, tumor modeling using hydrogels with cancer cells to promote vascularization often leaves behind residual biomaterials that inhibit integration with surrounding tissues. To address these issues, we utilized a straightforward in vivo vascularized tumor modeling method with a completely degradable, crosslinker-free carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCTS)/oxidized hyaluronic acid (OHA) hydrogel that encapsulates high-density human cancer cells for in situ injection. The CMCTS/oHA hydrogel was fully degraded within 3 weeks, enabling three-dimensional (3D) cell condensation in vitro. 2 weeks after subcutaneous injection in mice, solid tumors formed, with native host vasculature infiltrating the transplanted human cancer cells, confirming spontaneous hydrogel degradation. Following this, human macrophages were administered via tail vein injection, enhancing the accumulation of mouse immune cells in the humanized tumor twofold and showing murine macrophages adjacent to the vasculature. This study thus provides proof-of-concept for a facile and fully vascularized humanized tumor model in mice for validating immune cell therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

This includes representing geographic ranges using binary presence-absence data, classifying statistical significance into categories, and quantifying biogeographic gradients into discrete regions.

The study compared the reliability of single pulse TMS, short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) protocols to evaluate TEP consistency in these regions. Methods: Seventeen healthy participants underwent two TMS EEG sessions spaced by at least one week, with targets for DLPFC and angular gyrus identified using resting-state functional connectivity (RS) and Neurosynth based functional overlays. Motor cortex was targeted using resting motor threshold (RMT). Early TEPs were quantified as peak-to-peak amplitude. Test retest reliability of early TEPs was calculated using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) for each region and protocol. Results: M1 demonstrated the highest TEP reliability (CCCmean = 0.59), while DLPFC (CCCmean = 0.40) and angular gyrus (CCCmean = 0.45) showed lower reliability, particularly for anterior DLPFC targets. Neurosynth-based DLPFC targets exhibited slightly higher CCC values (mean CCC = 0.57) compared to RS-based targets (mean CCC = 0.30), but the difference was not statistically significant. No significant differences in reliability were found across single pulse and paired pulse protocols. Lateral targets, DLPFC and angular gyrus, showed lower reliability in comparison to motor cortex which might have been caused by muscle artifacts. Conclusion: While individualized functional targeting methods provide advantages in engaging specific brain networks, their reliability for TEP measurements remains lower than the RMT-based approach for motor cortex. Future studies should integrate neuroimaging-based targeting with real time TEP monitoring to enhance reliability in non-motor regions. This approach could enhance the precision of TMS EEG protocols, especially for clinical applications targeting cortical regions like the DLPFC and angular gyrus.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Cereal aphids are small sap-feeding insects that infest cereals and vector devastating cereal pathogens, principally the yellow dwarf viruses, with severe infection reducing yields by 20-80%. Currently, farmers are advised to apply insecticide if a single cereal aphid is found within the crop. However, this is an oversimplification of the biology and ecology of the vector-virus system: Each aphid species can transmit a range of yellow dwarf virus species with variable efficiency, and intra-species diversity within a vector species (genotype) can influence this further. Accounting for this variation in decision-making processes has the potential to help with developing bespoke management options based on the composition of the local vector-virus population, and represents a novel avenue that could be explored to develop more sustainable management strategies. Here we describe a stage-structured model that can estimate vector dispersal and disease spread. We use data for the two main cereal aphid species and the two yellow dwarf virus species of greatest concern in Europe to examine how diversity at each level of the vector-virus system impacts disease spread. More broadly, our modelling framework represents a tool that can be used to explore vector-virus-host interactions in greater detail, and we use cereal systems as a case study. Our modelling scenarios highlight diversity at each scale as an important factor. We show that the two main vector species have contrasting dispersal patterns, and that this interacts with virus transmission efficacy to influence disease spread; genetic variation within a vector population is a key driver behind disease spread and disease risk; and for vector species that transmit multiple virus species, the specific vector-virus species combination is a key risk factor to consider.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

However, stable circuit function and consistent expression of key inducible proteins are crucial for effective reprogramming, and DNA methylation-induced silencing hinders this stability. To address this issue, A2-ubiquitous chromatin opening elements (A2UCOE) have gained attention for their ability to maintain open chromatin and prevent methylation, thereby stabilizing gene expression. In this study, we aimed to forward program iPSCs into thymic epithelial cells (TECs) using a compact, all-in-one gene circuit composed of a doxycycline-inducible Tet-On system, 863-bp A2UCOE (0.9 UCOE), and FOXN1, a master transcription factor for TEC differentiation. This compact construct enables site-specific genome integration and stable inducible expression within iPSCs for renewably generating TECs. While the 0.9 UCOE promoted stable expression of constitutively expressed genes, it also caused unintended FOXN1 gene leakage, leading to unprogrammed gradual differentiation of the iPSCs. We generated A2UCOE fragments of varying lengths and found that gene leakage persisted regardless of fragment size. We tested spacer sequences between the A2UCOE and the Tet-On promoter consisting of varying AT-nucleotide content (35, 50, and 65%) and the 65% AT-rich SV40 poly-A terminator sequence and found that only the SV40 poly-A mitigated this leakage, and surprisingly, enhanced desired anti-silencing effects. These findings highlight the benefits and potential risks of using A2UCOE in iPSCs, and provides insights into a regulatory DNA architecture optimal for compact forward programming circuits for controlled iPSC differentiation.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Phosphate is particularly problematic, as it represents a globally limited resource, and its runoff and soil erosion threaten open water bodies. Many crops engage in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis with nutrient-acquiring fungi, aiding in the uptake of phosphate and other mineral nutrients. However, AM colonization is strongly reduced under high soil phosphate levels. A mechanistic understanding of phosphate sensing, phosphate starvation responses, and their connection to AM remains enigmatic. Here, we show that in Lotus japonicus, low-abundant, energy-rich inositol pyrophosphates act as master regulators of AM, orchestrating the crosstalk between phosphate starvation responses and plant root endosymbiosis. These findings hold promise for breeding nutrient-efficient crops.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

One major obstacle is that distinct pathologies may currently be diagnosed as the same disease and prescribed the same treatments. The key to developing antidepressants with ubiquitous efficacy is to first identify a strategy to differentiate between heterogeneous conditions. Major depression is characterized by hallmark features such as anhedonia and a loss of motivation, and it has been recognized that even among inbred mice raised under identical housing conditions, we observe heterogeneity in their susceptibility and resilience to stress. Anhedonia, a condition identified in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, is described as the inability to experience pleasure and is linked to anomalous medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity. The mPFC is responsible for higher order functions, such as valence encoding; however, it remains unknown how mPFC valence-specific neuronal population activity is affected during anhedonic conditions. To test this, we implemented the unpredictable chronic mild stress (CMS) protocol in mice and examined hedonic behaviors following stress and ketamine treatment. We used unsupervised clustering to delineate individual variability in hedonic behavior in response to stress. We then performed in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging to longitudinally track mPFC valence-specific neuronal population dynamics during a Pavlovian discrimination task. Chronic mild stress mice exhibited a blunted effect in the ratio of mPFC neural population responses to rewards relative to punishments after stress that rebounds following ketamine treatment. Also, a linear classifier revealed that we can decode susceptibility to chronic mild stress based on mPFC valence-encoding properties prior to stress-exposure and behavioral expression of susceptibility. Lastly, we utilized markerless pose tracking computer vision tools to predict whether a mouse would become resilient or susceptible based on facial expressions during a Pavlovian discrimination task. These results indicate that mPFC valence encoding properties and behavior are predictive of anhedonic states. Altogether, these experiments point to the need for increased granularity in the measurement of both behavior and neural activity, as these factors can predict the predisposition to stress-induced anhedonia.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

From the first COVID-19 case detected through March 25, 2022, 66,684 of 196,652 residents of Californias state prison system were infected, most of them in two large winter waves of outbreaks that reached all 35 of the state prisons. We used individual-level data on disease timing and nightly room assignments in these prisons to reconstruct locations and pathways of transmission statistically, and from that estimated reproduction numbers, locations of unobserved infection events, and the subsequent magnitude and distribution of long COVID prevalence. Where earlier work has recommended smaller cells over large dormitory housing to reduce transmission, recommended use of cells with solid doors over those with bars only, and cautioned against reliance on solid doors (e.g., in cold months when HVAC systems can circulate aerosols), we found evidence of substantial transmission in both dorms and cells regardless of the door and season. Effective reproduction numbers were found to range largely between 0 and 5, in both cells and dorms of all door types. Our estimates of excess case rates suggest that as a result of disparities in incarceration, prison outbreaks contributed to disproportionate disease burden on Black and Indigenous people in California. We estimated that 9,100-11,000 people have developed long COVID as a result of infection in these prison outbreaks, 1,700-2,000 of them with disabling consequences, and that this burden is disproportionately on Black and Indigenous people in comparison to the state as a whole. We urge high-quality medical care for prison residents affected by long COVID, and decarceration to reduce the risk of future outbreaks of both COVID-19 and other diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1734818874642

In this study, we evaluated the impact of the morphogenic regulator GRF-GIF on plant regeneration and genome editing outcomes in tomato. We demonstrate that expressing a tomato GRF-GIF chimera reliably accelerates the onset of shoot regeneration from callus tissue culture by approximately one month and nearly doubles the number of recovered transgenic plants. Consequently, the GRF-GIF chimera enables the recovery of a broader range of edited haplotypes and simplifies the isolation of mutants harboring heritable edits, but without markedly interfering with plant growth and development. Based on these findings, we outline strategies that employ basic or advanced diagnostic pipelines for efficient isolation of single and higher-order mutants in tomato. Our work represents a technical advantage for tomato transformation and genome editing, with potential applications across other Solanaceae species.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Diabetes increases the oxidative status of lipoproteins in nearly all tissues, including muscle tissues, but the role of lipid ROS on diabetes-induced muscle atrophy is not fully understood. Deuterium reinforced polyunsaturated fatty acids (D-PUFA) are more resistant to ROS-initiated chain reaction of lipid peroxidation than regular hydrogenated PUFA (H-PUFA). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that D-PUFA would protect muscle atrophy induced by diabetes driven by an accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH). C57BL/6J mice were dosed with H-PUFA or D-PUFA for four weeks through dietary supplementation and then injected with streptozotocin (STZ) to induce insulin-deficient diabetes. After two weeks, muscles tissues were analyzed for individual muscle mass, force generating capacity and cross-sectional area. Skeletal muscle fibers from diabetic mice exhibited increased total ROS and LOOH. This was abolished by the D-PUFA supplementation regardless of accumulated iron. D-PUFA were found to be protective against muscle atrophy and weakness from STZ-induced diabetes. Prevention of muscle atrophy and weakness by D-PUFA might be independent of ACSL4/LPCAT3/15-LOX pathway. These findings provide novel insights into the role of LOOH in the mechanistic link between oxidative stress and diabetic myopathy and suggest a novel therapeutic approach to diabetes-associated muscle weakness.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

The emergence of new variants has increased the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect species that were not susceptible to the original SARS-CoV-2, such as mice and rats. This work attempted to evaluate the role of urban rats in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission by combining surveillance studies of rat populations in urban environments, in vivo experimental inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 and comparative viral-receptor interaction in silico analyses. We studied the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in wild Rattus norvegicus (n=401) captured in urban areas and sewage systems of several French cities. Except for 3 inconclusive samples (2/75 from Bordeaux and 1/261 from Lyon) none of the 353 sera tested showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by microsphere immunoassay. However, the 3 inconclusive sera samples were negative by virus neutralisation assay. No SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in all lungs collected from the 401 captured urban brown rats. In complement, four rat groups (two wild-type colonies, Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus, and two laboratory strains, Sprague-Dawley and Wistar) were inoculated with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5. At 4 days post-inoculation, no infectious viral particles were detected in the lungs and upper respiratory tract (URT) while viral RNA was detected at a low level only in the URT of all groups. In addition, seroconversion was observed 14 days after inoculation in the four groups. By molecular modelling, the Omicron BA.5 receptor binding domain (RBD) had lower affinities for Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus ACE2 than Homo sapiens ACE2. Based on these results the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 was unable to infect laboratory and wild type rats. In addition, Rattus norvegicus collected for this study in different areas of France were not infected with SARS-CoV-2.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

By screening 10 million eukaryotic proteins, we identified several domains that define multi-copy gene families and frequently co-occur with TE/viral domains. Among these, a Tc1/Mariner transposase helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain was captured by F-box genes in the Caenorhabditis genus, creating a new class of F-box genes. For specific members of this class, like fbxa-215, we found that the HTH domain is required for diverse processes including germ granule localisation, fertility, and thermotolerance. Furthermore, we provide evidence that HSF-1 mediates the transcriptional integration of fbxa-215 into the heat-shock response by binding to Helitron TEs directly upstream of the fbxa-215 locus. The interactome of HTH-bearing F-box factors suggests roles in post-translational regulation and proteostasis, consistent with established functions of F-box proteins. Based on AlphaFold2 multimer proteome-wide screens, we propose that the HTH domain may diversify the repertoire of protein substrates that F-box factors regulate post-translationally. We further demonstrate that F-box genes repeatedly and independently captured TE domains throughout eukaryotic evolution, and describe an additional instance in zebrafish. In conclusion, we identify recurrent TE domain captures by F-box genes in eukaryotes and provide insights into how these novel proteins are integrated within host gene regulatory networks.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Theory suggests the evolution of differentiation between life stages is facilitated by the expression of different genes at different points throughout ontogeny, which alleviates pleiotropic evolutionary constraints. Therefore, ascertaining what contributes to specialized patterns of gene expression across ontogeny is fundamental to understanding the evolution of ontogenetic complexity. Expression divergence between duplicate genes and gene organization on chromosomes have been identified as important features of relatively complex ontogenies. Therefore, one could predict that their link to transcriptional specialization across ontogeny may be weaker in relatively simpler life cycles. Here, we investigated the links between gene duplication, gene organization, and stage-specific patterns of expression across the relatively simple Caenorhabditis elegans life cycle. We found that signatures of stage-biased chromosomal regions were weaker in C. elegans than what has been previously described in organisms with more complex ontogenies. Furthermore, we found the extent that duplicate genes varied in ontogenetic expression pattern was more constrained in C. elegans. Overall, our findings add to a body of evidence that suggests a link between gene duplication and gene organization and the evolution of complex ontogenies.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

As such early identification of emerging bacterial strains capable of rapidly evolving AMR is key. Although antimicrobial tolerance and persistence are precursor phenotypes for AMR, little evidence exists to support their importance in real-world settings. Here we used bacterial genome wide association on national genomic surveillance data of the diarrhoeal pathogen Shigella sonnei (n=3745) to agnostically identify common genetic signatures among lineages convergently evolving toward AMR (n=15). This revealed an association of an AMR trajectory with a multi- and highly variable second copy of metG, borne by a phage-plasmid we called pWPMR2. Further analyses revealed that pWPMR2 was present across clinically relevant enteric pathogens globally, including past and contemporary outbreaks, and that the additional-metG mechanism was present across multiple bacterial phyla. Functional microbiology, experimental evolution, and single-cell physiology studies confirmed that the expression of auxiliary metG, particularly the mutated version on pWPMR2, created a sub population of persister cells predisposed to survival in, and evolving resistance against, third generation cephalosporins. Thus, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of auxiliary metG carriage that predisposes bacteria to AMR with real world impacts. Furthermore, our approach is a timely example of using genomic epidemiology to rapidly guide functional microbiology studies in the era of routine genomic surveillance, and also highlights several deficiencies in current AMR surveillance practices.","NA","medrxiv",1734818874642

Mormon Fritillary butterflies (Speyeria mormonia) exhibit a striking wing color polymorphism throughout their range: typical morphs bear silver spots on their ventral surfaces, and can co-occur with unsilvered morphs displaying a dull coloration1. Through genome-wide association studies in two polymorphic populations, we fine-map this difference in silvering to the 3 region of the transcription factor gene optix. The expression of optix is confined to the unsilvered regions that surround the spots, and these patterns are transformed to a silver identity upon optix RNAi knockdown, implicating optix as a repressor of silver scales in this butterfly. We show that the unsilvered optix haplotype shows signatures of recent selective sweeps, and that this allele is shared with the monomorphic, unsilvered species Speyeria hydaspe, suggesting that introgressions facilitate the exchange of variants of adaptive potential across species. Remarkably, these findings parallel the role of introgressions and cis-regulatory modulation of optix in shaping the aposematic red patterns of Heliconius butterflies2-7, a lineage that separated from Speyeria 45 million years ago8. The genetic basis of adaptive variation can thus be more predictable than often presumed, even for traits that appear divergent across large evolutionary distances.

However, most existing genetic studies have been based on short-read sequencing methods, which capture fewer than half of the SVs present in any one individual. Long-read sequencing (LRS) enhances our ability to detect disease-associated and functionally relevant structural variants (SVs); however, its application in large-scale genomic studies has been limited by challenges in sample preparation and high costs. Here, we leverage a new scalable wet-lab protocol and computational pipeline for whole-genome Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing and apply it to neurologically normal control samples from the North American Brain Expression Consortium (NABEC) (European ancestry) and Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC) (African or African admixed ancestry) cohorts. Through this work, we present a publicly available long-read resource from 351 human brain samples (median N50: 27 Kbp and at an average depth of [~]40x genome coverage). We discover approximately 234,905 SVs and produce locally phased assemblies that cover 95% of all protein-coding genes in GRCh38. Utilizing matched expression datasets for these samples, we apply quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses and identify SVs that impact gene expression in post-mortem frontal cortex brain tissue. Further, we determine haplotype- specific methylation signatures at millions of CpGs and, with this data, identify cis-acting SVs. In summary, these results highlight that large-scale LRS can identify complex regulatory mechanisms in the brain that were inaccessible using previous approaches. We believe this new resource provides a critical step toward understanding the biological effects of genetic variation in the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

The whooping crane (Grus americana) experienced severe population declines in the 18th century, culminating into a collapse to 16 individuals in 1941. Legal protections and conservation actions have since increased the population to approximately 840 individuals, yet the impact on genomic diversity remains unclear. We analysed the temporal dynamics of genomic erosion by sequencing a high-quality genome reference, and re-sequencing 16 historical and 37 modern genomes, including wild individuals and four generations of captive-bred individuals. Genomic demographic reconstructions reveal a steady decline, accelerating over the past 300 years with the European settlement of North America. Temporal genomic analyses show that despite demographic recovery, the species has lost 70% of its genetic diversity and has increased their inbreeding. Although the modern population bottleneck reduced the ancestral genetic load, modern populations possess more realized load than masked load, possibly resulting in a chronic loss of fitness. Integrating pedigree and genomic data, we underscore the role of breeding management in reducing recent inbreeding. Yet ongoing heterozygosity loss, load accumulation, and background inbreeding argues against the species downlisting from their current Endangered status on the IUCN Red List and the Endangered Species Act. The presence of private genetic variation in wild and captive populations suggests that wild-captive crosses could enhance genetic diversity and reduce the realized load. Our findings emphasize the role of genomics in informing conservation management and policy.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

However, the high cost of NA fluorometers presents a barrier to eDNA sequencing in resource limited settings (RLSs). For instance, at ~$1.5-3.3k USD, current NA fluorometers present a greater capital cost than ONT's $1k USD portable MinION third-generation Nanopore sequencing platform. The collapse of international scientific device and consumable supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic also highlighted the need for distributed manufacturing of molecular research tools to mitigate the impact of increased pricing to RLSs. To address these challenges, we have developed the ""DIYNAFLUOR"" (DIY Nucleic Acid FLUORometer), a portable, open-source, <$40 USD NA fluorometer, designed using readily available off-the-shelf components, simple 3D-printed parts, and plug-and-play, solder-free assembly. The DIYNAFLUOR was primarily designed to be compatible with the popular DNA-centric Qubit High Sensitivity (HS) and Broad Range (BR) assay kits. Notably, the DIYNAFLUOR demonstrated an 'in-assay' Limit of Detection with the Qubit HS kit of 0.0028 ng/uL, and an average absolute bias of 0.018 ng/muL across a 0-10 ng/uL working range using a 2-point linear calibration methodology. Device verification was performed by comparative measurements with a Qubit 4 fluorometer in a busy biotechnology laboratory, and build instructions were validated through assembly and qualification of three DIYNAFLUOR devices by researchers outside the primary design team. We also describe a custom ""extreme"" low-cost assay, < 13 cent USD per-measurement, that uses SYBR Safe dye to quantify DNA across a working range of 0-0.5 ng/uL. This assay reports a lower sensitivity and accuracy than commercial kits but may be of use to RLSs in times of extreme resource constraints or as a teaching tool for STEM educators. To demonstrate its practical application for field-based eDNA analysis in RLSs, the DIYNAFLUOR was used to perform all quality control measurements throughout the preparation of a 16S and 18S metabarcoding library generated from eDNA extracted from Australian lake water, leading to the successful identification of Australian fauna via Nanopore sequencing.

Here, we developed a preclinical LUAD mouse model and demonstrated that targeted oncogenic KRAS degradation induces rapid tumor regression. Transcriptional, histological, and immunophenotypic analyses revealed a substantial remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Notably, disease relapse observed during long-term degrader treatment stems from proteolysis machinery dysregulation, indicating resistance mechanisms distinct from those reported upon KRAS inhibition.

Although these methods are conceptually similar, we show by analyzing association studies of 209 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank that they systematically prioritize different genes. This raises the question of how genes should ideally be prioritized. We propose two prioritization criteria: 1) trait importance -- how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and 2) trait specificity -- a genes importance for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, while burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, while burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation. Our results illustrate that burden tests and GWAS reveal different aspects of trait biology and suggest ways to improve their interpretation and usage.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

One of the features of embryo models is their multilineage differentiation, which allows the co-development of, and interactions between, tissues. Here, we utilise a human Trunk-like Structure (hTLS) model to explore trunk development. We show that hTLS have morphologically organised somites and a neural tube that form through self-organised, endogenous signalling including anteroposterior FGF, Wnt and Retinoic Acid (RA) gradients that modulate the fate of neuromesodermal progenitors. Comparison to an existing dataset from organogenesis-stage human embryos shows that hTLS cells approximate Carnegie Stage 13-14 (28-35 days post-fertilisation). The absence of a notochord leads to a dorsal identity, but exogenous exposure to smoothened agonist (promoting Sonic Hedgehog signalling) progressively ventralises both somites and neural tube in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we identify endogenous signalling from the neural tube to the somites, which leads to medially localised ALDH1A2, and subsequent RA signalling from the somites to the neural tube, which leads to spontaneous neural progenitor patterning and PAX6 expression. Together, our data highlight the value of modularity in embryo models which we leverage to explore human trunk co-development.

However, it is not known how this translates to host-pathogen interactions which share a different evolutionary relationship. Here, we analyse the structural protein-protein interaction network between ten different pathogens and their human host. We predict the structure of 9452 human-pathogen interactions of which only 10 have known structure. We find that we can model 30 interactions with an expected TM-score of [&ge;]0.9, expanding the structural knowledge in these networks three-fold. We select the highly-scoring Francisella tularensis dihydroprolyl dehydrogenase (IPD) complex with human immunoglobulin Kappa constant (IGKC) for detailed analysis with homology modeling and native mass spectrometry. Our results confirm the predicted 1:2:1 heterotetrameric complex with potential implications for bacterial immune response evasion. We are entering a new era where structure prediction can be used to guide vaccine and drug development towards new pathogenic targets in very short time frames.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

However, unraveling the intertwined relationships between enzymes and their catalytic reactions remains a significant challenge. Here, we present EnzymeCAGE, a catalytic-specific geometric foundation model trained on approximately 1 million structure-informed enzyme-reaction pairs, spanning over 2,000 species and encompassing an extensive diversity of genomic and metabolic information. EnzymeCAGE features a geometry-aware multi-modal architecture coupled with an evolutionary information integration module, enabling it to effectively model the nuanced relationships between enzyme structure, catalytic function, and reaction specificity. EnzymeCAGE supports both experimental and predicted enzyme structures and is applicable across diverse enzyme families, accommodating a broad range of metabolites and reaction types. Extensive evaluations demonstrate EnzymeCAGE's state-of-the-art performance in enzyme function prediction, reaction de-orphaning, catalytic site identification, and biosynthetic pathway reconstruction.

The response changes induced by adaptation have been characterized in detail in individual neurons and at the population level after averaging across trials. However, it is not clear how adaptation modifies the aspects of the representations that relate more directly to the ability to perceive stimuli, such as their geometry and the noise structure in individual trials. To address this question, we recorded from a population of neurons in the mouse visual cortex and presented one stimulus (an oriented grating) more frequently than the others. We then analyzed these data in terms of representational geometry and studied the ability of a linear decoder to discriminate between similar visual stimuli based on the single-trial population responses. Surprisingly, the discriminability of stimuli near the adaptor increased, even though the responses of individual neurons to these stimuli decreased. Similar changes were observed in artificial neural networks trained to reconstruct the visual stimulus under metabolic constraints. We conclude that the paradoxical effects of adaptation are consistent with the efficient coding framework, allowing the brain to improve the representation of frequent stimuli while limiting the associated metabolic cost.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Particular interest lies in studying stone tool use by non-human primates, especially when stone hammers are used to open encased food sources. Percussive tool use is a rare and complex technological behavior which was also employed by our early hominin ancestors. It is widely theorized that environmental factors play a role in explaining the presence and absence of stone tool use across primate populations. Research to date has focused heavily on the quality and availability of tool-extractable foods, and how these compare to alternative food sources. There has been limited investigation into whether access to different types of raw tool material for hammerstones and anvils affects the efficiency of tool users when exploiting encased resources. Here, we quantitatively analyzed how percussive tools of different raw materials vary in their performance and durability. Wild capuchins (Sapajus libidinosus) in Brazil were provided with stones sourced globally from primate and hominin tool use sites. We measured the reliability with which monkeys could crack nuts when using different raw materials, the number of strikes required to open a nut or obtain a food reward, and how these metrics changed over time. We further reported variations in the durability of different raw materials which directly relates to how long a tool remains usable. Our results showed that differences in nut cracking reliability and efficiency were largely driven by the ability of the tool material to stabilize the nut. Furthermore, there was wide variation in tool durability, particularly for anvils. These results highlight the importance of considering raw materials among the ecological factors that can influence the selective benefits or costs of tool use behaviors.

How this movement synchronization is achieved by the nervous system remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover the neural basis of body part coordination during goal-directed antennal grooming in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We find that unilateral or bilateral grooming of one or both antenna, respectively, arises from synchronized movements of the head, antennae, and forelegs. Simulated replay of these body part kinematics in a biomechanical model shows that this coordination makes grooming more efficient by permitting unobstructed, forceful collisions between the foreleg tibiae and antennae. Movements of one body part do not require proprioceptive sensory feedback from the others: neither amputation of the forelegs or antennae, nor immobilization of the head prevented movements of the other unperturbed body parts. By constructing a comprehensive antennal grooming network from the fly brain connectome, we find that centralized interneurons and shared premotor neurons interconnect and thus likely synchronize neck, antennal, and foreleg motor networks. A simulated activation screen of neurons in this network reveals cell classes required for the coordination of antennal movements during unilateral grooming. These cells form two coupled circuit motifs that enable robust body part synchronization: a recurrent excitatory subnetwork that promotes contralateral antennal pitch and broadcast inhibition that suppresses ipsilateral antennal pitch. Similarly centralized controllers may enable the flexible co-recruitment of multiple body parts to subserve a variety of behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Small-molecule GLP1RAs promise oral bioavailability and scalable manufacturing, but their selective binding to human versus rodent receptors has limited mechanistic studies. The neural circuits through which these emerging therapeutics modulate feeding behavior remain undefined, particularly in comparison to established peptide-based GLP1RAs. Here, we developed humanized GLP1R mouse models to investigate how small- molecule GLP1RAs influence feeding behavior. Integrating genetic manipulations, calcium imaging, and behavior profiling, we discovered that these compounds regulate both homeostatic and hedonic feeding through parallel neural circuits. Beyond engaging canonical hypothalamic and hindbrain networks that control metabolic homeostasis, GLP1RAs recruit a discrete population of Glp1r-expressing neurons in the central amygdala, which selectively suppress the consumption of palatable foods by reducing dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Stimulating these central amygdalar neurons curtail hedonic feeding, whereas targeted deletion of the receptor in this cell population specifically diminishes the anorectic efficacy of GLP1RAs for reward-driven intake. These findings reveal a dedicated neural circuit through which small molecule GLP1RAs modulate reward processing, suggesting broad therapeutic potential in conditions of dysregulated dopamine signaling including substance use disorder and binge eating.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

Despite their declining presence in advanced CRC, eosinophils suppress metastatic dissemination by counteracting the pro-tumorigenic functions of SPP1+ macrophages - a subset linked to immune exclusion and tumor metastasis. Mechanistically, eosinophils respond to tumor-derived signals and inhibit macrophage differentiation into SPP1+ cells. Eosinophil depletion exacerbates peritoneal tumor spread.

However, almost no research has included environmental factors spanning micro-to-macro-systems, brain structure, and psychopathology in an integrated framework. Here, we assessed the ways and degree to which multi-system environmental factors during late childhood predict subcortical volume and psychopathology during early adolescence.

MethodWe used the baseline and 2-year follow-up data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study (N = 2,766). A Bayesian latent profile analysis was applied to obtain distinct multi-system environmental profiles during late childhood. The profiles were used in a path analysis to predict their direct and indirect effects on subcortical volume and psychopathology during early adolescence.

ResultsBayesian latent profile analysis revealed nine environmental profiles. Two distinct profiles predicted greater externalizing problems in adolescents: (i) adversity across, family, school, and neighborhood systems and (ii) family conflict and low school involvement. In contrast, a profile of family and neighborhood affluence predicted fewer externalizing difficulties. Further, family and neighborhood affluence predicted higher subcortical volume, which in turn, predicted fewer externalizing problems; whereas, family economic and neighborhood adversity predicted lower subcortical volume, which in turn, predicted greater externalizing difficulties.

ConclusionWe captured direct and indirect influences of environmental factors across multiple systems on externalizing psychopathology. Specifying the equifinal pathways to externalizing psychopathology serves to provide an evidence base for establishing different types of interventions based on the needs and risk profiles of youth.

This often amounts to first segmenting the biological objects of interest in the image before performing a quantitative analysis. Deep-learning (DL) is nowadays ubiquitous in such segmentation tasks. However, DL can be cumbersome to apply, as it often requires large amount of manual labeling to produce ground-truth data, and expert knowledge to train the models from scratch. Nonetheless, the performance of large foundation models, although trained on natural images, are improving on scientific images with every new model released. They, however, require either manual prompting or tedious post-processing to selectively segment the biological objects of interest. Classical machine learning algorithms, such as random forest classifiers, on the other hand, are well-established, easy to train, and often yield results of sufficient quality for downstream processing tasks, hence their continued popularity. Unfortunately, they are limited to objects with distinct, well-defined textures compared to their environment. This generally limits their usefulness to structures easy to recognize. Here, we present FeatureForest, an open-source tool that leverages the feature embeddings of large foundation models to train a random forest classifier, thereby providing users with a rapid way of semantically segmenting complex images using only a few labeling strokes.

We also show that the recombination of glycoproteins between different orders of RNA viruses, including between positive- and negative-sense viruses, may have shaped the evolution of multiple lineages. Our study reveals that some disease-causing RNA virus lineages were present in early chordates and highlights that the evolution of structural genes may be incongruent with that of the highly conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

This latest version brings many significant improvements by reducing the computational time needed for selecting optimal substitution models and conducting bootstrap tests on phylogenies using maximum likelihood (ML) methods. These improvements are achieved by implementing heuristics that minimize likely unnecessary computations. Analyses of empirical and simulated datasets show substantial time savings by using these heuristics without compromising the accuracy of results. MEGA12 also implements an evolutionary sparse learning approach to identify fragile clades and associated sequences in evolutionary trees inferred through phylogenomic analyses. In addition, this version includes fine-grained parallelization for ML analyses, support for high-resolution monitors, and an enhanced Tree Explorer.

Even well-annotated proteins are often poorly characterized in diverse biological contexts, disease states, and perturbations. We present PO_SCPLOWROC_SCPLOWCO_SCPLOWYONC_SCPLOW, a foundation model for modeling, generating, and predicting protein phenotypes across five interrelated knowledge domains: molecular functions, therapeutic mechanisms, disease associations, functional protein domains, and molecular interactions. To support this, we created PO_SCPLOWROC_SCPLOWCO_SCPLOWYONC_SCPLOW-INSTRUCT, a dataset of 33 million protein phenotype instructions, representing a comprehensive resource for multiscale protein phenotypes. By co-training a large language model with multimodal molecular encoders, PO_SCPLOWROC_SCPLOWCO_SCPLOWYONC_SCPLOW integrates phenotypic and protein data. A novel architecture and instruction tuning strategy allow PO_SCPLOWROC_SCPLOWCO_SCPLOWYONC_SCPLOW to process arbitrarily interleaved protein-and-phenotype inputs, achieve zero-shot task transfer, and generate free- form text phenotypes interleaved with retrieved protein sequence, structure, and drug modalities in a single unified model. PO_SCPLOWROC_SCPLOWCO_SCPLOWYONC_SCPLOW achieves strong performance against single-modality models, multimodal models such as ESM3, as well as text-only LLMs on dozens of benchmarking tasks such as contextual protein retrieval and question answering. We extensively evaluate PO_SCPLOWROC_SCPLOWCO_SCPLOWYONC_SCPLOW for biological applications, including identifying protein domains that bind small molecule drugs, predicting peptide binding with enzymes, and assessing the functional impact of Alzheimers disease mutations. PO_SCPLOWROC_SCPLOWCO_SCPLOWYONC_SCPLOW enables conditional retrieval of proteins linked to small molecules through complementary mechanisms of action. It generates candidate phenotypes for under-characterized proteins recently implicated in Parkinsons disease, facilitating hypothesis generation for poorly understood proteins and biological processes.

Here, we take advantage of gastruloids, a stem cell embryoid system not subject to most size controls, to study the role of size in emergent properties of mammalian embryogenesis. We report that gastruloids exhibit robust morphology and transcriptional profiles within a size range. However, size affects the dynamics, and, outside a range of robust morphogenesis, the precision of anterior-posterior (AP) axial elongation. Gastruloid axial elongation exhibits active cellular contractility, requires planar cell polarity (PCP), adhesion and cell-cell contact remodelling. Smaller gastruloids initiate elongation earlier, correlated with an earlier Brachyury polarisation. Brachyury expression increases tissue fluidity. Axis formation is regulated by the balance of Brachyury multifoci coalescence and the timing of initiation of the elongation programme. Sizes beyond the robust range can modify relative tissue composition. Very small aggregates have increased neural fate bias, accompanied by a loss of paraxial mesoderm mediated by differences in Nodal signalling activity.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874642

In recent years, there has a been a shift towards using graph-based reference genomes to address some of these biases, which has required new algorithms and file formats to be developed. This has created the need to develop new tools capable of utilizing these formats and performing operations similar to those carried out by traditional methods.In this paper we present ""gaftools"", a multi-purpose tool that introduces several utilities for processing graph alignments in GAF format. Gaftools enables users to index and sort alignments, with graph ordering serving as a necessary step for the sorting process. Additionally it allows users to view subsets of alignments and perform realignment using the wavefront alignment algorithm, among other useful features. Many of these functionalities are inspired by SAMtools, which provide similar operations for linear genomes, while gaftools adapts and extends them for pangenomes.

The structural models deposited have provided insights into protein folds, relationships to evolution, energy functions of structures, and most recently, protein structure prediction, connecting sequence to structure. However, the X-ray crystallography (and cryo-EM) models deposited in the PDB are determined by a combination of refinement algorithms and manual modeling. The intervention of human modeling leads to the possibility that within a single structure, there can be differences in how well parts of a structure are modeled and/or fit the underlying experimental data. We identified that small molecule binding sites are more carefully modeled and better match the underlying experimental data than the rest of the protein structural model. This trend persisted regardless of the resolution or Rfree values of the structure. The variation of modeling has implications for how we interpret protein structural models and use structural models as truth in mechanisms, structural bioinformatics, simulations, docking, and structure prediction, especially when comparing binding sites to the rest of the protein.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874643

In addition, the ability to capture spatial information of kinase activity is crucial to deconvolute complex signaling networks, interrogate multifaceted kinase actions, and assess drug effects or genetic perturbations. Here we developed a proteomic kinase activity sensor platform (ProKAS) for the analysis of kinase signaling using mass spectrometry. ProKAS is based on a tandem array of peptide sensors with amino acid barcodes that allow multiplexed analysis for spatial, kinetic, and screening applications. We engineered a ProKAS module to simultaneously monitor the activities of the DNA damage response kinases ATR, ATM, and CHK1 in response to genotoxic drugs, while also uncovering differences between these signaling responses in the nucleus, cytosol, and replication factories. Furthermore, we developed an in silico approach for the rational design of specific substrate peptides expandable to other kinases. Overall, ProKAS is a novel versatile system for systematically and spatially probing kinase action in cells.","NA","biorxiv",1734818874643
