It is estimated that 783 million by 2045 will live with diabetes worldwide, 90% of those cases are type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a multifaceted disease, its treatment requires a holistic approach, beyond single target medications with high efficacy. There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness.

Emerging research suggests that ME/CFS and Long COVID exhibit overlapping metabolic symptoms, indicating possible shared metabolic dysfunctions. This study aims to systematically explore these shared metabolic disturbances and their potential treatments. Utilizing our novel metabolic modeling method, GPMM, we identified the key metabolic irregularities in patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID, notably the downregulation of the alanine and aspartate metabolism pathway, and the arginine and proline metabolism pathway. Genome-wide knockout analyses indicated that supplementation with aspartate (ASP) or asparagine (ASN) could potentially ameliorate these metabolic deficiencies. Further metabolic assessments in Long COVID patients highlighted the significant downregulation of ASP in both blood and muscle, supporting our predictions. Consequently, we propose that the combination of l-ornithine and l-aspartate (LOLA) offers a promising approach to alleviate metabolic symptoms in both ME/CFS and Long COVID patients. This study not only elucidates the shared metabolic pathways in ME/CFS and Long COVID but also positions LOLA as a viable candidate for future clinical trials.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

In animals, complex sensory motor systems are primarily built around the fundamental cell types of muscles and neurons, though the evolutionary origin of these cells, and their integration, remains unclear. Here, in order to investigate sensory-behavior coupling in the closest relatives of animals, we established a line of the choanoflagellate, Salpingoeca rosetta, which stably expresses the calcium indicator RGECO1. Using this, we identify a novel cellular behavior associated with electrical signaling, in which ciliary arrest is coupled with apical-basal contraction of the cell. This behavior, and the associated calcium transients, are synchronized in the multicellular state and result in coordinated ciliary arrest and colony wide contraction, suggesting information is spread amongst the cells. Our work reveals fundamental insights into how choanoflagellates sense and respond to their environment and offer a new perspective into the integration of cellular and organism wide behavior in the closest protistan relatives of animals.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Human genetic variation provides a set of ""natural experiments"" that can inform successful strategies for therapeutic discovery. Previous work has estimated that drug targets with human genetics supported mechanisms have a 2-3x increased likelihood of succeeding in the clinic compared to those without. 23andMe, Inc. is a direct-to-consumer genetics company that has created a human genetics dataset approximately an order of magnitude larger in sample size than current publically available cohorts. As of 2024, 23andMe has approximately 15 million individuals with genotype and phenotype data, of which [~]80% consent to participation in research. In this work, we explore how both the scale of the genetic data and improved methods to link genetic associations to putative causal genes impact the prediction of clinical success. Comparing the total number of target-indication pairs that have reached at least phase I that are also supported by genetic evidence, the number of target-indication pairs with support from 23andMe is 60% greater than that with support from all GWAS datasets in the public domain. Including 23andMe genetic evidence approximately doubles the number of target-indication pairs in the clinic that are supported by human genetics. Furthermore, we show that genetic associations derived from entirely self-reported phenotypes are 2-3x enriched for clinical success, just as for clinically derived phenotypes. In contrast to conclusions from the recent publication of Minikel et al., we found that minor allele frequencies and effect sizes from GWAS influence the relative success estimates for program approvals, and that drug programs supported by rare and large effect associations have greater (3-4x) likelihood to be approved compared to common variant associations with small effects. Finally, improved gene mapping to identify the likely causal genes underlying genetic associations can result in up to 4-5x enrichment for trial success. With the increased power and scale of the 23andMe genetic dataset, we identify an expansive set of opportunities that may be pursued in the clinic, emphasizing the importance of cohort size and gene mapping confidence in deriving clinical value.","NA","medrxiv",1719093902457

Lifetime cannabis use GWAS identified two loci, one near CADM2 (rs11922956, p=2.40E-11) and another near GRM3 (rs12673181, p=6.90E-09).

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1719093902457

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3, which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 and KP.2.3, which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

This is exemplified by repressive chromatin domains frequently contacting nuclear lamina or nucleoli. The nucleolus undergoes structural changes in response to various cellular states, potentially impacting genome organization. However, how the 3D-genome organization responds to nucleolar states has remained underinvestigated due to the lack of methods able to identify nucleolar associated domains (NADs) in single cells and under nucleolar stress. To address this, we developed NoLMseq, a method combining laser-capture microdissection and DNA sequencing to map NADs in single cells. NoLMseq identified many unexplored features of chromosome organization around single nucleoli such as NAD heterogeneity among ESCs, culminating in two major populations with distinct chromatin states. The data also revealed that NADs prevalently contact nucleoli in a monoallelic manner and allelic nucleolar contact frequency sets gene expression and chromatin states. NoLMseq also revealed how chromosomes reorganise around nucleoli under nucleolar stress conditions, highlighting the importance of nucleolus integrity in genome organization and 3D-genome response to nucleolar stress. The results demonstrated that NoLMseq accurately measures chromosome contacts around single healthy and stressed nucleoli and it will be a critical tool to study NADs within biological populations and determine how the 3D-genome responds to nucleolar stress in healthy and disease states.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Neonatal research offers a pivotal opportunity to address this long-standing debate. Given that postnatal environmental influences (e.g., gender socialisation) are minimal at birth, any sex differences observed at this stage can be more readily attributed to prenatal influences. Here, we assessed on-average sex differences in global and regional brain volumes in 514 newborns (236 birth-assigned females and 278 birth-assigned males) using data from the developing Human Connectome Project. On average, males had significantly larger intracranial and total brain volumes, even after controlling for birth weight. After controlling for total brain volume, females showed higher total cortical gray matter volumes, whilst males showed higher total white matter volumes. After controlling for total brain volume in regional comparisons, females had increased white matter volumes in the corpus callosum and increased gray matter volumes in the bilateral parahippocampal gyri (posterior parts), left anterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral parietal lobes, and right caudate nucleus. Males had increased gray matter volumes in the right medial and inferior temporal gyrus (posterior part) and right subthalamic nucleus. Effect sizes ranged from small for regional comparisons to large for global comparisons. While postnatal experiences likely amplify sex differences in the brain, our findings demonstrate that several global and regional on-average sex differences are already present at birth.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

We aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 serological responses to primary infection and vaccination in people who developed PCC versus those with an acute infection only. Methods: Participants (n=2,010) were a sub-cohort of the Virus Watch community cohort study in England who experienced mild-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infections, completed surveys on persistent symptoms, and provided monthly finger-prick blood samples for serology. We compared the likelihood of post-infection seroconversion using logistic mixed models and the trajectories of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) and anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies using linear mixed models. Results: Participants who developed PCC (n=394) had 1.8x the odds of post-infection seroconversion for anti-N antibodies compared to those with an acute infection only (n=1616) (adjusted odds ratio= 1.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-2.90). Post-infection anti-N levels were persistently elevated in people with PCC (final log anti-N titres at 365 days 0.97, 95% CI 0.76-1.18) compared to those without (0.47, 95% CI 0.31-0.62). No differences were found in post-vaccination anti-S levels or trajectories before or after primary infection between participants with and without PCC; pre-vaccination anti-S responses could not be evaluated. Conclusion: People with PCC demonstrated greater and more persistent anti-N antibody responses following primary infection compared to those with an acute infection only. Vaccination response pre- or post-infection did not systematically differ between groups.

The method is implemented in two stages: first, the pre-training stage that generates 3028 generic pathway aging models by integrating age-related genome-wide DNA methylation data with gene ontology and signaling pathway; second, the fine-tuning stage that produces 30280 disease-specific pathway aging models using DNA methylation profiling from 3263 samples across 10 age-related diseases. The Next Generation Aging Clock Models have demonstrated exceptional performance in predicting diseases. For example, the aging index of blood vessel endothelial cell migration can predict Atherosclerosis with an odds ratio of 80. Alzheimer's disease can be predicted by the aging index of response to DNA damage stimulus, with an odds ratio of 3.1. Major Depressive Disorder can be predicted by the organization of the mitochondrion, with an odds ratio of 4.4. Breast cancer can be predicted by DNA repair, with an odds ratio of 3.4, and the severity of COVID-19 can be predicted by neutrophil degranulation, with an odds ratio of 8.5. Furthermore, the models have allowed the categorization of diseases into nucleus aging and cytoplasm aging types. The former includes Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, breast cancer, colon cancer, and osteoporosis. The latter includes Parkinson's disease, depression, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and COVID-19 severity. This innovative approach is expected to be a valuable tool for research into aging-related diseases and for personalized aging interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

We hypothesized that sex-specific immune dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of LC. To investigate the immunologic underpinnings of LC development and persistence, we used single-cell transcriptomics, single-cell proteomics, and plasma proteomics on blood samples obtained during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and at 3 and 12 months post-infection in a cohort of 45 patients who either developed LC or recovered. Several sex-specific immune pathways were associated with LC. Specifically, males who would develop LC at 3 months had widespread increases in TGF-{beta} signaling during acute infection in proliferating NK cells. Females who would develop LC demonstrated increased expression of XIST, an RNA gene implicated in autoimmunity, and increased IL1 signaling in monocytes at 12 months post infection. Several immune features of LC were also conserved across sexes. Both males and females with LC had reduced co-stimulatory signaling from monocytes and broad upregulation of NF-{kappa}B transcription factors. In both sexes, those with persistent LC demonstrated increased LAG3, a marker of T cell exhaustion, reduced ETS1 transcription factor expression across lymphocyte subsets, and elevated intracellular IL-4 levels in T cell subsets, suggesting that ETS1 alterations may drive an aberrantly elevated Th2-like response in LC. Altogether, this study describes multiple innate and adaptive immune correlates of LC, some of which differ by sex, and offers insights toward the pursuit of tailored therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

This study highlights the heterogeneous and polyfunctional regulatory-T (Treg) cell compartment in the meninges. A Treg subtype specialized in controlling Th1-cell responses and another known to control responses in B-cell follicles were substantial components of this compartment, foretelling that punctual Treg-cell ablation rapidly unleashed interferon-gamma production by meningeal lymphocytes, unlocked their access to the brain parenchyma, and altered meningeal B-cell profiles. Distally, the hippocampus assumed a reactive state, with morphological and transcriptional changes in multiple glial-cell types; within the dentate gyrus, neural stem cells showed exacerbated death and desisted from further differentiation, associated with inhibition of spatial-reference memory. Thus, meningeal Treg cells are a multifaceted bulwark to brain homeostasis at steady-state.

One sentence summaryA distinct population of regulatory T cells in the murine meninges safeguards homeostasis by keeping local interferon-{gamma}-producing lymphocytes in check, thereby preventing their invasion of the parenchyma, activation of hippocampal glial cells, death of neural stem cells, and memory decay.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

For this purpose, numerous detergents, amphipols, polymers and membrane scaffold proteins are available. The choice of the specific membrane substitute can strongly affect the protein's specific activity, stability and conformational spectrum, potentially leading to errors or misinterpretation during analysis. The bacterial ATP-binding cassette transporter MsbA is a prominent example of such environment-specific bias, resulting in apparent conformational and activity responses. Here, we present a systematic analysis of the conformational spectrum of MsbA, stabilized in a dozen environments, using cryo-EM. Our data show pronounced structural feedback of the ABC transporter to the respective membrane mimetics. Detergents generally favour a conformation with wide separation of the nucleotide-binding domains, while nanodiscs induce the narrow conformation. Notably, only three of the dozen tested environments allow MsbA to sample the functional conformational spectrum, enabling full movement of the nucleotide-binding domains between narrow and wide inward-facing conformations. We expect this study to serve as a blueprint for other membrane proteins, even where the structural reaction to the hydrophobic environment is not directly visible but still critical for the proteins' function.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

However, the resurgent interest in the drugs as therapeutics has also prompted a search for novel agents with more specific pharmacological activities than the rather promiscuous classical psychedelics. Here we present the results of an elaborate preclinical characterization of one such compound, LPH-5 [(S)-3-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)piperidine]. LPH-5 was found to be a potent partial agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) and to exhibit pronounced selectivity for this receptor over the related 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors in a range of functional assays. LPH-5 (0.375 - 12.0 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently induced head-twitch responses (HTR) in Sprague Dawley rats, with substantial 5-HT2AR engagement being observed at 0.5-1.0 mg/kg. Acute administration of LPH-5 (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced robust antidepressant-like effects in Flinders Sensitive Line rats and adrenocorticotropic hormone-treated Sprague Dawley rats, and LPH-5 (0.3 and 1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced significant effects in a recently developed Wistar Kyoto rat model proposed to reflect the long-term antidepressant-like effects produced by psychedelics in humans. In conclusion, selective 5-HT2AR activation, as mediated here by LPH- 5, seems to hold antidepressant potential, suggesting that this activity component is key for the beneficial effects of classical psychedelics. Hence, we propose that LPH-5 and other 5-HT2AR- selective agonists could hold potential as therapeutics in psychiatric disease as a new generation of psychedelic-derived antidepressant.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

We uncover three syntactic networks that are broadly distributed across traditional language regions, but with focal concentrations in middle and inferior frontal gyri. In contrast to previous findings from comprehension studies, these networks process syntax mostly to the exclusion of words and meaning, supporting a cognitive architecture with a distinct syntactic system. Most strikingly, our data reveal an unexpected property of syntax: it is encoded independent of neural activity levels.

However, the differential roles of state vs. trait anxiety remain unclear, and underlying computational mechanisms have not been thoroughly characterized. In the present study, we investigated how a somatic (interoceptive) state anxiety induction influences learning and decision-making under uncertainty in individuals with clinically significant levels of trait anxiety. A sample of 58 healthy comparisons (HCs) and 61 individuals with affective disorders (iADs; i.e., depression and/or anxiety) completed a previously validated explore-exploit decision task, with and without an added breathing resistance manipulation designed to induce state anxiety. Computational modeling revealed a pattern in which iADs showed greater information-seeking (i.e., directed exploration; Cohen's d=.39, p=.039) in resting conditions, but that this was reduced by the anxiety induction. The affective disorders group also showed slower learning rates across conditions (Cohen's d=.52, p=.003), suggesting more persistent uncertainty. These findings highlight a complex interplay between trait anxiety and state anxiety. Specifically, while elevated trait anxiety is associated with persistent uncertainty, acute somatic anxiety can paradoxically curtail exploratory behaviors, potentially reinforcing maladaptive decision-making patterns in affective disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1719093902457

The structure of the resting state of NbNRC2 was recently revealed to be a homodimer. However, the sensor-activated state has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we used cryo-EM to determine the structure of sensor-activated NbNRC2, which forms a hexameric inflammasome-like structure known as resistosome. To confirm the functional significance of the hexamer, we mutagenized the interfaces involved in oligomerization and found that mutations in three nucleotide-binding domain interface residues abolish oligomerization and immune signalling. Comparative structural analyses between the resting state NbNRC2 homodimer and the sensor-activated homohexamer revealed significant structural rearrangements before and after activation, providing insights into NLR activation mechanisms. Furthermore, structural comparisons between the NbNRC2 hexamer and previously reported CC-NLR pentameric assemblies revealed features in NbNRC2 that allow for the integration of an additional protomer. We also used the NbNRC2 hexamer structure to assess the recently released AlphaFold 3 for the prediction of activated CC-NLR oligomers. This revealed that AlphaFold 3 allows for high-confidence modelling of the N-terminal 1-helices of NbNRC2 and other CC-NLRs, a region that has proven difficult to fully resolve using structural approaches.

Extensive research in rodents, along with some evidence in humans, suggests that single-neuron activity at specific phases of theta oscillations plays a crucial role in memory processes. Our fundamental understanding of such theta-phase locking in humans and its dependency on basic electrophysiological properties of the local field potential is still limited, however. Here, using single-neuron recordings in epilepsy patients performing a spatial memory task, we thus aimed at improving our understanding of factors modulating theta-phase locking in the human brain. Combining a generalized-phase approach for frequency-adaptive theta-phase estimation with time-resolved spectral parameterization, our results show that theta-phase locking is a strong and prevalent phenomenon across human medial temporal lobe regions, both during spatial memory encoding and retrieval. Neuronal theta-phase locking increased during periods of elevated theta power, when clear theta oscillations were present, and when aperiodic activity exhibited steeper slopes. Theta-phase locking was similarly strong during successful and unsuccessful memory, and most neurons activated at similar theta phases between encoding and retrieval. Some neurons changed their preferred theta phases between encoding and retrieval, in line with the idea that different memory processes are separated within the theta cycle. Together, these results help disentangle how different properties of local field potentials and memory states influence theta-phase locking of human single neurons. This contributes to a better understanding of how interactions between single neurons and local field potentials may support human spatial memory.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Rnf is widespread in primordial organisms and the evolutionary predecessor of the Na+-pumping NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (Nqr)1. By running in reverse, Rnf reduces ferredoxin with NADH as reductant at the expense of the transmembrane electrochemical ion gradient and provides low potential electrons for nitrogenases as well as CO2 reductases. Yet, the molecular principles that couple the long-range electron transfer to the Na+ translocation across the membrane remain elusive. Here we resolve key functional states along the electron transfer pathway using redox-controlled cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that, in combination with biochemical functional assays and atomistic molecular simulations, provide key insight into the redox-driven Na+ pumping mechanism. We show that the reduction of the unique membrane-embedded [2Fe2S] cluster in the vestibule between the RnfA/E subunits electrostatically attracts the sodium ions, and in turn, triggers an inward/outward transition with alternating membrane access driving the Na+ pump and the reduction of NAD+.

A pitch percept is formed by weighting different acoustic cues (e.g., signal fundamental frequency and inter-harmonic spacing) and contextual cues (expectation). How and when such cues are neurally encoded and integrated remains debated. In this study, twenty-eight participants listened to tone sequences with different acoustic cues (pure tones, complex missing fundamental tones, and ambiguous mixtures), placed in predictable and less predictable sequences, while magnetoencephalography was recorded. Decoding analyses revealed that pitch was encoded in neural responses to all three tone types, in the low-to-mid auditory cortex, bilaterally, with right-hemisphere dominance. The pattern of activity generalized across cue-types, offset in time: pitch was neurally encoded earlier for harmonic tones ([~]85ms) than pure tones ([~]95ms). For ambiguous tones, pitch emerged significantly earlier in predictable contexts, and could be decoded even before tone onset. The results suggest that a unified neural representation of pitch emerges by integrating independent pitch cues, and that context alters the dynamics of pitch generation when acoustic cues are ambiguous.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

To produce the contractile forces required for the controlled excision of cell-like compartments such as giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), reconstituted cytokinetic rings made of actin are considered to be among the most promising structures of a potential synthetic division machinery. Although the targeting of actin rings to GUV membranes and their myosin-induced constriction have been previously demonstrated, large-scale vesicle deformation has been precluded due to the lacking spatial control of these contractile structures. Here, we show the combined in vitro reconstitution of actomyosin rings and the bacterial MinDE protein system, effective in targeting E.coli Z-rings to mid-cell, within GUVs. Incorporating this spatial positioning tool, which induces active transport of any diffusible molecule on membranes, yields self-organized assembly of actomyosin rings at the equatorial plane of vesicles. Remarkably, the synergistic effect of Min oscillations and the contractile nature of actomyosin bundles induces mid-vesicle membrane deformation and striking bleb-like protrusions, leading to shape remodeling and symmetry breaking. Our system showcases how functional machineries from various organisms may be synergistically combined in vitro, leading to the emergence of new functionality towards a synthetic division system.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Furthermore, we show that certain population structure changes can cause similar patterns. Newer methods like Beta-PSMC do not always avoid this artifact.

Flagellar motility is an energy-demanding process, where the sum of its production (biosynthesis) and operation (rotation) costs has been estimated to total ~10% of the entire energy budget of an E. coli cell. The acquisition of such a costly adaptation process is expected to secure short-term benefits by increasing competitiveness and survival, as well as long-term evolutionary fitness gains. While the role of flagellar motility in bacterial survival has been widely reported, its direct influence on the rate of evolution remains unclear. We show here that both production and operation costs contribute to elevated mutation frequencies. Our findings suggest that flagellar movement may be an important player in tuning the rate of bacterial evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

We compared the diagnostic accuracy of available TB triage tests. Methods: We prospectively screened consecutive adults with [&ge;]2 weeks of cough presenting to primary health centers in the Philippines, Vietnam, South Africa, Uganda, and India. All participants received the index tests: chest-X-ray (CXR), venous or capillary Cepheid Xpert TB Host Response (HR) testing, and point-of-care C-reactive protein (CRP) testing (Boditech iChroma II). CXR images were processed using computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithms. We assessed diagnostic accuracy against a microbiologic reference standard (sputum Xpert Ultra, culture). Optimal cut-points were chosen to achieve sensitivity [&ge;]90% and maximize specificity. Two-test screening algorithms were considered, using two approaches: 1) sequential negative serial screening in which the second screening test is conducted only if the first is negative and positive is defined as positive on either test and 2) sequential positive serial screening, in which the second screening test is conducted only if the first is positive and positive is defined as positive on both tests. Results: Between July 2021 and August 2022, 1,392 participants with presumptive TB had valid results on index tests and the reference standard, and 303 (22%) had confirmed TB. In head-to-head comparisons, CAD4TB v7 showed the highest specificity when using a cut-point that achieves 90% sensitivity (70.3% vs. 65.1% for Xpert HR, difference 95% CI 1.6 to 8.9; 49.7% for CRP, difference 95% CI 17.0 to 24.3). Among the possible two-test screening algorithms, three met WHO target product profile (TPP) minimum accuracy thresholds and had higher accuracy than any test alone. At 90% sensitivity, the specificity was 79.6% for Xpert HR-CAD4TB [sequential negative], 75.9% for CRP-CAD4TB [sequential negative], and 73.7% for Xpert HR-CAD4TB [sequential positive]. Conclusions: CAD4TB achieves TPP targets and outperforms Xpert HR and CRP. Combining screening tests further increased accuracy. Cost and feasibility of two-test screening algorithms should be explored. Registration: NCT04923958","NA","medrxiv",1719093902457

Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a multi-domain protein containing both a kinase and a GTPase, are a leading cause of the familial form of PD. Pathogenic LRRK2 mutations increase LRRK2 kinase activity. While the bulk of LRRK2 is found in the cytosol, the protein associates with membranes, where its Rab GTPase substrates are found, and, under certain conditions, with microtubules. Integrative structural studies using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have revealed the architecture of microtubule-associated LRRK2 filaments, and that formation of these filaments required LRRK2's kinase to be in the active-like conformation. Whether LRRK2 can interact with and form filaments on microtubules in its autoinhibited state, where the kinase domain conformation is inactive and the N-terminal LRR domain covers the kinase catalytic site, was not known. Using cryo-ET, we showed that full-length LRRK2 can oligomerize on microtubules in its autoinhibited state. Both WT-LRRK2 and PD-linked LRRK2 mutants formed filaments on microtubules. While these filaments are stabilized by the same interfaces seen in the active-LRRK2 filaments, we observed a new interface involving the N-terminal repeats that were disordered in the active-LRRK2 filaments. The helical parameters of the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are different from those reported for the active-LRRK2 filaments. Finally, the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are shorter, suggesting they are less stable.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

During the last two millennia, genetic exchange in Africa has resulted in a complex tapestry of taurine-indicine ancestry, with most cattle populations exhibiting varying levels of admixture. Similarly, there are several Southern European cattle populations that also show evidence for historical gene flow from indicine cattle, the highest levels of which are found in the Central Italian White breeds. Here we use two different software tools (MOSAIC and ELAI) for local ancestry inference (LAI) with genome-wide high- and low-density SNP array data sets in hybrid African and Italian cattle populations and obtained broadly similar results despite critical differences in the two LAI methodologies used. Our analyses identified genomic regions with elevated levels of retained or introgressed ancestry from the African taurine, European taurine, Asian indicine lineages. Functional enrichment of genes underlying these ancestry peaks highlighted biological processes relating to immunobiology and olfaction, some of which may relate to differing susceptibilities to infectious diseases, including bovine tuberculosis, East Coast fever, and tropical theileriosis. Notably, for retained African taurine ancestry in admixed trypanotolerant cattle we observed enrichment of genes associated with haemoglobin and oxygen transport. This may reflect positive selection of genomic variants that enhance control of severe anaemia, a debilitating feature of trypanosomiasis disease, which severely constrains cattle agriculture across much of sub-Saharan Africa.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Sequence change is additionally marked by an excess number of C->U transitions suggested as being due to host-mediated genome editing. To investigate how therse influence the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2, 2000 high quality, coding complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants collected pre-September, 2020, and from each subsequently appearing alpha, delta, BA.1, BA.2, BA.5, XBB, EG, HK and JN.1 lineages were downloaded from NCBI Virus in April, 2024. C->U transitions were the most common substitution during diversification of SARS-CoV-2 lineages over the 4-year observation period. A net loss of C bases and accumulation of Us occurred at a constant rate of approximately 0.2%-0.25% / decade. C->U transitions occurred in over a quarter of all sites with a C (26.5%; range 20.0%-37.2%), around 5 times more than observed for the other transitions (5.3%-6.8%). In contrast to an approximately random distribution of other transitions across the genome, most C->U substitutions occurred at statistically preferred sites in each lineage. However, only the most C->U polymorphic sites showed evidence for a preferred 5U context previously associated with APOBEC 3A editing. There was a similarly weak preference for unpaired bases suggesting much less stringent targeting of RNA than mediated by A3 deaminases in DNA editing. Future functional studies are required to determine editing preferences, impacts on replication fitness in vivo of SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses and impact on host tropism.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

The olfactory nerve is widely accepted as the neuroinvasive route by which the etiological agent SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain, but the trigeminal nerve is an often-overlooked additional route. Based on this consensus, we initially conducted a pilot experiment investigating the olfactory nerve route of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion via intranasal inoculation in AC70 human ACE2 transgenic mice. Notably, we found that the trigeminal ganglion is an early and highly efficient site of viral replication, which then rapidly spread widely throughout the brain where neurons were primarily targeted. Despite the extensive viral infection across the brain, obvious evidence of tissue pathology including inflammatory infiltration, glial activation, and apoptotic cell deaths were not consistently observed, albeit inflammatory cytokines were significantly induced. However, the expression levels of different genes related to neuronal function, including the neurotransmitter dopamine pathway as well as synaptic function, and markers of neuronal damage were altered as compared to mock-infected mice. Our findings suggest that the trigeminal nerve can be a neuroinvasive route complementary to the olfactory nerve and that the ensuing neuroinvasion presented a unique neuropathological profile. This study provides insights into potential neuropathogenic mechanisms utilized by coronaviruses.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

The transcriptomically-derived spatial patterns of gene expression separate the cortex into three major regions, frontal, temporal and parietooccipital, with smaller subregions appearing at lower levels of the transcriptomic hierarchy. The core regions, which remain stable across different hierarchical levels, are physiologically associated with language, emotion regulation, social cognition, motor and visuospatial processing and planning. Importantly, some core regions cross structural and anatomical boundaries identified in previous parcellations of the cortex, revealing that the transcriptomic architecture of the cortex is closely linked to human-specific higher cognitive function.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Genetic variation around the LRRK2 gene affects risk of both familial and sporadic Parkinsons disease (PD). The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) protein has been implicated in peripheral immune signaling, however, the effects of an aging immune system on LRRK2 function have been neglected to be considered. We demonstrate here that the R1441C mutation induces a hyper-responsive phenotype in macrophages from young female mice, characterized by increased effector functions, including stimulation-dependent antigen presentation, cytokine release, phagocytosis, and lysosomal function. This is followed by age-acquired immune cell exhaustion in a Lrrk2-kinase-dependent manner. Immune-exhausted macrophages exhibit suppressed antigen presentation and hypophagocytosis, which is also demonstrated in myeloid cells from R1441C and Y1699C-PD patients. Our novel findings that LRRK2 mutations confer immunological advantage at a young age but may predispose the carrier to age-acquired immune cell exhaustion have significant implications for LRRK2 biology and therapeutic development. Indeed, LRRK2 has become an appealing target in PD, but our findings suggest that more research is required to understand the cell-type specific consequences and optimal timing of LRRK2-targeting therapeutics.

We find that biallelic PSMF1 missense and loss-of-function variants co-segregate with phenotypes from early-onset PD and parkinsonism to perinatal lethality with neurological manifestations across 15 unrelated pedigrees with 22 affected subjects, showing clear genotype-phenotype correlation.

Inhibition of PCSK9 (PCSK9i) blocks MHC-I degradation. Evolocumab is a PCSK9i monoclonal antibody (mAb) indicated for hyperlipidemia. However, mAbs have limited penetrance across the blood brain/tumor barrier (BBB/BTB). We conducted a non-randomized surgical window-of-opportunity study to evaluate if peripheral evolocumab penetrates the BBB/BTB and effects tumor (PesKE; NCT04937413). 32 patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent glioma were enrolled (M: 16, F: 16; average age of controls: 51.85, evolocumab: 53). Of these, 4 who received evolocumab and 17 control participants had tissue for research. No significant adverse events were reported. However, BBB/BTB penetration (assessed by mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS)) was akin to other mAbs, with a tumor:blood ratio of 0.0332 (SD{+/-}0.0215) in contrast-enhancing and 0.0112 (SD{+/-}0.0039) in non-contrast-enhancing cases.

Despite being modular, composed of multiple zooids and supporting tissues, colonies function as a single physiological unit. A major question in the biology of colonies is the cellular mechanism of generating structurally and functionally distinct colony parts. The cnidarian Hydractinia establishes colonies with different types of zooids (polyps), interconnected by a gastrovascular system that is attached to the substrate and known as stolons. We obtained single cell transcriptomic profiles of ~200K Hydractinia cells, including isolated stolons and two polyp types. We characterised the major Hydractinia cell types and quantified their abundance across colony parts. Overall, we find that distinct colony parts are characterised primarily by distinct combinations of shared cell types and to a lesser extent by part-specific cell types. Therefore, we propose that both cell type combinations, as well as rarer cell type innovations, have been the main mechanism in the evolution of coloniality in cnidarians. We identified cell type-specific transcription factors (TFs) and gene networks expressed within these cell types. Notably, we discovered a previously unidentified, stolon-specific cell type, which expresses enzymes related to biomineralization and chitin synthesis, reminiscent of molluscan shell matrix proteins that may represent a crucial adaptation to the animal's habitat. In summary, the Hydractinia cell atlas elucidates the fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying coloniality.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Although the exact mechanisms underlying its maturation remain elusive, spontaneous activity patterns in the retina, known as retinal waves, have been shown to contribute to this developmental process. Retinal waves exhibit complex spatio-temporal statistics and contribute to the establishment of circuit connectivity and function in the visual system, including the formation of retinotopic maps and the refinement of receptive fields in downstream areas such as the thalamus and visual cortex. Recent work in mice has shown that retinal waves have statistical features matching those of natural visual stimuli, such as optic flow, suggesting that they could prime the visual system for motion processing upon vision onset. Motivated by these findings, we examined whether artificial neural network (ANN) models trained on natural movies show improved performance if pre-trained with retinal waves. We employed the spatio-temporally complex task of next-frame prediction, in which the ANN was trained to predict the next frame based on preceding input frames of a movie. We found that pre-training ANNs with retinal waves enhances the processing of real-world visual stimuli and accelerates learning. Strikingly, even when matching the total training time by merely replacing initial training epochs on naturalistic stimuli with exposure to retinal waves, an ANN trained on retinal waves temporarily outperforms one trained solely on natural movies. Similar to observations made in biological systems, we also found that pre-training with spontaneous activity refines the receptive field of ANN neurons. Overall, our work sheds light on the functional role of spatio-temporally patterned spontaneous activity in the processing of motion in natural scenes, suggesting it acts as a training signal to prepare the developing visual system for adult visual processing.

Author summaryBefore the onset of vision, the retina generates its own spontaneous activity, referred to as retinal waves. This activity is crucial for establishing neural connections and, hence, ensuring the proper functionality of the visual system. Recent research has shown that retinal waves exhibit statistical properties similar to those of natural visual stimuli, such as the optic flow of objects in the environment during forward motion. We investigate whether retinal waves can prepare the visual system for motion processing by pre-training artificial neural network (ANN) models with retinal waves. We tested the ANNs on next-frame prediction tasks, where the model predicts the next frame of a video based on previous frames. Our results showed that ANNs pre-trained with retinal waves exhibit faster learning on movies featuring naturalistic stimuli. Additionally, pre-training with retinal waves refined the receptive fields of ANN neurons, similar to processes seen in biological systems. Our work highlights the importance of spatio-temporally patterned spontaneous activity in preparing the visual system for motion processing in natural scenes.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Ulva-associated bacteria exhibit high turnover across environmental gradients, leading to the hypothesis that bacteria contribute to the acclimation potential of the host. Yet little is known about the variation in the functional profile of Ulva-associated bacteria in relation to environmental changes. To test which microbial functions shift alongside a strong environmental gradient, we analysed microbial communities of 91 Ulva samples across a 2,000 km Atlantic-Baltic Sea salinity gradient using metagenomic sequencing. Metabolic reconstruction of 639 metagenome-assembled genomes revealed widespread potential for carbon, sulphur, nitrogen, and vitamin metabolism, including amino acid and vitamin B biosynthesis. While salinity explained 70% of taxonomic variation, it only accounted for 17% of functional variation, indicating extensive functional stability. The limited variation was attributed to typical high-salinity bacteria exhibiting enrichment in genes for thiamine, pyridoxal, and betaine biosynthesis. These metabolic modules likely contribute to oxidative stress mitigation, cellular osmotic homeostasis, and membrane stabilization in response to salinity variations. Our results emphasise the importance of functional profiling to understand the seaweed holobiont and its collective response to environmental change.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

The prediction and analysis of gene essentiality can advance our understanding of basic life and human diseases, and further boost the development of new drugs. Wet lab methods for identifying cell essential genes are often costly, time-consuming, and laborious. As a complement, computational methods have been proposed to predict essential genes by integrating multiple biological data sources. Most of these methods are evaluated on model organisms. However, prediction methods for human essential genes are still limited and the relationship between human gene essentiality and different biological information still needs to be explored. In addition, exploring suitable deep learning techniques to overcome the limitations of traditional machine learning methods and improve prediction accuracy is also important and interesting. We propose a snapshot ensemble deep neural network method, DeEPsnap, to predict human essential genes. DeEPsnap integrates sequence features derived from DNA and protein sequence data with features extracted or learned from multiple types of functional data, such as gene ontology, protein complex, protein domain, and protein-protein interaction network. More than 200 features from these biological data are extracted/learned which are integrated together to train a series of cost-sensitive deep neural networks by utilizing multiple deep learning techniques. The proposed snapshot mechanism enables us to train multiple models without increasing extra training effort and cost. The experimental results of 10-fold cross-validation show that DeEPsnap can accurately predict human gene essentiality with an average AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) of 96.1%, the average AUPRC (Area under the Precision-Recall curve) of 93.82%, the average accuracy of 92.21%, and the average F1 measure about 80.62%. In addition, the comparison of experimental results shows that DeEPsnap outperforms several popular traditional machine learning models and deep learning models. We have demonstrated that the proposed method, DeEPsnap, is effective for predicting human essential genes.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Identifying causal links between specific fecal microbiome-derived metabolites and disease susceptibility has been shown using fecal microbial transfer (FMT) into animal models of MS (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, EAE). However, a pipeline that identifies microbiome-associated metabolites that can alter age-dependent disease progression is lacking. We recently established a mouse model of MS disease progression that is induced by adoptive transfer of TH17 cells from young SJL/J mice immunized with myelin peptide into aged recipients. Adapting this model to FMT, we tested the role of young versus aged murine and human fecal microbial communities on disease progression. We demonstrate that microbiota derived from aged SJL/J mice is not sufficient to drive the progressive disease phenotype in young mice. However, human fecal microbiota from young versus aged donors induced a range of EAE phenotypes. Taking advantage of this variability, we were able to identify fecal communities that promote an ""aged EAE"" phenotype in chronologically young mice that were associated with distinct microbiota-derived metabolites. Our findings provide a framework for metabolite discovery associated with EAE disease chronicity and severity.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Atelocyanobacterium thalassa) has recently been recognized as a globally-distributed, early stage, nitrogen-fixing organelle (the 'nitroplast') of cyanobacterial origin present in select species of haptophyte algae (e.g., Braarudosphaera bigelowii). Although the nitroplast was recognized as the UCYN-A2 sublineage, it is yet to be confirmed in other sublineages of the algal/UCYN-A complex. We used water samples collected from Halifax Harbour (Bedford Basin, Nova Scotia, Canada) and the offshore Scotian Shelf to further our understanding of B. bigelowii and UCYN-A in the coastal Northwest Atlantic. Sequencing data revealed UCYN-A-associated haptophyte signatures and yielded near-complete metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) for UCYN-A1, UCYN-A4, and the plastid of the A4-associated haptophyte. Comparative genomics provided new insights into the pangenome of UCYN-A. The UCYN-A4 MAG is the first genome sequenced from this sublineage and shares ~85% identity with the UCYN-A2 nitroplast. Genes missing in the reduced genome of the nitroplast were also missing in the A4 MAG supporting its likely classification as a nitroplast as well. The UCYN-A1 MAG was found to be nearly 100% identical to the reference genome despite coming from different ocean basins. Time-series data paired with the recurrence of specific microbes in enrichment cultures gave insight into the microbes that frequently co-occur with the algal/UCYN-A complex (e.g., Pelagibacter ubique).

Such discordance has hampered interpretation and convergence of research findings across the field. To address this problem, we have developed the Network Correspondence Toolbox (NCT) to permit researchers to examine and report spatial correspondence between their novel neuroimaging results and sixteen widely used functional brain atlases, consistent with recommended reporting standards developed by the Organization for Human Brain Mapping.

The atlases included in the toolbox show some topographical convergence for specific networks, such as those labeled as ""default"" or ""visual"". Network naming varies across atlases, particularly for networks spanning frontoparietal association cortices. For this reason, quantitative comparison with multiple atlases is recommended to benchmark novel neuroimaging findings.

We provide several exemplar demonstrations using the Human Connectome Project task fMRI results and UK Biobank independent component analysis maps to illustrate how researchers can use the NCT to report their own findings through quantitative evaluation against multiple published atlases. The NCT provides a convenient means for computing Dice coefficients with spin test permutations to determine the magnitude and statistical significance of correspondence among user-defined maps and existing atlas labels. The NCT also includes functionality to incorporate additional atlases in the future. The adoption of the NCT will make it easier for network neuroscience researchers to report their findings in a standardized manner, thus aiding reproducibility and facilitating comparisons between studies to produce interdisciplinary insights.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Single-dose depletion-AAV administration permanently eliminates lymphocyte subsets in mice while avoiding accessory deficiencies of GEMMs such as marginal zone defects in B cell-deficient animals. Depletion-AAVs can be used irrespective of the animals genetic background, and multiple depletion-AAVs can readily be combined. Exploiting depletion-AAV technology, we show that B cells are required for unimpaired CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to chronic viral infection. Importantly, CD8 T cells fail to suppress viremia when B cells are depleted, and they only help resolving chronic infection if antibodies suppress viral loads.

We hypothesized that a genomic comparison of mutations in pre-treated versus treatment-naive tumors would serve to identify genes that confer resistance. A challenge in such an analysis is that therapy alters mutation burdens and signatures, confounding association studies and complicating identifying causal, selected mutations. We developed DiffInvex, a framework for identifying changes in selection acting on individual genes in somatic genomes. Crucially, DiffInvex draws on a mutation rate baseline that accounts for these shifts in neutral mutagenesis during cancer evolution. We applied DiffInvex to 9,953 cancer whole-genomes from 29 cancer types from 8 studies, containing both WGS of treatment-naive tumors and tumors pre-treated by various drugs, identifying genes where point mutations are under conditional positive or negative selection for a certain chemotherapeutic, suggesting resistance mechanisms occurring via point mutation. DiffInvex confirmed well-known chemoresistance-driver mutations in EGFR, ESR1, KIT and AR genes as being under conditional positive selection, with additional cancer types identified for EGFR and KIT. Additionally, DiffInvex identified 11 genes with treatment-associated selection for different classes of therapeutics. In most cases, these genes were common cancer genes including PIK3CA, APC, MAP2K4 and MAP3K1. This suggests that tumor resistance to therapy via mutation often occurs via selective advantages conferred by known driver genes, rather than via mutations in specialized resistance genes. Various gene-chemotherapy associations were further supported in tests for functional impact of mutations, again implemented in a conditional selection setting, as well as replicating in independent panel or exome sequencing data. In addition to nominating drug resistance genes that could be targeted by future therapeutics, DiffInvex can also be applied to diverse analysis in cancer evolution, such as comparing normal and tumoral tissues, or analyzing subclonal evolution, identifying changes in selection over time.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Given evidence from animal models that thalamic axons modulate windows of cortical plasticity7-12, here we evaluate the overarching hypothesis that structural connections between the thalamus and cortex help to coordinate cortical maturational heterochronicity during youth. We first introduce, cortically annotate, and anatomically validate a new atlas of human thalamocortical connections using diffusion tractography. By applying this atlas to three independent youth datasets (ages 8-23 years; total N = 2,676), we reproducibly demonstrate that thalamocortical connections develop along a maturational gradient that aligns with the cortexs sensorimotor-association axis. Associative cortical regions with thalamic connections that take longest to mature exhibit protracted expression of neurochemical, structural, and functional markers indicative of higher circuit plasticity as well as heightened environmental sensitivity. This work highlights a central role for the thalamus in the orchestration of hierarchically organized and environmentally sensitive windows of cortical developmental malleability.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Understanding the impacts of isolation and culture upon the yield of human islets for research is important for planning research studies and islet distribution to distant laboratories. Here we examine islet isolation and cell culture outcomes at the Alberta Diabetes Institute (ADI) IsletCore (n=197). Research- focused isolations typically have a lower yield of islet equivalents (IEQ), with a median of 252,876 IEQ, but a higher purity (median 85%) than clinically-focused isolations before culture. The median recovery of IEQs after culture was 75%, suggesting some loss. This was associated with a shift towards smaller islet particles, indicating possible islet fragmentation, and occurred within 24 hours with no further loss after longer periods of culture (up to 136 hours). No overall change in stimulation index as a measure of islet function was seen with culture time. These findings were replicated in a representative cohort of clinical islet preparations from the Clinical Islet Transplant Program at the University of Alberta. Thus, loss of islets occurs within 24 hours of isolation and there is no further impact of extended culture prior to islet distribution for research.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

BiomiX incorporates diverse omics data. DESeq2/Limma packages analyze transcriptomics data, while statistical tests determine metabolomics peaks. The metabolomics annotation uses the mass-to-charge ratio in the CEU Mass Mediator database and fragmentation spectra in the TidyMass package while Methylomics analysis is performed using the ChAMP R package. Multiomics Factor Analysis (MOFA) integration and interpretation identifies common sources of variations among omics. BiomiX provides comprehensive outputs, including statistics and report figures, also integrating EnrichR and GSEA for biological process exploration. Subgroup analysis based on user gene panels enhances comparisons. BiomiX implements MOFA automatically, selecting the optimal MOFA model to discriminate the two cohorts being compared while providing interpretation tools for the discriminant MOFA factors. The interpretation relies on innovative bibliography research on Pubmed, which provides the articles most related to the discriminant factor contributors. The interpretation is also supported by clinical data correlation with the discriminant MOFA factors and pathways analyses of the top factor contributors. The integration of single and multi-omics analysis in a standalone tool, together with the implementation of MOFA and its interpretability by literature, constitute a step forward in the multi-omics landscape in line with the FAIR data principles.

Parvalbumin (PV) INs inhibit PCs and are activated by local and extrinsic inputs. Thus, SOM and VIP INs exhibit complementary roles in feedback and feedforward inhibition, respectively, while PV INs contribute to both microcircuit motifs. Functionally, each IN subtype reveals unique activity patterns across fear- and extinction learning with SOM and VIP INs showing most divergent characteristics, and PV INs display an intermediate phenotype parallelling synaptic data. Finally, SOM and PV INs dynamically track behavioral state transitions across learning.

Therefore, the abundance variation of regulatory proteins across unstimulated single cells can be associatively linked with their response to stimulation. Here we developed an approach that leverages this association across individual cells and nuclei to systematically identify potential regulators of biological processes, followed by targeted validation. Specifically, we applied this approach to identify regulators of nucleocytoplasmic protein transport in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To this end, we quantified the proteomes of 3,412 individual nuclei, sampling the dynamic response to LPS treatment, and linking functional variability to proteomic variability. Minutes after the stimulation, the protein transport in individual nuclei correlated strongly with the abundance of known protein transport regulators, thus revealing the impact of natural protein variability on functional cellular response. We found that simple biophysical constraints, such as the quantity of nuclear pores, partially explain the variability in LPS-induced nucleocytoplasmic transport. Among the many proteins newly identified to be associated with the response, we selected 16 for targeted validation by knockdown. The knockdown phenotypes confirmed the inferences derived from natural protein and functional variation of single nuclei, thus demonstrating the potential of (sub-)single-cell proteomics to infer functional regulation. We expect this approach to generalize to broad applications and enhance the functional interpretability of single-cell omics data.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Adolescence is considered a crucial period for the maturation of excitation-inhibition balance. This has been primarily observed in animal studies, yet human in vivo evidence on adolescent maturation of the excitation-inhibition balance at the individual level is limited. Here, we developed an individualized in vivo marker of regional excitation-inhibition balance in human adolescents, estimated using large-scale simulations of biophysical network models fitted to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from two independent cross-sectional (N = 752) and longitudinal (N = 149) cohorts. We found a widespread relative increase of inhibition in association cortices paralleled by a relative age-related increase of excitation, or lack of change, in sensorimotor areas across both datasets. This developmental pattern co-aligned with multiscale markers of sensorimotor-association differentiation. The spatial pattern of excitation-inhibition development in adolescence was robust to inter-individual variability of structural connectomes and modeling configurations. Notably, we found that alternative simulation-based markers of excitation-inhibition balance show a variable sensitivity to maturational change. Taken together, our study highlights an increase of inhibition during adolescence in association areas using cross sectional and longitudinal data, and provides a robust computational framework to estimate microcircuit maturation in vivo at the individual level.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

However, replicating this protocol to match the productivity of the traditional PURE system can take considerable time and effort due to variability in the expression level of individual proteins. In this work, we observed unstable PURE protein expression in two E. coli protein expression strains, M15/pREP4 and BL21(DE3), and addressed this instability using catabolite repression. We identified key proteins whose concentration in the One-Pot PURE mixture significantly impacted the reaction's protein expression capacity. Compared to the original method using two E. coli protein expression strains, we found that consolidating all expression vectors onto one BL21 (DE3) strain led to more uniform cell growth at the time of protein induction, thereby improving the composition of critical translation initiation factors in the purified mixture for efficient translation. We also found that variations in commercial energy solution formulations could compensate for deficiencies in the One-Pot PURE protein composition.

Despite significant progress in understanding these individual processes, the mechanism orchestrating these two fates and their effects on root architecture and secondary growth remain unclear. Here we combined lineage tracing with molecular genetics to study the fate dynamics of XPP cells. We showed that developmentally arrested lateral root primordia (LRP) that fail to emerge as lateral roots, gradually obtain cambium identity thus contributing to secondary growth. Conversely, preestablished procambium identity within XPP cells can be reverted to LR identity when simulated by auxin, an important player in LR development. This competence for auxin-induced LR formation from XPP cells, termed LR potency, however, decreases as the root matures. We found key cambium regulators play essential roles in shaping LR potency by promoting cambium activation and inhibiting LR development. Consistently, corresponding mutants with impaired cambium activity display broader LR potency. Moreover, cytokinins, essential players in cambium development, facilitate the identity transition of LRPs to cambium and reduce LR potency through key cambium regulators. Overall, our findings highlight the inherent cellular plasticity of XPP cells and elucidate how plant hormones influence root architecture and secondary growth through balancing the two cell fates of XPP cells.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

The mitotic spindle, the self-organized microtubule structure driving chromosome segregation, scales in size with the available cytoplasm. Yet, the relationship between spindle size and chromosome movement remains poorly understood. Here, we address how the movement of chromosomes changes during the cleavage divisions of the Drosophila blastoderm. We show that the speed of chromosome separation gradually decreases during the 4 nuclear divisions of the blastoderm. This reduction in speed is accompanied by a similar reduction in the length of the spindle, thus ensuring that these two quantities are tightly linked. Using a combination of genetic and quantitative imaging approaches, we find that two processes contribute to controlling the speed at which chromosomes move at mitotic exit: the activity of molecular motors important for microtubule depolymerization and the cell cycle oscillator. Specifically, we found that the levels of Klp10A, Klp67A, and Klp59C, three kinesin-like proteins important for microtubule depolymerization, contribute to setting the speed of chromosome separation. This observation is supported by quantification of microtubule dynamics indicating that poleward flux rate scales with the length of the spindle. Perturbations of the cell cycle oscillator using heterozygous mutants of mitotic kinases and phosphatases revealed that the duration of anaphase increases during the blastoderm cycles and is the major regulator of chromosome velocity. Thus, our work suggests a potential link between the biochemical rate of mitotic exit and the forces exerted by the spindle.

However, the specific effects that they have on brain health are still poorly understood, preventing its implementation in clinical practice. For instance, the association between such risk factors and cortical thickness (CT) has been primarily explored using univariate/bivariate methods and global/lobar measures of CT and has yielded inconsistent results. In this work, we aim to study the relationship between risk factors for non-communicable diseases and CT. In addition, we adopt a systems-level perspective to understand such relationship, by integrating several brain features including brain structure and function as well as neurotransmitter systems.

Here, we analyzed latent dimensions linking a broad set of risk factors for non-communicable diseases to parcel-wise CT across the whole cortex (including raw, proportional, and brain size- corrected measures). We used a multivariate approach (regularized canonical correlation analysis (RCCA)) embedded in a machine learning framework that allows to capture inter- individual variability and to assess the generalizability of the model. The brain patterns (captured in association with risk factors) were characterized from a multi-level perspective, by comparing them with patterns of brain structure, function, and neurotransmitter systems. Analyses were performed separately in women (n=3685, 46-81 years) and in age-matched men (n=3685, 46-81 years) to avoid sex-bias on the results.

We found one significant latent dimension (women: rrange=0.25-0.30, p=0.005-0.005; men: rrange=0.31-0.34, p=0.005-0.005), capturing variability in cardiometabolic health, including physical activity, body morphology/composition, basal metabolic rate, and blood pressure. This cardiometabolic health dimension was linked to a CT axis of inter-individual variability from the insula and cingulate cortex to occipital and parietal areas. Interestingly, this brain pattern was associated with the binding potentials of several neurotransmitter systems, including serotoninergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic systems. Of note, this latent dimension was similar across sexes and across CT measures (raw, proportional, and brain-size corrected).

We observed a robust, multi-level and multivariate link between cardiometabolic health, CT, and neurotransmitter systems. These findings support the urgency of further investigation into the interaction between brain health and physical health and contributes to the challenge to the classical conceptualization of neuropsychiatric and physical illnesses as categorical entities. Therefore, regular monitoring of cardiometabolic risk factors may reduce their adverse effects on brain health and prevent the development of brain diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Increases in activity during a cognitive task are often assumed to reflect the processing of task-relevant information, while reductions can be interpreted as suppression of irrelevant activity to facilitate task goals. Here, we explore the relationship between task-induced increases and decreases in activity from a geometric perspective. Using a technique known as kriging, developed in earth sciences, we examined whether the spatial organisation of brain regions showing positive activity could be predicted based on the spatial layout of regions showing activity decreases (and vice versa). Consistent with this hypothesis we established the spatial distribution of regions showing reductions in activity could predict (i) regions showing task-relevant increases in activity in both groups of humans and single individuals; (ii) patterns of neural activity captured by calcium imaging in mice; and, (iii) showed a high degree of generalisability across task contexts. Our analysis, therefore, establishes that antagonistic relationships between brain regions are topographically determined, a spatial analog for the well documented anti-correlation between brain systems over time.

Significance StatementIt is well documented that brain activity changes in response to the demands of different situations, although what gives rise to the observed cortical activity patterns remains poorly understood. Using analytic tools from earth sciences, we examined whether the landscape of regional changes in activity emerge from a set of common topographical causes. Using only regions showing decreases in activity, we could predict the landscape of regions showing increases in activity using fMRI in humans and calcium imaging in mice. Our results suggest topographical principles determine the landscape of peaks and valleys in brain activity -- a spatial analog for the well documented anti-correlation between sets of brain regions over time.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Due to the presence of spatial autocorrelation, statistical inference can be challenging; to address this, random permutation approaches based on null models are widely used. Here, we show how that the presence of heterogeneity in the spatial autocorrelation across brain maps may affect statistical inference in common approaches for spatially correlated maps. In response, we highlight the need to explicitly model spatial processes, including non-stationarity, for more accurate statistical inference. We illustrate how a Bayesian spatial regression approach can be applied to compare functional and structural cortical brain maps, even in the presence of heterogeneity. By explicitly modelling spatial processes underlying the data, a much wider and more sophisticated range of neurobiological questions can be answered about the relationship between brain maps than with current approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1719093902457

While the TMEs impact on immunotherapy has been extensively studied, its role in chemotherapy response remains less explored. To address this, we developed DECODEM (DEcoupling Cell-type-specific Outcomes using DEconvolution and Machine learning), a generic computational framework leveraging cellular deconvolution of bulk transcriptomics to associate the gene expression of individual cell types in the TME with clinical response. Employing DECODEM to analyze the gene expression of breast cancer (BC) patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we find that the gene expression of specific immune cells (myeloid, plasmablasts, B-cells) and stromal cells (endothelial, normal epithelial, CAFs) are highly predictive of chemotherapy response, going beyond that of the malignant cells. These findings are further tested and validated in a single-cell cohort of triple negative breast cancer. To investigate the possible role of immune cell-cell interactions (CCIs) in mediating chemotherapy response, we extended DECODEM to DECODEMi to identify such CCIs, validated in single-cell data. Our findings highlight the importance of active pre-treatment immune infiltration for chemotherapy success.

During foraging as well as during sleep, population activity drifted continuously and unidirectionally along a one-dimensional manifold.

While the progression of STING activators into the clinic has been successful, the discovery and clinical progression of STING inhibitors remain elusive. Questions persist about the molecular properties needed to distinguish between a STING activator and inhibitor, particularly within SAVI disease, a monogenic autoinflammatory disease that renders STING constitutively active.3 Here we leverage an orthosteric STING activator and inhibitor from the same chemical series to discover that STING M271 is a critical residue for molecular activation. The M271CH3 NMR chemical shifts reveal a unique molecular signature for pharmacological or genetically driven activation and inhibition that is not captured by x-ray crystallography. Additionally, M271 directly interacts with the most common SAVI mutation, V155M, and using an orthosteric STING inhibitor, we show partial rescue and molecular correction of STING V155M. Finally, these data present insights into therapeutic STING molecular correction for treating SAVI patients. Our results elucidate an unappreciated structural interaction critical for STING modulation that could be utilized as a molecular diagnostic tool for drug discovery. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time how the therapeutic requirements of a molecular corrector differ from an orthosteric STING inhibitor, and why this is important for the SAVI disease population.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

The types and levels of glycans on one cell can be sensed by other cells using carbohydrate-specific binding proteins such as lectins, enabling glycans to regulate cell-cell interactions. Glycans are covalently assembled onto proteins and lipids as they traverse the secretory pathway, a tightly regulated process known as glycosylation and carried out by Golgi-resident enzymes. Errors in glycosylation due to the dysfunctional trafficking of enzymes and substrates in the Golgi are implicated in human diseases. Here we ask how much information about Golgi dysfunction is encoded by surface glycans in single cells. This task is challenging due to high cell-to-cell variability in glycan levels. We exploited the loss-of-adhesion driven disorganization of the Golgi in mouse fibroblasts to generate a highly reproducible gradient of Golgi morphology phenotypes, by titrating the Arf1 inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA). We measured the resulting distribution of cell-surface glycans in single cells using two fluorescently tagged lectin probes (ConA and WGA). A mathematical model of intracellular traffic, parameterized against measurements of Golgi fragmentation and endocytosis, quantitatively explains cell-surface lectin levels across time and BFA concentrations. We used this model to construct an optimal Bayesian decoder and showed that singlecell lectin measurements predict Golgi phenotypes with accuracy far greater than chance. By combining signals from two lectins we further improved prediction accuracy and speed. Such multi-lectin information may be exploited during natural cell-cell communication, and in the development of single-cell diagnostics.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Traditional link prediction (LP) methods, using similarity metrics like Personalized PageRank, are limited in capturing the complexity of biological networks. Recently, representation-based learning techniques have emerged, mapping nodes to low-dimensional embeddings to enhance prediction accuracy. However, these methods often face challenges with interpretability and scalability in large, complex networks. Based on a representation of biological systems as knowledge graphs (KGs), which encode entities and their relationships as triplets, we propose here BioKGC, a novel graph neural network framework which builds upon the Neural Bellman-Ford Network (NBFNet). It addresses the limitations of previous methods by utilizing path-based reasoning for LP in biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs). Unlike node-embedding learning frameworks that optimize the embedding space based on single triplets, BioKGC learns representations between nodes by considering all relations along paths. This approach enhances prediction accuracy and interpretability, allowing for the visualization of influential paths and facilitating the validation of biological plausibility. BioKGC leverages a background regulatory graph (BRG) for enhanced message passing and implements a stringent negative sampling strategy to improve learning precision. In evaluations across various LP tasks, gene function annotation, drug-disease interaction prediction, synthetic lethality prediction, and lncRNA-mRNA regulatory relationship inference, BioKGC consistently outperformed state-of-the art methods. BioKGC outperformed knowledge graph embedding and GNN-based methods in gene function prediction, especially with BRG information. We demonstrated that BioKGC effectively predicts drug-disease interactions in zero-shot learning scenarios, surpassing state-of-the-art models like TxGNN. Additionally, BioKGC demonstrated robust performance in synthetic lethality prediction and the capacity for scoring novel lncRNA-mRNA interactions, showcasing its versatility in diverse biomedical applications. One of BioKGC's key advantages is its interpretability, enabling researchers to trace prediction paths and gain insights into molecular mechanisms. Combined with its use of regulatory information for message passing, BioKGC is a powerful tool for predicting complex biological interactions, making it valuable for drug discovery and personalized medicine.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Here, we leveraged unbiased single-nucleus transcriptional profiling to identify expression of the secreted glycoprotein Reelin (encoded by the Reln gene) as a marker of cocaine-activated neuronal ensembles within the rat NAc. Multiplexed in situ detection confirmed selective expression of the immediate early gene Fos in Reln+ neurons after cocaine experience, and also revealed enrichment of Reln mRNA in Drd1+ medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in both the rat and human brain. Using a novel CRISPR interference strategy enabling selective Reln knockdown in the adult NAc, we observed altered expression of genes linked to calcium signaling, emergence of a transcriptional trajectory consistent with loss of cocaine sensitivity, and a striking decrease in MSN intrinsic excitability.

Many of the specimens studied have been excavated and stored for a significant duration prior to their proteomic analysis. Human handling and storage environments therefore provide ample opportunities for protein contamination onto and into specimens of interest to palaeoproteomic studies. As such, modern protein contamination limits access to endogenous proteomes. Here, we compare five approaches of bone protein decontamination applied to a Pleistocene Equus sp. bone fragment contaminated with a modern dog salivary proteome. We find that all tested methods reduce the protein contamination, but with different efficiencies. We find that a brief bleach wash is the most effective approach in removing modern protein contamination, and that no additional damage is caused to the endogenous proteome by this treatment. Next, we apply this approach to a hominin tooth found at Khudji, a Late Pleistocene archaeological site in Tajikistan. We demonstrate that a brief bleach wash removes almost all human skin protein contamination while retaining the endogenous hominin dentine proteome. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of the Khudji dentine proteome allowed determination that the specimen likely represents a Neanderthal, extending the fossil evidence for Neanderthals in Central Asia.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Despite years of study, however, how Notch induces the transcription of its target genes remains unclear. Here, we comprehensively examined the response to human Notch1 across a time course of activation using genomic assays of nascent RNA and chromatin accessibility. These data revealed that Notch induces target gene transcription primarily by releasing paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), in contrast to prevailing models suggesting that Notch acts by promoting chromatin accessibility. Indeed, we found that open chromatin is established at Notch-responsive regulatory elements prior to Notch signaling, through SWI/SNF-mediated remodeling. Notch activation, however, elicited no further chromatin opening at these loci. Together, these studies reveal that the nuclear response to Notch signaling is dictated by the pre-existing chromatin state and RNAPII distribution at time of signal activation.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

To solve this ambiguity, animals form hierarchical associations in which the context acts as a gatekeeper in the retrieval of the appropriate cue-evoked memory, ensuring context-appropriate behavior. These hierarchical associative structures also influence future learning by promoting the formation of new context-dependent associations (leading to the inference of context-dependency for new associations). The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the dorsal hippocampus (DH) are both proposed to encode a ""cognitive map"" that includes the representation of hierarchical, context-dependent, associations. However the causal role of the OFC and DH in the different functional properties of hierarchical associations remains controversial. Here we used chemogenetic inactivations, in rats, to examine the role of OFC and DH in 1) the contextual regulation of performance, and 2) the contextual learning bias conferred by hierarchical associations. We show that OFC is required for both manifestations of hierarchical associations. In contrast, DH contribution appears limited to the contextual learning bias. This study provides novel insight into the different functional properties of context-dependent hierarchical associations, and establishes the OFC as a critical orchestrator of these different contextual effects.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Given the paucity of approved therapeutic strategies for this lifestyle disorder, dietary interventions may prove effective. We evaluated how green jackfruit flour (JF) prevents MASH and progression to HCC and its underlying mechanisms. The study utilized two murine models that mimicked human MASLD disease: (i) a diet-induced MASH model; (ii) a MASH-HCC model induced by diet and a very low dose of CCl4. C57Bl/6 mice were fed with chow (CD) or western diet (WD) with normal (NW) or sugar water (SW) for 12 weeks, then randomized to receive either 5 kcal% green jackfruit flour (JF) or an equal volume of placebo flour (PB). The biochemical, histological, and molecular analyses were assessed. JF significantly reduced body weight, liver injury, insulin resistance, and alleviated obesity, steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor development in WDSW or WDSW/CCl4 mice compared to placebo groups. Furthermore, JF activated AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and inhibited MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways in MASH and MASH-HCC experimental models, respectively. This was supported by sodium propionate treatment, the primary short-chain fatty acid entering the liver from JFs soluble fiber microbial fermentation, which also regulated AMPK and MAPK signaling in cellular models of MASH and HCC, respectively. Hence, our findings present strong evidence of JFs therapeutic potential in the prevention of MASH and MASH-HCC, warranting further investigation of JFs efficacy as a dietary intervention in clinical trials.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Here, we identify a unique molecular battle between the classical biotype of Vibrio cholerae and virulent phages ICP1, ICP2, and ICP3. We show that classical biotype strains resist almost all isolates of these phages due to a 25-kb genomic island harboring several putative anti-phage systems. We observed that one of these systems, Nezha, encoding SIR2-like and helicase proteins, inhibited the replication of all three phages. Bacterial SIR2-like enzymes degrade the essential metabolic coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), thereby preventing replication of the invading phage. In support of this mechanism, we identified one phage isolate, ICP1_2001, which circumvents Nezha by encoding two putative NAD+ regeneration enzymes. By restoring the NAD+ pool, we hypothesize that this system antagonizes Nezha without directly interacting with either protein and should be able to antagonize other anti-phage systems that deplete NAD+.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Here we present a unique set of vectors together with a novel assembly strategy designed to overcome these limitations. It allows for the generation of expression constructs for multi-subunit protein complexes for various hosts in a single cloning step. Its modular nature allows the system to be easily extended to target additional expression hosts or to include new tags or regulatory sequences.

Control of gene expression by GPCRs has been studied almost exclusively at the transcriptional level, neglecting an extensive amount of regulation that takes place translationally. Hence, little is known about the nature and mechanisms of gene-specific post-transcriptional regulation downstream of receptor activation. Here, we apply an unbiased multiomics approach to delineate an extensive translational regulatory program initiated by the prototypical beta2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2-AR) and provide mechanistic insights into how these processes are orchestrated. Using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), we identify nearly 120 novel gene targets of adrenergic receptor activity which expression is exclusively regulated at the level of translation. We next show that all translational changes are induced selectively by endosomal {beta}2-ARs. We further report that this proceeds through activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Specifically, within the set of translational GPCR targets we discover significant enrichment of genes with 5 terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, a gene class classically known to be translationally regulated by mTOR. We then demonstrate that endosomal {beta}2-ARs are required for mTOR activation and subsequent mTOR-dependent TOP mRNA translation. Together, this comprehensive analysis of drug-induced translational regulation establishes a critical role for location-biased GPCR signaling in fine-tuning the cellular protein landscape.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Responses to sub-lethal abiotic stress combinations are complex and often distinct from responses to individual stresses and remain poorly understood. Investigating traits and molecular factors mediating acclimation to stress combinations is essential for the development of climate change-resilient field crops. Here, we studied the morphological, physiological, and molecular responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to i) co-occurring high temperature and drought and ii) flooding sequentially followed by drought, both of which have increased in frequency due to climate change. A set of 15 physiological and morphological traits were assessed during single and combined stresses. By combining these comprehensive trait analyses with transcriptome characterization, we established the generally additive effects of simultaneous or sequential stresses on plant morphology and physiology compared to the corresponding individual stresses. Although drought had a mild effect in both stress combinations, a unique transcriptome signature emerged upon combination with high temperature simultaneously or flooding sequentially. Molecular processes identified as important for multi-stress resilience included plastid-nucleus communication, ABA signaling and photo-acclimation. Based on the RNA-seq data, a set of 39 genes was identified as potential multi-stress response regulators. Mutants were tested to validate their contribution to plant survival and phenotypic acclimation under combined stress. We confirmed the involvement of several genes in regulating phenotypic acclimation traits.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022).

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Here, we report chronic neurological dysfunction in mice infected with a virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 that does not infect the brain. Long after recovery from nasal infection, we observed loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in olfactory bulb glomeruli and neurotransmitter levels in the substantia nigra (SN) persisted. Vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in these brain areas was accompanied by increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and neurobehavioral changes. RNAseq analysis unveiled persistent microglia activation, as found in human neurodegenerative diseases. Early treatment with antivirals (nirmatrelvir and molnupiravir) reduced virus titers and lung inflammation but failed to prevent neurological abnormalities, as observed in patients. Together these results show that chronic deficiencies in neuronal function in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice are not directly linked to ongoing olfactory epithelium dysfunction. Rather, they bear similarity with neurodegenerative disease, the vulnerability of which is exacerbated by chronic inflammation.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded. We report the value of wastewater sequencing to track avian influenza.","NA","medrxiv",1719093902457

The central biological question about HD pathogenesis has been how the disease-causing DNA repeat expansion (CAGn) in the huntingtin (HTT) gene leads to neurodegeneration after decades of apparent latency. Inherited HTT alleles with a longer CAG repeat hasten disease onset; the length of this repeat also changes over time, generating somatic mosaicism, and genes that regulate DNA-repeat stability can influence HD age-at-onset. To understand the relationship between a cells CAG-repeat length and its biological state, we developed a single-cell method for measuring CAG-repeat length together with genome-wide RNA expression. We found that the HTT CAG repeat expands from 40-45 CAGs to 100-500+ CAGs in HD-vulnerable SPNs but not in other striatal cell types, with these long DNA-repeat expansions acquired at different times by individual SPNs. Surprisingly, somatic expansion from 40 to 150 CAGs had no apparent effect upon gene expression - but neurons with 150-500+ CAGs shared profound gene-expression changes. These expression changes involved hundreds of genes, escalated alongside further CAG-repeat expansion, eroded positive and then negative features of neuronal identity, and culminated in expression of senescence/apoptosis genes. Rates of striatal neuron loss across HD stages reflected the rates at which neurons entered this biologically distorted state. Our results suggest that HTT CAG repeats in striatal neurons undergo decades of biologically quiet expansion, then, as they asynchronously cross a high threshold, cause SPNs to degenerate quickly and asynchronously. We conclude that, at any moment in the course of HD, most neurons have an innocuous (but unstable) huntingtin gene, and that HD pathogenesis is a DNA process for almost all of a neurons life.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1719093902457

These ruminants were presumed not to be hosts for IAVs. Previously, IAV-positive mammalian species were hunters and scavengers, possibly getting infected while feeding on infected birds. It is now presumed that H5N1 viruses that circulate in US dairy cattle transmit through a mammary gland route, in contrast to transmission by aerosols via the respiratory tract, although the latter cannot be excluded. The receptor display in the mammary and respiratory tract in cows for IAVs is unknown. Here, we used recombinant HA proteins representing current circulating and classical H5 viruses to determine the distribution of IAV receptors in the respiratory and mammary tract tissues of cows and goats. Most of the sialome of the cow and goat respiratory tract is lined with sialic acid modifications such as N-glycolyl and O-acetyl, which are not bound by IAV. Interestingly, the H5 protein representing the cow isolates bound significantly in the mammary gland, whereas classical H5 proteins failed to do so. Furthermore, whereas the 9-O-acetyl modification is prominent in all tissues tested, the 5-N-glycolyl modification is not, resulting in the display of receptors for avian IAV hemagglutinins. This could explain the high levels of virus found in these tissues and milk, adding supporting data to this possible virus transmission route.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

Here, we present a blueprint for assessing the national carbon sequestration capacity of kelp forests in which data synthesis and Bayesian hierarchical modelling enable estimates of kelp forest carbon production, storage, and export capacity from limited data. Applying this blueprint to Canadas extensive coastline, we find kelp forests store an estimated 1.4 Tg C in short-term biomass and produce 3.1 Tg C yr-1 with modest carbon fluxes to the deep ocean. Arctic kelps had the highest carbon stocks and production capacity, while Pacific kelps had greater carbon fluxes overall due to their higher productivity and export rates. Our transparent, reproducible blueprint represents an important step towards accurate carbon accounting for kelp forests.","NA","biorxiv",1719093902457

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1719093902457

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.
