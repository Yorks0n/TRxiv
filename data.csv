To control the infection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron JN.1 subvariants, JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccines have been developed. Some previous reports showed that the JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccine of Pfizer/BioNTech (US/Germany) increased antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 subvariants and XEC. However, the efficacy of other available JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccines (e.g., Daiichi-Sankyo, Japan) remains unassessed. To validate the antiviral efficacy induced by JN.1 mRNA vaccines, sera were collected from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech JN.1 mRNA vaccine (N=15) or Daiichi-Sankyo JN.1 mRNA vaccine (N=19) before and 3-4 weeks after vaccination. We then performed a neutralization assay using these sera and pseudoviruses. Both Pfizer/BioNTech JN.1 vaccine (2.4- to 8.0-fold, P=0.0001) and Daiichi-Sankyo JN.1 vaccine (2.3- to 13-fold, P=0.0001) boosted antiviral humoral immunity against all variants tested with statistical significance. While the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine encodes the full-length JN.1 spike (S), the Daiichi-Sankyo mRNA vaccine encodes the receptor-binding domain of JN.1 S. Our data suggest that the receptor-binding domain of JN.1 S can effectively induce antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 subvariants and XEC comparable to the full-length JN.1 S. However, it should be considered that the sizes of our cohorts are relatively small (<20 donors per cohort), and donor characteristics, such as age, sex, underlying disease status, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, may critically affect the experimental results. Future investigations with larger cohorts will address this concern. When compared to vaccination with JN.1 mRNA vaccines, our previous investigations showed that the natural infection of JN.1 and KP.3.3 elicited poorer antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 and its subvariants. Our results suggest that the JN.1 mRNA vaccination more robustly induces antiviral humoral immunity against recent JN.1 subvariants than the natural infection of JN.1 subvariants regardless of manufacturer. Moreover, as we reported last year, the humoral immunity induced by XBB.1.5 monovalent mRNA vaccine against XBB.1.5 was weaker than that against ancestral B.1.1. However, in the case of JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccine, here we showed that the 50% neutralization titer against XBB.1.5 is greater than that against ancestral B.1.1. These observations imply that immune imprinting has shifted from that biased toward pre-Omicron to that biased toward Omicron, depending on the time and/or number of immune stimuli (e.g., infection and/or vaccination).","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Gut microbiome profiling was performed using full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Elevated interleukin-6 levels were observed in the most severe cases, indicating systemic inflammation. Reduced gut bacterial diversity was more pronounced in women and obese patients and correlated with higher disease severity. The presence of the genus Mitsuokella was significantly associated with increased physical, stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, and Granulicatella with critically ill patients.

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty. We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1732226959300

However, the specific mechanisms by which viral proteins influence cholesterol remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cholesterol sequestration within lysosomes, with the viral protein ORF3a identified as the primary driver of this effect. Mechanistically, we found that ORF3a interacts directly with the HOPS complex subunit VPS39 through a hydrophobic interface formed by residues W193 and Y184. A W193A mutation in ORF3a significantly rescues cholesterol egress and corrects the mislocalization of the lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC2, which is caused by defective trafficking of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) sorting receptor, the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). We further observed a marked reduction in bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a lipid essential for lysosomal cholesterol egress, in both SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and ORF3a-expressing cells, suggesting BMP reduction as an additional mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-caused cholesterol sequestration. Inhibition of lysosomal cholesterol egress using the compound U18666A significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting a potential viral strategy of manipulating lysosomal cholesterol to modulate host cell susceptibility. Our findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a disrupts cellular cholesterol transport by altering lysosomal protein trafficking and BMP levels, providing new insights into virus-host interactions that contribute to lipid dysregulation in infected cells.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Although the ability of Stentor to habituate has been extensively documented, the mechanism of learning is currently not known. Here we take a bottom-up approach and investigate a simple biochemistry-based model based on prior electrophysiological measurements in Stentor along with general properties of receptor molecules. In this model, a mechanoreceptor senses the stimulus and leads to channel opening to change membrane potential, with a sufficient change in polarization triggering an action potential that drives contraction. Receptors that are activated can become internalized, after which they can either be degraded or recycled back to the cell surface. This activity-dependent internalization provides a potential means for the cell to learn. Stochastic simulations of this model confirm that it is capable of showing habituation similar to what is seen in actual Stentor cells, including the lack of dishabituation by strong stimuli and the apparently step-like response of individual cells during habituation. The model also can account for several habituation hallmarks that a previous two-state Markov model could not, namely, the dependence of habituation rate on stimulus magnitude, which had to be added onto the two state model but arises naturally in the receptor inactivation model; the rate of response recovery after cessation of stimulation; the ability of high frequency stimulus sequences to drive faster habituation that results in a lower response probability, and the potentiation of habituation by repeated rounds of training and recovery. The model makes the prediction that application of high force stimuli that do not normally habituate should drive habituation to weaker stimuli due to decrease in the receptor number, which serves as an internal hidden variable. We confirmed this prediction using two new sets of experiments involving alternation of weak and strong stimuli. Furthermore, the model predicts that training with high force stimuli delays response recovery to low force stimuli, which aligns with our new experimental data. The model also predicts subliminal accumulation, wherein continuation of training even after habituation has reached asymptotic levels should lead to delayed response recovery, which was also confirmed by new experiments. The model is unable to account for the phenomenon of rate sensitivity, in which habituation caused by higher frequency stimuli is more easily reversed leading to a frequency dependence of response recovery. Such rate sensitivity has not been reported in Stentor. Here we carried out a new set of experiments which are consistent with the models prediction of the lack of rate sensitivity. This work demonstrates how a simple model can suggest new ways to probe single-cell learning at an experimental level. Finally, we interpret the model in terms of a kernel estimator that the cell may use to guide its decisions about how to response to new stimuli as they arise based on information, or the lack thereof, from past stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

In this study, we investigated differences in tissue tropism of two HPAI H5N1 strains, the isolate A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (VN1203) isolated from a fatal human case in 2004 and the bovine isolate A/Bovine/Ohio/B24osu-342/2024 (Bov342) isolated in 2024, in C57BL/6J mice. Infection with either HPAI H5N1 isolate was uniformly lethal in mice. However, tissue tropism differed significantly: while VN1203 replication was largely restricted to the respiratory tract, Bov342 successfully replicated in the respiratory tract as well as various regions of the brain. Bov342-challenged animals exhibited clinical signs consistent with central nervous system (CNS) infection, and infectious virus was detected in brain tissue. Correspondingly, cytokine profiles in the brain differed significantly between the isolates. Notably, in addition to abundant evidence of CNS infection in Bov342-challenged mice via immunohistochemistry, sporadic intranuclear and intracytoplasmic immunoreactivity was observed in other tissues in the head, including the choroid plexus, retina, and inner ear. This study demonstrates that while both HPAI H5N1 isolates are uniformly lethal in C57BL/6J mice upon aerosol exposure, significant differences exist in tissue tropism, with Bov342 resulting in respiratory disease as well as increased neurotropism and inflammation in the brain and nasal turbinates compared to VN1203, which predominantly induces respiratory disease.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Likelihood-free approaches optimize a least square objective and have gained popularity in recent years due to their scalability. However, this comes at the cost of accuracy in the ancestry estimates in more complex admixture scenarios. We present a new model-based approach, fastmixture, which adopts aspects from likelihood-free approaches for parameter initialization, followed by a mini-batch expectation-maximization procedure to model the standard likelihood. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that the model-based approaches of fastmixture and ADMIXTURE are significantly more accurate than recent and likelihood-free approaches. We further show that fastmixture runs approximately 30x faster than ADMIXTURE on both simulated and empirical data from the 1000 Genomes Project such that our model-based approach scales to much larger sample sizes than previously possible.

Representation learning methods summarize high-dimensional single-cell data into a manageable latent space in a typically nonlinear fashion, allowing cross-sample integration or generative modeling. However, these methods often produce entangled representations, limiting interpretability and downstream analyses. Existing disentanglement methods instead either require supervised information or impose sparsity and linearity, which may not capture the complexity of biological data. We, therefore, introduce Disentangled Representation Variational Inference (DRVI), an unsupervised deep generative model that learns nonlinear, disentangled representations of single-cell omics. This is achieved by combining recently introduced additive decoders with nonlinear pooling, for which we theoretically prove disentanglement under reasonable assumptions. We validate DRVIs disentanglement capabilities across diverse relevant biological problems, from development to perturbational studies and cell atlases, decomposing, for example, the Human Lung Cell Atlas into meaningful, interpretable latent dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that if applied to batch integration, DRVIs integration quality does not suffer from the disentanglement constraints and instead is on par with entangled integration methods. With its disentangled latent space, DRVI is inherently interpretable and facilitates the identification of rare cell types, provides novel insights into cellular heterogeneity beyond traditional cell types, and highlights developmental stages.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

However, the extent to which sleep has been lost across cave populations, and whether sleep loss occurs in wild fish, is poorly understood. We have measured sleep and locomotor activity in 15 distinct populations of A. mexicanus representing multiple lineages that are broadly representative of the 34 cavefish populations identified to date. Strikingly, sleep was largely lost in all cave and hybrid populations that were tested. Hybrid populations retained intermediate eye and pigmentation phenotypes, suggesting sleep loss precedes cave-associated morphological changes. Mapping behavioral changes onto the phylogeny of A. mexicanus populations revealed that independent loss of sleep and elevated locomotor activity has occurred at least three times. Analysis of sleep in the wild confirms that the sleep loss phenotype observed in lab-reared fish is also present in the natural environment. Together, these findings reveal deep evolutionary convergence on sleep loss in cavefish and provide evidence for sleep loss as a primary trait contributing to cave adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

The presence of spectrally broad ('white') light is therefore the exclusive remit of the visual foreground. However, if and how aquatic visual systems exploit this 'white effect' as an inductive bias, for example to judge distance, remains unknown. By combining two-photon imaging with hyperspectral stimulation, genetic cone-type ablation, and behaviour, we here show that zebrafish suppress neural responses to the visual background by contrasting 'greyscale' and 'colour' circuits that emerge at the first synapse of vision. To do so, zebrafish use an early retinal architecture that fundamentally differs from that of mammals: Rather than combining cone signals to drive the retinal output leading to behaviour, zebrafish vision is built around competing ancestral cone systems: Red/UV versus green/blue. Of these, the non-opponent red and UV cones, which are retained in mammals, are necessary and sufficient for vision. By contrast, the colour opponent green and blue cones, which are lost in mammals, form a net-suppressive 'auxiliary' system that shape the 'core' drive from red and UV cones. Our insights challenge the long-held notions that cones act in concert to drive visual behaviour, and that their spectral diversity primarily serves colour vision. Instead, we posit that vertebrate vision is ancestrally built upon opposing cone systems that emerged to exploit the strong spectral interactions of light with water. This alternative view points at terrestrialisation, not nocturnalisation, as the leading driver for visual circuit reorganisation in mammals.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Despite considerable progress in physics-based methods for peptide design and deep-learning methods for protein design, there are currently no robust approaches for de novo design of protein-binding macrocycles. Here, we introduce RFpeptides, a denoising diffusion-based pipeline for designing macrocyclic peptide binders against protein targets of interest. We test 20 or fewer designed macrocycles against each of four diverse proteins and obtain medium to high-affinity binders against all selected targets. Designs against MCL1 and MDM2 demonstrate KD between 1-10 M, and the best anti-GABARAP macrocycle binds with a KD of 6 nM and a sub-nanomolar IC50 in vitro. For one of the targets, RbtA, we obtain a high-affinity binder with KD < 10 nM despite starting from the target sequence alone due to the lack of an experimentally determined target structure. X-ray structures determined for macrocycle-bound MCL1, GABARAP, and RbtA complexes match very closely with the computational design models, with three out of the four structures demonstrating Ca RMSD of less than 1.5 [A] to the design models. In contrast to library screening approaches for which determining binding mode can be a major bottleneck, the binding modes of RFpeptides-generated macrocycles are known by design, which should greatly facilitate downstream optimization. RFpeptides thus provides a powerful framework for rapid and custom design of macrocyclic peptides for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

We developed a new, integrated approach to analyze the sequence, modification, and aminoacylation state of tRNA molecules in a high throughput nanopore sequencing experiment, leveraging a chemical ligation that embeds the charged amino acid in an adapted tRNA molecule. During nanopore sequencing, the embedded amino acid generates unique distortions in ionic current and translocation speed, enabling application of machine learning approaches to classify charging status and amino acid identity. Specific applications of the method indicate it will be broadly useful for examining relationships and dependencies between tRNA sequence, modification, and aminoacylation.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Barrier formation requires positioning of functional tight junctions (TJ) to the most suprabasal viable layer of the epidermis through a mechanical circuit that is driven by generation of high tension at adherens junctions. However, what allows the sensing of tension build-up at these adhesions and how this tension is balanced to match the requirements of tissue mechanical properties is unclear. Here we show that the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 is essential for the maturation of intercellular junctions into functional, continuous adhesions. Deletion of Piezo1 results in an imbalance of cell contractility and membrane tension, leading to a delay in adhesion maturation. Consequently, the requirement for Piezo1 activity can be bypassed by lowering contractility or elevating membrane tension. In vivo, Piezo1 function in adhesion integrity becomes essential only in aged mice where alterations in tissue mechanics lead to impaired TJs and barrier dysfunction. Collectively these studies reveal an essential function of Piezo1 in the timely establishment and maintenance of cell-cell junctions in the context of a mechanically tensed epidermis.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and its deficiency induces extensive reprogramming of growth and defense strategies in plants. This process involves Phosphate Starvation Response 1 (PHR1), a master regulator of the Phosphate Starvation Response (PSR). In this study, we identify a novel, non-canonical role for TORC1 in regulating P starvation responses in Arabidopsis. We demonstrate that P limitation activates TORC1, leading to the stabilization of PHR1. Inhibition of TORC1 increased sensitivity to P starvation, accompanied by disruption of starvation-induced transcriptional reprogramming. Additionally, our results reveal that the TORC1-PHR1 signaling axis plays a crucial role in reprogramming the expression of genes involved in the plant immune signaling network. This regulation is critical for the symbiotic association with the endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica under P starvation. These findings underscore the significant role of the TORC1-PHR1 module in orchestrating the PSR and highlight the evolutionary adaptation of TORC1 signaling pathways in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

This review investigates whether excess weight increases the risk of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with PCC. Methods: Studies published up to July 2023 were searched independently across eight electronic databases to evaluate the risk of developing neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms more than 12 weeks post-infection between exposure and controls groups (excess weight vs. normal weight; obesity vs. non-obesity). Meta-analyses were conducted under a random-effects model. Results: Of the 10,122 abstracts screened, 18 studies (n = 139,091 adults) met the inclusion criteria and reported PCC symptoms according to nutritional status. These studies included 79,050 individuals with excess weight vs 57,926 normal-weight individuals and 30,694 individuals with obesity vs 107,612 non-obese individuals. The presence of excess weight in PCC significantly increased the risk of depression (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.03-1.42), headache (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.09-1.35), memory issues (RR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.24-1.65), sleep disturbance (RR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.16-1.48), and vertigo (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04-1.41).

Endothelial cells (ECs) of the BBB are enwrapped by mural cells including pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) that regulate angiogenesis, vessel stability and barrier function. To explore mural cell control of the BBB, we investigated neurovascular phenotypes in zebrafish pdgfrb mutants that lack brain pericytes and vSMCs. As expected, mutants showed an altered cerebrovascular network with mis-patterned capillaries. Unexpectedly, mutants displayed no BBB leakage from larval through to young adult stages. This demonstrates that pericytes and vSMCs do not control BBB function in young zebrafish. Instead, we observed adult BBB disruption occurring at ""hotspot"" focal haemorrhages at major vessel aneurysms. ECs at leakage hotspots showed induction of caveolae on abluminal surfaces and major structural defects including basement membrane thickening and disruption. Our work suggests that capillary pericytes regulate cerebrovascular patterning in development and vSMCs of major arteries protect from haemorrhage and BBB breakdown in older zebrafish. The fact that young zebrafish can have a conserved BBB with intact barrier function in the absence of mural cells, warrants renewed interrogation of the paradigm of mural cell control of the BBB.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Thirty healthy, untrained participants conducted either periodic RT (RT1-DT-RT2, n=17) or a 10-week no-training control period (n=13) followed by 20 weeks of RT (n=11). RT included twice-weekly supervised whole-body RT sessions, and resting vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained for proteomics analysis using high-end DIA-PASEF's mass spectrometry. First RT period altered 150 proteins (93% increased) involved in e.g. energy metabolism, cytokine signalling, and protein processing compared with minor changes during the no-training control period. The proteome adaptations were similar after the second RT compared to baseline demonstrating reproducibility in proteome adaptations to RT. Many of the proteins were reversed towards baseline after detraining and increased again after retraining. These reversible proteins were especially involved in aerobic energy metabolism. Interestingly, several proteins remain elevated after detraining, including carbonyl reductase 1, histone H1.5, and many calcium-binding proteins. Specifically, Calpain 2 (CAPN2), a calcium-activated protease was recently identified as an epigenetic muscle memory gene. We show for the first time that human skeletal muscle experiences retained levels of several proteins even into detraining. This shows that resistance training evokes long-term protein changes in skeletal muscle and is the first study to demonstrate a proteomic memory of muscle growth following resistance training in human skeletal muscle.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Compared with 3 Tesla (3T) MRI, 7 Tesla (7T) MRI can detect more subtle injuries, including hippocampal subfield volume differences and additional standard biomarkers such as white matter lesions. 7T MRI could help with the interpretation of the various persistent post-acute and distal onset sequelae of COVID-19 infection.

ObjectiveTo investigate the differences in white matter hyperintensity (WMH), hippocampal subfields volumes, and cognition between patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and non-hospitalized participants in a multi-site/multi-national cohort.

DesignOriginal investigation of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between 5/2020 and 10/2022 in 3 USA and 1 UK medical centers with follow-up at hospital discharge.

ParticipantsA total of 179 participants without a history of dementia completed cognitive, mood and other assessments and MRI scans.

ExposureCOVID-19 severity, as measured by hospitalization vs no hospitalization

Main Outcomes and Measures7T MRI scans were acquired. All WMH and hippocampal subfield volumes were corrected for intracranial volumes to account for subject variability. Cognition was assessed using a comprehensive battery of tests. Pearson correlations and unpaired t-tests were performed to assess correlations and differences between hospitalized and non-hospitalized groups.

ResultsWe found similar WMH volume (4112 vs 3144mm3, p=0.2131), smaller hippocampal volume (11856 vs 12227mm3, p=0.0497) and lower cognitive and memory performance, especially the MoCA score (24.9 vs 26.4 pts, p=0.0084), duration completing trail making test B (97.6 vs 79.4 seconds, p=0.0285), Craft immediate recall (12.6 vs 16.4 pts, p<0.0001), Craft delay recall (12.0 vs 15.6 pts, p=0.0001), and Benson figure copy (15.2 vs 16.1 pts, p=0.0078) in 52 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (19[37%] female; mean[SD] age, 61.1[7.4] years) compared with 111 age-matched non-hospitalized participants (66[59%] female; mean[SD] age, 61.5[8.4] years).

Conclusions and RelevanceOur results indicate that hospitalized COVID-19 cases show lower hippocampal volume when compared to non-hospitalized participants. We also show that WMH and hippocampal volumes correlate with worse cognitive scores in hospitalized patients compared with non-hospitalized participants, potentially indicating recent lesions and atrophy.

Key PointsQuestion: Do white matter hyperintensity burden, hippocampal whole and subfield volumes, and cognition differ between patients hospitalized with COVID-19 versus participants without hospitalization?

Findings: We found no significant difference in white matter hyperintensity volume, but hippocampal volume was reduced, and cognitive and memory performance were worse in those hospitalized for COVID-19 compared with age-matched non-hospitalized group (either mild COVID-19 or no COVID-19 reported). In the hospitalized group, increased white matter hyperintensity and reduced hippocampal volumes are significantly higher correlated with worse cognitive and memory scores.

Meaning: Adults hospitalized for COVID-19 had lower hippocampal volumes and worse cognitive performance than adults with COVID-19 that did not lead to hospitalization or without reported COVID-19 infection.","NA","medrxiv",1732226959300

We developed and externally validated a noise-resilient single-lead AI-ECG algorithm that can detect SHD and predict the risk of their development using wearable/portable devices.

MethodsUsing 266,740 ECGs from 99,205 patients with paired echocardiographic data at Yale New Haven Hospital, we developed ADAPT-HEART, a noise-resilient, deep-learning algorithm, to detect SHD using lead I ECG. SHD was defined as a composite of LVEF<40%, moderate or severe left-sided valvular disease, and severe LVH. ADAPT-HEART was validated in four community hospitals in the US, and the population-based cohort of ELSA-Brasil. We assessed the models performance as a predictive biomarker among those without baseline SHD across hospital-based sites and the UK Biobank.

ResultsThe development population had a median age of 66 [IQR, 54-77] years and included 49,947 (50.3%) women, with 18,896 (19.0%) having any SHD. ADAPT-HEART had an AUROC of 0.879 (95% CI, 0.870-0.888) with good calibration for detecting SHD in the test set, and consistent performance in hospital-based external sites (AUROC: 0.852-0.891) and ELSA-Brasil (AUROC: 0.859). Among those without baseline SHD, high vs. low ADAPT-HEART probability conferred a 2.8- to 5.7-fold increase in the risk of future SHD across data sources (all P<0.05).

ConclusionsWe propose a novel model that detects and predicts a range of SHDs from noisy single-lead ECGs obtainable on portable/wearable devices, providing a scalable strategy for community-based screening and risk stratification for SHD.","NA","medrxiv",1732226959300

While highly effective in tumors with high mutational burden, lowly mutated cancers, including pediatric malignancies, present low response rate and limited predictive biomarkers. Here, we present a framework for the identification and validation of tumor-reactive T cells as a biomarker to quantify ICI efficacy and as candidates for a personalized TCR-T cell therapy. Therefore, we profiled a pediatric malignant rhabdoid tumor patient with complete remission after ICI therapy using deep single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the peripheral blood. Specifically, we tracked T cell dynamics longitudinally from the tumor to cells in circulating over a time course of 12 months, revealing a systemic response and durable clonal expansion of tumor-resident and ICI-induced TCR clonotypes. We functionally validated tumor reactivity of TCRs identified from the TME and the blood by co-culturing patient-derived tumor cells with TCR-engineered autologous T cells. Here, we observed unexpectedly high frequencies of tumor-reactive TCR clonotypes in the TME and confirmed T cell dynamics in the blood post-ICI to predict tumor-reactivity. These findings strongly support spatio-temporal tracking of T cell activity in response to ICI to inform therapy efficacy and to serve as a source of tumor-reactive TCRs for personalized TCR-T designs.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

In tested bacteria, targeting drives efficient homologous recombination in tested bacteria, offering flexible and scar-free genome editing without base replacement nor counterselection.

Overexpressing the subunits RPB1, RPB3 and RPB4 in cells we find that these induce DNA damage. However, the mechanisms behind this increased genome instability are specific for each subunit, linked to the unique transcription alterations generated by the subunit overexpression. Importantly, we find significant overlap between the genes with more DNA damage in our cell line models and those more affected in cancers with subunit upregulation, indicating that upregulations could be responsible for some of the phenotypes present in these patients.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Our toolbox can detect less than 3x10-7 ng of DNA (100 attoMolar) or 102 CFU/mL. High concordance was observed when comparing the C12a toolbox with sequenced genomes and antibiotic susceptibility tests for the blaCTX-M-15 and floR antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which confer resistance to cefotaxime and other {beta}- lactams, and amphenicols, respectively. C12aINT, designed to detect the Integrase 1 gene, confirmed a high prevalence of the integrase/integron system in E. coli containing multiple ARGs.

Systematic perturbation studies reveal that silencing recent TFs disrupts normal cell cycle progression, which we experimentally confirm for ZNF519, a simian-restricted KZFP.

In Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), considerable evidence shows that the dynamics between residual leukemia and the patients immune system can result in either sustained disease control, leading to treatment-free remission (TFR), or disease recurrence. The question remains how to integrate mechanistic and data-driven models to support prediction of treatment outcomes. Starting from classical ecological modeling concepts, which allow to explicitly account for immune interactions at the cellular level, we incorporate time-course data on natural killer (NK) cell number, function, and their tumor-induced suppression into our general model of CML treatment. We identify relevant time scales governing treatment and immune response, enabling refined model calibration using tumor and NK cell time courses from different datasets. While the model successfully describes patient-specific response dynamics, critical parameters for predicting treatment outcome remain uncertain. However, by explicitly incorporating tumor load changes in response to TKI dose alterations, these parameters can be estimated and used to derive model predictions for treatment cessation. Further exploring dynamic changes in the number of functional immune cells, we suggest specific measurement strategies of immune effector cell populations to enhance prediction accuracy for CML recurrence following treatment cessation. The generalizability and flexibility of our approach represent a significant step towards quantitative, personalized medicine that integrates tumor-immune dynamics to guide clinical decisions and optimize dynamic cancer therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Recently, we proposed that recombination suppression may evolve in sex chromosomes simply because of the presence of recessive deleterious mutations within genomes. Specifically, we demonstrated that chromosomal inversions suppressing recombination and carrying by chance fewer deleterious mutations than average have a selective advantage. In addition, we showed that the permanent heterozygosity of Y-like sex chromosomes facilitates the fixation of these less-loaded inversions by a sheltering effect, i.e., by preventing the expression of recessive deleterious mutations in a homozygous state when they increase in frequency. In contrast, similar less-loaded inversions in autosomes suffer from a disadvantage in the homozygous state as their frequency increases, preventing their fixation. However, the methodology and significance of our previous study have been questioned. Here, we present new analyses that further reinforce our original claims, demonstrating that the lower-load advantage and the sheltering effect can explain the fixation of inversions on sex chromosomes over a broad range of parameter values. We show that these mechanisms promote the fixation of inversions on Y-like chromosomes at rates exceeding those expected under drift alone. We used, as a control, autosomes with a similar population size as the Y chromosome, which, we argue, provides the appropriate neutral control for the sheltering effect. We also address criticisms regarding our focus on inversions surviving the first 20 generations in a figure of our previous study, and show that these criticisms stemmed from a misunderstanding of what this figure was intended to illustrate. Including all inversions, even those that went extinct within 20 generations, does not alter our conclusions. Overall, the present study offers new support for our theory based on the combination of lower-load advantage and sheltering effect, and addresses the questions about its significance and range of applicability.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Summarizing this distribution using two numbers yields an informative 2D embedding, the arity map, which summarizes structural elements in all predictions. Second, we establish a clear correlation between the number of homologs of a protein sequence in UniProtKB, and the quality of its prediction, possibly hinting at the learning biases incurred by AlphaFold. Third, we show that certain regions of the arity map are connected with poor quality structures: proteins rich in false positive intrinsically disordered regions.

Unfortunately, intrinsic or acquired resistance, often causing therapy discontinuation, is frequently caused by mutations in the kinase therapeutic target. The advent of clinical tumor sequencing has opened additional opportunities for precision oncology to improve patient outcomes by pairing optimal therapies with tumor mutation profiles. However, modern precision oncology efforts are hindered by lack of sufficient biochemical or clinical evidence to classify each mutation as resistant or sensitive to existing inhibitors. Structure-based methods show promising accuracy in retrospective benchmarks at predicting whether a kinase mutation will perturb inhibitor binding, but comparisons are made by pooling disparate experimental measurements across different conditions. We present the first prospective benchmark of structure-based approaches on a blinded dataset of in-cell kinase inhibitor affinities to Abl kinase mutants using a NanoBRET reporter assay. We compare NanoBRET results to structure-based methods and their ability to estimate the impact of mutations on inhibitor binding (measured as {Delta}{Delta}G). Comparing physics-based simulations, Rosetta, and previous machine learning models, we find that structure-based methods accurately classify kinase mutations as inhibitor-resistant or inhibitor-sensitizing, and each approach has a similar degree of accuracy. We find that physics-based simulations are best suited to estimate {Delta}{Delta}G of mutations that are distal to the kinase active site. To probe modes of failure, we investigate two clinically significant mutations poorly predicted by our methods, T315A and L298F, and find that starting configurations and protonation states significantly alter the accuracy of our predictions. Our experimental and computational measurements provide a benchmark for estimating the impact of mutations on inhibitor binding affinity for future methods and structure-based models. These structure-based methods have potential utility in identifying optimal therapies for tumor-specific mutations, predicting resistance mutations in the absence of clinical data, and identifying potential sensitizing mutations to established inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Transducing bacteriophage (phage) particles and gene transfer agents (GTAs) are constrained by their capsids structural properties in the length of host DNA they can package. This results in a narrow distribution of DNA fragment lengths associated with a given viral carrier. Single molecule nanopore sequencing of intact capsid-packaged single DNA molecules with full genome-sized reads can be used to establish the precise lengths and identity of individual packaged DNA molecules and their association with specific bacterial hosts and virus-like agents. The approach developed in this study was validated using a selection of well-characterised transducing phages and a GTA-like element, and then applied to study bacterial DNA encapsidation in the faecal microbiomes from three healthy human donors.

Bacterial DNA encapsidation by viruses and virus-like particles appears to be widespread in the microbiome with up to 5.4% of capsid-packaged DNA in the gut virome being of bacterial (non-prophage) origin. Generalised transduction and GTA activity are especially prevalent in the families Ospillospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae (genera Faecalibacterium, Gemmiger, Onthomonas), whereas an example of lateral transduction was observed in genus Bacteroides. In addition to that, induction of prophages in a variety of highly prevalent anaerobic bacteria was observed.

Further work will be needed to understand biological significance of capsid-mediated DNA packaging in the gut microbiome and its role in community structure, evolution on ecological timescales, spread of beneficial and detrimental genes, as well as its possible role in gastrointestinal disease.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Designing the kinetics and dynamics of a system requires, in addition, the design of excited states that are traversed in transitions from one low-lying state to another2,3. This is a challenging task as such states must be sufficiently strained to be poorly populated, but not so strained that they are not populated at all, and because protein design methods have generally focused on creating near-ideal structures4-7. Here we describe a general approach for designing systems which use an induced-fit power stroke8 to generate a structurally frustrated9 and strained excited state, allosterically driving protein complex dissociation. X-ray crystallography, double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy, and kinetic binding measurements demonstrate that incorporating excited states enables design of effector-induced increases in dissociation rates as high as 6000-fold. We highlight the power of this approach by designing cytokine mimics which can be dissociated within seconds from their receptors.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Recent studies have suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection can lead to reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), yet, the extent and impact of viral reactivation in COVID-19 and its effect on the host immune system remain incompletely understood.

Here we present a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of viral reactivation of all known chronically infecting viruses in 1,154 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study, who were followed prospectively for twelve months. We reveal significant reactivation of Herpesviridae, Enteroviridae, and Anelloviridae families during acute stage of COVID-19 (0-40 days post- hospitalization), each exhibiting distinct temporal dynamics. We also show that viral reactivation correlated with COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes, including mortality. Integration of cytokine profiling, cellular immunophenotyping, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics demonstrated virus-specific host responses, including elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, CXCL10, and TNF), increased activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and upregulation of cellular replication genes, independent of COVID-19 severity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Notably, persistent Anelloviridae reactivation during convalescence ([&ge;]3 months post-hospitalization) was associated with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptoms, particularly physical function and fatigue.

Our findings highlight a remarkable prevalence and potential impact of chronic viral reactivation on host responses and clinical outcomes during acute COVID-19 and long term PASC sequelae. Our data provide novel immune, transcriptomic, and metabolomic biomarkers of viral reactivation that may inform novel approaches to prognosticate, prevent, or treat acute COVID- 19 and PASC.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

While intracellular Ca2+ signalling has been shown to control cell migration in multiple cell contexts, it is unknown whether it is required for DVE migration. The pattern of Ca2+ activity in the mouse embryo at early peri-implantation stages is also unknown. Using the GCaMP6f Ca2+ reporter line we performed a detailed assessment of Ca2+ dynamics between E0.5 - E5.5 using live imaging. We find that prior to implantation, Ca2+ transients are rare, but at E5.5 widespread, periodic, Ca2+ transients in extra-embryonic tissues can be observed, including in the VE and ExE. In contrast, cells of the E5.5 epiblast remain relatively quiescent but show sporadic large-scale multi-cellular waves. Inhibition of SERCA at E5.5 abolishes Ca2+ transients and leads to DVE arrest, indicative that these transients are required for axial patterning. Together these results reveal the pattern of Ca2+ handling in the early mouse embryo and a novel requirement in anterior-posterior axis formation.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Here, we establish a two-step approach to eliminate the abnormal copy of chromosome 8 and restore euploidy in cells derived from an individual with a complex rearrangement of chromosome 8p. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 361 differentially expressed genes between the proband and the euploid revertant, highlighting genes both within and outside the 8p region that may contribute to 8p syndrome pathology.

Our ""Takoyaki"" pulse sequence uses the simultaneous scanning of multiple focal points to excite contrast agents with sufficient acoustic pressure for nonlinear imaging while efficiently covering 3D space. Through in vitro experiments, we first show that the Takoyaki sequence produces highly sensitive volume images of gas vesicle contrast agents and compare its performance with alternative imaging schemes. We then establish its utility in cellular imaging in vivo by visualizing acoustic reporter gene-expressing tumors in a mouse model of glioblastoma. Finally, we demonstrate real-time volumetric imaging by tracking the dynamics of fluid motion in brain ventricles after intraventricular contrast injection. Takoyaki imaging enables a more comprehensive understanding of biological processes by providing spatiotemporal information in 3D within the constraints of accessible multiplexed matrix array systems.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

This longevity discrepancy also extends to health and aging-larger dogs show higher rates of age-related diseases. Despite this well-established phenomenon, we still know little about the biomarkers and molecular mechanisms that might underlie breed differences in aging and survival. To address this gap, we generated an epigenetic clock using DNA methylation from over 3 million CpG sites in a deeply phenotyped cohort of 864 companion dogs from the Dog Aging Project, including some dogs sampled annually for 2-3 years. We found that the largest breed size tends to have epigenomes that are, on average, 0.37 years older per chronological year compared to the smallest breed size. We also found that higher residual epigenetic age was significantly associated with increased mortality risk, with dogs experiencing a 34% higher risk of death for each year increase in residual epigenetic age. These findings not only broaden our understanding of how aging manifests within a diverse species but also highlight the significant role that demographic factors play in modulating the biological mechanisms underlying aging. Additionally, they highlight the utility of DNA methylation as both a biomarker for healthspan-extending interventions, a mortality predictor, and a mechanism for understanding inter-individual variation in aging in dogs.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b exhibits tropism for the mammary gland, with milk from infected cows containing high levels of viral RNA and infectious virus. The viruss ability to infect the mammary gland suggests potential risks of transmission to offspring through breastfeeding. Here, we show that mammary gland infection with bovine H5N1 influenza in lactating ferrets transmits virus and disease to suckling kits. Viral RNA titers significantly increased in milk over time and remained high in mammary gland tissue. Suckling kits had significantly increased viral RNA in the oral and nasal cavity, as well as in feces. However, viral detection in the dam nasal cavities was delayed, with only minimal virus present in the oral cavity. Lung viral RNA levels were low in dams but high in a sampled suckling kit. Additionally, we detected the expression of the H5N1 receptor, 2,3 sialic acid, in mammary tissue from both ferrets and humans. These data demonstrate that H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b infection in lactating dams leads to mastitis-related disease and transmits to suckling pups, resulting in 100% mortality among the neonates.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Biochemical large language models have transformed the interpretation of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, but have not yet had a comparable impact on understanding small molecule metabolism. Here, we present an approach that leverages chemical language models to discover previously uncharacterized metabolites. We introduce DeepMet, a chemical language model that learns the latent biosynthetic logic embedded within the structures of known metabolites and exploits this understanding to anticipate the existence of as-of-yet undiscovered metabolites. Prospective chemical synthesis of metabolites predicted to exist by DeepMet directs their targeted discovery. Integrating DeepMet with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data enables automated metabolite discovery within complex tissues. We harness DeepMet to discover several dozen structurally diverse mammalian metabolites.

In the context of natural selection analyses, specifically codon evolutionary models, excessive rates of false positives result. A characteristic signature of error-driven findings is unrealistically high estimates of dN/dS (e.g., >100), affecting only a small fraction (e.g., [~]0.1%) of the alignment. Despite the widespread use of codon models to assess alignment quality, their potential for error correction remains unexplored. We present BUSTED-E: a novel method designed to detect positive selection while concurrently identifying alignment errors. This method is a straightforward adaptation of the BUSTED flexible branch-site random effects model used to fit distributions of dN/dS, with an important modification: it integrates an ""error-sink"" component representing an abiological evolutionary regime (dN/dS > 100), and provides the option for masking errors in the MSA for downstream analyses. Statistical performance of BUSTED-E on data simulated without errors shows that there is a small loss of power, which can be mitigated by model averaged inference. Using four published empirical datasets, we show BUSTED-E reduces unrealistic rates of positive selection detection, often by an order of magnitude, and improves biological interpretability of results. BUSTED-E also detects errors that are largely distinct from other popular alignment cleaning tools (HMMCleaner and BMGE). Overall, BUSTED-E is a robust and scalable solution for improving the accuracy of evolutionary analyses in the presence of residual alignment errors, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of natural selection and adaptive evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

No obvious signatures of attractor dynamics were detected. Rather, olfactory discrimination training selectively enhanced the separation of neural manifolds representing task-relevant odors from other representations, consistent with predictions of autoassociative network models endowed with precise synaptic balance. Analytical approaches using the framework of manifold capacity revealed multiple geometrical modifications of representational manifolds that supported the classification of task-relevant sensory information.

Comprehensive studies are needed to assess its transmission dynamics and clinical presentation.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective observational cohort study at Kamituga General Hospital in South Kivu, DRC, between May 2 and October 9, 2024. Sociodemographic, exposure and clinical data were collected from mpox suspected cases. Cases confirmed by Xpert(R) Mpox PCR were presumed Clade Ib infections (awaiting Clade confirmation) and followed through hospitalization and on days 29 and 59 post-diagnosis to assess clinical progression and outcomes.

FindingsOf 511 included suspected cases, 431 (84%) tested PCR positive; with 205 being women (47%). Age distribution was bimodal, with 279 (65%) individuals aged 15-34 years, and 63 (15%) children under five. Most cases (59%) reported contact with a suspected or confirmed mpox case; among adults, this was primarily a spouse, colleague or sexual partner, while for children, the primary contacts were parents or siblings. Comorbidities were rare (4%), including six (1%) HIV infections. Prodromal symptoms were present in 346 (88%) patients, active skin lesions in 414 (96%), mucosal lesions in 338 (82%), and lymphadenopathy in 295 (71%). In adults, lesions were more concentrated in the genital area, with 90% of adults presenting lesions in this region. In contrast, only 39% of children had genital lesions, with lesions more frequently found elsewhere on the body. Among 427 hospitalized patients, two deaths (0{middle dot}5%) occurred. Among 315 patients with detailed hospital follow-up, complications were primarily genito-urinary (55%) or cutaneous (40%).

In particular, plague has been linked to population declines in Late Neolithic Europe3,4. Although plague is amongst the most devastating diseases in human history, early strains of Yersinia pestis, the causal agent of plague, lack virulence factors required for the bubonic form5, and their severity remains unclear. Here, we describe the oldest strains of plague reported so far, associated with two early phases of outbreaks among prehistoric hunter-gatherers in the Lake Baikal region in East Siberia, beginning from [~]5600-5400 years ago (cal. BP). These outbreaks occur across four hunter-gatherer cemeteries; the largest of these (Ust-Ida I) has a 38.7% detection rate for plague infection (39% detection across all sites). By reconstructing kinship pedigrees, we show that small familial groups are affected, consistent with human-to-human spread of the disease, and the first outbreak occurred within a single generation. Intriguingly, the infections appear to have resulted in acute mortality events, especially among children. Zoonotic transmission is separately indicated by a Brucella infection in one of the children. Interestingly, we see differences in functional genomic variants in the prehistoric plague strains, including in the ypm superantigen known from Y. pseudotuberculosis today. The new strains diverge ancestrally to all known Y. pestis diversity and push back the Y. pestis divergence from Y. pseudotuberculosis by some 2000 years6. Our results show that plague outbreaks happen earlier than previously thought and that these early outbreaks were indeed lethal. The findings challenge the common notion that high population densities and lifestyle changes during the Neolithic transition were prerequisites for plague epidemics.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

They play a vital role in maintaining ecological equilibrium and promoting the health of their hosts. Consequently, understanding the strain diversity within microbial communities is crucial, as variations between strains can lead to distinct phenotypic expressions or diverse biological functions. However, current methods for taxonomic classification from metagenomic sequencing data have several limitations, including their reliance solely on species resolution, support for either short or long reads, or their confinement to a given single species. Most notably, the majority of existing taxonomic classifiers rely solely on a single linear representative genome as a reference, which fails to capture the strain diversity, thereby introducing single-reference biases.

Here, we present PanTax, a pangenome graph-based taxonomic classification method that overcomes the shortcomings of single-reference genome-based approaches, because pangenome graphs possess the capability to depict the genetic variability present across multiple evolutionarily or environmentally related genomes. PanTax provides a comprehensive solution to taxonomic classification for strain resolution, compatibility with both short and long reads, and compatibility with single or multiple species. Extensive benchmarking results demonstrate that PanTax drastically outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, primarily evidenced by its significantly higher precision or recall (at both species and strain levels), while maintaining comparable or better performance in other aspects across various datasets.

Our integration study unexpectedly reveals two distinct apCAF lineages present in most cancer types: one associated with mesothelial-like cells and the other with fibrocytes. Using a high-resolution single-cell spatial imaging platform, we characterize the spatial niches of these apCAF lineages. We find that mesothelial-like apCAFs are located near cancer cells, while fibrocyte-like apCAFs are associated with tertiary lymphoid structures. Additionally, we discover that both apCAF lineages can up-regulate the secreted protein SPP1, which facilitates primary tumor formation and peritoneal metastasis. Taken together, this study offers an unprecedented resolution in analyzing apCAF lineages and their spatial niches.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

While improvements have been made, high-coverage long-read sequencing is associated with higher costs and input DNA requirements. To decrease the cost one can lower the sequence coverage, but the current long-read SV callers perform poorly with coverage below 10x. Synthetic long-read (SLR) technologies hold great potential for structural variant (SV) detection, although utilizing their long-range information for events smaller than 50 kbp has been challenging.

ResultsIn this work, we propose a hybrid novel integrated alignment- and local-assembly-based algorithm, Blackbird, that uses SLR together with low-coverage long reads to improve SV detection and assembly. Without the need for a computationally expensive whole genome assembly, Blackbird uses a sliding window approach and barcode information encoded in SLR to accurately assemble small segments and use long reads for an improved gap closing and contig assembly. We evaluated Blackbird on simulated and real human genome datasets. Using the HG002 GIAB benchmark set, we demonstrated that in hybrid mode, Blackbird demonstrated results comparable to state-of-the-art long-read tools, while using less long-read coverage. Blackbird requires only 5x coverage to achieve F1 scores (0.835 and 0.808 for deletions and insertions) similar to PBSV (0.856 and 0.812) and Sniffles2 (0.839 and 0.804) using 10x Pacbio Hi-Fi long-read coverage.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

In neuroscience, this translates into how the brain anatomy shapes brain dynamics. From neuroanatomy, the topology of the mammalian brain can be approximated by local connectivity, accurately described by an exponential distance rule (EDR). The compact, folded geometry of the cortex is shaped by this local connectivity and the geometric harmonic modes can reconstruct much of the functional dynamics. However, this ignores the fundamental role of the rare long-range cortical connections, crucial for improving information processing in the mammalian brain, but not captured by local cortical folding and geometry. Here we show the superiority of harmonic modes combining rare long-range connectivity with EDR (EDR+LR) in capturing functional dynamics (specifically long-range functional connectivity and task-evoked brain activity) compared to geometry and EDR representations. Importantly, the orchestration of dynamics is carried out by a more efficient manifold made up of a low number of fundamental EDR+LR modes. Our results show the importance of rare long-range connectivity for capturing the complexity of functional brain activity through a low-dimensional manifold shaped by fundamental EDR+LR modes.

Significance StatementExplaining how structure of the brain gives rise to its emerging dynamics is a primary pursuit in neuroscience. We describe a fundamental anatomical constraint that emphasises the key role of rare long-range connections in explaining functional organisation of the brain in terms of spontaneous and task-evoked activity. Specifically, this constraint unifies brain geometry and local connectivity through the Exponential Distance Rule while considering the long-range exceptions to this local connectivity as derived from the structural connectome. In addition, when using this structural information, we show that the task-evoked brain activity is described by a low-dimensional manifold of several modes suggesting that less is more for the efficient information processing in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

However, null space theory makes the counter-intuitive prediction that neurons often generate spikes not to cause behavior, but to prevent the effects that other neurons would have on behavior. What is missing is a direct way to test this theory in the brain. Here, we found that in the marmoset cerebellum, spike-triggered averaging identified a potent vector unique to each Purkinje cell (P-cell) along which the spikes of that cell displaced the eyes. Yet, the P-cells were active not just for saccades along their potent vector, but for all saccades. Simultaneous recordings revealed that two spikes in two different P-cells produced superposition of their potent vectors. The result was a population activity in which the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. But why was one neuron producing spikes that would be canceled by another neuron? To answer this question, we recorded from the mossy fiber inputs and the interneurons in the molecular layer. We found that the mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands as well as the sensory goal of the movement, then the interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P-cells as a population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped. Because this output had faster dynamics than was present in the individual neurons, the cerebellum placed the cells in subtractive competition with each other such that the downstream effects of spiking in one neuron were partially or completely eliminated because of the spiking in another neuron.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Human skin undergoes both chronological aging and environmental degradation, particularly UV-induced photoaging. Detrimental structural and physiological changes caused by aging include epidermal thinning due to stem cell depletion and dermal atrophy associated with decreased collagen production. Here, we present a comprehensive single-cell atlas of skin aging, analyzing samples from young, middle-aged, and elderly individuals, including both sun-exposed and sun-protected areas. This atlas reveals age-related cellular composition and function changes across various skin cell types, including epidermal stem cells, fibroblasts, hair follicles, and endothelial cells. Using our atlas, we have identified basal stem cells as a highly variable population across aging, more so than other skin cell populations such as fibroblasts. In basal stem cells, we identified ATF3 as a novel regulator of skin aging. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor for genes involved in the aging process, with its expression reduced by 20% during aging. Based on this discovery, we have developed an innovative mRNA-based treatment to mitigate the effects of skin aging. Cell senescence decreased 25% in skin cells treated with ATF3 mRNA, and we observed an over 20% increase in proliferation in treated basal stem cells. Importantly, we also found crosstalk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts as a critical component of therapeutic interventions, with ATF3 rescue of basal cells significantly enhancing fibroblast collagen production by approximately 200%. We conclude that ATF3-targeted mRNA treatment effectively reverses the effects of skin aging by modulating specific cellular mechanisms, offering a novel, targeted approach to human skin rejuvenation.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Here, we expand the capabilities of LLMs for science by introducing the Virtual Lab, an AI-human research collaboration to perform sophisticated, interdisciplinary science research. The Virtual Lab consists of an LLM principal investigator agent guiding a team of LLM agents with different scientific backgrounds (e.g., a chemist agent, a computer scientist agent, a critic agent), with a human researcher providing high-level feedback. We design the Virtual Lab to conduct scientific research through a series of team meetings, where all the agents discuss a scientific agenda, and individual meetings, where an agent accomplishes a specific task. We demonstrate the power of the Virtual Lab by applying it to design nanobody binders to recent variants of SARS-CoV-2, which is a challenging, open-ended research problem that requires reasoning across diverse fields from biology to computer science. The Virtual Lab creates a novel computational nanobody design pipeline that incorporates ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta and designs 92 new nanobodies.

To address this, we present a comprehensive assessment of tissue changes occurring during human aging, utilizing a vast array of whole slide histopathological images from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx). We analyzed 25,712 images from 40 distinct tissue types across 983 individuals, applying deep learning to quantify the nuanced morphological changes that tissues undergo with age.

We developed  tissue clocks--predictors of biological age based on tissue images--which achieved a mean prediction error of 4.9 years and were associated with telomere attrition, the incidence of subclinical pathologies, and comorbidities. In a systematic assessment of biological age rates across organs, we identified pervasive non-uniform rates of aging across the human lifespan, with some organs exhibiting earlier changes (20-40 years old) and others showing bimodal patterns of age-related changes. We also uncovered several associations between demographic, lifestyle, and medical history factors and tissue-specific acceleration or deceleration of biological age, highlighting potential modifiable risk factors that influenced the aging process at the tissue level. Finally, by combining paired histological images and gene expression data, we developed a strategy to predict tissue-specific age gaps from blood samples. This approach was validated in external cohorts of both healthy individuals and those with chronic diseases, revealing the organs most differentially affected by aging in disease contexts.

This work offers a new perspective on the aging process by positioning tissue structure as an integrator of cellular and molecular changes that reflect the physiological state of organs. These findings underscore the value of histopathological imaging as a tool for understanding human aging and provide a foundation for the exploration of tissue-specific aging processes in age-associated diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

While human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived organoids are valuable models for studying human organ function, they often lack critical tissue-resident immune cells. Here, we introduce an advanced human heart assembloid model, termed hHMA (human heart-macrophage assembloid), which fully integrates autologous cardiac tissue-resident macrophages (MPs) with pre-existing human heart organoids (hHOs). Through multi-omic analyses, we confirmed that these MPs are phenotypically similar to embryonic cardiac tissue-resident MPs and remain viable in the assembloids over time. The inclusion of MPs significantly impacts hHMA development, influencing cardiac cellular composition, boosting cellular communication, remodeling the extracellular matrix, promoting ventricular morphogenesis, and enhancing sarcomeric maturation. Our findings indicate that MPs contribute to homeostasis via efferocytosis, integrate into the cardiomyocyte electrical system, and support catabolic metabolism. To demonstrate the versatility of this model, we developed a platform to study cardiac arrhythmias by chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory factors linked to arrhythmogenesis in clinical settings, successfully replicating key features of inflammasome-mediated atrial fibrillation. Overall, this work introduces a robust platform for examining the role of immune cells in cardiac development, disease mechanisms, and drug discovery, bridging the gap between in vitro models and human physiology.

They allow researchers to analyze animal behaviors and reveal causal relationships between specific neural circuits and behaviors. However, the application of such annotation/manipulation systems to social behaviors, in which multiple individuals interact dynamically, remains challenging. Here, we applied an object detection algorithm to classify animal social behaviors. Our system, packaged as ""YORU"" (Your Optimal Recognition Utility), classifies animal behaviors, including social behaviors, based on the shape of the animal as a ""behavior object"". It successfully classified several types of social behaviors ranging from vertebrates to insects. We also integrated a closed-loop control system for operating optogenetic devices into the YORU package. YORU enables real-time delivery of photostimulation feedback to specific individuals during specific behaviors, even when multiple individuals are close together. We hope that the YORU system will accelerate the understanding of the neural basis of social behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

The transition from OPC to oligodendrocyte involves a complex cascade of molecular and morphological states that position the cell to make a fate decision to integrate as a myelinating oligodendrocyte or die through apoptosis. Oligodendrocyte maturation impacts the cell death mechanisms that occur in degenerative conditions, but it is unclear if and how the cell death machinery changes as OPCs transition into oligodendrocytes. Here, we discovered that differentiating oligodendrocytes transiently upregulate the zymogen procaspase-3, equipping these cells to make a survival decision during differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of caspase-3 decreases oligodendrocyte density, indicating that procaspase-3 upregulation promotes differentiation. Moreover, using procaspase-3 as a marker, we show that oligodendrocyte differentiation continues in the aging cortex and white matter. Taken together, our data establish procaspase-3 as a differentiating oligodendrocyte marker and provide insight into the underlying mechanisms occurring during the decision to integrate or die.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Here we developed IMMClock, a novel immune aging clock that uses gene expression data to predict the biological age of individual CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, and NK cells. The accuracy of IMMClock is first validated across multiple independent datasets, demonstrating its robustness. Second, utilizing the IMMClock, we find that intrinsic cellular aging processes are more strongly altered during immune aging than differentiation processes. Thirdly, our analysis confirms the strong associations between immune aging and established processes such as cellular senescence, exhaustion, and telomere length at the single cell level. Furthermore, immune aging is accelerated under several disease conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Finally, we apply IMMClock to analyze a perturb-seq gene activation screen of T cell functionality. We find that the post-perturbation immune age of individual T cells is strongly correlated with their pre-perturbation immune age. Furthermore, the immune age at resting state of individual T cells is strongly predictive of their post-stimulation activation state. Overall, IMMClock advances our understanding of immune aging by providing precise, single-cell level age estimations. Its future applications hold promise for identifying interventions that concomitantly rejuvenate and activate T cells, potentially enhancing efforts to counteract age-related immune decline.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Acute inhibition of ATR with ATR inhibitor (ATRi) triggers a surge in origin firing, leading to increased levels of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that rapidly deplete all available RPA. This leaves ssDNA unprotected and susceptible to breakage, a phenomenon known as replication catastrophe. However, the mechanism by which unprotected ssDNA breaks remains unclear. Here, we reveal that APOBEC3B is the key enzyme targeting unprotected ssDNA at replication forks, triggering a reaction cascade that induces fork collapse and PARP1 hyperactivation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that uracils generated by APOBEC3B at replication forks are removed by UNG2, creating abasic sites that are subsequently cleaved by APE1 endonuclease. Moreover, we demonstrate that APE1-mediated DNA cleavage is the critical enzymatic step for PARP1 trapping and hyperactivation in cells, regardless of how abasic sites are generated on DNA. Finally, we show that APOBEC3B-induced toxic PARP1 trapping in response to ATRi drives cell sensitivity to ATR inhibition, creating to a context of synthetic lethality when combined with PARP inhibitors. Together, these findings reveal the mechanisms that cause replication forks to break during replication catastrophe and explain why ATRi-treated cells are particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes relevant to many physiological and pathological processes. As with all members of the steroid receptor family, GR forms condensates of unknown function. Here, we examine whether GR condensates are involved in transcription regulation using Airyscan super-resolution microscopy and nano-antibodies targeting initiation and elongating states of RNA polymerase II (Pol2). We observed subpopulations of GR condensates colocalizing with initiating and, surprisingly, elongating Pol2 foci. The analysis of GR mutants with different transcriptional outputs suggests a correlation between condensate formation capability and transcription initiation. Moreover, the number of GR molecules within initiation and elongation condensates appears to be linked to transcriptional activity. Taken together, our data suggests an involvement of GR condensates in transcription initiation and elongation.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey. Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1732226959300

Here, we found that both KP.3.1.1 and XEC maintained the high ACE2-Spike binding affinity and pseudovirus infectivity of KP.3. Importantly, compared to KP.3, KP.3.1.1, and especially XEC, could further evade the neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma, even those elicited by KP.2-like breakthrough infections. Interestingly, both variants demonstrated increased resistance against monoclonal neutralizing antibodies targeting various epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD). These suggest that the additional NTD glycosylation of KP.3.1.1 and XEC could enhance immune evasion via allosteric effects, and supports the future prevalence of XEC.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959300

We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads.

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment. The findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF.","NA","biorxiv",1732226959301
