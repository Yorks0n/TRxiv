Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353786

Despite advancements in imaging technology, achieving accurate cell tracking remains challenging, particularly in complex and crowded tissues where cell segmentation is often ambiguous. We present Ultrack, a versatile and scalable cell-tracking method that tackles this challenge by considering candidate segmentations derived from multiple algorithms and parameter sets. Ultrack employs temporal consistency to select optimal segments, ensuring robust performance even under segmentation uncertainty. We validate our method on diverse datasets, including terabyte-scale developmental time-lapses of zebrafish, fruit fly, and nematode embryos, as well as multi-color and label-free cellular imaging. We show that Ultrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cell Tracking Challenge and demonstrates superior accuracy in tracking densely packed embryonic cells over extended periods. Moreover, we propose an approach to tracking validation via dual-channel sparse labeling that enables high-fidelity ground truth generation, pushing the boundaries of long-term cell tracking assessment. Our method is freely available as a Python package with Fiji and napari plugins and can be deployed in a high-performance computing environment, facilitating widespread adoption by the research community.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353786

As a dynamic pandemic, COVID-19 trends might have also varied over space and time. We conducted a spatiotemporal hotspot analysis of COVID-19 over the first four major waves of COVID-19 using three different applications of Morans I to highlight the variable experience of COVID-19 infections in Toronto, while describing the potential impact of socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors on increased risk of COVID-19 exposure and infection. Results highlight potential clustering of COVID-19 case rate hot spots in areas with higher concentrations of immigrant and low-income residents and cold spots in areas with more affluent and non-immigrant residents during the first three waves. By the fourth wave, case rate clustering patterns were more dynamic. In all, a better understanding of the unequal COVID-19 pandemic experience in Toronto needs to also consider the dynamic nature of the pandemic.

HIGHLIGHTS- The COVID-19 pandemic was spatially and temporarily dynamic in the City of Toronto.
- At first, hotspots were concentrated in areas with more marginalized residents.
- Later, COVID-19 spatial trends diverged from initially identified patterns.
- East Asian enclaves in the city disproportionally had lower COVID-19 case counts.
- COVID-19 studies need to consider the dynamic nature of the pandemic.","NA","medrxiv",1725401353786

Las is transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) where it colonizes the phloem tissue, resulting in substantial economic losses to citrus industry worldwide. Despite extensive efforts, effective management strategies against HLB remain elusive, necessitating a deeper understanding of the pathogen's biology. Las undergoes cell-to-cell movement through phloem flow and colonizes different tissues in which Las may have varying interactions with the host. Here, we investigate the transcriptomic landscape of Las in citrus seed coat vasculatures, enabling a complete gene expression profiling of Las genome and revealing unique transcriptomic patterns compared to previous studies using midrib tissues. Comparative transcriptomics between seed coat, midrib and ACP identified specific responses and metabolic states of Las in different host tissue. Two Las virulence factors that exhibit higher expression in seed coat can suppress callose deposition. Therefore, they may contribute to unclogging sieve plate pores during Las colonization in seed coat vasculature. Furthermore, analysis of regulatory elements uncovers a potential role of LuxR-type transcription factors in regulating Liberibacter effector gene expression during plant colonization. Together, this work provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of the devastating citrus HLB.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353786

Prior to moulting, epidermal tissue peels off from the old cuticle and grows non-uniformly to shape protruding appendages, which are often branching, curving, or twisting, from the planar epidermis. This non-uniform growth is possibly regulated by the distribution of morphogens on the epidermal cell sheet. Previous studies have identified molecules and signalling pathways related to such morphogenesis; however, how local regulation of cell sheet growth can transform planar epidermis globally into complex three-dimensional structures, such as beetle horns, remains unclear. To reveal the relationship between epidermal growth regulation and generated structures, this study theoretically examined how various shapes can be generated from planar epidermis under a deductive growth model that corresponds morphogen distributions to non-uniform growth on tissue. The results show that the heterochronic expression of multiple morphogens can flexibly fuse multiple simple shapes to generate various structures emulating complex appendages of beetles. These findings indicate that morphogenesis through such a mechanism may have developmental stability and modularity, providing insights into the evolution of the diverse morphology of arthropods.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353786

Safe and alternative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed1. A ketogenic diet has been shown to have anti-tumor effects across diverse cancer types but will unlikely have a significant effect alone. However, the diet shifts metabolism in tumors to create new vulnerabilities that can be targeted (1). Modulators of glutamine metabolism have shown promise in pre-clinical models but have failed to have a marked impact against cancer in the clinic. We show that a ketogenic diet increases TCA and glutamine-associated metabolites in murine pancreatic cancer models and under metabolic conditions that simulate a ketogenic diet in vitro. The metabolic shift leads to increased reliance on glutamine-mediated anaplerosis to compensate for low glucose abundance associated with a ketogenic diet. As a result, glutamine metabolism inhibitors, such as DON and CB839 in combination with a ketogenic diet had robust anti-cancer effects. These findings provide rationale to study the use of a ketogenic diet with glutamine targeted therapies in a clinical context.

Until now, the mechanism of sex determination in cephlaopods has been a mystery. Using a chromosome-level genome assembly generated with long read sequencing, we report the first evidence for genetic sex determination in cephalopods. We have uncovered a sex chromosome in California two-spot octopus (Octopus bimaculoides) in which males/females have ZZ/ZO karyotypes respectively. We show that the octopus Z chromosome is an evolutionary outlier with respect to divergence and repetitive element content as compared to autosomes and that it is present in all cephalopods that we have examined including Nautilus, the outgroup to squids and octopuses. Our results suggest that the cephalopod Z chromosome system originated before the split of all extant cephalopod lineages, over 480 million years ago and has been conserved to the present, making it the among the oldest conserved animal sex chromosome systems known.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353786

However, a detailed description of the pathway from the initial assembly product (procapsid) to the mature, infectious particle (virion) has been elusive. This is due to the ""in cell"" nature of the natural process, the 2-state behavior of maturation (no detectable intermediates) in some viruses in vitro and heterogeneous populations of particle intermediates that are only partially matured in other systems. The non-enveloped, T=4, ssRNA-containing, Nudaurelia capensis omega virus (N{omega}V), is a highly accessible model system that exemplifies the maturation process of a eukaryotic virus. During maturation the particle shrinks in outer diameter from 482 Angstroms (pH 7.5) to 428 Angstroms (pH 5.0). It is possible to mimic the maturation process in vitro by lowering the pH of a population of procapsids produced in heterologous systems. Indeed, by controlling the pH in vitro it is possible to produce homogenous populations of intermediate N{omega}V virus-like particles (VLPs) that occur too fleetingly to be observed in vivo. Here we report structural models, based on cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), of five intermediates in the N{omega}V maturation process. The structures of the intermediate particles reveal unique, quaternary position-dependent trajectories and refolding of subunit N and C-terminal regions, including the formation of the autocatalytic cleavage site at N570. The detailed structures reported here, coupled with previously determined structures of the procapsids and mature particles, allows the maturation pathway to be described in detail for the first time for a eukaryotic virus.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

Unlike for small-molecule catalysts, the structural ensembles of enzymes can vary substantially with temperature, and it is in general unclear how this modulates the temperature dependence of activity. Here multi-temperature X-ray crystallography was used to record structural changes from -20{degrees}C to 40{degrees}C for a mesophilic enzyme in complex with inhibitors mimicking substrate-, intermediate-, and product-bound states, representative of major complexes underlying the kinetic constant kcat. Both inhibitors, substrates and catalytically relevant loop motifs increasingly populate catalytically competent conformations as temperature increases. These changes occur even in temperature ranges where kinetic measurements show roughly linear Arrhenius/Eyring behavior where parameters characterizing the system are assumed to be temperature independent. Simple analysis shows that linear Arrhenius/Eyring behavior can still be observed when the underlying activation energy / enthalpy values vary with temperature, e.g., due to structural changes, and that the underlying thermodynamic parameters can be far from values derived from Arrhenius/Eyring model fits. Our results indicate a critical role for temperature-dependent atomic-resolution structural data in interpreting temperature-dependent kinetic data from enzymatic systems.

ObjectiveThe objective was to evaluate the immunogenicity/alloimmunization potential of Helaina rhLF (effera) from K. phaffii over a 28-day period compared to bovine LF (bLF). It was hypothesized that rhLF would have an equal or lower immunogenic potential compared to bLF, which is permitted for use in conventional foods and infant formula in the EU and US.

MethodsStudy 1 was a randomized, double-blind, parallel arm, controlled trial where 66 healthy adults were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups: high-dose rhLF (3.4 g/d), low-dose rhLF (0.34 g/d), or bLF (3.4 g/d) (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT06012669). Participants completed a 28-day (Day 28) supplementation period followed by a 28-day washout period (Day 56) and an additional 28-day follow-up period (Day 84). Study 2 was a 12-week observational study with no intervention that enrolled 24 healthy adults. In both studies, fasting blood was obtained on Days 0, 28, 56, and 84 for analysis of anti-bLF and anti-hLF antibody levels as the primary endpoint as well as other secondary safety endpoints including complete blood count, iron biomarkers, and metabolic panel.

ResultsIn Study 1, the change from baseline to Day 56 in serum anti-bLF antibodies in the bLF group (least squares geometric mean and 95% confidence interval for the post/pre ratio: 3.01; 2.08, 4.35) was greater than the changes in serum anti-hLF antibodies in the low-dose rhLF (1.07; 0.77, 1.49; P<0.001) and high-dose rhLF (1.02; 0.62, 1.70; P<0.001) groups. In Study 2, the post/pre ratio at Day 56 in serum anti-hLF and anti-bLF antibodies were 1.00 (0.93, 1.08) and 1.01 (0.94, 1.09), respectively, confirming no change in anti-hLF antibodies in Study 1 or Study 2. Changes in all safety outcomes in Study 1 were similar between groups and within normal ranges.

ConclusionThese results support the safety and tolerability of efferaTM as a food ingredient at an intake level up to 3.4 g/d in healthy adults.","NA","medrxiv",1725401353787

The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

Decades of work that have provided insights into pathophysiological manifestations of sucrose overfeeding have employed paradigms that rarely mimic human consumption of SSBs. Thus, our understanding of multi-organ cross-talk and molecular and/or cellular mechanisms, which operate across scales and drive physiological derangement is still poor. By employing a paradigm of sucrose water feeding in mice that closely resembles chronic SSB consumption in humans (10% sucrose in water), we have unraveled hitherto unknown tissue-specific mechanistic underpinnings, which contribute towards perturbed physiology. Our findings illustrate that systemic impaired glucose homeostasis, mediated by hepatic gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance, does not involve altered gene expression programs in the liver. We have discovered the pivotal role of the small intestine, which in conjunction with liver and muscles, drives dyshomeostasis. Importantly, we have uncovered rewiring of molecular mechanisms in the proximal intestine that is either causal or consequential to systemic ill-effects of chronic sucrose water consumption including dysfunction of liver and muscle mitochondria. Tissue-specific molecular signatures, which we have unveiled, clearly indicate that inefficient utilization of glucose is exacerbated by enhanced uptake by the gut. Besides providing systems-wide mechanistic insights, we propose that consumption of SSBs causes intestinal molecular addiction for deregulated absorption of hexose-sugars, and drives diseases such as diabetes and obesity.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

Phenoxyacetic acid derivatives are a widely used group of auxin herbicides in agriculture and research. Despite their prevalence, the identity of the transporters required for distribution of these herbicides in plants is both poorly understood and the subject of controversial debate 3,4. Here we show that PIN-FORMED auxin transporters transport a range of phenoxyacetic acid herbicides across the membrane and we characterize the molecular determinants of this process using a variety of different substrates as well as protein mutagenesis to control substrate specificity. Finally, we present Cryo-EM structures of Arabidopsis thaliana PIN8 with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) or 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (4-CPA) bound. These structures represent five key states from the transport cycle, allowing us to describe conformational changes associated with substrate binding and transport across the membrane. Overall, our results reveal that phenoxyacetic acid herbicides use the same export machinery as endogenous auxins and exemplify how transporter binding sites undergo transformations that dictate substrate specificity. These results enable development of novel synthetic auxins and for guiding precision breeding of herbicide resistant crop plants.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

Thyroid disorders occur frequently and include congenital hypothyroidism, which occurs due to aberrant thyroid development (thyroid dysgenesis) or impaired hormone synthesis and is particularly prevalent in trisomy 21 (T21). In contrast, thyroid carcinoma, an acquired disorder, is the most common endocrine malignancy in both paediatric and adult populations. Understanding the molecular basis of thyroid dysgenesis and paediatric thyroid carcinoma remains challenging, and requires an improved understanding of foetal thyroid development. To address this, we generated a comprehensive spatiotemporal atlas of the human thyroid during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. Profiling over 200,000 cells with single-cell sequencing revealed key cell types involved in thyroid gland development, including the hormone-producing thyrocytes. We discovered that foetal thyroid follicular cells are heterogeneous epithelial populations consisting of two main functional subtypes (fTFC1, fTFC2), with fTFC2 expressing increased levels of PAX8, and spatial transcriptomics revealed subtype co-occurrence within individual follicles. While both fTFC1 and fTFC2 persist in adult thyroid, fTFC2 is a minor population amongst additional PAX8-positive follicular cell subsets. We observed thyroid dysgenesis in T21 age-matched specimens, and T21 thyrocytes showed transcriptional signatures of cytoskeletal disorganisation and altered interactions with the extracellular matrix, as well as compensatory activation of metabolic stress gene programs and upregulation of thyroid biosynthetic genes. In line with the altered proportions of fTFC2 in healthy foetal and adult thyroid, papillary thyroid cancer in children is transcriptionally enriched for the fTFC2 signature compared to that in adults. All together, these findings reveal thyrocyte heterogeneity across the lifespan and provide insights into thyroid development in health and disease, informing potential therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

However, the rate at which microbial genomes are sequenced has continued to increase, and there are now datasets in the millions, far beyond the abilities of existing alignment tools. We introduce LexicMap, a nucleotide sequence alignment tool for efficiently querying moderate length sequences (> 500 bp) such as a gene, plasmid or long read against up to millions of prokaryotic genomes. A key innovation is to construct a small set of probe k-mers (e.g. n = 40,000) which window-cover the entire database to be indexed, in the sense that every 500 bp window of every database genome contains multiple seed k-mers each with a shared prefix with one of the probes. Storing these seeds, indexed by the probes with which they agree, in a hierarchical index enables fast and low-memory variable-length seed matching, pseudoalignment, and then full alignment. We show that LexicMap is able to align with higher sensitivity than Blastn as the query divergence drops from 90% to 80% for queries [&ge;] 1 kb, and then benchmark on small (GTDB) and large (AllTheBacteria and Genbank+RefSeq) databases.

To understand the evolution of NLR diversity in Arabidopsis thaliana, we leverage graph-based methods to define pangenomic NLR neighbourhoods in 17 genetically diverse genomes. We integrate full-length transcript and transposable element information to exhaustively annotate all intact and degraded NLRs, enabling exploration of the processes that underpin the birth, death and maintenance of NLR diversity within a species. Our main finding is that many uncorrelated mutational processes create NLR diversity, and that there is no single metric that captures on its own the true extent of NLR structural and sequence variation. This immense diversity in plant immune system diversification allows populations to survive the constant onslaught of pathogens, not unlike vertebrate adaptive immunity, where variation is also generated by a variety of complementary mechanisms, albeit at the level of individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

One such pathogen is the fungus Fusarium graminearum, which causes Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) disease on wheat and barley. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that F. graminearum expresses many candidate effector proteins during early phases of the infection process, some of which are annotated as proteases. However, the contributions of these proteases to virulence remains poorly defined. Here, we characterize a F. graminearum endopeptidase, FgTPP1 (FGSG_11164), that is highly upregulated during wheat spikelet infection and is secreted from fungal cells. To elucidate the potential role of FgTPP1 in F. graminearum virulence, we generated FgTPP1 deletion mutants ({Delta}Fgtpp1) and performed FHB infection assays. While the number of completely bleached spikes infected by F. graminearum wild-type reached 50% of total infected spikes, the number of fully bleached spikes infected by {Delta}Fgtpp1 mutants was 25%, suggesting FgTPP1 contributes to fungal virulence. Transient expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged FgTPP1 revealed that FgTPP1 localizes, in part, to chloroplasts and attenuates chitin-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, reactive oxygen species production, and cell death induced by an autoactive disease resistance protein when expressed in planta. Notably, the FgTPP1 protein is conserved across the Ascomycota phylum, making it a core effector among ascomycete plant pathogens. These properties make FgTPP1 an ideal candidate for decoy substrate engineering, with the goal of engineering resistance to FHB, and likely other crop diseases caused by ascomycete fungi.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

Intracellular concentrations of cdG are controlled by the interplay of diguanylate cyclase (DGC) enzymes, which synthesize cdG to promote biofilms, and phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes, which hydrolyse cdG to drive motility. To track the complete regulatory logic of how V. cholerae responds to changing cdG levels, we followed a timecourse of overexpression of either the V. harveyi diguanylate cyclase QrgB or a variant of QrgB lacking catalytic activity (QrgB*). We find that QrgB increases cdG levels relative to QrgB* for 30 minutes after overexpression, but the effect of QrgB on cdG levels plateaus at 30 minutes, indicating tight adaptive control of cdG levels. In contrast, loss of VpsR, a master regulator activating biofilm formation upon binding to cdG, leads to higher baseline levels of cdG and continuously increasing cdG through 60 minutes after QrgB induction, revealing the existence of a negative feedback loop on cdG levels operating through VpsR. Through a combination of RNA polymerase ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and genetic approaches, we show that transcription of a gene encoding a PDE, cdgC, is activated by VpsR at high cdG concentrations, mediating this negative feedback on cdG levels. We further identify a transcript encoded within, and antisense to, the cdgC open reading frame which we name sRNA negative regulator of CdgC (SnrC). RNA polymerase ChIP-seq and RNA-seq demonstrate SnrC to be expressed specifically under conditions of high cdG in the absence of VpsR. Ectopic SnrC expression increases cdG levels in a manner dependent on CdgC, demonstrating that its effect on cdG levels is likely through interference with CdgC production. Further, although cells lacking cdgC exhibit enhanced biofilm formation, these mutants are outcompeted by wild type V. cholerae in colonization assays that reward a combination of attachment, dispersal, and motility behaviors. These results underscore the importance of negative feedback regulation of cdG to maintain appropriate homeostatic levels for efficient transitioning between biofilm formation and motility, both of which are necessary over the course of the V. cholerae infection cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

We previously reported that KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE 2 (KAI2)-dependent signaling promotes gemma cup and gemma formation. KAI2A perceives unidentified endogenous ligand(s), tentatively referred to as KAI2 ligands (KL). Perception of KL by KAI2 triggers MAX2-dependent proteolysis of MpSMXL. In this study, we identified genes working downstream of KAI2-dependent signaling in M. polymorpha. We found that KAI2-dependent signaling positively controls the expression of MpLONLEY GUY (MpLOG), encoding a cytokinin biosynthesis enzyme. Disruption of the MpLOG function decreased endogenous cytokinin levels and caused defects similar to KAI2-dependent signaling mutants. Moreover, supplying exogenous cytokinins rescued the defects of Mplog and KAI2-dependent signaling mutants, implying that cytokinins work downstream of KAI2-dependent signaling. Activation of MpLOG by KAI2-dependent signaling occurs in a highly cell-type-specific manner, leading to cell-specific induction of GEMMA CUP-ASSOCIATED MYB1 (GCAM1), the master regulator of vegetative reproduction of M. polymorpha. We propose a genetic cascade, starting from KAI2-dependent signaling, that promotes vegetative reproduction through the induction of MpLOG and GCAM1.

Genetic variants that confer MS risk implicate genes involved in immune function3, while variants related to severity of the disease are associated with genes preferentially expressed within the CNS4. Current MS therapies decrease relapse rates by preventing immune-mediated damage of myelin, but they ultimately fail to slow long-term disease progression, which apparently depends on CNS intrinsic processes. The molecular events that trigger progressive MS are still unknown. Here we report that the C-terminal region of TAF1 (the scaffolding subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID) is underrepresented in postmortem brain tissue from individuals with MS. Furthermore, we demonstrate in vivo, in genetically modified mice, that C-terminal alteration of TAF1 suffices to induce an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-elongation deficit that particularly affects oligodendroglial myelination-related genes and results in an MS-like brain transcriptomic signature, including increased expression of proinflammatory genes. This transcriptional profile is accompanied by CNS-resident inflammation, robust demyelination and MS-like motor phenotypes. We also identify numerous interactors of C-terminal TAF1 that participate in RNAPII-promoter escape, of which two show evidence for genetic association to MS3, 4. Our study reveals that TAF1 dysfunction converges with genetic susceptibility to cause transcriptional dysregulation in CNS cell types, such as oligodendrocytes, to ultimately trigger MS.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

Horses undergo bi-annual vaccines for H3N8 equine influenza virus, and surveillance of sera from vaccinees demonstrated very broad reactivity and neutralization to many human seasonal influenza strains. Subsequently, vaccination of mice using the equine H3N8 Kentucky/1/91 strain of equine H3N8 vaccine induced similar broadly reactive and neutralizing serum antibodies to human seasonal strains and to high pathogenicity avian influenza strains. Challenge of mice vaccinated with equine H3N8 or recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) based on the same strain protected vaccinees from high-dose lethal virus challenges. Protection was associated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies to the HA head, esterase, and stem regions that was similar to that of antibodies generated in horses after vaccination. Vaccinated ferrets exhibited similar broadly reactive serum antibody responses that protected vaccinees from clinical signs of infection and viral-induced histopathology after challenge with influenza A/07/2009 (H1N1) pandemic virus. Taken together, these data suggest that vaccination with equine H3N8 vaccine induces broad protection against influenza without the need for non-influenza viral vectors, multiple HAs, or foreign protein scaffolds common to other universal influenza vaccine candidates.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

These inferred ARGs provide a detailed representation of genealogical relatedness along the genome and have been shown to complement genotype imputation in complex trait analyses by capturing the effects of unobserved genomic variants. An inferred ARG can be used to construct a genetic relatedness matrix, which can be leveraged within a linear mixed model for the analysis of complex traits. However, these analyses are computationally infeasible for large datasets. We introduce a computationally efficient approach, called ARG-RHE, to estimate narrow-sense heritability and perform region-based association testing using an ARG. ARG-RHE relies on scalable randomized algorithms to estimate variance components and assess their statistical significance, and can be applied to multiple quantitative traits in parallel. We conduct extensive simulations to verify the computational efficiency, statistical power, and robustness of this approach. We then apply it to detect associations between 21,374 genes and 52 blood-related traits, using an ARG inferred from genotype data of 337,464 individuals from the UK Biobank. In these analyses, combining ARG-based and imputation-based testing yields 8% more gene-trait associations than using imputation alone, suggesting that inferred genome-wide genealogies may effectively complement genotype imputation in the analysis of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

Publicly available data sets of contact data are however typically recorded over short time windows with respect to the duration of an epidemic. To inform models of disease transmission, data are thus often repeated several times, yielding synthetic data covering long enough timescales. Looping over short term data to approximate contact patterns on longer timescales can lead to unrealistic transmission chains because of the deterministic repetition of all contacts, without any renewal of the contact partners of each individual between successive periods. Real contacts indeed include a combination of regularly repeated contacts (e.g., due to friendship relations) and of more casual ones. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to longitudinally extend contact data recorded in a school setting, taking into account this dual aspect of contacts and in particular the presence of repeated contacts due to friendships. To illustrate the interest of such an algorithm, we then simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on our synthetic contacts using an agent-based model specific to the school setting. We compare the results with simulations performed on synthetic data extended with simpler algorithms to determine the impact of preserving friendships in the data extension method. Notably, the preservation of friendships does not strongly affect transmission routes between classes in the school but has a clear impact on the infection pathways between individual students. Our results moreover indicate that gathering contact data during two days in a population is sufficient to generate realistic synthetic contact sequences between individuals in that population on longer timescales. The proposed tool will allow modellers to leverage existing contact data, and contributes to the design of optimal future field data collection.","NA","medrxiv",1725401353787

We have recently shown that T follicular helper (TFH) cells are precursors of TR1 cells and that the TFH-to-TR1 cell transdifferentiation process is characterized by the progressive loss and acquisition of opposing transcription factor gene expression programs that evolve through at least one transitional cell stage. Here, we use a broad range of bulk and single-cell transcriptional and epigenetic tools to investigate the epigenetic underpinnings of this process. At the single cell level, the TFH-to-TR1 cell transition is accompanied by both, downregulation of TFH cell-specific gene expression due to loss of chromatin accessibility, and upregulation of TR1 cell-specific genes linked to chromatin regions that remain accessible throughout the transdifferentiation process, with minimal generation of new open chromatin regions. By interrogating the epigenetic status of accessible TR1 genes on purified TFH and conventional T cells, we find that most of these genes, including Il10, are already poised for expression at the TFH cell stage. Whereas these genes are closed and hypermethylated in Tconv cells, they are accessible, hypomethylated and enriched for H3K27ac-marked and hypomethylated active enhancers in TFH cells. These enhancers are enriched for binding sites for the TFH and TR1-associated transcription factors TOX-2, IRF4 and c-MAF. Together, these data suggest that the TR1 gene expression program is genetically imprinted at the TFH cell stage.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

This study investigated the potential of metformin as a novel treatment for IIH, exploring its effects on disease outcomes and safety profile. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX database, analyzing data from 2009 to August 2024. Patients diagnosed with IIH were included, with exclusions for other causes of elevated intracranial pressure and pre-existing diabetes. Propensity score matching was employed to balance cohorts according to age, sex, race, ethnicity, Hemoglobin A1C, and baseline body mass index (BMI) at the time of metformin initiation. Outcomes were assessed at various follow-up points up to 24 months. Results: The study initially comprised 1,268 patients in the metformin group and 49,262 in the control group, with notable disparities in several parameters. Post-matching, both cohorts were refined to 1,267 patients each after matching with metformin group. Metformin-treated patients showed significantly lower risks of papilledema, headache, and refractory IIH status at all follow-up points (p<0.0001). The metformin group also had reduced rates of therapeutic spinal punctures and acetazolamide continuation. BMI reductions were more pronounced in the metformin group, with significant differences observed from 6 months onward (p<0.0001). Notably, metformin's beneficial effects persisted independently of BMI changes. The safety profile of metformin was favorable, with no significant differences in adverse events compared to the control group which did not receive metformin during the study timeframe. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for metformin's potential as a disease-modifying therapeutic approach in IIH, demonstrating improvements across multiple outcomes. The benefits appear to extend beyond weight loss, suggesting complex mechanisms of action. These findings warrant further investigation through prospective clinical trials to establish metformin's role in IIH management and explore its underlying therapeutic mechanisms.","NA","medrxiv",1725401353787

While the selection of headgear is central to these efforts, there does not currently exist a standardized design that can accommodate diverse probe configurations and experimental procedures.

AimWe aim to provide the community with an open-source software pipeline for conveniently creating low-cost, 3-D printable neuroimaging head caps with anatomically significant landmarks integrated into the structure of the cap.

ApproachWe utilize our advanced 3-D head mesh generation toolbox and 10-20 head landmark calculations to quickly convert a subjects anatomical scan or an atlas into a 3-D printable head cap model. The 3-D modeling environment of the open-source Blender platform permits advanced mesh processing features to customize the cap. The design process is streamlined into a Blender add-on named ""NeuroCaptain"".

ResultsUsing the intuitive user interface, we create various head cap models using brain atlases, and share those with the community. The resulting mesh-based head cap designs are readily 3-D printable using off-the-shelf printers and filaments while accurately preserving the head topology and landmarks.

ConclusionsThe methods developed in this work result in a widely accessible tool for community members to design, customize and fabricate caps that incorporate anatomically derived landmarks. This not only permits personalized head cap designs to achieve improved accuracy, but also offers an open platform for the community to propose standardizable head caps to facilitate multi-centered data collection and sharing.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

Palm1 binds to the N-terminal region of {beta}II-spectrin, a core MPS component, and is periodically organized along the axon in hippocampal neurons. Applying the 3D imaging power of MINFLUX, we locate Palm1 in close proximity (<20 nm) to the actin-capping protein and MPS component adducin. Functionally, Palm1 overexpression enhances the degree of periodicity of several MPS proteins ({beta}II-spectrin, adducin, and ankyrinB) without altering their local concentrations, while the knock-out severely compromises the MPS structure and modifies electrophysiological properties of neurons. Both the MPS-binding and remodelling activities of Palm1 are abolished by mutating a single amino acid (W54A) in the conserved Paralemmin sequence motif. Our findings identify Palm1 as the first protein specifically dedicated to organizing the MPS, and will advance the understanding of the regulation of MPS assembly and remodelling, as well as of the Paralemmin protein family.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

More generally it is of interest to consider what genomes of our ancestry each of us may represent. We consider only diploid dioecious organisms, and consider primarily the ancestry of a haploid genome, for example the maternal autosomes of the focal individual. Our ancestors are many and, in an unbounded population, increase exponentially in number. Our genetic ancestors are few, bounded by the number of ancestral genome segments which increases linearly over past generations. First we show that the major loss of potential ancestral lineages is at 8-11 generations, and that thereafter the number of genetic ancestors increases approximately linearly, but does not approach the upper bound. Over many generations, there remain tightly linked but not contiguous segments that result from the same ancestral lineage. Second we analyze the process of these ""repeated"" ancestral segments that continue to be formed in distant ancestry, even as others are lost by recombination. Thirdly, we consider the effect of a finite population, with one model of a geographically structured population. Ancestors are many, and soon fill the entire species range even with low migration rates. Genetic ancestors are not only few, but remain geographically local.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

We study the material properties of small spheroids of human periosteum-derived cells as they effect spheroid fusion, an elementary operation for constructing large tissue structures. We use two-photon confocal microscopy to measure cell-cell tension and individual cell motility throughout fusion. Cytoskeletal inhibition through Y-27632 (ROCKi) results in more granular tissues with decreased cell rearrangements, but accelerated fusion. Further reducing cell contractility with blebbistatin and ROCKi increases tissue granularity, decreases rearrangements, and slows down fusion. In all conditions, complete fusion is associated with frequent cellular rearrangements. Using a novel computational model that represents tissue material as an active cellular foam, with cells depicted as viscous shells with interfacial tension and persistent, random motility, we construct a phase diagram of spheroid fusion in function of relative cell-cell tension and cell motility. Our results reveal a close relationship between microscopic tissue fluidity and the visco-elastic properties of spheroid fusion. Additionally, we find that cell-cell friction promotes arrested fusion by inducing jamming through a distinct physical mechanism. Combined, our findings offer a framework for understanding spheroid fusion dynamics that can aid in the robust generation of large tissue constructs for regenerative medicine.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

We analysed somatic variants in the liver from patients with genetic CLD from alpha-1 anti-trypsin (A1AT) deficiency or haemochromatosis. We show that somatic variants in SERPINA1, the gene encoding A1AT, are strongly selected for in A1AT deficiency, with evidence of convergent evolution. Acquired variants cluster at the 3-prime end of SERPINA1 leading to C-terminal missense or truncation variants of A1AT. In vitro, C-terminal truncation variants abrogate disease-associated A1AT polymerisation and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, supporting the C-terminal domain swap mechanism. Therefore, somatic escape variants from a deleterious germline variant are selected for in A1AT deficiency, suggesting adaptive functional somatic variants are disease-specific in CLD and point to disease-associated mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

A large structural intronic variant is associated with a robust reduction of Zhx2 expression in J mice, which we hypothesized enhances OMOR levels and OXY addiction-like behaviors. We tested this hypothesis by restoring the Zhx2 loss-of-function in Js (MVKO) and modeling the loss-of-function variant through knocking out the Zhx2 coding exon (E3KO) in Bys and assessing brain OXY metabolite levels and behavior. Consistent with our hypothesis, Zhx2 E3KO females showed an increase in brain OMOR levels and OXY-induced locomotor activity. However, contrary to our hypothesis, state-dependent expression of OXY-CPP was decreased in E3KO females and increased in E3KO males. We also overexpressed Zhx2 in the livers and brains of Js and observed Zhx2 overexpression in select brain regions that was associated with reduced OXY state-dependent learning.

Nevertheless, studies on the effectiveness of various tVNS protocols have produced heterogeneous results on pupil dilatation to date. Here, we synthesize the existing evidence and compare conventional continuous and pulsed stimulation protocols using Bayesian meta-analysis. To maintain a living version, we developed a Shiny App with the possibility to incorporate newly published studies in the future. Based on a systematic review, we included 18 studies (N = 771) applying either continuous or pulsed stimulation protocols. Across studies, we found anecdotal evidence for the alternative hypothesis that tVNS increases pupil size (g = 0.14, 95% CI = [0.001, 0.29], BF01 = 2.5). Separating studies according to continuous vs. pulsed protocols revealed that results were driven by studies using pulsed taVNS (strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis: g = 0.34, 95% CI = [0.15, 0.53], BF10 = 14.15) while continuous tVNS provided strong evidence for the null hypothesis (g = 0.01, CI = [-0.15, 0.16], BF01= 20.7).

This optimization is achieved by myriad mechanisms and processes that influence the brain's computational state. These include development, plasticity, homeostasis, and more. Despite enormous variability over time and between individuals, do these diverse mechanisms converge on the same set-point? Is there a universal computational optimum around which the healthy brain tunes itself? The criticality hypothesis posits such a unified computational set-point. Criticality is a special dynamical brain state, defined by internally-generated multi-scale, marginally-stable dynamics which maximize many features of information processing. The first experimental support for this hypothesis emerged two decades ago, and evidence has accumulated at an accelerating pace, despite a contentious history. Here, we lay out the logic of criticality as a general computational end-point and systematically review experimental evidence for the hypothesis. We perform a meta-analysis of 143 datasets from manuscripts published between 2003 and 2024. To our surprise, we find that a long-standing controversy in the field is the product of a simple methodological choice that has no bearing on underlying dynamics. Our results suggest that a new generation of research can leverage the concept of criticality---as a unifying principle of brain function--to accelerate our understanding of behavior, cognition, and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

In this study, we address a key question of the repeatability of molecular evolution by investigating the convergent and lineage-specific molecular mechanisms underlying dietary adaptations in four major sugar-consuming bird lineages: hummingbirds, parrots, honeyeaters, and sunbirds. We assembled nine new genomes for sugar-consuming species and their closely related non-sugar feeding outgroup species and generated 90 tissue-specific transcriptomes for six key species. We identified signatures of positive selection in both protein-coding and non-coding regulatory sequences, and found positive selection targets the same genes more frequently in sugar-feeders compared to non-sugar feeding controls, suggesting that adapting to a high-sugar diet requires changes in a limited number of genetic elements. At the functional level, pathways associated with energy homeostasis, carbohydrate metabolism, heart function, and hormonal regulation showed convergent selection signals in both protein-coding and regulatory evolution, while lipid and amino acid metabolism demonstrated mostly regulatory evolution. Notably, we observed striking evidence for convergent adaptation in MLXIPL, a transcription factor regulating sugar and lipid homeostasis, manifesting in both sequence and regulatory changes across all sugar-feeders. With functional assays, we demonstrated that hummingbird MLXIPL enhances sugar-induced transcriptional activity in HEK239 cells, suggesting its central role in the evolution of adaptations to high-sugar diets. Our findings elucidate the main genomic targets in the evolution of sugar-feeding at both molecular and pathway levels.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

This was captured by multiple cross-sectional studies and a few longitudinal studies in early PD. Yet only a longitudinal study with a control group can capture accelerated atrophy in early PD and differentiate it from healthy ageing. Accordingly, we performed a multicohort longitudinal analysis between PD and healthy ageing, examining subcortical regions implicated in PD pathology, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, corpus callosum (CC), and cerebellum. Longitudinal volumetric analysis was performed on 56 early PD patients and 53 matched controls, with scans collected 2-3 years apart. At baseline, the PD group showed a greater volume in the pallidum, thalamus, and cerebellar white matter (WM), suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms in prodromal and early PD. After 2-3 years, accelerated atrophy in PD was observed in the putamen and cerebellar WM. Interestingly, healthy controls - but not PD patients - demonstrated a significant decline in Total Intracranial Volume (TIV), and atrophy in the thalamus and mid-CC. Between-group analysis revealed more severe atrophy in the right striatum and cerebellar WM in PD, and in the mid-posterior CC in controls. Using CEREbellum Segmentation (CERES) for lobule segmentation on the longitudinal PD cohort, we found a significant decline in the WM of non-motor regions in the cerebellum, specifically Crus I and lobule IX. Our results highlight an initial increase in cerebellar WM volume during prodromal PD, followed by significant degeneration over the first few years post-diagnosis.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

While CXCL13 expression is absent in most cell types, aberrant amplification of the CXCR5-CXCL13 signaling is observed in various cancers, including germinal center-derived B-lymphomas (GCDBL), colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD), and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying abnormal CXCL13 transcription in cancer cells and its functional consequences remain elusive. We identify DNA-CpG methylation binding protein 1 (MBD1) as a suppressor of CXCL13 expression. Chromosomal conformation capture (3C) analysis reveals a distal super-enhancer located near CCNG2 that interacts with the CXCL13 promoter in GCDBL, suggesting that enhancer-hijacking drives the aberrant expression. Our functional validation demonstrates that CXCR5-CXCL13 signaling suppresses p53 and its target genes in GCDBLs, COAD, and LIHC. Notably, CXCL13 in the GCDBL cell line Raji disrupts CXCR5-mediated migration, a mechanism essential for (light zone) LZ-entry and affinity maturation of GC B cells.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are enzyme resistant RNA molecules that accumulate in ageing tissues. Furthermore, circRNAs bind gDNA directly, forming circRNA:DNA complexes which can induce DNA breaks. This study investigated circRNA accumulation with gestational age in healthy and stillbirth placentae and determined whether circRNAs directly interact with placental DNA causing DNA damage. Placenta samples (n=60 term uncomplicated; n=4 unexplained stillbirth, 23, 26, 31, 34 weeks' gestation) were assessed for DNA damage using an alkaline Comet Assay. Expression levels of 6 candidate circRNAs (circ_0009000, circ_0024157, circ_0061017, circ_0036877, circ_0054624 and circ_0111277), and their linear transcripts, were quantified using qPCR. Physical interaction of candidate circRNAs with DNA was confirmed by DNA:RNA ImmunoPrecipitation (DRIP). The effect of circ_0009000 knockdown in HEK293T cells was assessed following transfection with either a siRNA (designed to knockdown circ_0009000) or a scrambled siRNA control, at 5, 10 and 20 nM final concentrations using Lipofectamine RNAiMax. DNA damage was assessed by Comet Assay. Compared with earlier gestations (37, 38, 39 and 40 weeks'), placental DNA damage and expression of all 6 candidate circRNAs, but not their linear transcripts, were increased in 40 and 41+ weeks' gestation samples, and in stillbirth. DRIP-qPCR signal size was significantly larger in term placentae than in enzyme-treated controls, confirming that all candidate circRNA loci bind to placental DNA. Depletion of circ_0009000 by specific siRNA in HEK293T cells, significantly reduced DNA damage compared to control. Stillbirth placentae show accelerated ageing with premature accumulation of candidate circRNAs (first evidence in humans) at levels consistent with older gestation tissue. Importantly, these circRNAs bind to DNA and circ_0009000 causes DNA breaks in placenta. Therefore, circRNAs (circ_0009000, circ_0024157, circ_0061017, circ_0036877, circ_0054624 and circ_0111277) play a role in placental ageing and associate with stillbirth, likely via DNA damage.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

This study aims to determine cost-saving risk thresholds for statin use in Germany to inform better prescription practices and healthcare policies.

MethodsA decision-analytic approach was employed, using secondary data to compare statin use with no statin use from the perspective of German sickness fund insurees. The analysis focused on cost savings from avoided cardiovascular (CV) events, translating these avoided events into net savings after accounting for treatment costs and potential side effects. The study considered the German adult population insured by sickness funds and used a lifetime horizon for the analysis.

ResultsThe maximum number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve cost savings over 10 years was found to be 40, leading to a minimum risk threshold for savings of 9.8%. It was estimated that approximately 22% of the adult population in Germany has a 10-year CV risk of [&ge;]9.8%, potentially avoiding between 307,049 and 705,537 CV events over 10 years, with net population savings of approximately {euro}18 billion.

ConclusionsThe current official threshold for statin prescription in Germany, set at a 20% 10-year risk, is too stringent. Lowering the threshold to 9.8% could significantly increase the number of patients benefiting from statin therapy, reducing CV events and generating substantial cost savings. These findings suggest that adjustments to prescription guidelines could improve cardiovascular outcomes and economic efficiency within the German healthcare system.","NA","medrxiv",1725401353787

Differences in copy number and other sources of extrinsic noise generate variance in transgene expression and limit the performance of synthetic gene circuits. In a therapeutic context, supraphysiological expression of transgenes can compromise engineered phenotypes and lead to toxicity. To ensure a narrow range of transgene expression, we design and characterize Compact microRNA-Mediated Attenuator of Noise and Dosage (ComMAND), a single-transcript, microRNA-based incoherent feedforward loop. We experimentally tune the ComMAND output profile, and we model the system to explore additional tuning strategies. By comparing ComMAND to two-gene implementations, we highlight the precise control afforded by the single-transcript architecture, particularly at relatively low copy numbers. We show that ComMAND tightly regulates transgene expression from lentiviruses and precisely controls expression in primary human T cells, primary rat neurons, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and human induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, ComMAND effectively sets levels of the clinically relevant transgenes FMRP1 and FXN within a narrow window. Together, ComMAND is a compact tool well-suited to precisely specify expression of therapeutic cargoes.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

For example, p53 deficiency in some mice has been shown to rescue premature aging while others display significant aging phenotype when p53-deficient. This study seeks to elucidate, structurally and mechanistically, p53s roles in longevity. Through a relative evolutionary scoring (RES) algorithm, we quantify the level of evolutionary change in the residues of p53 across organisms of varying average lifespans in six taxonomic orders. Secondly, we used PEPPI to assess the likelihood of interaction between p53-or p53-linked proteins-and known senescence-regulating proteins across organisms in the orders Primates and Perciformes. Our RES algorithm found variations in the alignments within and across orders, suggesting that mechanisms of p53-mediated regulation of longevity may vary. PEPPI results suggest that longer-lived species may have evolved to regulate induction and inhibition of cellular senescence better than their shorter-lived counterparts. With experimental verification, these predictions could help elucidate the mechanisms of p53-mediated cellular senescence, ultimately clarifying our understanding of p53s connection to aging in a multiple-species context.

Author summaryThe p53 tumor suppressor protein protects our genome from cancers by repairing DNA damage, regulating cell death and/or pushing cells to a state where they become permanently unable to divide (known as cellular senescence). An accumulation of senescent cells produces various molecular features of aging in both mouse and human cellular models-thus linking p53 to the aging process. However, the molecular mechanism by which p53 regulates aging and its structural implications on this regulation are not clear. In this study, we assessed quantitatively the evolutionary differences in p53 sequences of organisms across several taxonomical orders to determine if there is a relationship between average lifespan and sequence evolution. In addition, we used a protein-protein interaction tool to assess the likelihood of interaction between p53, or p53-associated protein, and various senescence-associated proteins across organisms of various lifespans in two taxonomic orders: Primates and Perciformes. An elucidation of p53 structural difference and mechanistic proteomic network linked to p53 regulation of cellular senescence could advance therapeutics targeting abnormal aging.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1725401353787

This study compared leading commercial blood tests for amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.

MethodsPlasma samples from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were assayed with AD blood tests from C2N Diagnostics, Fujirebio Diagnostics, ALZPath, Janssen, Roche Diagnostics, and Quanterix. Outcomes measures were amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, cortical thickness, and dementia severity. Logistic regression models assessed the classification accuracies of individual or combined plasma biomarkers for binarized outcomes, and Spearman correlations evaluated continuous relationships between individual plasma biomarkers and continuous outcomes.

ResultsMeasures of plasma p-tau217, either individually or in combination with other plasma biomarkers, had the strongest relationships with all AD outcomes.

DiscussionThis study identified the plasma biomarker analytes and assays that most accurately classified amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1725401353787

Persistently elevated autoantibodies have been found in some individuals with long COVID (LC). Using a >21,000 human protein array, we identified diverse AAB targets in LC patients that correlated with their symptoms. Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness.

From this family, we estimate an average of 192 DNMs per generation, including 75.5 de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 7.4 non-tandem repeat indels, 79.6 de novo indels or structural variants (SVs) originating from tandem repeats, 7.7 centromeric de novo SVs and SNVs, and 12.4 de novo Y chromosome events per generation. STRs and VNTRs are the most mutable with 32 loci exhibiting recurrent mutation through the generations. We accurately assemble 288 centromeres and six Y chromosomes across the generations, documenting de novo SVs, and demonstrate that the DNM rate varies by an order of magnitude depending on repeat content, length, and sequence identity. We show a strong paternal bias (75-81%) for all forms of germline DNM, yet we estimate that 17% of de novo SNVs are postzygotic in origin with no paternal bias. We place all this variation in the context of a high-resolution recombination map ([~]3.5 kbp breakpoint resolution). We observe a strong maternal recombination bias (1.36 maternal:paternal ratio) with a consistent reduction in the number of crossovers with increasing paternal (r=0.85) and maternal (r=0.65) age. However, we observe no correlation between meiotic crossover locations and de novo SVs, arguing against non-allelic homologous recombination as a predominant mechanism. The use of multiple orthogonal technologies, near-telomere-to-telomere phased genome assemblies, and a multi-generation family to assess transmission has created the most comprehensive, publicly available ""truth set"" of all classes of genomic variants. The resource can be used to test and benchmark new algorithms and technologies to understand the most fundamental processes underlying human genetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1725401353787

To understand how neurons work together and develop to mediate number sense, we used two-photon fluorescence light sheet microscopy to capture the activity of individual neurons throughout the brain of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), while displaying a visual number stimulus to the animal. We identified number-selective neurons as early as 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) and found a proportional increase of neurons tuned to larger (>2) quantities after 3 dpf. To determine if these neurons are sufficient to encode the correct quantity, we used machine learning to predict the stimulus from the neuronal activity and observed that the prediction accuracy improves with age. Given ethanol's propensity to inhibit cognitive functions, we tested its effect on number sense and found a decrease of active number-selective neurons in the forebrain during ethanol exposure, suggesting cognitive impairment. The findings here are a significant step towards understanding neural circuits devoted to discrete magnitudes and our methodology to track single neuron activity across the whole brain is broadly applicable to other fields in neuroscience.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787

We isolated satellite cells from eel muscle tissue to establish a foundation for cultured eel meat production. While initial cell cultures contained myoblasts, continued passaging led to a decline in myoblast characteristics and an increase in fibroblast-like cells. RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR analyses showed significant downregulation of well-established markers for satellite cells and myoblasts, such as pax7a and myoD, over successive passages, highlighting a loss of myoblastic traits. Single-cell cloning was employed to overcome this challenge and maintain myoblast purity, leading to the successful creation of the JEM1129 cell line. These JEM1129 cells demonstrated enhanced expression of myoblast marker genes, exceeding the initial primary culture cell population. The cells showed strong myotube formation, particularly when cultured in a differentiation medium, indicating their robust potential for muscle development. The JEM1129 cell line represents a significant advancement in the cultivation of eel muscle cells, offering a promising avenue for cultured meat production. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of muscle cell biology and provide valuable insights into using fish-derived myoblasts for cultured meat production.

However, the neural mechanisms that control cognitive map formation remain unclear. Here, using a double-blind study design with a pharmacological intervention in humans, we show that the neuromodulator noradrenaline elicits a significant 'spread of association' across the hippocampal cognitive map. This neural spread of association predicts overgeneralisation errors measured in behaviour, and is predicted by physiological markers for noradrenergic arousal, namely an increase in the pupil dilation response and reduced cortical GABAergic tone. Thus, noradrenaline sets the width of the 'smoothing kernel' for plasticity across the cognitive map. Elevated noradrenaline can allow disparate memories to become linked, introducing potential for distortions in the cognitive map that deviate from direct experience.","NA","biorxiv",1725401353787
