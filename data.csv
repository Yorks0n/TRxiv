We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1717970906899

Our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the channeling of hepatocyte neutral lipids towards cytosolic LDs or secreted lipoproteins remains incomplete. Here, we performed a series of CRISPR-Cas9 screens under different metabolic states to uncover mechanisms of hepatic neutral lipid flux. Clustering of chemical-genetic interactions identified CLIC-like chloride channel 1 (CLCC1) as a critical regulator of neutral lipid storage and secretion. Loss of CLCC1 resulted in the buildup of large LDs in hepatoma cells and knockout in mice caused liver steatosis. Remarkably, the LDs are in the lumen of the ER and exhibit properties of lipoproteins, indicating a profound shift in neutral lipid flux. Finally, remote homology searches identified a domain in CLCC1 that is homologous to yeast Brl1p and Brr6p, factors that promote the fusion of the inner and outer nuclear envelopes during nuclear pore complex assembly. Loss of CLCC1 lead to extensive nuclear membrane herniations, consistent with impaired nuclear pore complex assembly. Thus, we identify CLCC1 as the human Brl1p/Brr6p homolog and propose that CLCC1-mediated membrane remodeling promotes hepatic neutral lipid flux and nuclear pore complex assembly.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

However, it is presently unknown if and how such bursts of organismal diversity are influenced by temporal niche partitioning, wherein species avoid competition by being active during different time windows. Here, we address this question through profiling temporal activity patterns in the exceptionally diverse fauna of cichlid fishes from African Lake Tanganyika. By integrating week-long longitudinal behavioural recordings of over 500 individuals from 60 species with eco-morphological and genomic information, we provide two lines of evidence that temporal niche partitioning facilitated this massive adaptive radiation. First, Tanganyikan cichlids exhibit all known circadian temporal activity patterns (diurnal, nocturnal, crepuscular, and cathemeral) and display substantial inter-specific variation in daily amounts of locomotion. Second, many species with similar habitat and diet niches occupy distinct temporal niches. Moreover, our results suggest that shifts between diurnal and nocturnal activity patterns are facilitated by a crepuscular intermediate state. In addition, genome-wide association studies indicate that the genetics underlying activity patterns is complex, with different clades associated with different combinations of variants. The identified variants were not associated with core circadian clock genes but with genes implicated in synapse function. These observations indicate that temporal niche partitioning contributed to adaptive radiation in cichlids and that many genes are associated with the diversity and evolution of temporal activity patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial, several potential treatments for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were assessed in separate comparisons in RECOVERY, both of which are reported here. Eligible and consenting adults could join the molnupiravir comparison, the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, or both. For each comparison, participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the relevant antiviral (five days of molnupiravir 800mg twice daily or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 300mg/100mg twice daily) or to usual care without the relevant antiviral drug, using web-based unstratified randomisation with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were time to discharge alive from hospital, and among those not on invasive ventilation at baseline, progression to invasive ventilation or death. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Both comparisons were stopped by the investigators because of low recruitment. ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsFrom 24 January 2022 to 24 May 2023, 923 patients were recruited to the molnupiravir comparison (445 allocated molnupiravir and 478 allocated usual care), and from 31 March 2022 to 24 May 2023, 137 patients were recruited to the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison (68 allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 69 allocated usual care). More than three-quarters of the patients in both comparisons were vaccinated and had anti-spike antibodies at randomisation, and more than two-thirds were receiving other SARS-CoV-2 antivirals (including remdesivir or sotrovimab). In the molnupiravir comparison, 74 (17%) patients allocated to molnupiravir and 79 (17%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.28; p=0.66). In the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, 13 (19%) patients allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 13 (19%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.47-2.23; p=0.96). In neither comparison was there evidence of a significant difference in the duration of hospitalisation or the proportion of patients progressing to invasive ventilation or death.

InterpretationIn adults hospitalised with COVID-19, neither molnupiravir nor nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were associated with reductions in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death although these comparisons had limited statistical power due to low recruitment.

Here, we introduce an advanced TUS system that achieves unprecedented precision in deep brain neuromodulation. The system features a 256-element, helmet-shaped transducer array operating at 555 kHz, coupled with a stereotactic positioning system, individualised treatment planning, and real-time monitoring using functional MRI. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate the system's ability to selectively modulate the activity of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and its functionally connected regions in the visual cortex. Participants exhibited significantly increased visual cortex activity during concurrent TUS and visual stimulation, with high reproducibility across individuals. Moreover, a theta-burst TUS protocol induced robust neuromodulatory effects, with decreased visual cortex activity observed for at least 40 minutes post-stimulation. These neuromodulatory effects were specific to the targeted LGN, as confirmed by control experiments. Our findings highlight the potential of this advanced TUS system to non-invasively modulate deep brain circuits with high precision and specificity, offering new avenues for studying brain function and developing targeted therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders. The unprecedented spatial resolution and prolonged neuromodulatory effects demonstrate the transformative potential of this technology for both research and clinical applications, paving the way for a new era of non-invasive deep brain neuromodulation.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Here, we demonstrate a general framework for identifying genetic tool-independent, pharmacological strategies for neural circuit-selective modulation. We developed an economically accessible calcium imaging-based approach for large-scale pharmacological scans of endogenous receptor-mediated neural activity. As a testbed for this approach, we used the mouse locus coeruleus due to the combination of its widespread, modular efferent neural circuitry and its wide variety of endogenously expressed GPCRs. Using machine learning-based action potential deconvolution and retrograde tracing, we identified an agonist cocktail that selectively inhibits medial prefrontal cortex-projecting locus coeruleus neurons. In vivo, this cocktail produces synergistic antinociception, consistent with selective pharmacological blunting of this neural circuit. This framework has broad utility for selective targeting of other neural circuits under different physiological and pathological states, facilitating non-genetic translational applications arising from cell type-selective discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Here we show that VPS13C, a bridge-like lipid transport protein and a PD gene, is a sensor of lysosome stress/damage. Upon lysosome membrane perturbation, VPS13C rapidly relocates from the cytosol to the surface of lysosomes where it tethers their membranes to the ER. This recruitment depends on Rab7 and requires release of a brake, most likely an intramolecular interaction within VPS13C, which hinders access of its VAB domain to lysosome-bound Rab7. While another PD protein, LRRK2, is also recruited to stressed/damaged lysosomes, its recruitment occurs at much later stages and by different mechanisms. Given the putative role of VPS13 proteins in bulk lipid transport, these findings suggest lipid delivery to lysosomes by VPS13C is part of an early response to lysosome damage.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

The oscillation period of the human segmentation clock, as measured in induced presomitic mesoderm (iPSM) cells, is two times longer than that of mouse. While the core clock gene HES7 is known to show slower protein degradation in human iPSM compared with mouse iPSM, it remains unclear whether the concept of species-specific protein stability is generalizable to other genes. Here we systematically compared the protein degradation rates of approximately 5000 genes between human and mouse iPSM by using dynamic SILAC-based proteomics, demonstrating a pervasive trend of slower protein degradation in human cells. The inter-species difference was observed not only for proteasome-mediated but also for lysosome-mediated degradation. We further investigated the effect of metabolism on the protein stability profile. Treating mouse iPSM cells with a glycolysis inhibitor extended the segmentation clock period, aligning the protein stability profile more closely with that of human cells, though with less effect on lysosome-mediated degradation. These results highlight the universality of slower protein degradation in human development compared with mouse, and suggest metabolism as one of the modulators.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

However, the neural mechanisms are poorly understood, partly due to challenges replicating their metabolic effects in rodents. Here, we report a new mouse model that recapitulates overeating induced by clozapine, a widely prescribed APD. Our study shows that clozapine boosts food intake by inhibiting melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Interestingly, neither clozapine nor risperidone, another commonly used APD, affects receptor-ligand binding or the canonical Gs signaling of MC4R. Instead, they inhibit neuronal activity by enhancing the coupling between MC4R and Kir7.1, leading to the open state of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel. Deletion of Kir7.1 in Mc4r-Cre neurons prevents clozapine-induced weight gain, while treatment with a selective Kir7.1 blocker mitigates overeating in clozapine-fed mice. Our findings unveil a molecular pathway underlying the effect of APDs on feeding behavior and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions.

Key to lipid catabolism in the lysosome is bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a major lipid constituent of intralysosomal vesicles (ILVs) and a stimulator of lipid-degrading enzymes. BMP levels are altered in a broad spectrum of human conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. Although BMP synthase was recently discovered, it has long been thought that the unique stereochemistry of BMP confers resistance to acid phospholipases, a requirement for its role in the lysosome. Here, we demonstrate that PLA2G15, a major lysosomal phospholipase, efficiently hydrolyzes BMP with primary esters regardless of stereochemistry. Interestingly, we discover that the unique esterification position of BMP is what confers resistance to hydrolysis. Purified PLA2G15 catabolizes most BMP species derived from cell and tissue lysosomes under acidic conditions. Furthermore, PLA2G15 catalytic activity against synthesized BMP stereoisomers with primary esters was comparable to its canonical substrates. Conversely, BMP with secondary esters is intrinsically stable in vitro and requires acyl migration for hydrolysis in lysosomes. Consistent with our biochemical data, PLA2G15-deficient tissues and cells accumulate multiple BMP species, a phenotype reversible by supplementing wildtype PLA2G15 but not its catalytically dead mutant. Increasing BMP levels by targeting PLA2G15 reverses the cholesterol accumulation phenotype in Niemann Pick Disease Type C (NPC1) patient fibroblasts and significantly ameliorate disease pathologies in NPC1-deficient mice leading to extended lifespan. Our findings establish the rules that govern the stability of BMP in the lysosome and identify PLA2G15 as a lysosomal BMP hydrolase and as a potential target for modulating BMP levels for therapeutic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Here, we employed cryo-electron tomography, volume electron microscopy, and live-cell imaging to identify Ribosome-Associated Vesicles (RAVs) as a dynamic platform for moving ribosomes to distal processes. Stimulation via chemically-induced long-term potentiation causes RAV accumulation in distal sites to drive local translation. We also demonstrate activity-driven changes in RAV generation and dynamics in vivo, identifying tubular ER shaping proteins in RAV biogenesis. Together, our work identifies a mechanism for ribosomal delivery to distal sites in neurons to promote activity-dependent local translation.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

This is because it is challenging to distinguish between adverse effects arising from the properties of the expressed excess protein (cytotoxicity) and those caused solely by protein overexpression. In this study, we attempted to identify the model protein with the lowest cytotoxicity in yeast cells by introducing a new neutrality index. We found that a non-fluorescent fluorescent protein (mox-YG) and an inactive glycolytic enzyme (Gpm1-CCmut) showed the lowest cytotoxicity. These proteins can be expressed at levels exceeding 40% of total protein while maintaining yeast growth. The transcriptome of cells expressing mox-YG to the limit indicated that the cells were in a nitrogen source requirement state. Proteome analysis revealed increased mitochondrial function and decreased ribosome abundance, like the inactivated state of the TORC1 pathway. The decrease in ribosome abundance was presumably due to defective nucleolus formation, partially rescued by a mutation in the nuclear exosome. These findings suggest that massive overexpression of excess protein, termed protein burden, causes nitrogen source starvation, a metabolic shift toward more energy-efficient respiration, and a ribosomal biosynthesis defect due to an imbalance between ribosomal protein and rRNA synthesis in the nucleolus.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

In insects, the neck connective is both a physical and information bottleneck connecting the brain and the ventral nerve cord (VNC, spinal cord analogue) and comprises diverse populations of descending (DN), ascending (AN) and sensory ascending neurons, which are crucial for sensorimotor signalling and control. Integrating three separate EM datasets, we now provide a complete connectomic description of the ascending and descending neurons of the female nervous system of Drosophila and compare them with neurons of the male nerve cord. Proofread neuronal reconstructions have been matched across hemispheres, datasets and sexes. Crucially, we have also matched 51% of DN cell types to light level data defining specific driver lines as well as classifying all ascending populations. We use these results to reveal the general architecture, tracts, neuropil innervation and connectivity of neck connective neurons. We observe connected chains of descending and ascending neurons spanning the neck, which may subserve motor sequences. We provide a complete description of sexually dimorphic DN and AN populations, with detailed analysis of circuits implicated in sex-related behaviours, including female ovipositor extrusion (DNp13), male courtship (DNa12/aSP22) and song production (AN hemilineage 08B).

One major cell state change is senescence, which is associated with dramatic changes in cell metabolism, including increases in lipid metabolism, but how cells accommodate such alterations is poorly understood. Here, we show that the transcription factor p53 enables recycling of the lipid headgroups required to meet the increased demand for membrane phospholipids during senescence. p53 activation increases supply of phosphoethanolamine (PEtn), an intermediate in the Kennedy pathway for de novo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), by transactivating genes involved in autophagy and lysosomal catabolism that enable membrane turnover. Disruption of PEtn conversion to PE is well-tolerated in the absence of p53 but results in dramatic organelle remodeling and perturbs growth and gene expression following p53 activation. Consistently, CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screens reveal that p53-activated cells preferentially depend on genes involved in lipid metabolism. Together, these results reveal lipid headgroup recycling to be a homeostatic function of p53 that confers a cell-state specific metabolic vulnerability.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Here we provide a comprehensive characterization of pubertal mammary fibroblasts, achieved using single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial mapping, and in vivo lineage tracing. Notably, we discovered a transient niche-forming population of specialized contractile fibroblasts that exclusively localize around the tips of the growing mammary epithelium and are recruited from the surrounding fat pad. Using functional organoid-fibroblast co-cultures we reveal that different fibroblast populations can acquire contractile features when in direct contact with the epithelium, promoting morphogenesis.

The layers and areas are distinguished both molecularly, by diverse neuronal and glial cell subtypes, and structurally, through intricate spatial organization. While single-cell transcriptomics studies have advanced molecular characterization of human cortical development, a critical gap exists due to the loss of spatial context during cell dissociation. Here, we utilized multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), augmented with deep-learning-based cell segmentation, to examine the molecular, cellular, and cytoarchitectural development of human fetal cortex with spatially resolved single-cell resolution. Our extensive spatial atlas, encompassing 16 million single cells, spans eight cortical areas across four time points in the second and third trimesters. We uncovered an early establishment of the six-layer structure, identifiable in the laminar distribution of excitatory neuronal subtypes by mid-gestation, long before the emergence of cytoarchitectural layers. Notably, while anterior-posterior gradients of neuronal subtypes were generally observed in most cortical areas, a striking exception was the sharp molecular border between primary (V1) and secondary visual cortices (V2) at gestational week 20. Here we discovered an abrupt binary shift in neuronal subtype specification at the earliest stages, challenging the notion that continuous morphogen gradients dictate mid-gestation cortical arealization. Moreover, integrating single-nuclei RNA-sequencing and in situ whole transcriptomics revealed an early upregulation of synaptogenesis in V1-specific Layer 4 neurons, suggesting a role of synaptogenesis in this discrete border formation. Collectively, our findings underscore the crucial role of spatial relationships in determining the molecular specification of cortical layers and areas. This work not only provides a valuable resource for the field, but also establishes a spatially resolved single-cell analysis paradigm that paves the way for a comprehensive developmental atlas of the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Nevertheless, the COVID-19 epidemic continues, albeit with low rates of severe illness, and hybrid immunity holders are becoming more common in these populations. It is necessary to determine the immunological protection correlates against SARS-CoV-2 re-infection in individuals with hybrid immunity because the currently available immune correlates were established by analyzing individuals possessing vaccine-induced immunity only. Methods We conducted an ad hoc prospective cohort study to measure serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in 4,496 Japanese adults as part of the national COVID-19 seroepidemiological survey. This ad hoc study evaluated the correlation between anti-S and anti-nucleocapsid (N) antibody levels at the first visit and their effectiveness in infection prevention until the second visit, including undiagnosed re-infections during the Omicron BA.5 epidemic period from December 2022 to March 2023. Findings We assessed the combined effect of anti-N and anti-S antibody levels and found that the reduced infection risk associated with anti-S antibody levels was limited. Contrastingly, higher levels of anti-N antibodies were strongly linked to a reduced infection risk in the entire cohort and in individuals with hybrid immunity. Interpretation We demonstrate a high correlation between reduced re-infection risk in hybrid immunity holders and high serum anti-N antibody levels, highlighting its potential as an immunological surrogate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 re-infection. The findings indicate that individuals with hybrid immunity are protected by a distinct form of immunity, beyond the presence of serum anti-S antibodies, which correlates with serum anti-N antibody levels. Funding The national COVID-19 seroepidemiological survey as a public health investigation was funded by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan (MHLW).

The oscillation of the segmentation clock is a well-studied model of developmental tempo. While the clock period is known to scale with the kinetics of gene expression and degradation processes of the core clock gene Hes7 across mammalian species, how these key molecular processes are coordinated remains unclear. In this study, we investigated if metabolic activities act as a global modulator for the segmentation clock, finding that they are rather selective modulators. While several metabolic inhibitions extended the clock period, their effects on the key processes varied. Inhibition of glycolysis decelerated the protein degradation of Hes7 and extended the production delay but did not influence the intron delay. Electron transport chain inhibition extended Hes7 intron delay without influencing the other two processes. Combinations of distinct metabolic inhibitions exhibited synergistic effects. By contrast, temperature changes affected the clock period and all three key processes simultaneously. These results highlight the selective effects of metabolic activities on segmentation clock processes, hinting that their scaled kinetics across species may be achieved through combinations of multiple modulators.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

However, little is known about how the microbial community in the rumen responds to Asparagopsis supplementation, and how changes in the rumen microbiome may contribute to shifts in rumen function and ultimately the hosts phenotype. In this study, we generated and analyzed metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from the microbiome associated with rumen fluid collected from two cohorts of lactating dairy cows, one fed a diet supplemented with Asparagopsis armata (treatment) and another fed the same diet without A. armata supplementation (control). The reduction of CH4 emission from animals that received A. armata was coupled to a qualitative decrease in relative archaeal abundance and a significant reduction in the transcription of methanogenesis pathways. Additionally, a significant decrease in the transcription of genes for complex carbon catabolism and a re-organization of the expression profile of carbon catabolic genes at the species level was observed in treated animals. Increased H2 production, a consequence of methanogenesis suppression, was coupled to a significant increase in the transcription of hydrogenases that mediate hydrogenotrophic metabolism in the treatment group. Analysis of metatranscriptome data identified a single uncultured hydrogenotrophic bacterial species (a Duodenibacillus sp.) as the dominant driver of this transcriptional change. Comparative genomic analysis between the Duodenibacillus sp. and other hydrogenotrophic rumen organisms revealed metabolic traits in the Duodenibacillus that may provide a competitive advantage in H2 scavenging. These findings provide an initial understanding of how rumen microbiota respond to a promising CH4 reducing feed additive, and may serve as a model to understand alternative stable rumen microbiome states that produce less methane and increase animal productivity.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

ROS and RCS extensively damage cellular biomolecules and organelles, affecting plant's viability and development. Emerging reports highlight that the multi-stress responding DJ-1 superfamily proteins are critical in attenuating cytotoxic effects associated with abiotic stress. The current report, validated in yeast and plant models, shows that AtDJ-1C and AtDJ-1E are robust antioxidants that scavenge ROS and improve survival under oxidative stress. Although they lack conventional glyoxalases and do not attenuate the glycation of proteins, AtDJ-1C and AtDJ-1E preserve the GSH pool and regulate redox homeostasis. Moreover, transcriptome profiling indicates that levels of AtDJ-1C and AtDJ-1E are rapidly established to counter heat and oxidative stress conditions. Notably, the knockdown of AtDJ-1C and AtDJ-1E promotes detrimental alterations such as reduced chlorophyll retention, impaired root morphogenesis, and induced sensitivity to heat stress due to ROS elevation. Contrastingly, overexpression of AtDJ-1C and AtDJ-1E improved plant height and rosette formation under physiological conditions. In conclusion, our study unravels the pivotal functions of Arabidopsis thaliana DJ-1C and DJ-1E in governing plant health and survival under heat and oxidative stress conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

This question has been virtually unexplored in the context of the H2A.Z histone variant and its incorporation into nucleosomes by the Snf2 Related CREBBP Activator Protein (SRCAP) complex. Here we combine rapid SRCAP depletion, a SRCAP mutant lacking H2A.Z deposition activity, and quantitative genome-wide approaches to dissect how SRCAP and H2A.Z regulate transcription in pluripotent stem cells. We find that SRCAP exhibits essential H2A.Z-independent functions in preventing DNA binding of lineage-specific transcription factors at enhancers and stimulating transcription factor binding at promoters. In contrast, H2A.Z acts mainly as a transcriptional repressor that requires dynamic reloading by SRCAP throughout the cell cycle. Our study demonstrates how the SRCAP-H2A.Z axis broadly orchestrates transcription to promote self-renewal, inhibit differentiation, and maintain plasticity of pluripotent stem cells.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Multiple solutions have been recently developed to widen the conformational landscape of predictions made by Alphafold2 (AF2). Here, we introduce AFsample2, a method employing random MSA column masking to reduce the influence of co-evolutionary signals to enhance the structural diversity of models generated by the AF2 neural network. AFsample2 improves the prediction of alternative states for a broad range of proteins, yielding high-quality end states and diverse conformational ensembles. In the data set of open-closed conformations (OC23), alternate state models improved in 17 out of 23 cases without compromising the generation of the preferred state. Consistent results were observed in 16 membrane protein transporters, with improvements in 12 out of 16 targets. TM-score improvements to experimental end states were substantial, sometimes exceeding 50%, elevating mediocre scores from 0.58 to nearly perfect 0.98. Furthermore, AFsample2 increased the diversity of intermediate conformations by 70% compared to the standard AF2 system, producing highly confident models, that could potentially be on-path between the two states. In addition, we also propose a way of selecting the end-states in generated model ensembles. These solutions could potentially enhance the generation and identification of alternative protein conformations, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of protein function and dynamics. Future work will focus on validating the accuracy of these intermediate conformations and exploring their relevance to functional transitions in proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Yet, studies rarely, if ever, consider the possibility that systematic differences in inner experience (i.e., what subjects think and feel during the scan) may directly affect FC measures. Here we demonstrate that is the case using a rs-fMRI dataset comprising 471 scans annotated with experiential data. Wide-spread significant differences in FC are observed between scans that systematically differ in terms of reported in-scanner experience.

A short-term increase in reliance on social information under these conditions has been experimentally shown in primates, including humans, but whether this occurs in other taxa is unknown. By conducting a large-scale cultural diffusion experiment, we asked whether migration between spatially variable environments affected social information use in great tits (Parus major), a small passerine bird that can socially learn novel behaviors. We simulated an immigration event where knowledgeable birds were exchanged between groups with opposing preferences for a socially learned foraging puzzle, living in similar or different environments. We found evidence that both immigrants and residents were influenced by social information and attended to the rewards that others received. Our analysis supported the use of a payoff-biased social learning by immigrants when both resources and habitat features were spatially variable. In contrast, immigrants relied more-so on individual learning when payoffs or the environment were unchanged. In summary, our results suggest that great tits assess the payoffs others receive, and are more influenced by socially observed differences in payoffs when environmental cues differ in their new environment. Our results provide experimental support for the hypothesis that spatial variation is a strong driver for the evolution of social learning strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

This study describes hospital care of pediatric catatonia patients and compares treatments for neurotypical patients and those with NDDs. Methods: Retrospective cohort study from 1/1/2018 to 6/1/2023 of two academic medical centers of patients aged 18 and younger with catatonia. Patients were retrospectively assessed using the clinical global impressions-improvement (CGI-I) by two independent reviewers. Results: One hundred sixty-five patients were hospitalized for catatonia, of whom 50.3% had an NDD. Median age was 15. One hundred sixty-four patients were treated with a benzodiazepine, with a median maximum 24-hour dose of 6 mg lorazepam-equivalents, which did not differ for patients with and without NDDs. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was utilized in 14.5% of patients. Median length of medical hospitalization was 5 days and hospitalizations were longer in neurotypical patients than in patients with NDDs. In an ordinal regression model, the probability of observing at least much improvement (CGI < 3) was 88.3% (95% CI: 82.4% to 92.3%), with NDD diagnosis associated with a lower odds of clinical response. Conclusions: The probability of patients achieving a CGI-I score indicating at least much improvement was 88.3%. Administered benzodiazepine dose and ECT treatment were similar for all patients, but neurotypical patients had longer hospitalizations than those with NDDs and had a higher odds of a more favorable clinical response.

These studies typically involve pre-training a transformer model on large-scale single-cell sequencing data, followed by fine-tuning for a variety of downstream tasks, achieving notable performance. However, these models all share a common shortcoming: to utilize the transformer architecture, originally designed for textual data, they artificially impose a sequential structure on genes within cells, simplifying the complex interactions between genes. Furthermore, they focus solely on transcriptomic data, neglecting other relevant biological information. To address these issues, here we introduce Cell-Graph Compass (CGC), the first foundational model that leverages graph structures to model single cells and describes cells from multiple perspectives, including transcriptional profiles, gene text summaries, transcription factor regulatory networks, gene co-expression patterns, and gene positional relationships. By incorporating self-attention mechanisms, we pretrained the model on 50 million human single-cell sequencing data, resulting in a robust digital representation of cells.

However, non-declarative memories do not require the hippocampus for learning or for sleep-dependent consolidation19-26 meaning what drives their consolidation is unknown.

Replay occurred at both real-world and time-compressed speeds and was also prioritised both at the level of the individual neurons and the type of neural sequence. Complete bilateral lesions of the hippocampus had no effect on any feature of this replay. Our results demonstrate that procedural replay during consolidation of a non-declarative memory is independent of the hippocampus. These results support the view that replay drives active consolidation of all types of memory during sleep but challenges the idea that the hippocampus is the source of this replay.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Somatostatin receptors (SSTR) are abundantly expressed in the islet cells and coupled to Gi and lowering of intracellular cAMP. We find that both SSTR3 and SSTR5 localize to primary cilia of {beta}-cells, and that activation of these receptors lowers the ciliary cAMP concentration. cAMP produced in the cytosol can enter the cilium through diffusion, but activation of ciliary SSTR3 specifically counteracts the rise of cAMP in the cilium. Moreover, we find that islet {delta}-cells are positioned near primary cilia of the other islet cell types and that somatostatin secretion is directed towards primary cilia. While acute exposure to somatostatin caused a rapid lowering of ciliary cAMP, sustained exposure promoted nuclear entry of the cilia-dependent transcription factor GLI2 through a mechanism that operated in parallel with the canonical Hedgehog pathway and depended on ciliary Ca2+ signaling. We also find that primary cilia length is reduced in islets from human donors with type-2 diabetes, which is associated with a reduction in cilia-{delta}-cell interactions. Our findings show that islet cell primary cilia constitute an important target of somatostatin action that endows it with the ability to regulate islet cell function beyond the acute suppression of hormone release.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Inhibition of G3BP1 by expression of its acidic or B-domain accelerates axon regeneration after nerve injury bringing a potential therapeutic intervention to promote neural repair in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we asked if G3BP1 inhibition is a viable strategy to promote regeneration in the injured mammalian central nervous system where axons do not regenerate spontaneously. G3BP1 B-domain expression was found to promote axon regeneration in both the mammalian spinal cord and optic nerve. Moreover, a cell permeable peptide to a subregion of G3BP1 B-domain (rodent G3BP1 amino acids 190-208) accelerated axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injury and promoted the regrowth of reticulospinal axons into the distal transected spinal cord through a bridging peripheral nerve graft. The rodent and human G3BP1 peptides promoted axon growth from rodent and human neurons cultured on permissive substrates, and this function required alternating Glu/Asp-Pro repeats that impart a unique predicted tertiary structure. These studies point to G3BP1 granules as a critical impediment to CNS axon regeneration and indicate that G3BP1 granule disassembly represents a novel therapeutic strategy for promoting neural repair after CNS injury.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, nitrogen starvation has distinct physiological consequences depending on the presence of mating partners. In their absence, cells enter quiescence, and TORC1 inactivation prolongs their life. In presence of compatible mates, TORC1 inactivation is essential for sexual differentiation. Gametes engage in paracrine pheromone signaling, grow towards each other, fuse to form the diploid zygote, and form resistant, haploid spore progenies. To understand the signaling changes in the proteome and phospho-proteome during sexual reproduction, we developed cell synchronization strategies and present (phospho-)proteomic datasets that dissect pheromone from starvation signals over the sexual differentiation and cell-cell fusion processes. Unexpectedly, these datasets reveal phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 during sexual development, which we establish requires TORC1 activity. We demonstrate that TORC1 is re-activated by pheromone signaling, in a manner that does not require autophagy. Mutants with low TORC1 re-activation exhibit compromised mating and poorly viable spores. Thus, while inactivated to initiate the mating process, TORC1 is reactivated by pheromone signaling in starved cells to support sexual reproduction.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Using a combination of electron and fluorescence microscopy and gentamicin protection assays we show that P. alcalifaciens 205/92 is internalized into eukaryotic cells, rapidly lyses its internalization vacuole and proliferates in the cytosol. This triggers caspase-4 dependent inflammasome responses in gut epithelial cells. The requirement for the T3SS1a in entry, vacuole lysis and cytosolic proliferation is host-cell type specific, playing a more prominent role in human intestinal epithelial cells as compared to macrophages. In a bovine ligated intestinal loop model, P. alcalifaciens colonizes the intestinal mucosa, inducing mild epithelial damage with negligible fluid accumulation. No overt role for T3SS1a or T3SS1b was seen in the calf infection model. However, T3SS1b was required for the rapid killing of Drosophila melanogaster. We propose that the acquisition of two T3SS by horizontal gene transfer has allowed P. alcalifaciens to diversify its host range, from a highly virulent pathogen of insects to an opportunistic gastrointestinal pathogen of animals.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

However, the relationship between behavioural aspects such as sleep quality and depressive symptoms, which contribute to MP, and the underlying structural brain substrates of their interplay remains unclear. This study used three population-based cohorts of younger and older adults (n=1,950) from the Human Connectome Project-Young Adult (HCP-YA), HCP-Aging (HCP-A), and enhanced Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland sample (eNKI-RS). Several canonical correlation analyses were computed within a machine learning framework to assess the associations between each of the three domains (sleep quality, depressive symptoms, grey matter volume (GMV)) and MP. The HCP-YA analyses showed progressively stronger associations between MP and each domain: depressive symptoms (unexpectedly positive, r=0.13, SD=0.06), sleep quality (r=0.17, SD=0.05), and GMV (r=0.19, SD=0.06). Combining sleep and depressive symptoms significantly improved the canonical correlations (r=0.25, SD=0.05), while the addition of GMV exhibited no further increase (r=0.23, SD=0.06). In young adults, better sleep quality, mild depressive symptoms, and GMV of several brain regions were associated with better MP. This was conceptually replicated in young adults from the eNKI-RS cohort. In HCP-Aging, better sleep quality, fewer depressive symptoms, and increased GMV were associated with MP. Robust multivariate associations were observed between sleep quality, depressive symptoms and GMV with MP, as well as age-related variations in these factors. Future studies should further explore these associations and consider interventions targeting sleep and mental health to test the potential effects on MP across the lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

We investigated how ecological interactions between microbes derived from polymicrobial urinary tract infections affect the tempo and mode of antibiotic resistance evolution. We show that for representative strains of three uropathogens, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecium, the rate and evolutionary trajectories towards antibiotic resistance depend on interactions with community members that mediate their growth and antibiotic tolerance. Replicate lineages of the same species evolved under similar ecological conditions show parallel evolutionary trajectories.

However, recent models have suggested that its neuronal responses can be well explained by graphs, or state-spaces, that model the transitions between experiences. Here we use simulations and hippocampal recordings to reconcile these views. We show that if state-spaces are constructed compositionally from existing building blocks, or primitives, hippocampal responses can be interpreted as compositional memories, binding these primitives together. Critically, this enables agents to behave optimally in novel environments with no new learning, inferring behaviour directly from the composition. We predict a role for hippocampal replay in building and consolidating these compositional memories. Importantly, due to their compositional nature, replay can construct states the agent has never experienced - effectively building memories of the future. We test these predictions in two datasets by showing that replay events from newly discovered landmarks induce and strengthen new remote firing fields. These memories, built in replay, are compositional. When the landmark is moved, replay builds a new firing field at the same vector to the new location. Together, these findings provide a framework for reasoning about compositional memories, and demonstrate that such memories are formed in hippocampal replay.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Here we used longitudinal 2-photon Ca2+ imaging of dorsal striatal neurons in head-fixed mice as they learned to self-generate locomotion. We observed a significant activation of both direct- and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs and iSPNs, respectively) during early locomotion bouts and sessions that gradually decreased over time. For dSPNs, onset- and offset-ensembles were gradually refined from active motion-nonspecific cells. iSPN ensembles emerged from neurons initially active during opponent actions before becoming onset- or offset-specific. Our results show that as striatal ensembles are progressively refined, the number of active nonspecific striatal neurons decrease and the overall efficiency of the striatum information encoding for learned actions increases.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Besides eliminating mutant alleles in familial disease, gene-editing can also be used to favorably manipulate upstream pathophysiologic events and alter disease-course in wider patient populations, but few such feasible therapeutic avenues have been reported. Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the last exon of amyloid precursor protein (App), relevant for Alzheimer disease (AD). Our strategy effectively eliminates an endocytic (YENPTY) motif at APP C-terminus, while preserving the N-terminus and compensatory APP-homologues. This manipulation favorably alters events along the amyloid-pathway; inhibiting toxic APP-beta-cleavage fragments (including amyloid-beta; and upregulating neuroprotective APP-alpha-cleavage products.

Pathologic alterations in the glial-transcriptome of App-KI mice, as seen by single nuclei RNA-sequencing (sNuc-Seq), are also normalized by App C-terminus editing. Our strategy takes advantage of innate transcriptional rules that render terminal exons insensitive to nonsense-decay, and the upstream manipulation is expected to be effective for all forms of AD.

These stringent standards can lead to the exclusion of many participants, creating a tension with a countervailing requirement for large sample sizes that can provide adequate statistical power, particularly for brain-behavior association studies. Here, we test and validate two techniques aimed at mitigating the impact of head motion on functional connectivity estimates, and show that these techniques enable the retention of a substantial proportion of participants who would otherwise be excluded based on motion criteria, such as a minimum mean framewise displacement (FD) threshold. Specifically, we first show that functional connectomes computed using time series data that have been ordered according to motion (i.e., framewise displacement - FD) and (1) subsetted to include the lowest-motion time points (""motion ordered"") or (2) subsetted and resampled (""bagged"") are reproducible, in that they enable the successful identification of an individual from a group using functional connectome fingerprinting. Second, we demonstrate that motion-ordered and bagged functional connectomes yield robust brain-behavior associations, which, when examined as a function of sample size, are comparable to those obtained using the standard full time series. Finally, we show that the utility of both approaches lies in maximizing participant inclusivity by allowing for the retention of high-motion participants that would otherwise be discarded. Given equivalent performance of the two approaches across these tests of reproducibility, validity, and utility, we conclude by recommending motion-ordering to enable data rescue, maximize inclusivity, and address the need for adequately powered samples in functional connectivity research, while maintaining stringent data quality standards. While our findings were reproducible across different head motion thresholds and edges in the functional connectome, we outline possibilities for further validation and assessment of generalization using other behavioral phenotypes and consortia datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

ObjectiveTo explore how the results of mega-trails compare to the meta-analysis results of trials with smaller sample sizes.

Data SourcesClinicaltrials.gov was searched for mega-trials until 10.01.2023. PubMed was searched until June 2023 for meta-analyses incorporating the results of the eligible mega-trials.

Study SelectionMega-trials were eligible if they were non-cluster non-vaccine randomized control trials (RCTs); had a sample size over 10,000; and had a peer-reviewed meta-analysis publication presenting results for the primary outcome of the mega-trials and/or all-cause mortality.

Data Extraction and SynthesisFor each selected meta-analysis, we extracted results of smaller trials and mega-trials included in the summary effect estimate, and combined them separately using random effects. These estimates were used to calculate the ratio of odds ratios (ROR) between mega-trials and smaller trials in each meta-analysis. Next, the ROR were combined using random-effects. Risk of bias was extracted for each trial included in our analyses (or when not available, assessed only for mega-trials).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe main outcomes were the summary ROR for the primary outcome and all-cause mortality between mega-trials and smaller trials. Sensitivity analyses were performed with respect to the time of publishing, masking, weight, type of intervention, and specialty.

ResultsOf 120 mega-trials identified, 39 (33%) had significant benefits for the primary outcome and 18 (15%) had significant benefits for all-cause mortality for the intervention. In 35 comparisons of primary outcomes (including 85 point estimates from 69 unique mega-trials and 272 point estimatesfrom smaller trials) and 26 comparisons of all-cause mortality (including 70 point estimates from 65 unique mega-trials and 267 point estimates from smaller trials), ROR was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.97-1.04) and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.97-1.04), respectively. For the primary outcomes, smaller trials published before the mega-trials had more favorable results than the mega-trials (ROR 1.05, 95% CI, 1.01-1.10), and than the subsequent smaller trials (ROR 0.91, 95% CI, 0.85-0.96).

Conclusions and RelevanceMeta-analyses of smaller studies show in general comparable results with mega-trials, but smaller trials published before the mega-trials give more favorable results than the mega-trials.","NA","medrxiv",1717970906899

These sensors effectively reported in planta the specific activity of both Tobacco Etch Virus protease and caspase-3. Furthermore, we developed sensors for detecting plant metacaspase activity, validated through both in vitro and in planta experiments. These experiments revealed the spatial dynamics of proteolysis triggered by metacaspase activation following wounding and programmed cell death in roots. The implementation of these tools in plant biology research opens new avenues for investigating proteolytic mechanisms, significantly enhancing the potential for in-depth studies. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using these sensors to detect diverse protease activities in vivo with high spatiotemporal resolution. These plant proteolytic biosensors hence represent a valuable toolbox for understanding protease functions within their natural context, paving the way for future advancements in plant biology research.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Here, we show that a transcriptomically, morphologically, and biophysically distinct RSG cell-type - the low-rheobase (LR) neuron - has a very distinct expression profile of cholinergic muscarinic receptors compared to all other neighboring excitatory neuronal subtypes. LR neurons do not fire persistently in response to cholinergic agonists, in stark contrast to all other principal neuronal subtypes examined within the RSG and across midline cortex. This lack of persistence allows LR neuron models to rapidly compute angular head velocity (AHV), independent of cholinergic changes seen during navigation. Thus, LR neurons can consistently compute AHV across brain states, highlighting the specialized RSG neural codes supporting navigation.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

In order to address these questions, we used a spatial mapping task on healthy participants to measure the accuracy and precision of spatial estimates pertaining to several locations on their arm and on a hand-held tool. To study spatial accuracy, we first fitted linear regressions with real location as predictor and estimated location as dependent variables. Intercepts and slopes, representing constant offset and estimation error, were compared between arm and tool, and before to after tool use. We further investigated changes induced by tool use in terms of variable error associated with spatial estimates, representing their precision. We found that the spatial maps for the arm and tool were comparably accurate, suggesting that holding the tool provides enough information to the sensorimotor system to map it in space. Further, using the tool fine-tuned the user spatial maps, increasing the precision of the tool map to a greater extent than their arm map. Furthermore, this increased precision is focal to specific tool locations, i.e., the tool tip, which may work as a spatial anchor following tool use.

A vital stage of their precopulatory behaviour involves detecting the faint flight tone of a mating partner amidst the noise from hundreds of other mosquitoes. This exquisite sensory performance is enabled by a complex auditory system with remarkable features. One such feature is their vast efferent control system, which provides the mosquito ear with the required plasticity to adapt to various external and internal changes. In this paper, we study the auditory role of GABA, one of the main efferent signalling molecules in the mosquito ear, and its interactions with octopamine, another neurotransmitter of the efferent network. We show that GABA is released in the malaria mosquito auditory nerve and that GABA receptors are expressed in the ear, including the GABAA receptor Resistance to Dieldrin (RDL), a target for the evolution of insecticide resistance. Using picrotoxin to antagonize RDL receptors, we discovered multiple auditory effects of GABA at the mechanical and electrical level. At the mechanical level, blocking RDL promotes the erection of antennal fibrillae and the cessation of flagellar self-sustained oscillations. These effects are not observed in knockouts of the octopamine receptor AgOctbeta2, suggesting that RDL auditory mechanical effects are mediated through octopamine release in the mosquito ear. Electrically, picrotoxin injection increases the spontaneous firing of auditory neurons and direct current (DC) responses of the nerve to mechanical stimulation both in wildtype and AgOctbeta2 mutants, indicating that RDL may also modulate auditory sensitivity via octopamine-independent pathways. In summary, our experiments uncover distinct auditory roles of GABA, as well as synergistic roles with octopamine. The data show a fundamental role of RDL in controlling the auditory function of malaria mosquitoes and implicate RDL signalling in mating of natural malaria mosquito populations.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

In the immunologically unique and tightly restricted CNS, it remains unclear if and how brain TRM, which express the inhibitory receptor PD-1, alarm the surrounding tissue during antigen re-encounter. Here, we reveal that TRM are sufficient to drive the rapid remodeling of the brain immune landscape through activation of microglia, DCs, NK cells, and B cells, expansion of Tregs, and recruitment of macrophages and monocytic dendritic cells. Moreover, we report that while PD-1 restrains granzyme B expression by reactivated brain TRM, it has no effect on cytotoxicity or downstream alarm responses. We conclude that TRM are sufficient to trigger rapid immune activation and recruitment in the CNS and may have an unappreciated role in driving neuroinflammation.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Recent studies have reported alterations of the adaptive immune system in early AD stages, such as preclinical AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. However, the identity of specific antigenic targets and whether the respective response is beneficial or detrimental during disease progression are still open questions. Herein, we describe cross-sectional analyses of blood and cerebrospinal fluid from three different study populations covering early AD stages. We employed high-dimensional mass cytometry, single-cell RNA-sequencing, in vitro T cell secretome analysis, and antigen presentation assays to achieve a comprehensive characterization of adaptive immune cell populations. Our results show that subjects at the stage of asymptomatic, preclinical AD can mount a CD4+ T helper cell response towards {beta}-amyloid peptide and display an early enrichment of cytotoxic CD8+ effector/TEMRA cells in CSF, combined with a less immunosuppressive gene signature of peripheral regulatory T cells. Conversely, in MCI due to AD, we observed increased frequencies of CD8+ effector/TEMRA cells in the periphery, characterized by a pro-inflammatory gene expression profile and an overall decrease in antigen responsiveness. Our results demonstrate the complexity of adaptive immune changes in early AD and suggest that it may be beneficial in the preclinical stage to promote specific CD4+ T cell responses, while in MCI it may be important to therapeutically target CD8+ T cell responses if these prove to be harmful.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Here, we examined gene family evolution of 1,154 genomes from nearly all known species in the medically and technologically important yeast subphylum Saccharomycotina. We found that yeast gene family and genome evolution are distinct from plants, animals, and filamentous ascomycetes and are characterized by small genome sizes and smaller gene numbers but larger gene family sizes. Faster-evolving lineages (FELs) in yeasts experienced significantly higher rates of gene losses, commensurate with a narrowing of metabolic niche breadth, but higher speciation rates than their slower-evolving sister lineages (SELs). Gene families most often lost are those involved in mRNA splicing, carbohydrate metabolism, and cell division and are likely associated with intron loss, metabolic breadth, and non-canonical cell cycle processes. Our results highlight the significant role of gene family contractions in the evolution of yeast metabolism, genome function, and speciation, and suggest that gene family evolutionary trajectories have differed markedly across major eukaryotic lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

CFT073 is a prototypic, urosepsis isolate of sequence type (ST) 73. This laboratory, among others, has shown that strain CFT073 is resistant to serum, with capsule and other extracellular polysaccharides imparting resistance. The interplay of such polysaccharides remains under-explored. This study has shown that CFT073 mutants deficient in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen and capsule display exquisite serum sensitivity. Additionally, O-antigen and LPS outer core mutants displayed significantly reduced surface K2 capsule, coupled with increased unbound K2 capsule being detected in the supernatant. The R1 core and O6 antigen are involved in the tethering of K2 capsule to the CFT073 cell surface, highlighting the importance of the R1 core in serum resistance. The dependence of capsule on LPS was shown to be post-transcriptional and related to changes in cell surface charge. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy suggested that the surface pattern of capsule is altered in such LPS core mutants, which display a punctate capsule expression. Finally, targeting LPS biosynthesis using sub-inhibitory concentrations of a WaaG inhibitor resulted in increased serum sensitivity, antibiotic sensitivity, and reduced capsule in CFT073. Interestingly, the dependency of capsule on LPS has been observed previously in several Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates and a neonatal meningitic E. coli strain, indicating that the synergy between these polysaccharides is not just strain, serotype or species-specific but may be conserved across several pathogenic Gram-negative species. Therefore, using WaaG inhibitor derivatives or phage-derived depolymerases to target LPS is a promising avenue for co-administration with antibiotics to reduce morbidity and mortality by reducing or eliminating surface capsule.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Under interpretable regularity conditions, we show that the proportion of detectable identity-by-descent segments at a locus is normally distributed for large sample size and large scaled population size. We use efficient and exact simulations to study the distributional behavior of the detectable identity-by-descent rate in finite samples.

The gut microbiome has been shown to enhance absorption of nutrients, such as lipids, by intestinal epithelial cells. However, whether protein absorption is also affected by the gut microbiome is poorly understood. Here, we investigate connections between protein absorption and microbes in the zebrafish gut. Using live microscopy-based quantitative assays, we find that microbes slow the pace of protein uptake and degradation in LREs. While microbes do not affect the number of absorbing LRE cells, microbes lower the expression of endocytic and protein digestion machinery in LREs. Using transgene assisted cell isolation and single cell RNA-sequencing, we characterize all intestinal cells that take up dietary protein. We find that microbes affect expression of bacteria-sensing and metabolic pathways in LREs, and that some secretory cell types also take up protein and share components of protein uptake and digestion machinery with LREs. Using custom-formulated diets, we investigated the influence of diet and LRE activity on the gut microbiome. Impaired protein uptake activity in LREs, along with a protein-deficient diet, alters the microbial community and leads to increased abundance of bacterial genera that have the capacity to reduce protein uptake in LREs. Together, these results reveal that diet-dependent reciprocal interactions between LREs and the gut microbiome regulate protein absorption.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Dysfunctional plasma lipid control represents the major risk factor for cardio-metabolic diseases, the leading cause of human mortality3,4. Within the cellular landscape, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the central hub of lipid synthesis and secretion, particularly in metabolically active hepatocytes in the liver or enterocytes in the gut5,6. Initially assembled in the ER lumen, lipid-ferrying lipoproteins necessitate the cross-membrane transfer of both neutral and phospho-lipids onto the lumenal apolipoprotein B (APOB), in a poorly-defined process 7-10. Here we show that trans-bilayer equilibration of phospholipids, regulated by the ER protein CLCC1, determines lipid partition across the ER membrane and consequently systemic lipid homeostasis. CLCC1 partners with the phospholipid scramblase TMEM41B11,12 to recognize imbalanced bilayers and promote lipid scrambling, thereby licensing lipoprotein biogenesis and the subsequent bulk lipid transport. Strikingly, loss of CLCC1 or TMEM41B leads to the emergence of giant lumenal lipid droplets enclosed by extensively imbalanced ER bilayers, and consequently drastically accelerated pathogenesis of metabolic-dysfunction-associated liver steatohepatitis (MASH). The above results establish phospholipid scrambling at the ER as the lynchpin to maintain a dynamic equilibrium. Considering the requirement of trans-bilayer phospholipid equilibration in numerous biological processes, ranging from catabolic autophagy to viral infection13-16, our study may enable further elucidation of a previously under-appreciated homeostatic control mechanism intrinsic to the ER function in lipid biogenesis and distribution.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

To enhance our understanding of how DNA methylation is implicated in regulation of gene expression and the X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in tree shrew brains, here we present their first genome-wide, single-base-resolution methylomes integrated with transcriptomes from prefrontal cortices. We discovered both divergent and conserved features of tree shrew DNA methylation compared to that of other mammals. DNA methylation levels of promoter and gene body regions are negatively correlated with gene expression, consistent with patterns in other mammalian brains studied. Comparing DNA methylation patterns of the female and male X chromosomes, we observed a clear and significant global reduction (hypomethylation) of DNA methylation across the entire X chromosome in females. Our data suggests that the female X hypomethylation does not directly contribute to the gene silencing of the inactivated X chromosome nor does it significantly drive sex-specific gene expression of tree shrews. However, we identified a putative regulatory region in the 5' end of the X inactive specific transcript (Xist) gene, a key gene for XCI, whose pattern of differential DNA methylation strongly relate to its differential expression between male and female tree shrews. We show that differential methylation of this region is conserved across different species. Moreover, we provide evidence suggesting that the observed difference between human and tree shrew X-linked promoter methylation is associated with the difference in genomic CpG contents. Our study offers novel information on genomic DNA methylation of tree shrews, as well as insights into the evolution of X chromosome regulation in mammals.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Following uptake, Sec released from SELENOP undergoes metabolisation via selenocysteine lyase (SCLY), producing selenide, a substrate used by selenophosphate synthetase 2 (SEPHS2), which provides the essential selenium donor - selenophosphate - for the biosynthesis of the selenocysteine tRNA. Here, we report the discovery of an alternative pathway mediating Sec metabolisation that is independent of SCLY and mediated by peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6). Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PRDX6 can readily react with selenide and interact with SEPHS2, potentially acting as a selenium delivery system. Moreover, we demonstrate the presence and functional significance of this alternative route in cancer cells where we reveal a notable association between elevated expression of PRDX6 with a highly aggressive neuroblastoma subtype. Altogether, our study sheds light on a previously unrecognized aspect of Sec metabolism and its implications in ferroptosis, offering new avenues for therapeutic exploitation.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Many Gram-negative bacteria that encode PQQ-dependent enzymes do not possess the biosynthetic machinery for its production and instead obtain it from the environment. To achieve this the bacterium Escherichia coli uses the TonB-dependent transporter PqqU as a high-affinity PQQ importer, allowing it to use PQQ at an external concentration as low as 1 nM. Here, we show that PqqU achieves this by binding PQQ with a very high affinity. Using cryo-electron microscopy we determine the structure of the PqqU-PQQ complex at a resolution of 1.99 angstrom, revealing that the extracellular loops of PqqU undergo significant conformational changes upon PQQ binding, which captures the cofactor in an internal cavity. This cavity likely facilitates an airlock-style gating mechanism that prevents non-specific import through PqqU. Using structural modelling we show that the change in PqqU structure upon PQQ binding precludes the binding of bacteriophage, which targets it as a cell surface receptor. Guided by the PqqU-PQQ complex structure we use phenotypic analysis to identify the amino acids essential for PQQ import and leverage this information to map the presence of PqqU across Gram-negative bacteria. This reveals that PqqU is encoded by Gram-negative bacteria from at least 22 phyla from diverse habitats, including those found in aquatic, soil, host-associated, and extreme environments. This indicates that PQQ is a ubiquitous nutrient in many environments, and an important cofactor for bacteria that adopt diverse lifestyles and metabolic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

SummaryAmong 47561 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine was 23% effective against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1717970906899

Computational denoising methods can bypass imaging constraints and improve signal-to-noise ratio in images. However, current state of the art methods are commonly trained in a supervised manner, requiring paired noisy and clean images, limiting their application across diverse datasets. An alternative class of denoising models can be trained in a self-supervised manner, assuming independent noise across samples but are unable to generalize from available unpaired clean images. A method that can be trained without paired data and can use information from available unpaired high-quality images would address both weaknesses. Here, we present Baikal, a first attempt to formulate such a framework using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for fluorescence microscopy images. We first train a DDPM backbone in an unconditional manner to learn generative priors over complex morphologies in microscopy images. We then apply various conditioning strategies to sample from the trained model and propose an optimal strategy to denoise the desired image. Extensive quantitative comparisons demonstrate better performance of Baikal over state of the art self-supervised methods across multiple datasets. We highlight the advantage of generative priors learnt by DDPMs in denoising complex Flywing morphologies where other methods fail. Overall, our DDPM based denoising framework presents a new class of denoising methods for fluorescence microscopy datasets that achieve high performance without collection of paired high-quality images.

However, natural populations frequently violate this assumption, which may potentially confound genome-wide association studies, selection scans, and demographic inference. Within several recently admixed human populations, empirical genetic studies have reported a correlation in global ancestry proportion between spouses, referred to as ancestry-assortative mating. Here, we use forward genomic simulations to link correlations in ancestry between mates to the underlying mechanistic mate-choice process. We consider the impacts of two types of mate-choice model, using either ancestry-based preferences or social groups as the basis for mate pairing. We find that multiple mate-choice models can produce the same correlations in ancestry proportion between spouses; however, we also highlight alternative analytic approaches and circumstances in which these models may be distinguished. With this work, we seek to highlight potential pitfalls when interpreting correlations in empirical data as evidence for a particular model of human mating practices, as well as to offer suggestions toward development of new best practices for analysis of human ancestry-assortative mating.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Here, we report a BRCA2 splice acceptor variant, c.517-2A>G, found in breast and ovarian cancer families from Shetland. We investigated the frequency and origin of this variant in a population-based research cohort of people of Shetland ancestry, VIKING I. The variant segregates with female breast and ovarian cancer in diagnosed cases and is classified as pathogenic. Exome sequence data from 2,108 participants with three or more Shetlandic grandparents in VIKING I was used to estimate the population prevalence of c.517-2A>G in Shetlanders. Nine VIKING I research volunteers carry this variant, on a shared haplotype (carrier frequency 0.4%). This frequency is [~]130-fold higher than in UK Biobank, where the small group of carriers has a different haplotype. Records of birth, marriage and death indicate genealogical linkage of VIKING I carriers to a founder from the Isle of Whalsay, Shetland, similar to our observations for the BRCA1 founder variant from Westray, Orkney. In total, 93.5% of pathogenic BRCA variant carriers in Northern Isles exomes are accounted for by these two drifted variants.

Here, we used a seasonally resolved, deep short- and long-read metagenomic approach to examine distinctive genomic features of microbiomes recovered from sediment, the overlaying water column, and particle-attached bacteria and archaea in the North Sea. We recovered 115 benthic metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that belonged to Woeseiales, Rhizobiales, Planctomycetia, Gemmatimonadota, and Desulfobacterota species.

We build on previous research characterizing changes in physiology and morphology to explore behavioral variation across the invasive range of coqui in Hawaii. We hypothesized that behavioral traits contributing to invasion expansion would be reflected in behavioral differences at the invasive center versus invasive edge. To investigate whether differences in the field represent local adaptation or behavioral plasticity, we additionally evaluated behavior following acclimation to a shared laboratory environment. While we identified only subtle behavioral variation among populations in the field, we found that individuals from all populations became less bold, active, and exploratory in the laboratory, converging on a similar behavioral phenotype.

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1.

Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1717970906899

To better describe its ontogeny and fill in this gap, we tested the Bouba-Kiki effect in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). Being a precocial species, chicks can be tested on the very early days of life, allowing for a virtually total control of their experience before test. Three-day-old chicks (n=42) first learned to circumnavigate a panel to obtain a food reward. Then, they were presented with two identical panels, one depicting a spiky shape, and one depicting a round shape, while hearing either the sound  Bouba or  Kiki. We recorded which panel chicks chose with either sound, in a total of 24 trials. Chicks preferred the panel with the spiky shape when hearing the  Kiki sound, and that with the round shape when hearing the  Bouba sound. Results from naive baby chicks hint at a predisposed mechanism for matching the two dimensions of shape and sound that may be widespread across species.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded. We report the value of wastewater sequencing to track avian influenza.","NA","medrxiv",1717970906899

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Here, we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), a genome editing system that combines the programmability and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 with the RNA-mediated gene insertion capabilities of the human LINE1 (L1) element. CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1717970906899

Recently, H5 viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b have caused large outbreaks in avian and multiple non-human mammalian species1,2. Previous studies have identified molecular phenotypes of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein that contribute to pandemic potential in humans, including cell entry, receptor preference, HA stability, and reduced neutralization by polyclonal sera3-6. However, prior experimental work has only measured how these phenotypes are affected by a handful of the >10,000 different possible amino-acid mutations to HA. Here we use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning7 to measure how all mutations to a 2.3.4.4b H5 HA affect each phenotype. We identify mutations that allow HA to better bind 2-6-linked sialic acids, and show that some viruses already carry mutations that stabilize HA. We also measure how all HA mutations affect neutralization by sera from mice and ferrets vaccinated against or infected with 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses. These antigenic maps enable rapid assessment of when new viral strains have acquired mutations that may create mismatches with candidate vaccine strains. Overall, the systematic nature of deep mutational scanning combined with the safety of pseudoviruses enables comprehensive measurements of the phenotypic effects of mutations that can inform real-time interpretation of viral variation observed during surveillance of H5 influenza.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1717970906899
